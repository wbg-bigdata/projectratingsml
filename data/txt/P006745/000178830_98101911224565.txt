COLOMBIA
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
THE RURAL SECTOR AND PROJECT AREAS
A. The Rural Sector
1.        The agricultural sector accounts for 37% of employment, 27% of
GDP and 59% of the value of all exports. The rural population, defined as
the people living outside centers with more than 2,500 inhabitants, is about
9 million, or 37% of the population of Colombia, which, in 1976, totalled
about 24.5 million. The growth of agricultural output was on average 4.6%
per annum from 1971 to 1975. Colombia is self-sufficient for most of its
food requirements, but continues to require imports of wheat, cocoa, oilseeds,
pulses, corn and barley.
2.        The wide range of climatic conditions and the various forms of
land tenure in Colombia have led to the development of several distinct types
of farming. Cattle ranching predominates in the lowlands along the Caribbean
coast, the lower part of the inter-Andean valleys and, increasingly, in the
Orinoco and Amazon river basins to the East. Fairly intensive, modernized
farms of medium and large size predominate in the upper reaches of the inter-
Andean valleys. On the steep slopes rising from these main valleys, small and
medium-sized farms produce a diversity of crop and livestock, but, with few
exceptions, coffee is of overwhelming importance, and it has provided the
resources which have financed the considerable development of the social ser-
vices and infrastructure in this zone. Above the coffee zone, conditions are
less favorable and these areas have not shared in the generally impressive
development of the agricultural sector.
3.        The unevenness in the distribution of land is an important character-
istic of the rural sector. However, aggregated national statistics do not take
into account differential land productivity; for example, they do not dis-
tinguish between the economic value of extensive ranch land and intensive coffee
land. In 1973, farmers with less than 20 ha (small farms) accounted for 83%
of the number but only 13% of the area of farmland, while farms of over 50 ha
(large farms) occupied 80% of the area, but represented only 8% of the number
of farm units. Half the rural income is retained by 10% of the rural popula-
tion, of which in 1975 63% had annual incomes below the relative poverty
income level, as defined by the Bank (US$148 per capita in 1975).
4.        Some 47% of the children of school age in rural areas do not attend
school. Schools exist throughout most inhabited parts of the country but
there are serious deficiencies in the number and training of teachers, the
number of classrooms and their equipment. Adult literacy is about 65% in
rural areas since there have been some fairly successful out-of-school
literacy programs.

5.        Health services in rural areas are generally very poor and in
towns the local hospitals are often poorly equipped and not fully utilized.
Health statistics are particularly deficient; however, it is clear that in
rural areas infant mortality is generally higher than the urban rate of
9.4 per thousand live births. Water-borne infections lead to a high propor-
tion of illness and death in rural areas.
6.        The country is fairly well served with main roads between Depart-
ment (Provincial) capitals, but only 60% of the rural communities are linked
by all-weather roads. About 35% of the rural population is linked to public
electricity systems. About 4 million of the rural population live in hamlets
or villages of between 50 and 2,500 inhabitants; of this group, 42% is linked
to a potable water supply and 10% to a sewerage system.
7.        Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria) is the
principal agricultural credit bank in Colombia and would have responsibility
for administration of the project. It was initiated in 1931 as a part of a
state-owned bank. In 1971, it was transformed into a mixed enterprise although
the Government still retains 89% shareholding. Caja Agraria has had consider-
able experience with lending to small-scale farmers and has participated
successfully in two previous projects partially financed by the Bank. It has
25 regional and 805 branch offices, many of which also have outlets for seeds,
fertilizers, and other farm requirements. Sales of farm inputs by Caja Agraria
currently account for about half of all national sales of these products.
At the end of 1974, loans to small-scale farmers accounted for about 60% of
its loan portfolio or the equivalent of US$318 million.
B.   The Project Areas
8.        The Bank project would cover three out of five geographic areas
which have been identified for the initial phase of a national rural develop-
ment program (Map IBRD 12202). The Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have already approved
loans to assist in the financing of the program in Areas 4 and 5, respectively.
9.        The project areas (Areas 1, 2 and 3) include districts in which
there is a high proportion of small-scale (under 20 ha) farmers and poverty.
In the areas selected, the current level of farm productivity is low, but
there are good potentialities for major increases using existing technology
which is being adapted to local conditions by the Colombian Agricultural
Institute (ICA) and incorporating improved varieties developed in collabora-
tion with the International Center of Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). In none of
the Bank project areas is the redistribution of land a prerequisite for project
execution (see para 10), although it would be necessary in time to attempt to
achieve a more equitable distribution.
o0.       All three project areas are located in the Andean highlands.  Area I
covers part of the Departments of Narino and Cauca adjoining the frontier with

Ecuador; Area 2 includes much of the Department of Cundinamarca and a small
part of Tolima in the center of the country close to Bogota; and Area 3 is
part of the Department of Antioquia, ncrth and east of Medellin.   In 1973,
the total population of these three areas was 2.6 million, of whom 1.8
million (69%) lived in rural areas on 204,000 farms covering 2.3 million ha
of agricultural land. The project would be focused on the requirements of
farmers with less than 20 ha, who number some 175,000 -- 86% of the total
number -- and occupy 0.7 million ha of agricultural land -- 31% of all agri-
cultural land. These farmers produce primarily cereals, pulses, potatoes and
other starch crops and also maintain small numbers of livestock of various
species. The target population would include about 1.1 million on farms
and also poor, landless residents, giving a total of some 1.5 million persons
with an average annual per capita income equivalent to about US$100.
11.       A large number of official agencies is active in the rural areas.
Generally, they are technically competent and well staffed. Nevertheless,
the development of the rural areas of greatest poverty has been very slow.
Contributory factors have been the attention previously devoted to assisting
medium- and large-scale farmers, or producers of export crops; the strong
vertical structure of each official entity with little authority delegated
to the regions; budgetary uncertainties; and a lack of coordination between
entities and between the national and local government authorities. In
the past there has been little attempt by official agencies to discover the
priorities perceived by the local communities, who therefore have not become
involved in the process of development. However, there has been a growing
official awareness of the needs of the poor in rural areas and a realization
that their conditions of life could be improved.
12.       In the project area, the average adult literacy rate is quite high
(76%), although only 40% of children aged 7 to 14 years attend school. The
number of schools in relation to the population is close to the national
average of 7:10,000 population. The education standards are generally low
and this contributes to the continuing migration to the towns of people ill
prepared for urban life, and also holds back development in the rural areas.
13.       The project areas lack an effective health service and there is
widespread occurrence of avoidable or readily controllable diseases associated
with impure water and unhygienic conditions. As the areas are generally at
high altitudes, tropical diseases are not important. 35% of the rural com-
munities are inaccessible by road and 57% of the rural population living in
groups of 50 to 2,500 persons has no piped water and 78% has no sewerage
system.
14.       Agencies of Caja Agraria are located throughout the project area
and agricultural supplies are generally available at the market towns. At
present, the majority of small farmers dispose of their produce through
intermediary traders who also provide extra-bank credit. There is wide-
spread interest among farmers in obtaining more direct outlets to the final
consumers but considerable skepticism concerning the formation of cooperative
societies because of generally unsuccessful past experience.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
A.  Project Concept
15.       The objective of the project would be to raise living standards in
selected rural areas by increasing the productivity, output and incomes of
farm families and by improving social services and facilities available to
rural communities. Through the project, it would be intended to reduce
disparities between rural and urban amenities while facilitating the transi-
tion of some of the rural population to industrial and commercial activities.
This would require not only raising formal educational standards of the rural
population but also increasing its familiarity with marketing, credit, techni-
cal and management skills which are required both for more intensive farm
management and to obtain regular urban employment, above the level of un-
skilled labor. The main emphasis of the project would be on providing super-
vised credit to promote farm investments and thereby to raise farm production.
Rural roads would be provided to areas with the highest agricultural potential
while investments in education, health, water and electricity would be designed
to spread these services more uniformly, while giving priority to communities
showing greatest interest in farm development.
16.       The project would be a component of the Integrated Rural Development
Program (IRDP), which forms part of the National Food and Nutrition Plan. The
IRDP would assist families with less than 20 ha to increase their farm produc-
tivity by providing supervised credit for development, operational expenses
and the improvement of marketing. With few exceptions, this category is com-
posed of families among the poorest 50% of the population. Priority would be
given to increasing the production of crop and livestock products of high
nutritive value and to promoting better family health, nutrition and living
conditions.
17.       The other part of the National Food and Nutrition Plan would be the
Nutrition Program for which Bank financing is being considered. This would
consist of the provision of subsidized food of high nutritive value to pregnant
and lactating women, and children under five years, and supporting investments
in food processing and quality control, health and water supply services and
education in nutrition. The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project could
contribute to financing the production and processing of the foods of high
nutritive value required for the Nutrition Program.
Detailed Features
a.   Supervised Credit
18.       Over a period of five years Caja Agraria would provide sub-loans to
some 40,000 borrowers -- 23% of the target group -- on the basis of integrated
farm plans incorporating crops (other than coffee), livestock, minor farm
structures and tree planting; from the third year of participation in the
project, credit would also be made available to farmers for minor home improve-
ments related to hygiene. Caja Agraria would also provide incremental working



v 
capital and medium- and long-term sub-loans to associations of producers for
marketing. Sub-loans would be financed through a credit fund to be estab-
lished within Caja Agraria. In total, over the whole of the project period,
Caja Agraria would be required to provide the equivalent of US$23 million from
its own funds for eligible sub-projects (Section 2.11 of draft Project Agree-
ment). Because of its central role in the project, it would be important that
the financial stability of Caja Agraria be assured. With this in mind, the
Government has added $36 million to the resources of Caja Agraria during 1976
and has relieved the institution of all debt servicing responsibility for the
whole IRDP (equivalent to a capital contribution of approximately $70 million
over five years). In addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that
Caja Agraria would maintain at all times a liquidity ratio equal to or greater
than unity (Section 4.03 draft Project Agreement).
b.   Production Support
19.       The project would finance part of the cost of a Program Management
Unit in the National Department of Planning (DNP) and an administration unit
in Caja Agraria and new facilities and increased service capabilities for the
following entities:
(a)  Instituto Colombiano                 (crop and livestock adaptation
Agropecuario:  ICA              - (and demonstration; preparation
(and supervision of farm plans
(b)  Instituto de los Recursos            (tree nurseries; advice on tree
Naturales Renovables y             (planting and soil conservation
del Medio Ambiente:  INDERENA - (and minor soil conservation
(works, including protection of
(water sources
(c)  Central de Cooperativas de la   - (Market Intelligence Unit;
Reforma Agraria Ltda.:  CECORA  (marketing advisory service
(d)  Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje: (staff training; publicity for
SENA                            - (the project; training farmers
(and staff of marketing groups
c.   Social Services
20.       The project would promote more effective use of existing rural
primary school facilities by providing classroom furniture -- 2,300 sets --
and 3,800 kits consisting of teaching aids and manuals. This component
would be the responsibility of the Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones
Escolares -- ICCE.
21.       Rural Health Service teams would be formed over five years to pro-
vide about 80% coverage of the rural population in the project areas. This
would require the construction and equipping of 75 new health posts and im-
provements to 26 existing facilities, 8 health centers and 17 local hospitals.
Health staff would be trained and provided with medical aid kits and nutrition
education kits. The construction of latrines in public places would also be



- vi -
financed under this component of the project, which would be executed by
Ministerio de Salud Publica (Minsalud).
22.       The Instituto Nacional de Salud (INAS) would supervise the construc-
tion, expansion or improvement and operation of 248 new piped water systems
with individual house connections; 36 existing schemes would be extended and
five old schemes provided with chlorination facilities. A total of 147,000
people would benefit from these works.
d.   Infrastructure
23.       The Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (Caminales) would supervise
the construction of 313 km of new rural roads and the improvement of 647 km
of existing rural roads throughout the project areas.
24.       In Area 1, the Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica (ICEL)
would supervise 22 sub-projects to provide electric power to 14,335 families --
about 90,000 persons. No further electrification under the project is planned
for Areas 2 and 3 since service levels there are already well above the
national average for rural areas.
B.   Project Costs and Financial Arrangements
Project Costs and Financing
25.       Total project costs for a five-year period of investment are esti-
mated to be US$131 million, including incremental seasonal credit and incre-
mental working capital for produce marketing. It is estimated that the
foreign exchange cost would be US$27.6 million, or 21% of the total.
26.       A Bank loan of US$52 million is proposed to finance all foreign
exchange costs and US$24.4 million of the local costs, and thus cover 40% of
the total cost of the project. Project beneficiaries would be required to
contribute US$11 million (19%) of farm and marketing development cost and
US$2.1 million (4%) of the cost of other project components, while the re-
maining project cost of US$65.9 million (50%) would be shared by SENA --
US$3.1 million (2%), Caja Agraria -- US$23 million (18%) and the Government --
US$39.8 million (30%). Further details are given in the table on the follow-
ing page.
27.       Local currency financing is recommended because of the importance
the project would have within the overall Government attempt to promote the
economic development of the poorest of the rural population within the project
areas and because of the relatively low foreign exchange content which is
characteristic of rural development projects. The cost sharing proportion
which is proposed is necessary to give the Bank a meaningful role in the
project.
28.       Of the total Bank loan of US$52 million, US$26.8 million (52%) would
be used to assist in financing sub-loans to farmers and marketing groups,

through a fund to be established in Caja Agraria. The relending interest rate,
terms and grace periods are summarized in Annex III. 1/ To ensure that relend-
ing rates reflect current economic conditions, the Bank obtained assurances at
negotiation that it would annually review with the Government and Caja Agraria
the terms and conditions of subloans to be made under the project. (Section
3.07 of Loan Agreement and Schedule 1 to the Project Agreement).
Procurement
29.       International competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Guidelines
on Procurement, would be required for orders of an estimated value of more than
US$100,000 for the purchase of vehicles, water pumps and piping. Caja Agraria
would consolidate the requirements of the participating entities and issue the
calls for tenders. Domestic manufacturers would be granted a preferential
margin in bid evaluation equal to the prevailing tariff, or 15% of the c.i.f.
cost of imports, whichever is the lower. All other purchases of goods and
services would be made in accordance with local competitive procedures accept-
able to the Bank, with the exception of individual purchases by farmers where
competitive bidding would be impractical. Procurement in such cases would be
through regular commercial channels. See Annex III. 2/
Disbursement
30.       The loan would be disbursed over a period of six years.  See the
table on the preceding page. Disbursement would be made according to the
following percentages of expenditures certified by Caja Agraria:
(a)  Sub-loans for farm marketing                  49% of amount disbursed
operations and development
(b)  Vehicles and medical equipment                100% of foreign expenditures
or 40% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods
(c)  Cables and electrical equipment;              100% of foreign expenditures
water pipes and pumps                         or 80% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods
(d)  All other expenditures by Caja                36%
Agraria and project entities
Retroactive financing not exceeding US$500,000 is proposed for expenditures
incurred from July 1, 1976 for initial staff training and orientation for
project work, to initiate farming adaptation and demonstration units, the
Natural Resources Advisory Service, the Marketing Advisory Service and
engineering studies.

C. Market and Production Aspects
31.       The incremental farm production which may be generated through the
implementation of the proposed project would be locally significant and could
make a small but useful contribution to the national food requirements by 1985.
It is projected that by then the incremental production from farms receiving
sub-loans under the project could amount to the following proportions of
the national demand: cereals and other starch crops, 5%; non-centrifuged
sugar, 4%; pulses, 6%; vegetables, 1%; and meat and milk, 2%.
32.       The project would set out to blend improved methods into existing
farming systems and practices. The farmers in the project areas are already
well established and the existing management systems have been evolved over
many centuries in the light of experience and in order to minimize risks to
the farmers. More intensive farming practices could increase the economic
risks to producers; the project would seek to reduce this problem through
placing great emphasis on improving marketing channels organized by associa-
tions of producers, which may take various forms including cooperative
societies.
D.   Implementation
33.       The overall policy for the National Integrated Rural Development
Program is determined and supervised by the National Council for Economic and
Social Policy (CONPES), a ministerial level body chaired by the President of
the Republic.
34.       Management and coordination would be carried out by a Program Manage-
ment Unit, headed by a Director General in the National Department of Planning
(DNP) responsible for the whole Integrated Rural Development Program, of
which the proposed Bank project would form about 45%. The administration of
the program would be carried out by the Department of Rural Development of
Caja Agraria.
35.       Caja Agraria would enter into subsidiary project agreements with
each entity responsible for implementing a component of the project. These
agreements would define the responsibilities of the respective executing
agencies to execute their components of the project and would recognize the
responsiblity of Caja Agraria to monitor the physical and financial progress
of each component and report to DNP (Section 2.02 of draft Project Agreement).
Caja Agraria would also consolidate the issuing and awarding of international
tenders required for the project and transmit reimbursement applications from
the participating entities through the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
to the Bank, which would disburse to the account of the Ministry in the Bank
of the Republic.
36.       A permanent Evaluation Group for the whole Integrated Rural Develop-
ment Progam would be formed in DNP but would be financed outside the project
(Section 3.03(a), of draft Loan Agreement).



x
37.       There would be four levels of committees of participating entities
for the project: community, municipal, departmental and national. The target
population would be included in the community and municipal committees and
would constitute 50% of the membership and provide the chairman for both
committees.
E.   Financial Analysis
38.       The financial rates of return of representative farms range between
33% and 91% and income levels would be substantially improved by the project.
However, at full development it is projected that for about half of the
representative farms, incomes would still be below the poverty level in
Colombia (US$148 per capita, 1975). This assessment indicates the continuing
need for the promotion of employment opportunities in rural areas. The
Small-Scale Industry Project (Loan No. 1070-CO) and the proposed Second
Agricultural Credit Project were appraised with this problem in mind and they
are expected to assist in the creation of employment opportunities in the
project area.
39.       Beneficiaries' contribution to total project costs would amount to
10% of total costs. Seasonal credit for farm operations would require a
contribution of 5% from the sub-borrower in the first year, increasing to 15%
for the fourth year. Farm investment and market operations and development
would require at least 15% contribution by beneficiaries. Communities are
required to contribute 15% of the cost of potable water sub-projects and 10%
of total investment costs for rural health posts and centers and electrifi-
cation subprojects. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that tariffs for electricity and potable water supplied under the
project would be maintained at levels sufficient to recover operating and
maintenance costs, including depreciation. (Section 4.03 of draft Loan
Agreement).
40.       Through the implementation of the proposed project, the Government
would be committed annually to finance additional current costs, rising to
US$10 million by year 5. About US$8 million per year would continue to be
necessary after the end of the five-year investment period proposed for the
project. The largest individual cost would be for the operation and mainte-
nance of the health services to be established within the project areas. In
addition, the Government would bear the entire responsibility for servicing
the proposed-Bank loan.
F.   Economic Analysis
41.       At full development (Year 5), 23% of the small farmers in project
areas are expected to have become incorporated into the supervised credit
component of the project. At this stage it is anticipated that the incre-
mental value (using 1975 international prices) of crops would be US$22.6



- xi -
million and that of livestock, US$12.3 million. Increased production of
various kinds of meat and non-centrifuged sugar should release additional
amounts of beef and sugar for export and help the agricultural sector to
continue to play a significant role in the growth of Colombia's foreign
trade. At the same time, increased production of wheat and pulses would
save foreign exchange by reducing the amount imported. The net annual
foreign exchange savings of the project at full development would be US$15.4
million. The other commodities produced by the project are for domestic
consumption only and would assist in meeting the increased demand resulting
from higher per capita incomes and would contribute to improved nutritional
standards.
42.       The number of people benefitting directly and indirectly from the
project would amount to approximately 1.5 million. Many of these would, for
the first time, have access to advisory services, credit facilities, markets,
training and education opportunities, health care and water and electricity
delivery systems.
43.       Given the emphasis of the project on providing credit and other
services to farmers with less than 20 ha of land, it is anticipated that the
project would improve the living standards of the rural poor and improve
income distribution in the project areas. It is projected that at full
development, 32% of the additional income generated under the project would
accrue to families currently receiving annual incomes of less than the
equivalent of US$29 per capita and 74% would be received by families now
earning annually less than the equivalent of US$98 per capita.
44.       The project's contribution to employment would stem mainly from
the regular work generated at the farm level at full development and also
from the opportunities generated during the investment period. At the farm
level, the project would require, annually, an additional 1.3 million man-
days of labor at full development, equivalent to 6,500 full-time jobs. Some
0.25 million man-days, or 20% of this labor, would be provided by members of
farm families while the rest would be provided by hired labor. In addition,
0.68 million man-days (3,400 full-time jobs) would be generated by the other
components of the project during the investment period.
45.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 22% for the productive
components of the project (credit, technical assistance, rural road develop-
ment and the project management unit), which account for 82% of total project
costs.
46.       The remaining components of the project -- education, health,
potable water and electrification, which together account for 18% of total
project costs -- were excluded from the economic analysis as no meaningful
rate of return could be estimated. These components, though not contributing
directly to the productive goals of the project, will help improve the living
conditions of the low income stratum rural population. The project's activi-
ties in these fields are designed to bring the level of these services in the
rural areas closer to that prevailing in urban communities.

G. Conclusions, Loan Conditions and Recommendation
Conclusions
47.       The proposed project presents a coherent attack on the problem of
rural poverty and deprivation in Colombia. The main emphasis would be on
raising the level of farm productivity by combining the efforts of Government
entities to this end, while providing adequate funds for credit. Most of the
components of the project would intensify ongoing activities in a coordinated
manner, but the natural resources and health service components would consti-
tute innovative approaches in these fields. The project would provide experi-
ence in concerted rural development activities within fairly limited but
representative areas, which would be suitable for more widespread application.
48.       The functioning of the market system and fluctuations in prices for
farm products present the greatest uncertainties facing the project. The
extent to which members of the target population will take part in the project
will be strongly influenced by their assessment of the potential benefits and
apparent risks of participation. These risks have been recognized during the
preparation of the project, which consequently includes special emphasis on
improving the competitive position of the target population. The market
advisory service and market intelligence service would be particularly impor-
tant since it is the Government's policy to limit its direct intervention in
marketing and to encourage the interaction of demand and supply to determine
prices. Finally, coordination and collaboration between executing agencies is
expected to develop during the course of the project. To the extent that such
integration among agencies fails to occur, project effectiveness would be dimi-
nished, although the individual components of the project would still be of
value to the communities.
Loan Conditions
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Caja Agraria,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex
IV. 1/ Special conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a) the subsidiary agreements between the Government and Caja Agraria,
and Caja Agraria and ICA, INDERENA, CECORA and SENA, have been
duly executed (Section 6.01(b) and (c) of the draft Loan Agree-
ment); and
(b) a Program Evaluation Group has been formed. (Section 6.01(d) of
the draft Loan Agreement).

51.       In addition, a condition for disbursement for each loan category
separately would be that the relevant subsidiary agreement between Caja
Agraria and the participating entity (other than ICA, INDERENA, CECORA, and
SENA) has been duly executed (paragraph 3 (b) of Schedule 1 to the draft Loan
Agreement).
52.       The proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank.
Recommendation
53.       With the assurances obtained at negotiations the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for a loan to the Republic of Colombia for
the equivalent of US$52 million to assist the financing of an integrated rural
development project. The loan would have a term of 17 years including a grace
period of 3-1/2 years, with interest at 8.7% per annum.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE RURAL SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01      Out of a total estimated population of about 24.5 million in 1976,
nearly nine million, or 37%, live in rural areas, 1/ with some 85% of the
rural families exclusively involved in farming. Rural population has been
increasing only 0.5% per year between 1964 and 1973, compared with a 2.8%
rate of growth for total population and 4.7% for urban areas. Table 1.1 pro-
vides socio-economic indicators. The agricultural sector supports 37% of a
total labor force of about seven million and, in 1975, contributed 27% of
GDP and 59% of the value of all exports of goods and services. Except for
wheat, cocoa, oilseeds, pulses and barley, Colombia is self-sufficient in food.
In 1975, despite considerable Government efforts at diversification, coffee,
grown in the Andes by small and medium farmers, still accounted for 62% of
earnings from agricultural exports and 44% of the total merchandise export
value. Other main export crops are sugar, cotton, rice and bananas.
1.02      From 1971 to 1975, agricultural output grew on average at 4.6% per
annum in real terms. However, this good overall performance conceals impor-
tant differences as most of the rural population live in conditions of poverty,
where unemployment and under-employment are serious problems. The main
reasons for this situation are:
(a)  poor distribution of land, associated with a high concentration
of small farmers on the poorer and increasingly degraded soils
of the Andean mountains;
(b)  the lack of coordinated production support services (research,
extension, credit and marketing) adapted to their production
systems and socio-economic conditions; and
(c)  inadequate physical infrastructure (roads and electricity) and
social services (education and health).
B. The Rural Structure
Land Tenure and Type of Farming
1.03      An exceptional regional diversity in altitudes (from sea level to
5,800 m), soils and climates (from tropical to alpine) enables Colombia to
1/   Rural population is defined as the people living outside centers with
more than 2,500 inhabitants.



produce a wide range of agricultural commodities. Out of a total area of
114 million ha, the agricultural census of 1970/71 showed that only 31 million
ha were occupied by the existing 1.2 million farm units--7.7 million ha were
cropped (2.1 million ha in seasonal crops, 2.3 million ha in permanent crops
and 3.3 million ha in fallow); 17.5 million ha were in pastures; and 5.9
million ha were unused.
1.04      There are six main types of farming in Colombia:
(a)- large-scale extensive ranching on the lowlands of the Caribbean
and Andean valleys; 80% of the 22.5 million head of cattle
in 1974 were found in those regions;
(b) medium- and large-scale mechanized farming in the inter-Andean
valleys, which has been expanding steadily and which mainly
produces cotton, soybeans, oil palm and sugarcane;
(c) small- and medium-scale farming at intermediate altitudes in
the highlands, with coffee as the main cash crop;
(d) organized resettlements of small farmers on land acquired and
reclaimed by the Government, mainly in the Caribbean lowlands,
but also in the Amazon basin;
(e) spontaneous colonization of up to 1 million ha a year of tropical
rainforest or in the Eastern Plains; and
(f) high-altitude, small-scale farming (less than 20 ha) in the Andean
highlands. In these densely populated areas, the average farm size
is 4 ha. These farms are often on poor soil and steep slopes
and produce mostly for family subsistence, although surpluses are
marketed. Production diversification is a hedge against risk, and
farming system characteristics are essentially low input, low risk
and low output. Overgrazing and cropping steep slopes without soil
conservation practices have resulted in substantial erosion.
Insufficient technical assistance and lack of access to institu-
tional credit and to markets are among the major obstacles to
improvement. These farmers constitute the target group of this
project.
Land Distribution and Income Structure
1.05      The 1970/71 agricultural census showed that the largest 8% of farms
(50 ha and above) accounted for 80% of the total farmland, while 60% of the
number of farms occupied only 4% of all farmland in small holdings with less
than 5 ha, of which 270,000 units had less than 1 ha. Some 83% of all farmers
had less than 20 ha and operated only 13% of the farmland. In addition, 200,000
rural families dependent on agriculture were landless. The distribution of
rural income is consequently very skewed, with half going to 10% of the rural



- 3 -
population. In 1975, 63% had incomes below the relative poverty income level
as defined by the Bank (US$148 per capita for 1975), including almost all
farmers who held less than 20 ha. Rural unemployment and underemployment are
estimated at an average of 20% of total available labor. The labor force is
decreasing in the highlands due to a significant migration to cities.
1.06      Since 1961, the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) has
been involved in programs of distribution of public land (4.1 million ha up
to the end of 1974) and redistribution of unused private land (0.4 million
ha) associated, to varying degrees, with investments in land reclamation and
infrastructure and the provision of supervised credit and technical assistance.
However, most of the land distributed so far has been assigned to families
already occupying the land. INCORA's land titling activities are limited
mostly to distributing to small-scale farmers titles on public land in
colonization areas.
C. Production and Support Services
Research and Technical Assistance
1.07      The main institutions responsible for research and technical assis-
tance are the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) and the National Insti-
tute for Natural Renewable Resources and the Environment (INDERENA). Other
institutions involved in technical assistance or farmers' training are INCORA,
the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (FEDECAFE), the National
Apprenticeship Service (SENA) and the Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture.
This multiplicity of entities involved in extension work and, hitherto, the
lack of coordination among them, has seriously limited their efficiency.
1.08      ICA operates 12 experimental stations, five research centers and
24 diagnostic centers throughout the country. Its research efforts at first
were not geared to small farmers' production systems and financial capabilities
and, consequently, its extension services benefitted mainly large-scale
farmers. Since 1971, however, this has changed and there has been a gradual
reorientation toward the small farm sector. By 1975, ICA's Rural Development
Division with 900 staff was providing technical assistance to about 50,000
small farm families in 21 rural development projects throughout the country.
The Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria) provides the
necessary credit for production and harvesting costs and farm development.
Although these efforts constitute a substantial improvement over past perfor-
mance, the projects suffer from ICA's failure to coordinate its activities
with those of other agencies operating in the same areas, the absence of a
well-defined development program, and the problems associated with adapting
technological recommendations to the small farmers' production system. A
newly created support group within ICA is in charge of finding a way to handle
the technology transfer.



-4-
1.09      INDERENA is in charge of research and technical assistance for
forestry, fisheries and soil erosion control. Created in 1968, its achieve-
ments in research are still limited, although it is currently involved in
many studies and research programs, often with external financial assistance.
Technical assistance in soil erosion control is successfully practiced in 12
special conservation districts, but assistance in tree planting is extended
only to Caja Agraria's borrowers (22,000 ha in 12 years), very few of whom
are small farmers. The shortage of resources and, until recently, restricted
government backing, and the lack of coordination with ICA, have prevented
INDERENA from providing an adequate advisory service for small farmers.
1.10      SENA is a semi-official institution which is quite efficiently
organizing informal training programs for the rural population in basic
literacy and arithmetic as well as in simple agricultural practices. It
operates through 25 permanent centers and through the Rural Popular Vocational
training component of its Mobile Rural Program for which there is now a great
demand. The total number of trainees since the inception of the program
(1967) to the end of 1974 was about 140,000.
1.11      INCORA has 20 projects of a supervised credit program in land reform
areas. In 1975, this program reached 47,380 individual small farm families,
and a further 13,008 were organized in 1,177 group farms. Technical assis-
tance is provided by INCORA's own staff.
1.12      FEDECAFE is a producers' association with semi-official status which
has for many years reinvested tax revenue from coffee exports in the develop-
ment of rural infrastructure in coffee growing areas. It also provides
technical assistance to some 40 multi-purpose cooperatives and finances farm
diversification activities.
1.13      Departmental Secretariats of Agriculture are directly responsible
to the Governors of the Departments. They provide technical assistance to
farmers with less than 10 ha or those producing no more than 100 liters of
milk per day. Their efficiency often is limited by the rapid rate of staff
turn-over, and changes in political direction.
Credit
1.14      At the beginning of 1975, the agricultural credit portfolio amounted
to Col$ 15 billion, about 25% of the total outstanding institutional credit
portfolio. It was shared by Caja Agraria, an official institution (40%), com-
mercial banks (37%), semi-official Banco Ganadero (5%), INCORA (9%), and
various others (10%).
1.15      In March 1973, the Government passed Law 5 ("Ley Quinta") to offset
an expected decline in the availability of funds for agricultural lending.
Under this law, commercial banks are currently (February 1976) required to



-5-
invest at least 17% of their total lendings in 8% agrarian bonds issued by the
Central Bank. These funds are then relent to agriculture through rediscount
facilities arranged by the Fondo Financiero Agropecuario (FFAP). Law 5 has
attracted more funds to agriculture but they have been insufficient to match
inflation and the sector is still receiving a smaller share of total credit
than the 30% provided during the period of 1968-70.
1.16      In May 1976 Caja Agraria revised its interest rates as follows:
Interest Rate from
Value of Total Assets of Borrower  Previous Interest Rate            May 1976
(%)                         (%)
Under Col$ 100,000                           14                           14
Col$ 100,000 to Col$ 500,000                 14                           18
Over Col$ 500,000                            15                           18
In addition, almost invariably a 1% life insurance premium is charged on all
loans and a further 1% charge for technical assistance is made on loans of
over Col$ 150,000.
Marketing
1.17      The domestic marketing system which serves the small farmer sub-
sector is characterized by the limited quantities each farmer places on the
market; the lack of on-farm storage; widespread indebtedness of farmers to
traders; and farmers' generally weak bargaining position, particularly when
they are obliged to sell immediately after the harvest to settle outstanding
debts; high transport costs because of inaccessibility, poor roads and defi-
cient road maintenance; and the large number of small traders at all stages,
which results in many changes of ownership and much costly handling before the
product reaches the wholesaler. There is a similar distribution network
between the wholesaler and the consumer, dominated by family firms working on
a relatively small turnover. The consequences of the traditional system as
practiced in Colombia are that:
(a) margins between producers and consumer prices average about 40%
of the consumer price, more than half of which is accounted for
between the wholesaler and the consumer;
(b) sales by producers immediately after harvesting accentuate
seasonal price fluctuations;
(c) price differences from market to market are often greater than
transport costs and reflect deficient market information;
(d) purchases must be made on the basis of inspection since there
are no accepted quality control standards; and



- 6 -
(e) physical losses are high, estimated at 9% of the tonnage
marketed, with 7% occurring during the wholesale market and
retail distribution phases.
This traditional system is bypassed by a few groups of specialized producers
with access to working capital and storage facilities who channel graded
produce directly to domestic consumers or to the export market. In the ex-
port of coffee, FEDECAFE plays a key marketing role by ensuring quality
standards and regulating prices to producers.
Agricultural Supplies
1.18      A large number of individual traders sell farm inputs but Caja
Agraria handles about half the total trade through its 438 outlets. In 1975
its sales volume totalled Col$ 1,700 million (US$51.5 million). In general,
the distribution system is remarkably effective, although the recent liquidity
problems have resulted in shortages of supplies at sales points when they were
required.
D. Government Marketing and Price Policy
1.19      Government policy is to keep direct market intervention to a mini-
mum and to limit the role of the Agricultural Marketing Institute (IDEMA) to
that of a price support agency. IDEMA has a total storage capacity of 316,000
tons of grain. Prices are fixed at six-month intervals at levels which cover
production and harvesting costs and provide incentives to farmers to strive
for higher productivity. These prices are uniform throughout the country with
no allowance for transport costs, although for rice and beans there are quality
differentials. Also they do not incorporate periodic increases to reflect the
costs of storing. Consequently, when there is an excess supply, deliveries
are often made to IDEMA immediately after the harvesting period. The strain
thus placed on IDEMA's financial resources has frequently caused delays in
payments, which, combined with rigorous quality requirements, has resulted
often in farmers selling to private traders below the official price, thus
reducing IDEMA's effectiveness as a price support agency.
1.20      The Government also wishes to encourage the growth of the Agricul-
tural Exchange (Bolsa Agropecuaria), which was established in 1974 to provide
an apex organization for the commercial grain marketing system. IDEI4A uses
its services when it sells the stocks it acquires through its support buying
operations.
1.21      So far, marketing improvements have consisted mainly of providing
modern central market facilities for the main cities (Bogota, Cali and
Medellin) and establishing special facilities such as cold stores for live-
stock products. A survey commenced in 1975 by the Planning Office of the
Ministry of Agriculture (OPSA), with USAID technical assistance, is reviewing
all aspects of the marketing problem.



E. Physical Infrastructure and Social Services
Physical Infrastructure
1.22      The topographic and climatic conditions of the country and the dis-
tribution of villages and communities are a constraint to a fast and extensive
road development program in the rural areas. Since 1962, a program of rural
road construction has been developed through the National Fund for Rural Roads
(FNCV) with the participation of communities in labor and construction mate-
rials. This effort has been intensified since 1971 with the introduction of a
"Pick and Shovel" program. Between 1962 and 1975, about 8,000 km of rural
roads were completed, but 40% of rural centers still have no proper road con-
nection and the bad condition of existing tracks usually does not meet the
minimum requirements for proper marketing of agricultural production.
1.23      Rural electrification is carried out through the rural development
division of the Colombian Institute for Electrical Energy (ICEL). In early
1976, only 35% of the rural population was served by the public electrical
supply system. The main constraint to a faster expansion is the lack of
investment funds.
1.24.     Financial limitations are also responsible for the insufficient
coverage of the rural population by potable water supply and sewage systems,
since they, respectively, serve only 42% and 10% of the rural population.
A clean water supply, however, is an essential precondition to health improve-
ments and therefore forms an important part of the project.
Social Services
1.25      There is a marked imbalance between the provision of health services
in the rural and urban areas. About 75% of all doctors and professional nurses
and health facilities are in cities with more than 20,000. The present system
fails to provide the rural population with preventive and simple curative
health care and advice on nutrition. The Government is aware of this situa-
tion and is emphasizing the construction of rural health posts and health
centers, the training of community workers ("promotoras") at the village level
for the most basic health services, and the provision of auxiliary nurses.
1.26      Better education is the first perceived need of the rural population,
but only 53% of primary school age children (7 to 14 years) attend school,
compared to the national and urban averages of 66% and 76%, respectively.
Facilities, equipment and the academic level of teachers are generally inade-
quate; 80% of rural schools offer only the first three grades, which limits
opportunities of rural children for further education. Moreover, syllabuses,
based on urban perspectives, have not yet been adapted to rural conditions.

F. Government Development Strategy
The National Development Plan 1975-78
1.27      The Government, which took office in August 1974, declared its inten-
tion to increase the incomes and standard of living of the marginal sectors
of the society, particularly by reducing the income gap between urban and
rural areas and by improving nutrition, and to securing higher export earn-
ings. The National Development Plan, 1975-78, is well in line with these
overall objectives. For the first time, heavy emphasis on the industrial
sector in the allocation of public resources is discarded on the ground that
the manufacturing sector has now gained a sufficient momentum, and agriculture
and the provision of rural infrastructure have been given first priority for
public investment. The Government has previously blamed the low incomes of
small-scale farmers on the lack of land so it has centered its efforts around
land reclamation, settlement and colonization schemes. However, today, the
thinking is that it is cheaper and more efficient to deal with the problem by
promoting higher production from existing small farms by providing minimum
technology packages and supporting services and basic infrastructure through
the implementation of integrated rural development programs. In addition to
raising the incomes of large numbers of small farmers, such activities also
create rural employment but do not imply an indefinite commitment of public
resources. Land redistribution will henceforth be carried out in response to
local circumstances in areas with both a high pressure on land and unequal
distribution, but is not regarded as the primary means for reducing rural
poverty.
1.28      The modern agricultural sector receives attention in two respects--
as the main source of foreign exchange earnings and as a source of foodstuff
not produced by the traditional sector but essential to the implementation of
the National Food and Nutrition Plan. Additional credit resources and export
incentives will be directed at products in which Colombia is believed to have
a comparative advantage (particularly livestock products, cotton, rice, sugar,
bananas, tobacco and flowers) on international markets.
The National Food and Nutrition Plan
1.29      The National Food and Nutrition Plan (PAN) would be implemented
through two programs: Nutrition and Integrated Rural Development. The Nutri-
tion Program would comprise a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing
actions in the field of processing, consumption and improved biological use
of nutritious foods. This program is to be supported by UNDP and USAID and
possibly by the Bank through a proposed Nutrition Loan and a proposed Second
Agricultural Credit Loan which would finance the production of food required
for the Nutrition Program such as wheat, rice, soybeans and milk. The Nutri-
tion Program aims to improve the nutritional status of the poorest 50% of the
population through two inter-related sub-programs;



(a)  Food Intervention, directed towards the most vulnerable
groups among the poorest 50%; pregnant and lactating women
and children under five years of age. The use of food
coupons is envisaged to subsidize the purchase of certain
nutritious foods by the target group; and
(b)  Supporting Investments, including food processing, food
quality control, preventive and simple curative health
service, potable water supply and education in nutrition.
Integrated Rural Development Program
1.30      The Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) is a comprehensive
integrated program of assistance focussed on actual and perceived needs in
regions where rural poverty is widespread. The IRDP areas will receive prior-
ity for developing production-oriented programs for small farmers, associated
with improvements to supporting and social services, and infrastructure.
Every effort will be made to reach as many families as possible and to estab-
lish a coordinated institutional structure which permits replication so that
the needs of the entire rural sector could be progressively met. The proposed
Bank project would form about half of the first phase of the IRDP, which is an
integral part of the PAN. Increases in the productivity of farms in IRDP
project areas is therefore essential not only to reduce their own poverty but
also to improve the nutritional standard of the entire population. Socio-
economic data and indicators are summarized in Table 1.1 and further informa-
tion on the IRDP is given in Chapter II of this report.

II. THE INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. The Program Areas
2.01      Five areas have been identified for the first phase of the Inte-
grated Rural Development Program (Map IBRD 12202). All have a high concen-
tration of poor, small farmers whose productivity could be increased rapidly
but where the limited availability of public funds has so far constrained
development of their productive potential. They include the following
districts:
Area 1    Departments of Narino and Cauca, including
Districts of Pasto, Ipiales, Mercaderes, Popayan;
Area 2    Departments of Cundinamarca and Tolima, including
Districts of Girardot (including six municipalites in
Tolima), La Mesa, Fusagasuga, Facatativa, Caqueza;
Area 3    Department of Antioquia, including
Districts of Yarumal (including part of Norte de
Medellin) and Rionegro;
Area 4    Departments of Cordoba and Sucre, including
Districts of Monteria, Sincelejo, and Tierra Alta; and
Area 5    Departments of Boyaca and Santander, including
Districts of Tunja, Tenza, Duitama, Soata, Chiquinquira,
Malaga, Socorro, Guavata.
The Bank would, under this project, be involved in the financing of the pro-
gram in Areas 1, 2 and 3, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
in Area 4, and the Inter-american Development Bank (IDB) in Area 5. The
following figures highlight the relative importance of the program within the
national context, and further details have been given in Table 1.1.

2.02      The 11 districts of Areas 1, 2 and 3 were selected from 61 economic
districts (Colombia is divided in 72 economic districts for planning purposes)
according to the following guidelines:
(a) the district has a high population pressure and a large proportion
of small farmers;
(b) land redistribution is not a prerequisite for development;
(c) the percentage of rural poor is high (this excludes most coffee-
producing districts where small farmers are comparatively well off
and already have good financing sources);
(d) farm productivity is low, but with good prospects for improvement;
and
(e) a minimum of production-support infrastructure already exists,
but there is a serious lack of social infrastructure.
B. The Project Area 1/
2.03      The main physical, social and economic data concerning the areas
are provided in Table 1.1. The three areas to be included in the proposed
Bank project are located in the densely populated parts of the Andean high-
lands. In 1973, 69% of the total estimated population of 2.55 million in the
project area was rural. The project areas are mainly within the temperate and
cold climate zones (72%), only 19% being in the hot zone. Rainfall varies
between and within the areas from 550 mm to 2,120 mm. A dry season generally
occurs from January to March and, to a lesser extent, in July and August. The
topography is predominantly mountainous, and soils are mainly of volcanic
origin. Most of the soils are poor (categories III to V USDA) and erosion is
serious, particularly in Area 1. Only 50% of the land area is used for agri-
cultural purposes and of this about 47% is grassland.
Small Farm Production and Production Support Services
2.04      Small farms constitute almost 90% of total farm units in the three
areas, and are operated by approximately 175,000 families. The average size
of a small farmer's holding is 4.3 ha. Eighty-six percent of these farmers
are considered to be landowners, but it is estimated that only 10% hold
titles. Agricultural land operated by small farmers amounts to about 695,000
ha, or 30% of the total--34% is grassland, supporting a dual-purpose cattle
herd of 451,000. Fifty-six percent of the agricultural area is cropped (half
in permanent crops) and 10% is fallow. A wide variety of crops is grown, with
emphasis on maize, potatoes, beans, wheat (in Area 1), barley, cassava,
1/   Map number IBRD 12202.



- 13 -
vegetables, sugarcane, plantain, and sisal. Mixed and relay inter-cropping
is widespread, the main crop associations being maize/beans and potatoes/
maize/beans. Minor animal species (pigs, sheep, rabbits, poultry, guinea-
pigs, and bees) make an important contribution to family nutrition and
income. Productivity is generally low, mainly because of poor soils and
scarcity of land, but inadequate soil preparation, inappropriate sowing dates,
poor weed control, insufficient fertilization and poor seeds also are contri-
buting factors. The lack of credit, technical assistance and a secure market
for increased production are further constraints to increasing production.
2.05      Although loans to small farmers represent about 90% of Caja Agraria's
portfolio (Caja Agraria is practically the only institutional source of
agricultural credit in the areas), less than 30% of such farmers took out
short-term loans from Caja Agraria in 1972. The expansion of credit in the
past has been hampered by the lack of resources and repayment terms and
guarantee requirements not entirely appropriate to this category of borrower.
Technical assistance linked to credit was provided by ICA to only 1,537 small
farms in 1975 through seven Rural Development Projects. In the same year,
INCORA provided supervised credit to 120 group farms with a total membership
of 1,375.
Traditional Marketing Channels
2.06      In the three project areas, small farmers have limited marketable
surpluses of a wide range of commodities. In Area 1, most commodities are
sold at the local or regional market, and only where major surpluses arise (as
in the case of potatoes, wheat and milk) are any sold outside the area. In
Areas 2 and 3, however, major influences are exerted by the central markets of
Bogota and Medellin, which draw off much of the farm production.
Cooperatives and Group Marketing
2.07      In 1975 there were nine cooperatives with 4,445 members engaged in
the marketing of agricultural products in the project areas but only five
established by INCORA serve small farmers exclusively. All five have had
a chequered history. Bad management, particularly in marketing produce, has
resulted in serious losses and in two cases (Narino and Cundinamarca) the
Central de Cooperatives de Reforma Agraria (CECORA) has had to take over.
In February 1976 the position was as follows:
(a) of the nominal membership of less than 4,000, little more
than half were active;
(b) the mainstay of the operation was input marketing (fertilizers
and veterinary products) in competition with Caja Agraria;
(c) output marketing was successful only when associated with
processing plants operated by CECORA in Bogota and Palmira;



- 14 -
(d) sales to non-members accounted for nearly 50% of total sales.
This has increased turnover and reduced unit overheads but has
reduced the cooperative character of the societies; and
(e) on average an active member transacted about 15% of his business
through the cooperative society.
2.08      The four non-INCORA cooperatives engaged in output marketing in the
project areas serve all types of farmers and do not have any permanent links
with CECORA. There are, in addition, some 120 group farms (Empresas Comuni-
tarias) with a total membership of 1,375 established and supported by INCORA
as part of its agrarian reform measures. Although operating as production
cooperatives, they market most of their production through the private trade.
Distribution of Agricultural Supplies
2.09      Caja Agraria has distribution outlets in over one-third of the 152
municipalities in the project areas, and, as elsewhere, is the major input
supplier. Cooperatives generally obtain their supplies from CECORA or private
distributors, but CECORA is reducing its fertilizer distribution operations.
Storage
2.10      In the project areas, public storage capacity exceeds 80,000 tons,
of which 29,000 tons are in silos owned by IDEMA and the General Warehousing
Corporation (INAGRARIO). Additional storage is also available as cooperatives
have been able to rent enough space to meet their needs.
Transport
2.11      Lack of feeder roads and poor maintenance are major transport con-
straints. However, as a result of the recent introduction of large trucks on
the main highways, there is, at least for the time being, enough transport
available for marketing the current farm production from the project areas.
The current freight rate is Col$ 1/m ton/km (USi5/m ton/mile).
Social Infrastructure
2.12      Health conditions are generally poor, with a high incidence of
gastro-enteritis, amoebic dysentery, typhoid and dysentery, mainly provoked
by impure water and lack of sewage facilities. Infant mortality is especially
high. There is also a serious shortage of qualified auxiliary personnel and
of health centers and health posts. Because of difficulty of access and an
inadequate system of referral, occupancy in the hospitals is only 50 to 75%.
2.13      Forty percent of school-age, rural children in the three areas do
not attend school. Of those registered in first grade, only 15% complete
primary school. Area 1 has the worst record, with a percentage of attendance
of only 50% and a drop-out rate of 92%. The number of fully trained teachers



- 15 -
is inadequate to cope with existing classrooms, and furniture and teaching
equipment are badly lacking.
Physical Infrastructure
2.14      The road network in the project areas consists of 3,532 km of secon-
dary and 540 km of rural roads. Although the three areas are connected to
the three main cities, Bogota, Cali and Medellin, the network of rural roads
is insufficiently dense considering the mountainous conditions and the disper-
sion of the population. It is estimated that proper full coverage of the
population in the three areas would require 20,736 km of new or improved rural
roads. Presently, only 60% of rural centers are accessible by car in Area 1,
70% in Area 2 and 45% in Area 3, and only 60% of the existing network is
satisfactorily maintained.
2.15      Rural electrification is particularly poor in Area 1 where only 19%
of rural families have electricity--Areas 2 and 3 are much better served,
with 80% and 70%, respectively.
2.16      An adequate supply of pure drinking water, which plays such an
essential part in health conditions, is still lacking for around 50% of the
rural families in Areas 1 and 3 and for 70% of those of Area 2.
III. THE EXECUTING AGENCIES
Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero -
Agricultural, Industrial and Mining Credit Bank (Caja Agraria)
3.01      Caja Agraria was set up in 1931 as an associated entity of the state-
owned Banco Agricola Hipotecario. It changed its name in 1932, and again in
1933. In 1954, it was authorized to operate its own insurance section and
then in 1955 it absorbed the Banco Agricola Hipotecario, together with the
savings bank, Caja Colombiano de Ahorros. In 1971, Caja Agraria became a mixed
enterprise although it remained under the general direction of the Minister of
Agriculture and its principal shareholder is still the Government with 89.1%
of the shares; other partners are local banks and public entities (3.4%),
FEDECAFE (7.5%), and a few private individuals. The statutes of Caja Agraria
enable it to:
(a) grant credit for the development of crops, livestock, craft
and other industries and mining;
(b) import, purchase and distribute material, machinery and
equipment principally for agriculture;
(c) produce, store and process goods and products;
(d) receive deposits;



- 16 -
(e) issue bonds;
(f) borrow from internal and external sources;
(g) enjoy rediscount facilities at the Bank of the Republic
(BOR); and
(h) accept warrants secured on agricultural products.
3.02      Within the general policy guidelines laid down by the Minister of
Agriculture, Caja Agraria has considerable operational autonomy and it is
required to conduct its business on commercial lines as a self-sustaining
entity. It has a Board of Directors, of which the Minister of Agriculture is
chairman. The General Manager, who is appointed by the President of the
Republic, directs seven Divisions through Deputy General Managers for Banking,
Credit, Development, Farm Supplies, Finance, Legal Affairs and Administration.
In addition, there is an Internal Audit Department whose head is appointed by
BOR, and who reports directly to the Board of Directors of Caja Agraria. The
Internal Audit Department employs about 320 people and operates through some
45 audit working groups. The head office of Caja Agraria is in Bogota and
there is a nationwide network of 25 regional and 805 branch offices and 446
farm supplies depots; at the end of 1975 it employed a staff of almost 14,000.
3.03      Decree No. 1,320 of July 31, 1970, authorized the Government to pay
the interest and amortization installments on Bank loans 448-CO and 651-CO,
with a total loan value of US$35 million, and an IDB loan of US$12.1 million,
but at the time of appraisal (February 1976), Caja Agraria was still servicing
these three loans to the detriment of its overall financial position. However,
in June 1976 the Government stated that in future it would assume this respon-
sibility, as had originally been authorized in 1970. Under Law 33 of 1971,
the Government undertook to increase the capital of Caja Agraria by Col$ (1971)
200 million a year for ten years commencing in 1971. Up to the end of 1975,
Caja Agraria had received only Col$ 150 million but, during 1976, the Govern-
ment assigned a further Col$ 701 million for this purpose and an additional
sum of Col$ 500 million to permit the writing off of trading losses incurred on
fertilizers during 1974 and 1975 (para 3.06). The National Development Plan
for 1975-78 states that the Government will bear the external debt incurred for
the whole IRDP and thus repayments by sub-borrowers to Caja Agraria are
projected to improve the funds' flow of the institution by the equivalent of
more than Col$ (1975) 2,400 million, and thereby the Government would be com-
plying with its commitment under Law 33 of 1971.
3.04      The consolidated balance sheet, and profit and loss account approved
by the Superintendency of Banks (SB) for the fiscal year ended December 27,
1974 did not demonstrate clearly the financial position of Caja Agraria, but
examination of the underlying accounts has shown that at the end of 1974 the
liquidity ratio was about 0.8 and the debt:equity ratio about 7:1.  The accounts
of Caja Agraria for the fiscal year ending December 29, 1975 approved by SB
showed that there had been a loss of 21% of gross income in the consolidated
operations of Caja Agraria during 1975 and that, although at the end of the
year, the liquidity ratio had improved to 0.9, the debt: equity ratio had
weakened to about 9:1. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Government
allocated Col$ 1,201 million (US$36 million) to Caja Agraria to absorb the



- 17 -
loss of Col$ 500 million (US$15 million) in fertilizer inventories and to
increase its capital contribution (para 3.03). It is estimated that this
contribution would have brought the debt: equity ratio at December 29, 1975
to about 5:1. Furthermore, by Decree No. 708 of 1976 the legal reserve for
Caja Agraria was reduced by 50%. These measures are expected to improve the
financial situation of Caja Agraria from 1977. An assurance from the Govern-
ment was obtained at negotiations that Caja Agraria would seek to maintain a
liquidity ratio equal to or greater than unity.
3.05      Between the end of 1972 and 1974, the total assets of Caja Agraria
increased by 46.5% (Col$ 4,791 million) and in 1975 they rose by a further
Col$ 2,355 (15.6%). The increase between 1972 and 1974 was accounted for
mainly by the addition of Col$ 2,493 million (40%) to the loan portfolio (ex-
cluding doubtful accounts) and a Col$ 2,042 million (670%) increase in stock on
hand which was principally in the form of fertilizers (para 3.06). At the end
of 1974, the portfolio included 492,000 loans valued at Col$ 9,106 million
(US$318 million at Col$ 28.60 = US$1.00). Small-scale farmers accounted for
94% of the number and 59% of the value of the loans. Loan collection records
since 1971 have shown a considerable improvement; the proportion by value of
loans with overdue installments had dropped from 17.9% in 1971 to 10.9% of the
loan portfolio at the end of 1975. The value of the installments overdue is
not separately tabulated, but would appear to be considerably less than the
above percentages suggest.
3.06      Caja Agraria accounts for nearly half of all national sales of farm
inputs and is thus in a strong position to influence price levels. Preliminary
figures for 1975 sales by Caja Agraria were Col$ 1,700 million (US$51.5 million)
operating with a gross margin of 21% yielding a net profit of 2% without taking
into account the major problem which arose concerning the large stock of fer-
tilizers purchased internationally at the end of 1974 at peak world market
prices. Up to June 30, 1975, the fertilizer was shown in the balance sheet as
stock on hand at its cost of acquisition. Adjusted to current market prices,
its balance sheet value was overstated by Col$ 282 million (US$8.6 million) at
that date. By the end of 1976, it is considered likely that losses on this
whole operation will be no less than Col$ 500 million or about US$15 million.
3.07      Caja Agraria is principally a bank; therefore, it is subject to
inspection by the Superintendency of Banks which determines the general form
of reporting required for annual examination and certification. This form of
reporting is neither adequate nor appropriate for day-to-day management, con-
trol or planning. It is particularly unsatisfactory in respect of the non-
banking operations of Caja Agraria because it is not possible to determine
readily the true cost of resources and services or the quality of performance
of profit centers. Some restructuring of the accounting systems and proce-
dures on management accounting is necessary to increase their value as a basis
for better financial management and control, while still complying with the
requirements of the Superintendency of Banks (para 4.33).
Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario -
Columbian Agricultural Institute (ICA)
3.08      In 1963, ICA was formed as an autonomous government institution re-
sponsible for all research related to the agricultural sector. As a result of
the administrative reorganizations of 1968 and 1976, ICA was brought more



- 18 -
directly under the control of the Minister of Agriculture and is now responsi-
ble for the farm advisory service, with particular emphasis on the smallholder
subsector. Attention to the requirements of small-scale farmers has only
been emphasized since about 1971; however, there is now a considerable number
of ICA staff with first-hand experience of smallholder conditions and it would
be these people who would head the extension drive, which would be a key ele-
ment of the IRDP.
3.09      In 1976 ICA had nine regional offices controlling five research
centers,-16 experimental and demonstration centers and a total of 21 rural
development projects, including 49 rural development offices. Of its total
staff of some 6,000, about 900 are engaged in providing technical assistance
to small farmers. Shortages of finance have curtailed the activities of ICA,
but recently the situation improved and in 1975 expenditures were covered by
income (Col$ 714 million), of which 57% came from the national budget, 28%
from charges for services to medium- and large-scale farmers, 7% from external
sources, and 8% from farm operations and other activities.
3.10      Under the provisions of Law 5 of 1973, ICA should receive the 1%
surcharge for technical assistance to small-scale farmers collected by the
FFAP account of BOR on all rediscounted sub-loans made by intermediary banks
to agricultural borrowers having assets exceeding Col$ 500,000 (US$15,000).
Up to the end of 1975, the balance sheets of ICA record the receipt of only
Col$ 255,000 from this source. At the end of the 1975, after writing off
losses of Col$ 188 million, the capital account was reduced to Col$ 235
million (US$7 million) and the position could deteriorate further as ICA will
commence repaying an IDB loan during 1976. Accounts are well maintained,
up to date, and are regularly audited by the Comptroller General.
3.11      Stringent measures were introduced at the end of 1974 to reestablish
the financial viability of ICA. Consequently, although ICA has sufficient
experience and a suitable structure to carry out its responsibilities under
the proposed project during the execution of the project, attention would have
to be paid to maintaining the overall financial viability of the entity. In
particular ICA could again slip into a serious financial condition unless
revenue is received from the 1% surcharge on FFAP lending to medium- and large-
scale farmers.
Instituto Nacional de los Recursos Naturales Renovables y del Medio Ambiente -
National Institute for Renewable National Resources and Environment (INDERENA)
3.12      INDERENA was established in 1968 as a dependency of the Ministry of
Agriculture responsible for protecting, administering, and developing the
natural resources of Colombia. So far it has been predominantly a licensing
and control agency, but it has recently initiated forestry, soil conservation
and fishery research. One of the objectives of the proposed IRDP would be
to increase the capacity of INDERENA to promote forestry development and to
collaborate with ICA in minimizing soil erosion. Appropriate conditions to
ensure effective coordination would be included in the relevant Subsidiary
Project Agreements (para 5.06).
3.13      INDERENA has a headquarters and six regional offices with a total
staff of some 2,400, of whom 400 are professionals. About half the staff is



- 19 -
engaged in work related to forest control and development, but, over the past
12 years, official technical assistance has been associated with planting of
no more than 22,000 ha. INDERENA had an annual income of Col$ 175 million in
1974 of which 66% was from national budget appropriations and the balance from
operating income. Accounting procedures have been considerably improved since
changes were introduced in 1973, and the books are audited regularly by the
Comptroller General. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that there
would be no conflict of responsibilities between INDERENA and the newly created
Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Metereology and Land Reclamation (HIMAT) to
which some of the functions of INDERENA were delegated early in 1976.
3.14      INDERENA has the capacity to undertake the natural resources compo-
nent of the proposed project.
Central de Cooperativas de Reforma Agraria Ltda. -
Union of Agrarian Reform Cooperatives Ltd. (CECORA)
3.15      CECORA was formed in 1968 by the Colombian Institute for Agrarian
Reform (INCORA) to assist cooperative societies of beneficiaries of the
agrarian reform program. INCORA retains specific powers under 20 of the 65
articles in the statutes of CECORA, but Articles 4 and 8 enable CECORA also
to assist cooperatives outside INCORA areas. The General Manager of INCORA
has approved the expansion of the scope of CECORA to permit it to play an
important role in the IRDP.
3.16      There is a staff of about 200 under a General Manager responsible
to a Board of Directors. In 1974 the main operations of CECORA, in terms
of the percentage of total sales (Col$ 277 million), were farm supplies
(mainly fertilizers), 71%; animal feedstuffs, 18%; crop produce sales, 10%;
and sales of livestock, 1%. As in the case of Caja Agraria, fertilizers
purchased in 1974 present a serious financial problem to CECORA. The remain-
ing 1974 stocks are being refinanced by commercial banks which are pressing
for payment, but sales at current prices would result in a trading loss of
some Col$ 100 million (US$3 million). In view of the importance of CECORA to
the IRDP, clarification would be sought concerning the financial condition of
this institution. During negotiations an assurance was obtained from the
Government that it would examine the financial status of CECORA and that a
financial plan for 1977, acceptable to the Bank, would be proposed before
finalizing and signing the Subsidiary Project Agreement between Caja Agraria
and CECORA.
3.17      Records are well maintained and accounts are regularly audited
by INCORA, which, in turn, is subject to audit by the Comptroller General.
CECORA is now well organized and could be expanded to provide the market
extension service proposed as part of the IRDP.
Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje -
National Apprenticeship Service (SENA)
3.18      Formed in 1957, SENA is an autonomous agency of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security responsible for vocational and informal training.
Since 1967 it has increased its activities in rural areas through the Programa
Movil Rural (PMR) - Mobile Rural Program. This sets out initially to identify



- 20 -
the training needs of small rural communities and then to provide appropriate
instruction. Most of the courses are related to farm production, but train-
ing in handcrafts is also provided.
3.19      SENA has its headquarters in Bogota, 17 regional offices, and a total
staff of about 7,000. It runs 13 well equipped Agricultural Training Centers,
which have a combined boarding capacity of 4,800 youths and 3,600 adults and
in which 35,800 persons were trained in 1974. In addition, nearly 60,000
persons took courses, each of at least 70 hours, conducted under the PMR.
3.20      The bulk (92% in 1975) of its income is from payroll taxes levied
at 2% for private enterprises and 1/2% for public entities. SENA is in a
strong financial condition and maintains satisfactory accounts which are
audited by the Comptroller General. It is well organized and fully able
to execute the training component of the proposed IRDP.
Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares -
Colombian Institute for School Buildings (ICCE)
3.21      Decree 218 of 1969 set ou1t the responsibilities and structure of
ICCE as a public institution attached to the Ministry of Education. It was
intended to concentrate on the building and equipping of schools, but it
also included a Pedagogical Department, which, in 1975, accounted for 56% of
its annual budget. Early in 1976, however, this Department was transferred to
the Ministry of Education to permit ICCE to concentrate on the major national
program to construct and equip 32,000 classrooms.
3.22      At the headquarters in Bogota, there are Departments for construc-
tion, equipment, administration and finance, which employ 60% of the staff
of 860; the remainder are located in 26 regional offices. ICCE depends al-
most entirely on Government funds to finance its operations. In 1975, its
original budget was Col$ 750 million (US$22.7 million) but it was cut to
Col$ 676 million (US$20.5 million) and of this for the 10 months to October 31,
1975, only 60% had been authorized for payment by the Ministry of Finance and
only 46% actually transferred to ICCE by the Treasury. ICCE has the technical
capacity to carry out its responsibilities under the IRDP.
Ministerio de Salud Publica -
Ministry of Public Health (Minsalud)
3.23      The functions and organization of Minsalud were redefined by Decree
No. 121 of January 1976. The administrative structure is made up of 14
Directorates which have hitherto tended to lack coordination. The Directo-
rate of Construction and Hospital Maintenance establishes building policy,
but execution is controlled by Fondo Nacional Hospitalario - National Hospital
Fund (FNH), which is regulated by Decree No. 687 of 1967 and has a separate
account in the Administrative Division. The FNH disburses funds through the
local sections of the Health Service which arrange for local bidding and the
supervision of the construction and operation and maintenance of health faci-
lities.



- 21 -
3.24      During negotiations assurances were obtained that, within Minsalud,
a unit would be responsible for the execution of the health component of the
project and that adequate provision would be made to finance the operational
and maintenance costs of the project facilities.
Instituto Nacional de Salud -
National Institute of Health (INAS)
3.25      Decree 671 of 1975 defined the responsibilities of INAS, which are
principally to provide, through its Basic Health (SBR) Division, potable water
and sewerage systems to communities of less than 2,500 persons. INAS also
has laboratories for food testing, vaccine production and research. The SBR
Division has four regional offices which have full responsibilities for the
selection, execution and supervision of local sub-projects.
3.26      INAS is financially dependent on appropriations from the national
budget. In recent years, the amounts released to INAS have been less than
approved in the budget and this has delayed the execution of projects financed
in part by three USAID loans, totalling Col$ 261 million (US$7.9 million).
INAS requires communities which are to benefit from projects to form water-
supply management committees and contribute about 15% of total investment
costs in cash or labor. A part of the balance is treated as a long-term (15
years) loan bearing 6% interest to be paid by the community through the
monthly water rate into a sub-project account. This account is maintained by
INAS to finance maintenance and additions to the sub-project. The accounts are
satisfactorily maintained and audited by the Comptroller General.
3.27      The operational and administrative capacity of INAS is satisfac-
tory and it would be fully capable of executing the proposed component of
the IRDP with little or no increase in staff or recurrent expenditure.
Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales -
National Fund for Rural Roads (Caminales)
3.28      Caminales is a dependent agency of the Ministry of Public works and
Communications which began operations in 1962. It is responsible for the
construction, improvement and maintenance of roads of local importance to
integrate remote areas with the more developed zones and to serve as feeder
roads for the national network of main roads.
3.29      At the end of 1975 the headquarters in Bogota had 30 technical and
127 administrative staff, while an additional 212 technical and 176 administ-
rative personnel were working from 25 regional offices. Between 1962 and
1975 Caminales promoted the construction of about 8,000 km of rural roads.
In recent years some of these roads have been built using almost all manual
labor through the "Pick and Shovel" program; however, declining budgetary
allocations seriously limited the extent of the actions to improve rural roads.
3.30      Caminales is almost entirely dependent on the national budget from
which it has received a declining allocation: Col$ 750 million in 1973 down



- 22 -
to Col$ 485 million (US$14.7 million) in 1975, and only Col$ 460 million is
expected in 1976. The accounts are satisfactorily maintained and regularly
audited by the Comptroller General, and Caminales has the necessary technical
and administrative capacity to execute the rural road component.
Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica -
Colombian Institute for Electrical Power (ICEL)
3.31      Decree-Law 3,175 of 1968 increased the control exercised by the
Ministry of Power and Mines over ICEL, which is an autonomous public entity
formed in 1946. ICEL is responsible for planning and design at the national
level and supervises the activities of subsidiary power companies (Electrifi-
cadoras) in each Department which carry out the production, transmission and
sale of electrical power.
3.32      The ICEL headquarters in Bogota includes a Planning Office for Rural
Electrification (OPER), which would be responsible for the detailed supervision
of this component of the project. The national budget provides 90% of ICEL's
financial resources and, in 1975, it received Col$ 1,800 million (US$54.5
million), of which 15% was devoted to current costs and the remainder to in-
vestment, including debt servicing. Its accounts are satisfactorily maintained
and regularly audited by the Comptroller General.
3.33      ICEL has the experience and technical capacity to supervise and
regulate the "Electrificadoras" in Narino and Cauca, which would execute the
rural electrification component of the project that is restricted to Area 1.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
4.01      The objective of the project would be to raise living standards in
selected rural areas by increasing the incomes of farm families and by improv-
ing social services and facilities available to rural communities. Through
the project, it would be intended to reduce disparities between rural and
urban amenities while facilitating the transition of some of the rural popula-
tion to industrial and commercial activities. This would require not only
raising formal educational standards of the rural population but also increas-
ing its familiarity with marketing, credit, technical and management skills
which are required both for more intensive farm management and to obtain
regular urban employment, above the level of unskilled labor. The main
emphasis of the project would be on investments to raise farm production and
to improve support services. Rural roads would be provided to areas with
the highest agricultural potential while investments in education, health,



- 23 -
water and electricity would be provided to spread these services more uni-
formly, while giving priority to communities showing greatest interest in farm
development.
4.02      The National Planning Department (DNP) would be responsible for the
overall programming and coordination of the project, the Rural Development
Department of Caja Agraria would administer and monitor the project, and
specialized agencies would execute the individual components of the project
(Chart 5.1). Sub-loans would be provided to some 40,000 sub-borrowers by
the Department of Credit of Caja Agraria on the basis of farm plans prepared
with the assistance of ICA and INDERENA staff. These plans would be for inte-
grated operations incorporating crops (other than coffee which is not finance-
able in Bank projects), livestock, minor farm structures and tree planting;
from the third year of the project; credit would also be available to success-
ful participants for minor home improvements related to hygiene. Farm manage-
ment adaptation and demonstration units would be established and maintained by
ICA. INDERENA would set up and run forest tree nurseries in each district
and also design, and assist in the construction of, minor civil works to
prevent soil erosion and to conserve water. A market advisory service would
be formed by CECORA, which would also assist groups of producers to obtain
sub-loans from Caja Agraria to finance the construction and operation of
associative marketing enterprises. Training for project staff and farmers
would be provided by SENA.
4.03      The proposed project would also finance furniture and equipment to
be bought by ICCE for rural primary schools and the construction and equip-
ment by Minisalud of health posts and centers, and some local hospitals would
be modernized; staff training for rural health and nutrition activities would
also be financed under the project. Piped water supply systems would be
constructed by INAS and rural roads would be constructed by Caminales in the
areas of highest production potential. In the Departments of Cauca and Narino
(Area 1) rural electrification schemes would carried out under the supervision
of ICEL.
B. Detailed Features
Project Management
4.04      A Program Management Unit under a Director General has been set up
in the National Planning Department (DNP) to coordinate and control the entire
IRDP under Decree 1269/June 1976. The Unit would require office equipment and
salaries for 20 staff posts, plus operating costs for five years; the proposed
Bank project would incorporate 45% of these costs as being attributable to
Areas 1, 2 and 3. A Direction and Coordination Group has been formed in the
Unit to link DNP headquarters and the program areas. DNP representatives are
to be stationed in eight of the nine Departments in which the IRDP will be
implemented; the small part of Tolima in Area 2 would be administered with
Cundinamarca (para 2.01). In addition, an Evaluation Group is to be formed to
continuously assess the performance and impact of the overall program. An
assurance was obtained from the Government at negotiations that the IRDP



- 24 -
Evaluation Group would be organized and maintained for at least 10 years from
the date of loan effectiveness. The cost of the Evaluation Group is estimated
at about Col$ 30 million (US$0.9 million) over the five-year investment period
of the project. The Government would assume full financial responsibility for
the Evaluation Group. The establishment of the Evaluation Group would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness.
4.05      Administration and Monitoring Units have been formed in the Rural
Development Department of the Caja Agraria. The Rural Development Department
would require 70 additional staff for the three project areas as follows:
Existing Staff   Staff Requirement
Project Management         Available           by Year 3         Additional Staff
Professional                    17                 29                     12
Assistant                        7                 50                     43
Secretarial                      0                 15                     15
Total                24                 94                     70
The total project cost would include 45% of the cost of the additional equip-
ment required for the headquarters units and the full cost of vehicles,
equipment, and, for five years, the salaries and operational costs of the
additional personnel required by the Rural Development Department of Caja
Agraria for the project in Areas 1, 2 and 3.
Farm Operations and Development
4.06      The Credit Department of Caja Agraria would administer sub-loans to
finance crop and livestock development, production and harvesting expenses of
participating farmers. Conditions of eligibility to participate in the project
would be:
(a)  gross capital assets per farmer and spouse of less than
Col$ 500,000 (US$15,000);
(b)  total area of land available for use by the sub-borrower,
less than 20 ha;
(c)  not less than 70% of the family income to be derived from
farming and local activities; and
(d)  the presentation of an integrated farm operation and
development plan prepared with the assistance of ICA staff
and, if appropriate, INDERENA staff.
4.07      The Credit Department of Caja Agraria would administer the credit
program and make sub-loans to eligible farmers for the following purposes:



- 25 -
(a)  seasonal farm operational expenses for crop production and
cattle management;
(b)  medium-term investments for semi-permanent crops such as
plantains and cassava and for minor livestock species, for
example, swine, poultry, rabbits and guinea-pigs. Medium-
term sub-loans also would be made for on-farm stores and
home improvements; and
(c)  long-term investment for cattle development, principally
for milk production, and for tree planting.
4.08      By the end of the investment period of the project (Year 5) it is
projected that the following enterprises would be included within the farm
programs of 40,000 small-scale farmers:
Crops and Trees                       Livestock
ha                                     Units

Marketing Operations and Development
4.09      Caja Agraria would also administer sub-loans for groups of eligible
farmers associated for the purpose of produce marketing. Groups of producers
for marketing, including cooperatives and other forms of association, are to be
encouraged by SENA, while CECORA would be responsible for assisting in the
preparation of market operating and development plans to be presented to Caja
Agraria with each sub-loan application. Sub-loans would be made for the
following purposes:
(a) working capital for marketing groups;
(b) medium-term investments in trucks; and

(c) long-term investments in produce collection centers
and local, short-term produce stores.
Production Support
4.10      Farm Advisory Service (ICA).  The proposed project would finance
vehicles (97 4-wheel drive, 392 motorcycles and three mobile visual aid
units), 54 horses, office furniture and equipment, and, for five years, the
salaries and operational expenses of the additional staff required for the
project. -A Farm Advisory Service manager responsible for the activities of
all professional and sub-professional field agents would be assigned to each
project area. The proposed number of field agents is related to the expected
number of eligible farmers who would require farm credit in each year of the
project (para 6.01).

4.11      The Farm Advisory Service would extend the ongoing program (paras
1.08 and 2.05) throughout the project areas. Current, traditional farm systems
have been reviewed and, through the proposed project, the Farm Advisory Service
would promote discrete changes to these systems to take advantage of the avail-
ability of new crop varieties and improved crop and livestock management
practices. High priority would be given to introducing individual integrated
farm plans, including the production of foodstuffs richer in proteins, vitamins
and minerals than are raised using the current farm systems. Farm practice
Adaptation Units would be used to verify the technical and economic feasibility
of the changes to be proposed; Demonstration Units would be used to disseminate
more widely the farming systems proved on the Adaptation Units. The number of
field agents would be sufficient to allow for the close supervision of up to
354 Adaptation Units and up to 445 livestock and 900 crop Demonstration Units
to be established under the project. The number of staff required at full
development is given as follows:

4.12      Natural Resources Advisory Service (INDERENA).  The five existing
forest tree nurseries in the project areas would be expanded and a further
four established. The project would finance these development costs and four
vehicles which would be used to deliver seedlings to convenient collection
points not more than 2 km from the planting sites. The project would also
finance the operating costs of the nine nurseries for five years to the extent
necessary to produce the 6.2 million seedlings a year required for the project,
and the project would finance the salaries and operating costs of one addition-
al INDERENA forester for each area and a total of 18 sub-professional forestry
assistants and three administrative personnel. Investment costs would include
three 4-wheel drive vehicles, 18 motorcycles, and survey instruments.

Tree planting (6,600 ha) would be promoted by INDERENA on about 10,600 indi-
vidual small farms within 20 km of its nurseries. In addition, about 1,000
ha of trees would be planted by communities around some 250 water sources in
collaboration with INAS, but under the technical supervision of INDERENA.
4.13      Soil conservation studies, technical assistance and minor civil
works for soil conservation would be carried out by INDERENA in Areas 1 and
2, based on experience already gained in Area 3. Initially, in Areas - and
2 a total of 45 representative test valleys would be selected for the local



- 28 -
adaptation of known conservation practices such as cut-off and drainage
ditches, contour terraces, gully control measures and minor stream regula-
tion works. The project would provide, for the three areas, vehicles (17 4-
wheel drive and 15 motorcycles) and equipment for INDERENA staff, three
crawler tractors with equipment, and three trucks. It would also finance for
five years the salaries and operating costs of 14 professional and 26 assist-
ant personnel. The Subsidiary Project Agreement would require that INDERENA
make arrangements, for the servicing and maintenance of vehicles and equipment
to be provided under the project.
4.14      Marketing Advisory Service.  CECORA would provide daily price inform-
ation to each of the 11 District headquarters in the three project areas as
well as to other Areas in the IRDP. A special program unit would be formed in
the CECORA headquarters to be responsible for the Market Intelligence Service
(para 1.17c) and the field operations of CECORA staff working in project areas
assisting associative marketing groups. The project would include 45% of the
investment costs and operating costs for five years; 55% of the central costs
have been assigned to the parallel projects to be financed in part by CIDA and
IDB. An application for technical assistance on marketing has been submitted
by the Government to UNDP. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that
before the end of 1977, CECORA would obtain technical assistance, satisfactory
to the Bank, on marketing agricultural output from the IRDP areas.
4.15      Training.  The central administration of this component would
be through an IRDP unit at SENA headquarters consisting of a Chief, three
specialist training officers and a statistical clerk to maintain a central
record of courses for monitoring purposes. Of the total operating costs
of this program unit, 45% would be attributed to the proposed Bank project.
In addition, the project would provide vehicles (62 4-wheel drive and three
45-passenger buses) and audio-visual equipment for the mobile units of SENA,
and include the operational expenses for training staff, groups of farmers
and individuals. Based on detailed records maintained by SENA for 1974
and 1975 it is estimated that in mid-1976 the average cost per course would
be as follows:
Col$
In-service staff courses                    2,850 per course
Groups in rural communities                28,580 per group
Special courses in rural communities        1,500 per farmer
4.16      Initially SENA would conduct courses for senior and other staff
of all the entities taking part in the IRDP to explain the concepts and
operations of the project. A total of 100 courses of two to five days are
proposed for some 4,100 participants. It is recommended that these courses
should be started in 1976 and therefore the associated expenses should be
recognized for retroactive financing (para 4.27). During the five years of
the proposed project, SENA would run special courses in farm management,



- 29 -
credit operations, the organization of groups, administration, accounting and
management of cooperatives and other forms of marketing association. Over
the five-year period of the project, 417 courses of an average of seven
days are scheduled for about 13,000 trainees, including the initial staff
induction courses mentioned above.
4.17      The mobile units of SENA would conduct a total of some 1,300 intro-
ductory meetings in the rural communities to explain the objectives and
opportunities available under the project. These initial assemblies would be
followed up with about 2,500 courses for common interest groups, and special-
ized, single topic instruction would be provided for a total of 40,000 farmers
over the five years of the project, in two- or three-day courses to be conduc-
ted within the communities, mainly in the field.
Social Services
4.18      Education.  The project would finance the purchase of furniture
for 2,300 existing classrooms which have already been constructed, plus 3,800
teaching aid kits. The proposed number of kits is approximately the same
as the number of schools in the project areas.
4.19     Health.  The project would provide within five years, 80% health
service coverage in the rural localities of Areas 1, 2 and 3, through the con-
struction and equipping of 75 new health posts and the restructuring and im-
provement of 26 existing health posts, eight health centers and 17 local
hospitals. A total of 246 posts and centers would be established and each
would be the focus for a health team of about six health visitors (promotoras)
and two health auxiliaries. The project would finance the purchase of 64
4-wheel drive ambulances and 2,000 medical kits and 246 nutrition education
kits for the health auxiliaries and "promotoras". In addition, the project
would finance the cost of health and nutrition training for a total of 1,500
health visitors and 500 health auxiliaries. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that Minsalud, in collaboration with other appropriate agencies,
would prepare and implement specialized rural health care training for staff,
including physicians, and that a communications system, satisfactory to the
Bank, would be established and operated among all health posts, centers,
ambulances and hospitals in the project areas.
4.20      The project would also provide up to half the cost of construction
of latrines built by communities at local markets, schools or other public
places. Farm development sub-loans could, under certain circumstances,
include the cost of materials for the construction of latrines at the indi-
vidual homesteads (para 4.07 (b)).

4.21     Potable Water.  Under the supervision of INAS, 248 water supply
systems would be constructed, expanded or improved, benefitting about 147,000
rural residents in the three project areas. The systems would be fed mainly
by gravity and each would serve an average of about 100 households by indi-
vidual connections.

Infrastructure
4.22     Rural Roads.  Caminales would plan and supervise the construction of
312.5 km of new rural roads, and the improvement of 646.5 km of existing rural
roads over a period of four years. The works would be carried out as part of
the "Pick and Shovel" program, but conventional methods using contracted heavy
equipment would be used for earthworks in difficult terrain and for laying
gravel pavements. Further details are as follows:

4.23      Electrification.  ICEL would supervise, through its planning
office, OPER, 22 electrification sub-projects benefitting 14,335 families in
the rural areas of the Departments of Narino and Cauca which comprise Area 1
of the project. The investments would be scheduled to be completed in three
years, since the studies are already well advanced. For bidding and construc-
tion purposes, 11 sub-projects have been prepared for each Department; each
sub-project covers from one to six municipalities. No investment is proposed
in Areas 2 and 3.

C. Cost Estimates
4.24      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$131 million, in-
cluding provision of US$68.1 million for incremental production credit and
working capital. for marketing; US$27.6 million, or 21%, represents foreign
exchange costs of the project. Baseline costs have been calculated as of
mid-1976. Physical contingencies, ranging between 5% and 15%, have been
allowed for each component except credit operations, producing a weighted
average physical contingency of 2.8% of total baseline costs. Price contin-
gencies have been computed separately for local and foreign costs. Local
price contingencies have then been adjusted to take into account the effects
of currency changes expected during the project period; on this basis the
price contingency represents 16.7% of baseline costs (Table 4.1).

D. Financing
4.25      The financing of the five-year project would be shared in the amounts
and proportions shown in Table 4.2. The proposed Bank loan of US$52 million
would be to the Republic of Colombia at the Bank lending rate current at the
time of loan approval and would be for 17 years, including 3-1/2 years of
grace. The Government of Colombia would bear the foreign exchange risk.
The loan would finance the 21% foreign exchange costs of the project (US$27.6
million) and a further 19% for local currency expenditures (US$24.4 million).
Local currency financing is recommended because of the importance the project
would have within the overall Government attempt to promote the economic devel-
opment of the poorest of the rural population within the project areas, and
because of the relatively low foreign exchange content which is characteristic
of rural development projects. The cost sharing proportion which is proposed
is necessary to give the Bank a meaningful role in the project, particularly
in view of the fact that in Area 5 of the IRDP the IDB will be providing 60%
of project costs.
4.26      The project beneficiaries would be required to finance 10% (US$13.1
million) of total project costs. Cost recovery is considered further in para-
graphs 8.04 to 8.07. The Government would be responsible for 50% (US$65.9
million) of total project costs. Of the latter amount, SENA would provide
US$3.1 and US$23.0 million would be required for additional credit operations
to be carried out by Caja Agraria for the project but this amount would be
available for relending as the sub-loans were repaid; the non-recoverable cost
to the Government of investment and incremental expenditures over the five
years of the proposed project would therefore be US$39.8 million.
4.27      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$500,000 is proposed for ex-
penditures incurred from July 1, 1976 for initial staff training and orienta-
tion for project work (para 4.16), to initiate farming Adaptation and Demon-
stration Units (para 4.11), the Natural Resources Advisory Service (para 4.12),
the Marketing Advisory Service for the project (para 4.14) and engineering
studies for the potable water, rural roads and electrification components.
These initial activities are necessary to enable the project to evolve as
rapidly as is planned after the date of loan effectiveness.
E. Procurement
4.28      International competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Guide-
lines on Procurement, would be required for orders estimated to cost more
than US$100,000 for vehicles for official use, estimated to total US$4.9
million; and water pumps and piping, estimated to total US$1.0 million.
Caja Agraria would consolidate the requirements of the participating agencies
for these categories and issue international calls for tenders. Domestic

manufacturers would be granted a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal
to the prevailing tariff, or 15% of the c.i.f. cost of imports, whichever
is lower. Much of the project would be concerned with training and extension
services which would involve only minor construction and the purchase of
small amounts of equipment. Farmers would purchase their requirements of
fertilizer, seeds, small farm equipment and other inputs of their choice
through existing commercial channels of which the agricultural merchandise
department of Caja Agraria would be the most important distribution agency. A
wide range of international manufacturers is represented in Colombia and, for
the items required for the project, competition is satisfactory and servicing
and spare parts are generally available. Construction of health posts and
centers, potable water systems, rural roads and electrification would be small
sub-projects widely dispersed geographically, and would therefore be carried
out by self-help, force account or local competitive bidding procedures which
are acceptable to the Bank.
F. Disbursement
4.29      The loan would be disbursed over a period of six years, as is shown
in Table 4.3. The closing date for the loan would be December 31, 1982. The
Program Administration Unit of the Rural Development Department of Caja Agraria
would be responsible for verifying the physical and financial evolution of the
project through its Section for Monitoring and Control.
4.30      The Bank would disburse the following proportions of disbursements
and expenditures certified by Caja Agraria:
(a) Sub-loans for farm and marketing
operations and development              49% of amount disbursed
(b)  Vehicles and medical equipment          100% of foreign expenditures
or 40% of ex-factory cost of
loca'lly manufactured goods
(c)  Cables and electrical equipment;        100% of foreign expenditures
water pipes and pumps                   or 80% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods
(d) All other expenditures by Caja
Agraria and project entities            36%
4.31      The Bank would reimburse for sub-loan disbursements against state-
ments of expenditure prepared by Caja Agraria.  Disbursement for foreign expen-
ditures, locally procured imported items and all other project expenditures
would be in accordance with normal Bank procedures. The full documentation
would not be submitted for review by the Bank but it would be retained by Caja
Agraria and made available for inspection by the Bank during the course of
project supervision missions. Retroactive financing not exceeding US$500,000
is proposed for expenditures incurred from July 1, 1976 for purposes listed in
paragraph 4.27. Any balance left in the loan account after completion of the
project could, with Bank approval, be used for investments of a similar nature

and for comparable purposes to promote rural development. At negotiations, an
assurance was obtained that the funds derived from the proposed loan would
continue to be used for rural development credit purposes, after the conclu-
sion of the implementation period, for the life of the project.
G. Accounts and Auditing
4.32      Each of the participating agencies, including Caja Agraria, would
maintain in its accounting records separate and uniform project accounts.
These would be subject to annual examination according to generally accepted
auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit
reports would express an opinion on the fairness with which each project
account presented the financial position, results of operations and changes in
the financial position, in conformity with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples applied on a consistent basis. The Comptroller General's office, which
operates in an independent manner, would continue to carry out external audits
of all participating agencies except Caja Agraria, the accounts of which are
examined by the Superintendency of Banks. During negotiations an assurance
was obtained that within four months of the close of each fiscal year, the
Borrower would provide the Bank with audited project accounts of Caja Agraria
and each of the participating agencies.
4.33      Since 1972, the financial reporting procedures and system of Caja
Agraria have been modified to conform with banking legislation and the require-
ments of the Superintendency of Banks. The reports which are examined and
certified by the Superintendency of Banks do not analyze the financial posi-
tion by lines of business (para 3.07). Therefore, during negotiations an
assurance was obtained that a technical review, acceptable to the Bank, would
be conducted of the existing accounting procedures, information systems and
management controls of Caja Agraria. The results of the technical review,
recommendations for improvements and a program for their implementation would
be submitted to the Bank within six months of effectiveness and no later than
the second fiscal year from effectiveness any modifications to the procedures
and systems would be implemented.
4.34      Subsidiary Project Agreements (para 5.06) would include a require-
ment that each participating entity would establish procedures acceptable to
the Bank for the maintenance of separate, comparable project accounts; con-
sistent standards for the allocation of approved current expenditures to the
project accounts; and annual audits by independent auditors, acceptable to the
Bank within four months of the close of each financial year.

methods of operation. Most of these agencies were created in the administ-
rative reform of 1968 as dependencies of various ministries, but because of
the degree of independence they enjoyed, it became increasingly difficult to
coordinate their actions, On January 26, 1976, the Minister of Agriculture
was given sufficient power (Decree 133) over entities dependent on his
Ministry to regain full control of their plans and activities, and similar
changes have also taken place in other ministries. The IRDP Program, by the
nature of its broad requirements, complements this trend by bringing together
official entities with responsibilities for promoting development in rural
areas.
5.02      Other official intentions are to promote regional development by
encouraging decentralization and to encourage the greater involvement of the
public in development decisions. This policy is given practical expression
in the Program's organizational structure by the four-tiered level of partic-
ipatory bodies at national, departmental, municipal and community levels.
At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the Government would initiate
and operate thereafter, a system of national, departmental, municipal and
community committees, satisfactory to the Bank, to give advice to the Project
Management Unit with regard to the management, coordination and integration of
the project activities at the national, departmental, municipal and community
levels., Participation by all members of each community would be encouraged to
prevent the relatively well off from becoming self-appointed spokesmen for the
rural communities. These natural leaders can contribute a valuable dynamism
to local activities, but they often override the wishes of the poorest members
of their community. The Government is fully aware of the overriding importance
of involving the target population, at the community and municipal levels, in
reviewing official development proposals and proposing modifications to the
plans in the light of local experience and current needs as recognized by the
communities. Various procedures for organizing local participation were
initiated in 1975 in selected localities in Areas 1 and 5 (IDB) of the IRDP;
the systems are being further evolved in 1976.
5.03      The proposed project organization would be fitted into the organiza-
tional framework of the IRDP set up for administrative and operational purposes
by Decrees No. 1,268 and 1,269 in June 1976. It would be clearly definable
as a project at the departmental level where the Regional IRD Project Coordi-
nator would be in charge of day-to-day management. The three main elements of
the management system for the Program and the project are management and co-
ordination, administration, and the execution of the components (Chart 5.1).
B. Project Management
Project Management and Coordination
5.04      The overall policy for the national IRDP would be determined by
the National Council for Economic and Social Policy (CONPES), a cabinet level
body, which includes all ministers responsible for the entities participating
in the IRDP, as well as the Chief of the National Planning Department (DNP).
The latter would be responsible for the management of the IRDP, which would

be carried out through a Director General of the IRDP who would be engaged
exclusively in this work. This Unit would be responsible for all budgeting,
programming and coordinating activities required for the IRDP and would have a
permanent representative on each departmental IRD Project Commitee, who would
be responsible for ensuring the effective coordination at the local level of
all entities taking part in the project. The IRDP Unit would, along with the
Department of Rural Development of Caja Agraria, constitute the secretariat
for the National IRDP Committee.
Project Administration
5.05      Caja Agraria would administer the project on behalf of DNP through
its Department of Rural Development in accordance with an agreement to be
entered into between the Government and Caja Agraria. It would be a condition
of effectiveness that the Bank had received a signed and authorized copy of
this agreement. The Department of Rural Development would:
(a) assist the IRDP unit of DNP to provide the secretariat
for the National IRDP Committee;
(b) provide the secretariat for Departmental IRD Project
Committees and the chairmen of Municipal and Community
IRD Project Committees;
(c) inspect and report on the physical and financial progress
of each component of the project;
(d) consolidate the issuing and awarding of tenders for inter-
national purchases required for the project; and
(e) submit to the Bank reimbursement applications on behalf of
all participating entities, including the Credit Department
of Caja Agraria.
Project Execution
5.06      In order to ensure that the participating agencies would carry out
their assigned tasks for the project, Caja Agraria would enter into Subsidiary
Project Agreements with each of them for the full five years of the project.
If these Agreements were also to cover program operations in Area 4 (CIDA) or
Area 5 (IDB), it would be necessary to distinguish clearly matters relating to
Areas 1, 2 and 3, which would be covered by the proposed Bank project. Detailed
annual programs of work and budgets would be appended to the Subsidiary Project
Agreement prior to the beginning of each financial year. The Agreements would
define responsibilities of the participating agency to:
(a) carry out its part of the annually approved
IRD project with the funds allocated for this purpose;
(b) specify the actions to be involved;
(c) provide staff and services in the amounts and of the
quality required for the project;



- 41 -
(d)  comply with procurement procedures previously agreed to
with external lenders (para 4.28);
(e) comply with disbursement procedures laid down by Caja
Agraria (para 4.29);
(f) maintain uniform separate project accounts (para 4.32);
(g) submit information to Caja Agraria in accordance with the
monitoring and evaluation system adopted for the project
(para 5.16); and
(h) collaborate with the inspection staff of Caja Agraria.
5.07      Caja Agraria would undertake to reimburse the executing agency a
specified percentage of its approved expenditure under the project in accord-
ance with procedures that comply with the requirements of the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit and the external lenders. A separate Subsidiary
Project Agreement, or an additional section to the standard agreement, would
be necessary for ICA, INDERENA and CECORA to cover their participation with
Caja Agraria in the operation of the farm and marketing credit component of
the project. The Subsidiary Project Agreeements with ICA and INDERENA would
establish, among other points, their respective responsibilities for soil
conservation research, advice and works (para 3.12). A condition of effective-
ness would be that the Bank had received copies of signed Subsidiary Project
Agreements between Caja Agraria and ICA, INDERENA, CECORA and SENA which had
been approved by the National Integrated Rural Development Committee, and a
condition of disbursement of each component separately would be that the Bank
had received a copy of the relevant Subsidiary Project Agreement between Caja
Agraria and the participating entity which had also been approved by the
National Integrated Rural Development Committee.
C. Lending Terms and Conditions
5.08      Caja Agraria would not require land as collateral for sub-loans.
Sub-borrowers would instead be identified with specific plots of land for
which they had full user rights, but they would be required not to mortgage
or to sell any of their fixed assets or land without the prior agreement of
Caja Agraria. Sub-loans would be made on the basis of technically sound farm
plans which would include seasonal, semi-permanent and permanent crops (except
coffee), livestock and tree growing and associated equipment and investment
costs, including on-farm storage facilities. Fish ponds would not be included
because the technical and economic feasibility of small-scale fish farming has
not yet been satisfactorily established. Special attention would be given to
developments which would improve family nutrition and health; therefore,
project beneficiaries who had successfully completed two years in the credit
program would be permitted to include in their farm plans the cost of materials
for minor home improvements directly related to sanitation and health.



- 42 -
5.09      Short-term credit would be granted partially to finance the seasonal
costs related to the productive process. Sub-borrowers would be required to
contribute at least the following proportions to the seasonal costs of farm
operations:
first-time sub-borrower under the project       5%
second- and third-time sub-borrower under
the project                                    10%
fourth-time and subsequent borrowing under
the project                                    15%
For medium- and long-term sub-loans, the sub-borrower would contribute at
least 15% of the total cost of the investment. Medium-term credit would
finance the investment costs of permanent or semi-permanent crops (sugarcane,
plantains, fruits, etc.), small livestock species, and minor home improvements.
Long-term credit would finance the costs related to dairy investment, including
on-farm infrastructure, pasture establishment and improvement, purchase of
equipment and dairy stock, some permanent crops and forestry.
5.10     Grace and repayment periods would be flexible, within the limits
shown below, to allow for the different types of farming in the project area.
Similarly, credit amortization would be annual or on a semester basis, depend-
ing of the income stream of the farm plan to be financed. Forestry credit
could be capitalized, and amortization of the sub-loan could be made in one or
two payments, depending on the species of trees to be planted and the farm
investment plan.
5.11     Within one year of loan signing, and annually thereafter during the
commitment period, the Bank would review with the Government and Caja Agraria
the sub-loan terms and conditions, taking into consideration relevant changes
which may have occurred in the national economic situation. An assurance on
this point was obtained during negotiations.
5.12      The proposed lending terms and conditions would be as follows:
(a)  small-scale farmers with gross assets (including assets of
the spouse) not exceeding the equivalent of US$3,000; not
less than 15% per annum on outstanding principal, inclusive
of 1% life insurance premium;
(b)  small-scale farmers with gross assets (including assets of the
spouse) of the equivalent of more than US$3,000, but less than
the equivalent of US$15,000; not less than 19% per annum on
outstanding principal, inclusive of 1% life insurance premium;
(c) a small-scale farmer would not be entitled to borrow under
sub-loans in excess of an amount aggregating the equivalent



- 43 -
of US$9,000; groups of small-scale farmers would be entitled
to borrow under sub-loans up to an amount aggregating the
equivalent of US$9,000 multiplied by the number of members
of the group; and
(d) a marketing association including at least 75% of its members
eligible as small-scale farmers (para 4.06) would pay not less
than 18% per annum on outstanding principal and would be entitled
to borrow under sub-loans up to an amount aggregating the equiva-
lent of US$150,000.
The periods of the sub-loans and the minimum contributions of sub-borrowers
would be according to the following schedule:

establishment                                             15%       9     18
c) Farm produce collection centers and
short-term stores                                         15%      3      10
D. Implementation
Programming and Budgeting
5.13    DNP would prepare annual detailed investment proposals based on field
surveys carried out in 1975 and submissions of the participating entities. As
the project develops, the annual proposals would also take into account the
initial experience gained. Twelve months before the start of each financial
year, DNP would distribute the draft proposals through the Departmental and
Municipal IRD Project Committees to the Committees at community level. Three
months would be allowed for the review of the DNP suggestions, and modifica-
tions may be proposed, provided they are well justified and remain within the
financial allocation for each component.



- 45 -
5.14     During April the joint DNP - Caja Agraria Secretariat of the National
IRDP Committee would revise the program for the following financial year,
taking into consideration the comments received from the IRD Project Com-
mittees in the field. In May the National IRDP Committee would consider the
budget and, when it has been approved, it would be transmitted to the Ministry
of Finance for incorporation into the national budget, which must be presented
to Congress by July 20. The National IRDP Committee would refer to CONPES for
decisions on any matters of new policy or on which it was not able to reach a
decision. The national budget is usually approved by October; the Secretariat
of the National IRDP Committee would then advise the lower level committees of
the detailed program of operations for the financial year commencing January 1
next.
Monitoring and Reports
5.15     Overall Program control would be the responsibility of DNP; however,
Caja Agraria would undertake the detailed supervision of all project compon-
ents through monitoring systems to be established separately with each partici-
pating entity and which would be specified in the Subsidiary Project Agree-
ments to be made between Caja Agraria and each participating agency. Caja
Agraria IRD project staff in the field would report to the Chairman of the
Departmental IRD Project Committee. DNP headquarters would authorize the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to release funds from the approved
budget to the head offices of the participating entities and at the same time
advise the DNP and Caja Agraria Departmental representatives accordingly. Any
delay in the transmittal of funds from the headquarters to field offices would
be noted by the project monitoring staff of Caja Agraria and reported to DNP
headquarters, which would immediately investigate the causes for the delay.
5.16     Each participating entity would have full autonomy to carry out its
responsibilities under the project, and existing satisfactory systems of inter-
nal supervision and control would be maintained. However, Caja Agraria would
have full access to matters relating to the project and would require regular
reports on the physical and financial progress of each project component.
5.17     The Control Division of the IRDP Unit of Caja Agraria would collate
quarterly reports to be sent to the Bank, and half yearly reports for the
National IRDP Committee. It would also provide much of the statistical data
required for evaluating the project (para 5.19).
5.18      The current accounting and auditing procedures within Caja Agraria
do not facilitate the use of its accounts and records as aids for better
management (para 4.33). Changes are necessary, but they can only be intro-
duced gradually in such a large and complex entity. During the course of the
project Caja Agraria would develop a system of data handling and analysis to
improve the control the management has over the various activities of Caja
Agraria, including the Rural Development Department.



- 46 -
Evaluation
5.19      An IRDP Evaluation Group would be set up to carry out a continuing
assessment of the program. The evaluation of the proposed Bank project would
be initiated at its outset and should be continued for at least five years
beyond the investment phase of five years. At first, the main objective would
be to use early experience to make improvements in the project as well as to
prepare a sound foundation for similar activities in other parts of Colombia.
As the project develops it would be necessary to measure the impact of the
project on the standard of living of the target population - the poorest 50%
of the rural inhabitants.  Further details of the monitoring and evaluation
system are to be developed by the Colombian authorities.  Presentation to the
Bank of an acceptable scheme and plan of operations for the evaluation of the
IRDP would be a condition of effectiveness.
Supervision
5.20     Supervision by the Bank would require a considerable input of staff
time (25 man-weeks/year) and careful scheduling to ensure that Bank missions
visit Colombia in May when the budget for the following year would be final-
ized, and in October, when it is expected that an evaluation of the work of
the previous year would be available.
VI.   TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS
A. Farm Production
Farm Advisory Service
6.01      During the first two years of the project, each field agent of ICA
would attend 50 farms or groups of adjoining farms operated in common; the
number to be attended would be raised to 75 in Year 3 and 100 from Year 4 on.
Initially there would be one professional for each five field agents, but
from Year 3 the ratio would be 1:7.
Natural Resources Advisory Service
6.02      For the tree planting scheme, the staffing of INDERENA has been
calculated on the following basis. During the first two years, two visits
a year would be made to each participating farmer, and each sub-professional
forestry assistant would spend, on average, 120 days per year making farm
visits to about three farms a day. The following coefficients have been
used in calculating the production and use of wood:

Farm Credit Operations
6.03      The following rate of incorporation of small-scale farmers into the
credit operations has been used as a basis for the calculation of requirements
for staff, credit and inputs and for the projections of output, training, and
marketing under the project:

Crop Yields and Livestock Production Coefficients
6.04      Current and projected crop yields are shown in Table 6.1 and live-
stock production coefficients are given in Table 6.2. The current values are
based on detailed surveys carried out by ICA in each of the project areas
during 1974 and 1975. These yields and coefficients vary significantly be-
tween project areas and are below the national average values for all Colombian
farms for the period 1970 to 1974. The projected yields and production co-
efficients for the fifth year of participation in the project by a sub-borrower
are approximately 70% of the values actually obtained between 1971 and 1975
on individual small farms in the project areas receiving credit from Caja
Agraria and technical assistance from ICA (para 2.05); in 1975 there were

1,537 small farms in the project areas taking part in this program of super-
vised credit. The farmgate prices in Table 6.3 are indicative of levels
obtained in the main districts of production, within the project areas, of
the respective items during the first half of 1976.
Marketing Advisory Service
6.05      The central telex unit for market price information would comply
with the specifications required by the International Consultative Committee
for Telegraph and Telephones (CCITT) and the communication channels and
teleprinters would be rented by CECORA from the National Telecommunications
Agency (TELECOM).
6.06      Detailed specifications for produce collection stores have been  2
prepared by the Development Department of ICA. The plans are based on 50 m
modular units each with a capacity of about 75 m ton. Cold storage facilities
are shown on the standard plans, but have been excluded from the price calcu-
lations for the proposed project because an adequate chain of cold storage
facilities is not available; with this modification the plans are accep-
table.
Training
6.07      Course outlines have been developed by SENA in collaboration with
other entities participating in the project. These are basically satisfactory
but should be kept regularly under review in the light of experience gained
in the initial years of the project.
B. Social Services
Education
6.08      A set of classroom furniture would consist of tables and chairs for
40 pupils, a desk and chair for the teacher, a chalkboard, a bulletin board
and a card rack. A teaching kit would include a storage cabinet with mate-
rials for "flash cards" for teaching reading, mathematics, science and geo-
graphy. There would also be a terrestial globe, charts, other aids for
teaching arithmetic and manuals on the use of the teaching kits which have
been developed with the aid of a Federal Republic of Germany Education Mission.
Health
6.09      The basic health post design would provide 79 m  with facilities
for attending patients and displaying health and nutrition information, a VHF
radio and also a small flat for the Health Auxiliary on duty. The health
service coverage would be extended to provide ready access for about 80% of
the rural population by year 5 of the project. The coverage would be cal-
culated according to the following coefficients.

1 Sanitation "Promotora"
7 Horses or mules
This unit would serve about 6,000 persons, or almost 1,000 families.  In
addition there would be a four-wheel drive ambulance, with a VHF radio and a
driver for each four Health Service Units, one physician for five units and
a dentist for every six Health Service Units.
Potable Water
6.10      Following existing Colombian design standards, the service life of
the water supply system is 20 years. Sub-projects would be calculated accord-
ing to the Hardy-Cross method to select the most economical pipe network
specifications. The piping would usually be PVC, with a 2-in diameter being
the most common size. Daily per capita water consumption would be assumed at
between 120 1 and 150 1, depending on the local climate; maximum daily use at
120% of average; maximum hourly use at 180% of average; and water storage at
30% of average daily utilization. Construction and management would be
carried out in accordance with well established practices (para 3.26).
C. Infrastructure
Rural Roads
6.11      Specifications for rural roads would be within the ranges shown
below, depending upon the terrain and expected traffic. The maximum axle
load weight would be 8,200 kg; side slopes would not exceed 1:1; cuts of
more than 2.5 m would be designed in steps; culverts of over 8.00 m would
have diameters of at least 0.90 m; side ditches on steep gradients would
not exceed 50 m; longitudinal curves would have a minimum radius of 500 m;
the profile gradient in cuts would be at least 2.5%; and the cross-section
gradient in cuts would be at least 2.0%.

Electrification
6.12      The sub-transmission lines would transmit power at 34.5 kV, which
would be transformed initially to 13.2 kV and finally to 110 or 220 V for
the house connections. It is estimated that the average annual utilization
per household would be 1,800 kWh.
D. Economic and Social Parameters
6.13      National parameters were used to estimate the economic and social
rates of return of the proposed project according to the methodology described
in Bank Staff Working Paper Nos. 194 and 239. These paramaters were calculated
on the basis of mainly macroeconomic data as follows:

VII. PRODUCTION, DEMAND AND MARKETING
A. Production
7.01      The project would support directly, by year 5, farm production and
development activities on some 40,000 small-scale farms occupying about 175,000
ha of agricultural land (average, 4.4 ha/farm). No major change in cropping
pattern is expected, but it is planned to establish 6,560 ha of trees on land
now under scrub and to reduce the proportion in fallow from 28% to 18% of the
area devoted to seasonal crops; this would increase the harvested area by
8,000 ha, from 57,000 ha to 65,000 ha.

B. Demand
7.03      Most of this additional production is expected to be utilized with-
in or close to the project areas (para 2.06) and none would be for the export
market. The increase in quantity would not be sufficient to depress market
prices, but would contribute to meeting the increasing demand for agricultural
products, and thus should check the rise in the prices to consumers. By 1985
the incremental project production could contribute the following proportions
of the projected national market demand for that year.

C.  Value of Incremental Production
7.04      Projections of the value of 4 -Lcremental production of crops were
built up separately fu- each project area using the yield, price and adoption
rate assumptions given in Chapt-er VI. Livestock production values were
calculated for the project as a whole and not by individual areas, because
the accuracy of the livestock census data for minor species does not warrant
the additional calculations. The main conclusions are as follows:
Incremental Value of Farm Production from Project Areas
Year 5       Year 9             Year 5       Year 9
million Col$                      million US$
Crop products               335           674              10.1          20.4
Livestock products          280           392               8.5          11.9

7.05      By year 5 it is expected that the annual incremental farm production
value may be about US$18.6 million, an average of US$465 per participating
farm family, or about US$75 per capita. For the category of farmer eligible
to take part in the proposed project, this would represent approximately a 75%
increase in total annual farm income, including subsistence.

D. Marketable Surplus
7.06      The additional amount of farm products appearing on the market is
not expected to rise as rapidly as is projected for the increase in the volume
produced. Through the provision of adequate seasonal credit, it is hoped
to curtail the practice of forward sales by farmers before harvest to inter-
mediaries to obtain extra-bank credit. At harvest time farmers would be
encouraged to retain the amount of their production required for home con-
sumption by providing credit to construct simple on-farm stores. Currently,
it is common for small farmers to sell all their production at harvest time
and later to purchase their requirements at the local market, often at a
far higher price than that at which they sold their own produce (para 1.17b).
VIII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis
Financial Return in Farm Models
8.01      Nine farm models were analyzed, representing the three project
areas, the three distinct climatic zones (Map IBRD 12202), and farm sizes
ranging from 1.8 ha to 14.0 ha. Various combinations of crops, livestock and
tree planting were considered (Table 8.1), using the production coefficients
and farm prices given in Chapter VI. Under such assumptions, the rates of
return suggest that it would be financially rewarding for farmers to undertake
the investments envisaged in the models. For Area 1, the financial rate of
return ranged between 33% and 43%, which would appear to be attractive even
when paying 19% for borrowed money - 18% interest plus 1% life insurance
premium (Table 8.2). The rates of financial return of all the models appear

to be satisfactory, but the resulting levels of income are modest and, at
full development, producers' income of all the models in Area 1 and Model 2
in, Area 2 (Table 8.3) are still below the poverty level in Colombia (US$148
per capita, 1975). For some models, the financial projections revealed
cash flow difficulties. These cash problems and the level of income at full
development are clear indications that it will be difficult for some small
farmers, given the assumptions of the family size, to raise their per capita
income to above the poverty level unless part of their family income is
derived from off-farm employment.
8.02      Two assumptions were utilized in the sensitivity analysis.  First,
the event most likely to occur would be that the beneficiaries of the project
would not reach the productivity levels indicated in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
Therefore, a test was made assuming that yields would stabilize at the third-
year level, equivalent to an average reduction of output of about 20%. A
second test was made assuming an increase in costs of 5% and a decrease of
farmgate prices of 10%, representing a moderate marketing problem for both
inputs and outputs. The results of the analysis indicate that Model I for
Area 1 shows considerable sensitivity to changes in prices and yields, parti-
cularly yields, since the rate of return of the model fell below the oppor-
tunity cost of capital to the farmer (18%). For the other models, the finan-
cial results remained acceptable and, in general, the situation in Areas 2
and 3 was shown to be more favorable than Area 1, since the farmgate prices
are generally higher because of the proximity of Areas 2 and 3 to the major
markets of Bogota and Medellin, respectively. Details of the rates of return
and sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 8.4.
Beneficiaries' Contribution to Investment
8.03      Beneficiaries' contribution to total project costs would amount to
US$13.2 million (10% of total). Short-term credit for farm operations would
require a minimum contribution of 5% from the sub-borrower in the first year,
increasing to 15% for the fourth year. Medium- and long-term credit for farm
investment, market operations and development would require at least 15% con-
tribution by beneficiaries (para 5.09). For potable water sub-projects, the
communities would be required to contribute at least 15% of the cost of the
water system in labor, materials, or cash. The communities would be required
to contribute 10% of total investment costs for health posts and centers, local
hospitals and rural electrification sub-projects. Assurances on these levels
of contribution were obtained during negotiations.
Cost Recovery and Tariffs
8.04      In Colombia, investment and pricing policies for public services
are important elements of the national strategy for improving income distri-
bution. The rural low-income groups can benefit from these policies only
when they have access to the public services and facilities. An important
effect of the project would be to contribute to improving income distribution
by providing improved services and facilities at a low cost and readily
accessible to the rural population. The directly productive components of the
project - farm and marketing operations and development - would be financed
through a regular credit operation at a low but positive interest rate; there-
fore, they would be fully recovered by Caja Agraria (paras 5.08 to 5.12).

Advisory services for farming, marketing and tree planting would be provided
free although a nominal fee would be charged for the sale of the tree seedlings.
There would be no cost recovery from the training, education and health compo-
nents.
8.05      Potable Water.  Between 40% and 60% of total investment in potable
water would be recovered through INAS. The repayment period and the actual
percentage to be recovered from each sub-project would depend on the capacity
of the respective communities to pay, as determined in each case by a socio
economic study to be carried out by INAS. The interest (6%) and amortization
payments from each sub-project would be held by INAS in individual water scheme
sub-accounts to finance major maintenance expenditures and possibly the further
expansion of the respective water schemes. In a sense, these payments would
not constitute contributions to the capital cost of the initial sub-project,
but would be a form of obligatory savings towards future investments on facili-
ties for potable water in the same community. In addition, the sub-project
beneficiaries would pay a monthly uniform household water tariff, which
was, at the time of the appraisal, about Col$ 35 (US$1.06) per month. This
monthly payment, collected by an employee of the community, covered the costs
of operation, maintenance, and administration, estimated to average Col$ 20
per household; the balance, Col$ 15 per month or Col$ 180 (US$5.45) per year,
contributed to the repayment by the community of the initial investments.
8.06      Electrification.  An initial connection charge equivalent to 10% of
the sub-project investment cost per household would be levied for electrifica-
tion. This fee could be paid by means of a sub-loan administered by Caja
Agraria, using a special fund which is already available for this purpose.
The electricity tariff of Col$ 0.30/kWh (US$0.008/kWh) would cover the cost of
power generation, transmission, overheads and depreciation, which are esti-
mated to total Col$ 0.27/kWh, leaving, therefore, a small contribution of Col$
0.03/kWh towards capital repayment. This tariff structure is appropriate to
the schemes to be financed under the project which are directed preferentially
towards the poorest 50% of the population.
8.07      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the tariffs
for the sale of electrical energy and potable water would be maintained at
levels to yield sufficient revenue to cover all the operating expenses,
including those related to administration, accounting and general expenses,
supply, maintenance and depreciation.
Fiscal Burden
8.08      The implications on the budgets of participating agencies of the
initial phase of the Integrated Rural Development Program, including the
projects to be financed by the Bank, IDB and CIDA, may be summarized as
follows:

ICEL
(Electrification)                                  3.4            0.0
With the notable exception of INAS, the increased budgetary requirements to
provide the necessary counterpart funds are relatively minor. The 36%
increase necessary for INAS is particularly significant because it has been
proposed that this institution would be required to play a major role in
the proposed Nutrition Project which is under consideration by the Bank.
There is no doubt that INAS has the capacity to fulfill its obligations
under the IRDP but further commitments should be carefully examined before
approval.
8.09      Through the implementation of the proposed project, the Government
would be committed to finance annually additional current costs, rising to
almost US$10 million by year 5. About US$8 million/year would continue to
be necessary after the end of the five-year investment period proposed for
the project. The largest individual cost would be for the operation and
maintenance of the health services to be established within the project
areas. While water and electrical power supply schemes would be self-
financing, the following annual current expenditures, including maintenance,
for other components are estimated for year 5 of the project and for subse-
quent years. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that it would take such action, including the provision of funds and

resources to ensure that roads, health and other facilities constructed or

Project Cash Flow
8.10      The project cash inflow would be derived from national budgetary
allocations, the existing resources of Caja Agraria only for credit operations,
the proposed Bank loan, and from the second year, debt service payments by
sub-borrowers to Caja Agraria. In addition, in order to repay the Bank loan,
for which a term of 17 years is proposed, the Government would have to allocate
additional US$1.0 million in year 17. The commitment the Government would make
would be considerably higher since it has stated its intention not to require
Caja Agraria to contribute to servicing the proposed Bank loan using recoveries
from project sub-borrowers (para 3.03). In this case, the Government would
have to service the proposed Bank loan entirely by allocations from the
national budget; the annual amounts required would build up to a maximum of
US$7.6 million by year 6 and then reduce gradually as the loan was repaid.
8.11      The project cash outflow would be concentrated within six years,
building up from US$18.0 million in year 1 to US$31.0 million in year 3
and then rising slightly over the next two years; in year 6, the outflow
would be restricted to the second year disbursement of medium- and long-term
sub-loans approved in year 5, the administrative costs of Caja Agraria, and
the amortization and interest payments on the proposed Bank loan (Table 8.5).

B. Economic Analysis
Economic Justification and Social Benefits
8.12      The project has high priority in the Colombian Government's plan
to meet its development objective of improving the living conditions of the
rural poor. Such improvement could also benefit urban areas if the rate of
migration from the country to the cities declined as rural life became more
attractive. The Government seeks to achieve its objective by increasing the
output on small farms, which would directly increase incomes of small farmers
and indirectly improve the nutritional standards of the rural poor in both
urban and rural areas.
8.13      At full development (year 5), 23% of the small farmers in project
areas are expected to have been incorporated into the supervised credit
component of the project; the expected distribution by size of farm would
be as follows:
Size                              Number of Farms
under 5 ha                           24,000
5 ha to under 10 ha                  12,000
10 ha to under 20 ha                  4,000
Number of families              40,000
Number of beneficiaries
at 6.2 per family            248,000
8.14      At full development, and using 1975 international prices, the value
of the incremental output of crops would be US$22.6 million and that of live-
stock US$12.3 million. Increased production of beef and sugar should lead to
higher exports and help the agricultural sector to continue to play a signif-
icant role in the growth of Colombia's foreign trade, whereas increased
production of wheat and pulses would save foreign exchange by reducing the
amount imported. The net annual foreign exchange savings of the project at
full development would be US$15.4 million. The other commodities produced
by the project are for domestic consumption only and would assist in meeting
the increased demand resulting from increased per capita incomes and improved
nutritional standards.
8.15      During implementation of the project, at least one person from each
of the participating 40,000 farms would attend a course of training to be
conducted by SENA. The classroom furniture and teaching kits would improve
the facilities for at least 100,000 primary school pupils. The improved rural
health service coverage would benefit approximately 1.5 million residents in



- 70 -
the project areas, at least 60% of whom would fall below the annual income
poverty level of US$148 per capita. The rural water schemes would provide
pure water for the first time to 102,000 people and service would be improved
for a further 45,000 people. The provision of pure water would improve rural
health by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases. Rural road improve-
ments would benefit a large, but unspecified, number of persons in the project
areas. Electricity would be provided for 14,335 households, totalling some
90,000 people.
8.16      The number of people benefitting from the project would amount to
approximately 1.5 million, many of whom would, for the first time, have access
to advisory services, credit facilities, markets, training and education
opportunities, health care, and water and electricity delivery systems, all
of which are already available elsewhere in more prosperous parts of the
country.
Economic Rate of Return
8.17      The economic and social analysis was carried out using only the
productive components of the project which included: credit for farm and
marketing operations and development, technical assistance to encourage use
of better farming forestry and marketing techniques, rural road development
and project management. These would account for US$89.4 million, or 82% of
the baseline total project costs (see Table 4.1).
8.18      The rest of the components - education, health, potable water and
electrification (US$20.2 million, or 18% of the baseline total project costs) -
were excluded from the economic analysis since no meaningful rates of return
could be estimated because of the predominance of non-quantifiable effects.
These components would not contribute directly to the productive purposes of
the project, but their inclusion is consistent with the policy of the Govern-
ment to achieve more equitable national income redistribution by increasing
the access of the low income stratum of the rural population to public services
such as education, health, potable water and electricity. The current service
levels and other socio-economic data have been given in paragraphs 2.12 to
2.16 and Table 1.1. The project would improve these services at low cost
(para 6.10) and, in order to reduce wasteful expenditure, would provide
potable water and electrification only at the request and with the active
participation of the local communities. The charges for these services would
be based on conventional rates which have been set at levels reasonably
consistent with a conflicting set of objectives - covering costs, reducing
waste and encouraging the participation of the rural communities.
8.19      The economic and social analysis of the productive components of the
project was carried out using the method referred to in paragraph 6.13 and the
following four sets of assumptions:



- 71 -
(a)  adjusting for import duties and indirect taxes and
using a shadow exchange rate about 20% higher than
the nominal exchange rate and thus a Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.836 gave a rate of
return of                                                          15.8%
(b)  adjusting for import duties and indirect taxes and
using a shadow exchange rate about 10% higher than
the nominal exchange rate gave a rate of return of                  15.0%
(c)  adjusting for import duties and indirect taxes and
using shadow wage rates of 0.7 times the nominal
unskilled rural wage rate and 0.8 times the skilled
wage rate gave a rate of return of                                  16.0%
(d)  using the full set of economic efficiency parameters
(para 6.13) including adjustments for import duties
and indirect taxes in (a) and the shadow wage rates
in (c) gave a rate of return of                                     21.6%
8.20      The second set of assumptions (b) gave only a slightly lower rate
of return than the first set (a) since, although the lower shadow exchange
rate increased costs, it also raised revenues because almost half the output
was valued in domestic prices adjusted by the equivalent Standard Conversion
Factor. The best estimate of the economic rate of return of the productive
components of the project is provided by the last set of assumptions (d) which
gave a result of 21.6% and, at the opportunity cost of capital (9.7%), a net
present value of US$39.2 million. Sensitivity tests showed that:
(a)  if costs increased or benefits dropped by 15% the economic
rate of return would fall to 12.6% and the net present value
would be US$8.3 million; or
(b)  if the rate of adoption of improved practices was 15% less
than currently projected, but reached the same level by
year 10, the economic rate of return would be 14.2% and the
net present value would be US$17.8 million.
8.21      The main emphasis of the project is on providing credit and other
services to farmers with less than 20 ha, and thereby the project should sig-
nificantly improve the living conditions of the rural poor and also improve
income distribution in the project areas. It is projected that at full
development (year 10), 32% of the additional income generated under the proj-
ect would accrue to families currently with annual incomes of less than
Col$ 6,000 (US$182) and 74% would be received by families now earning annually
less than Col$ 20,000 (US$606), equivalent to US$98 per capita. The potential
contribution of the project to savings and income distribution was tested
further using an experimental method of analysis which places preponderant
weights on these objectives. The results of this analysis support the quanti-
tative projections and judgment that the project would be effective in further-
ing these considerations. Thus, the project would be even more attractive than
is indicated by the conventional economic analysis.

Employment Effects
8.22      Employment effects which are accounted for in the social rate of
return would be substantial through the increased opportunities for work
provided by the project. The project's contribution to employment would stem
mainly from the regular work generated at the farm level at full development
but also from the jobs generated during the investment period. At the farm
level, the project would require, annually, an additional 1.3 million man-days
of labor at full development, equivalent to 6,500 full-time jobs. Some 0.3
million man-days, or 20% of this labor, would be provided by members of farm
families while the rest would come from hired labor on a permanent or part-
time basis. In addition, a total requirement of 0.7 million man-days (3,500
full-time jobs) would be created during the five-year investment period by the
other components of the project. The total incremental employment generated
by the project during the five-year investment period would be 4.7 million
man-days.
Environmental Impact
8.23      A portion of the project (4.4%) is directed at improving land and
water management. Particular attention is given to minor soil protection
works, reforestation and water source protection in order to start to tackle
the soil erosion problems which are of increasing severity in many parts of
the project areas. It is recognized, however, that a larger effort beyond
the scope of the proposed project is required in Colombia in order to deal
more effectively with the problems of soil and water conservation. Ferti-
lizers and chemicals for plant and animal protection utilized in the project
would have little or no effect on the local ecology, assuming normal pre-
cautions in their application and considering the localization of their use
and the small area covered by any particular farm participating in the
project.
Constraints, Limitations and Risks
8.24      The functioning of the market system and fluctuations in prices for
farm products present the greatest uncertainties facing the project (para 1.17).
The extent to which members of the target population will take part in the
project will be strongly influenced by their assessment of the potential bene-
fits and apparent risks of participation. These risks have been recognized
during the preparation of the project, which consequently includes special
emphasis on improving the competitive position of the target population.
The Marketing Advisory Service and Market Intelligence Service (para 4.14)
would be particularly important since it is Government policy to limit its
direct intervention in marketing and to encourage the interaction of demand
and supply to determine prices (paras 1.19 to 1.21).
8.25      It is expected that the extent of coordination and collaboration
between the executing agencies would develop during the course of the project
and that this would constitute a benefit of the project, which would be of



- 73 -
permanent and national importance. If, however, the integration between the
agencies is imperfect the several components of the project would still be
of value to the communities, although evidently less effective than has been
projected in preparing the project.
IX. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED ON LOAN CONDITIONS
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points:
(a) Caja Agraria would seek to maintain a liquidity ratio equal
to or greater than unity (para 3.04);
(b) within Minsalud, a unit would be responsible for the execution
of the health component of the project and that adequate pro-
vision would be made to finance the operational and maintenance
costs of the project facilities (para 3.24);
(c) an IRDP Evaluation Group would be organized and maintained for
at least 10 years from the date of loan effectiveness (para 4.04);
(d) before the end of 1977, CECORA would obtain technical assistance,
satisfactory to the Bank, on marketing agricultural output from
the IRDP areas (para 4.14.);
(e) Minsalud, in collaboration with other appropriate agencies,
would prepare and implement specialized rural health care
training for staff, including physicians (para 4.19);
(f) a communications system, acceptable to the Bank, would be estab-
lished between each health post and center, ambulances and the local
hospitals in the project areas (para 4.19);
(g) funds derived from the proposed loan would continue to be
used for rural development credit purposes, after the conclu-
sion of the implementation period, for the life of the project
(para 4.31);
(h) within four months of the close of each fiscal year, the Borrower
would provide the Bank with audited project accounts of Caja
Agraria and each of the participating agencies (para 4.32);
(i) a technical review, acceptable to the Bank, would be conducted
of the existing accounting procedures, information systems
and management controls of Caja Agraria. The results of the
technical review, recommendations for improvement and a
program for their implementation would be submitted to the



- 74 -
Bank within six months of effectiveness and no later than
the second fiscal year from effectiveness any modifications
to the procedures and systems would be implemented (para 4.33);
(j)  the Government would initiate and operate thereafter, a
system of national, departmental, municipal and community
committees satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.02);
(k)  within one year of loan signing, and annually thereafter
during the commitment period, the Government and Caja Agraria
would review with the Bank the terms and conditions of sub-
loans to be made under the project (para 5.11);
(1)  the communities would be required to contribute at least 15%
to the investment cost of potable water sub-projects and at
least 10% to the investment cost of health facilities and
electrification sub-projects (para 8.03);
(m)  the tariffs for the sale of electrical energy and potable
water would be maintained at levels to yield sufficient
revenue to cover all operating expenses, including administ-
ration, accounting and general expenses, supply, maintenance
and depreciation (para 8.07); and
(n)  the Government would take action, including the provision of
funds and resources, to ensure that roads, health and other
facilities constructed or equipped under the project would be
adequately operated, maintained, renewed and repaired (para
8.09).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be that:
(a)  the Bank had received a signed and authorized copy of an agree-
ment between the Government and Caja Agraria concerning the
administration of the project by Caja Agraria (para 5.05);
(b)  the Bank had received copies of Subsidiary Project Agreements
between Caja Agraria and ICA, INDERENA, CECORA and SENA
which had been approved by the National Integrated Rural
Development Committee (para 5.07); and
(c)  an IRDP Evaluation Group had been established (para 4.04) and
an acceptable scheme and plan of operations for the evaluation
of the Integrated Rural Development Program had been presented
to the Bank (para 5.19).
9.05      A condition for disbursement for each component separately would be
that the Bank had received a copy of the relevant Subsidiary Project Agreement
between Caja Agraria and the participating entity which had been approved by
the National Integrated Development Committee (para 5.07).



- 75 -
9.06      With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$52 million for a term of 17 years, includ-
ing a grace period of 3-1/2 years, with interest at 8.7% per annum.
