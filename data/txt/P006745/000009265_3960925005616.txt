INTECRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1352-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report on the Integrated Rural Development
Project in Colombia (Loan 1352-CO), for which a loan of US$52.0 million was
approved in December 1976. The legal documents were signed on January 7,
1977, and the project became effective on August 26, 1977. The original
Closing Date for the loan was December 31, 1982. Two extensions were granted
and the final Closing Date was September 30, 1984. However, disbursements
were authorized through May 1985. Almost the full US$52.0 million of the
loan was disbursed and an amount of US$42,031 was cancelled on May 20, 1985.
As part of a major Government initiative to improve living condi-
tions in rural areas as well as the quality of nutrition, the Integrated
Rural Development Prcgram (DRI) and the Nati(Aal Food ane Nutrition Plan
(PAN) were created. In this framework, the project was the first Integrated
Rural Development Project in Colombia. It focused on improving the income of
about 40,000 farmers with less than 20 ha and the living conditions of about
150,000 rural inhabitants of some of the poorest areas in three regions of
the Andes. The emphasis of this project was to (i) increase farm incomes
throug) technical assistance, training, credit and marketing services;
(ii) improve infrastructure: roads, electric power and water supply; and
(iii) improve social infrastructure, in particular education and health
services.
This report was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in
February 1986 and Completion Reports prepared by the Ministry of
Agriculture's Directorate General for the DRI/PAN program (DRI/PAN), deli-
vered to the Bank on October 10, 1985 and one by Caja delivered to the Bank
on August 8, 1985. Other sources of information for the Completion Report
were: the Appraisal Report No. 1212-CO dated November 12, 1976; the Project
Loan Agreement dated January 7, 1977; a 1984 project completion survey in a
sample area in the Bank's No. 3 project region, Antioquia, entitled:
"Evaluation of the Socio-economic Impact in the District of Rionegro" by the
Center for Economic Investigations (CIE) of the University of Antioquia,
contracted by the project management; supervision reports; correspondence
with the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda as contained in relevant Bank
files.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments.
No comments have been received.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1352-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Objectives
This was the first Integrated Rural Development Project in Colombia
and its objectives were: (a) to raise incomes of small farmers through
increased yields and intensified land use with programs of supervised credit,
technical assistance, training and marketing; and (b) to improve rural living
conditions through the construction of ! .frastructure, such as roads,
electric power connections, and piped water supply and through the increase
of primary health and education services and facilities (para. 2.03)
Implementation Experience
During the first five years of implementation, the project benefit-
ted from a strong centralized project management in a special unit of the
National Planning Department, DNP (para. 3.34). There was political support
for the project at the highest Government level and sufficient counterpart
funds were made available. However, the absence of a project revolving fund
created problems 'ecause Colombian law does not allow funds to be advanced if
they will subsequently be reimbursed by an external financing agency
(paras. 3.30-3.31). A major effort was required to coordinate the work of
the participating agencies and to promote the participation of the target
population. To this end, a tier of committees was set up, from the national,
departmental, and municipal level down to the village level. As it turned
out, the village level committees could only be sustained with the help of
outside support, and once the targets for communal services were achieved,
these committees disintegrated (para. 3.35).
The agencies with the most widespread representation in the
countryside--such as the credit institution (Caja), the extension service
(ICA) and the training service (SENA)--were among the best performers with a
strong consensus on the purpose of the project. As a result, the project was
successful in improving farwers' income. Other agencies that performed well
were those in charge of rural roads construction and electrification. The
success of the water supply and education components was modest, while the
reforestation, marketing and health components were unsuccessful. This, how-
ever, does not appear to have had a negative impact on the project overall.
(paras. 4.01-4.04)
Project administration and monitoring of data were entrusted to
Caja, because of its network of offices in the project area. The stream of
data, collected by Caja, was effective in alerting DNP's project management
to deficiencies in project execution (para. 3.37). Evaluation was entrusted



v 
to a special evaluation unit that was part of DNP's project management.
However, this unit never developed as an analytical tool to continuously
evaluate the project's impact, probably because the project management was
overwhelmed by the task of day-to-day cont,ol of the activities of the
participating agencies. Therefore, the project management subcontracted
evaluation on the basis of two surveys, in 1979 and 1984, in the same sample
area (paras. 3.38-3.4G).
Starting in 1981, the country experienced a deteriorating financial
situation because the coffee bonanza of the late 1970s had come to an end
(para. 1.01). As a result, budgetary constraints during the latter part of
the implementation period had a negative impact on the availability of
counterpart funds for project implementation, on staffing, and on the
operation and maintenance of newly constructed facilities. In spite of this,
the major effort, which had taken place before the financial problems
started, had already made a positive impact (paras. 3.07 and 3.30-3.31).
Processing of disbursement requests and subsequent movement of
disbursed funds back to the executing agencies was very slow, due to
complicated administrative procedures. The process between expenditure and
receipt of funds on average required eleven months. The participating
agencies were too slow and too late with the procurement of motorcycles and
vehicles. This resulted in partial immobilization of the very large number
of field staff during the early years of the project (paras. 3.30-3.31).
After 1981, the project management in DNP acquired the additional
responsibility of administering the National Food and Nutrition Plan. The
task of administering projects became too large for a policy making authority
such as the National Planning Agency and in October 1983, project management
was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture (para. 3.36). This change
resulted in delays in project execution. The project was completed on
September 30, 1984, or 21 months later than the original Closing Date of
December 31, 1982 (para. 3.03).
Results
The project's economic rate of return was 16% against an appraisal
estimate of 22%. The average financial rate of return was 23% against an
appraisal estimate of 57%. Average annul family income from farming
improved from C$ 164,000 before the project to C$ 381,000 after the project,
compared with a poverty level of C$ 299,000. Fallow was reduced, yields
increased and in particular livestock operations were promoted, so that milk
production increased by 700%. This was not only due to project activities,
but also to a liberalization of the price of milk. Overall, the value of
production increased from US$56 million to US$104 million for crops, and from
US$6 million to US$43 million for meat and milk. The introduction of easier
credit terms to farmers who often had unclear titles to land and to those who
rented land broke the hold of non-institutional money lenders, who used to
prefinance the harvest. Thus, farmers were free to sell their products in a
competitive market, and this probably offset the fa'lure of the project's
marketing component (paras. 6.04-6.05).

Sustainability
Prospects for sustainability of project benefits appear to be
good. There is a renewed policy emphasis in Colombia on assistance to small
farmers by agriculture public sector agencies and other Government agencies
dealing with infrastructure and social services. Budget support for the DRI
program nationwide has been substantially increased in 1987, and the status
of the Program Administration Unit has been upgraded to that of a
semi-autonomous agency, the Fondo DRI, with correspondingly increased
decision-making authority. Provision of credit to small farmers through Caja
Agraria would also be made more efficient through a proposed Bank project
that seeks to rationalize that agency's organization and management. Thus it
can be expected that project beneficiaries will continue to receive adequate
production support and other services in the foreseeable future.
Findings and Lessons
The lessons learned from this project are that complex integrated
rural development projects can be successful, provided that they are
supported at the highest political level and that they are executed by
individual agencies of proven institutional strength under a strong
centralized management. On the other hand, such projects are not the
appropriate mechanism for the institutional improvement of weak agencies.
Tae project could have benefitted from an early focus on a few profitable
agricultural farm investment options, rather than a broad approach under
which all possibilities were investigated. The project was overly complex:
it would have been better to concentrate initial efforts on improving
farmers' income and improving social amenities as a second step. It was
fortunate that those components required to improve farm incomes, such as
credit, technical assistance, training and roads, were executed by competent
agencies (para. 7.02).



COLOMBIA
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1352-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At project appraisal in February 1976, Colombia's GNP per capita
was US$554. The agricultural sector was the most important of the economy,
accounting for 37% of employment, 27% of GDP and 59% of the value of all
registered merchandise exports. Coffee, grown in the Andes by small and
medium size farmers, accounted for 62% of all agricultural exports. Other
major export crops in 1976 were sugar, cotton, rice and bananas. The total
population was about 24.5 million, and the rural population numbered nine
million. About 63% of the rural population had incomes below the relative
poverty level as defined by the Bank of US$148 per capita., The Government's
agricultural development strategy was to reduce disparities between rural and
urban incomes and living conditions, while facilitating the transition of
some of the rural population to industrial and commercial activities. The
vehicle for this transformation was the Tntegrated Rural Development Program
(IRDP) coupled with the National Food and Nutrition Plan (PAN) which sought
to improve nutritional conditions, in particular of small children and
nursing mothers. Colombia's first attempt in integrated rural development
coincided with a similar movement in the Bank, following Mr. McNamara's
Nairobi speech of 1973.
1.02      Over the past ten years, some changes have occurred in the struc-
ture of the economy: agriculture still is the most important sector of the
economy, slowly decreasing to about 25% of employment and 22% of GNP, but
increasing its share in the country's total registered merchandise exports to
70%. Of the total value of agricultural exports of US$2 billion in 1983,
coffee accounted for 73%, followed by bananas (7%) and flowers (6%), a marked
change compared with 1976. Food imports account for 7.5% of total registered
imports. The population is now about 27.5 million, and the most recent Bank
estimate of GNP per capita is US$1,430 (1983). From 1977 through 1979 the
country experienced a coffee bonanza, followed by a period of economic diffi-
culties between 1981 and 1984, resulting in a shortage of public resources.
Due to severe drought in Brazil in 1985, coffee prices again increased signi-
ficantly. The rate of growth f agricultural production was about 4% in the
seventies, but fell to 1.3% in the early eighties. The Government is now
giving priority to prt~jects that would reduce the violence in the coutryside
(Peace Plan) and others that would make more efficient use of existing infra-
structure. Subsequent to this project, the Bank has financed nine projects
in the agricultural sector: the Second Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 1357-CO) completed in January 1985; the Third Agricultural Credit Proj-
ect (Loan 1737-CO); the Irrigation Rehabilitation I Project (Loan 1996-CO);
the Upper Magdalena Watershed Management Project (Loan 2069-CO); the Integra-
ted Rural Development II Project (Loan 2174-CO); the Agricultural Research



and Extension Project (Loan 2303-CO); the Agricultural Diversification Proj-
ect (Loan 2453-CO); the Irrigation Rehabilitation II Project (Loan 2667-CO);
and the Trade and Agricultural Policy Project (Loan 2677-CO).
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The project was identified in September 1973 by an FAO/CP mission.
Due to the great complexity of the project, five additional FAO/CP and two
Bank preparation missions were required during 1974 and 1975, and preparation
was completed in November 1975. The project was appraised in February 1976
by a mission consisting of 13 persons.
B. Negotiations and Board Presentation
2.02      Loan negotiations took place in Bogota, Colombia, from September 16
to 21, 1976.  The Loan was approved by the Boare on December 23, 1976.  Dis-
cussions emphasized the rnecessity of local cost financing for rural develop-
ment, given the minor foreign eAchange component of such projects.
C. Project Objectives and Components
Objectives
2.03      The objectives of the project were: (a) to raise incomes of small
farmers (less than 20 ha) through increased yields and intensified land use
with programs of supervised credit, technical assistance, training and
marketing; (b) to improve rural living conditions through the construction of
infrastructure, such as roads, electric power connections, and piped water
supply and through the increase of primary health and education services and
facilities.
2.04      The project was part of a US$250 million national program of rural
development in five impoverished regions, with a high concentration of very
low income farmers uith small landholdings, often without title. The Bank
financed the program in three mountainous regions in Narino, Cauca,
Cundinamarca and Antioqula, while an IDB loan of US$65 million financed an
area in Boyaca and Santander and a CIDA loan of US$13 million, an area in
Cordoba and Sucre. About 21% of the farmers with less than 20 ha in the pro-
gram area, or a total of 92,000, would benefit from the credit and technical
assistance program. This number is about 9% of all such farmers nationwide.
Direet beneficiaries in the Bank-financed area were to total 40,000. Water
supply and power connections in the Bank area would benefit 23,700 and i4,300
families, respectively.
Components
2.05      The project included the following components (percentages of base-
line costs are given in parentheses):
-    Seasonal, medium- and long-term agricultural credit (49%);
-    Production support, including forestry advisory service (19%);
-    Marketing operations and development (3%);



Infrastructure: roadts, power (12%).
Social services: education, health, water supply (14%):
Project management (3%);
D. Project Cost and Financing
2.06      At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at US$131.0 million,
of which the Bank was to contribute US$52.0 million (40%) to cover the fo-
reign exchange costs of US$27.6 million and US$24.4 million of local currency
costs. The Government was to cortribute US$65.9 million (50%); and benefi-
ciaries the remaining US$13.1 million (10%).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      This chapter compares actual performance with the targets estab-
lished at appraisal, including an analysis of implementation of the different
components, assessment of project costs, disbursements, procurement, report-
ing and auditing, monitoring and evaluation, and compliance with loan cove-
nants. Annex i presents a table of Key Indicators.
A. Implementation Schedule
3.02      The loan became effective on August 26, 1977, eight months after
Board approval. An organizational structure was already in place and the
project had started on a small scale in 1976. The delay between Board appro-
val and effectiveness was caused by the work involved in finalizing project
agreements between the ten executing agencies and Caja Agraria (Caja) en-
trusted with the general administration of the program.
3.03      The appraisal projected project completion in five years, with
December 31, 1982 as closing date.  Completion was delayed by twen v-one
months, because: (a) the implementation period assumed was too short for such
a complex project; (b) there was a shortage of counterpart funds after 1980,
which was exacerbated by complicated Government disbursement procedures which
delayed the flow of funds for field activities of the executing agencies; and
(c) because lack of transportation facilities partially immobilized field
staff during the early project years.
B. Implementation of Project Components
Agricultural Credit
3.04      The project was to finance seasonal, medium and long-term credit to
about 40,000 beneficiary farm families, in addition to credit for cooperative
marketing groups, home improvements after the third year, and on-farm refo-
restation. A number of 38,563 farmers received subloans, or 96% of the
target. The credit program, slightly adjusted upwards for pre-effectiveness
lending during 1976, was to lend a nominal C$ 2,330 million over the imple-
mentation period for farming activities on 175,000 ha. An amount of
C$ 6,616 million was lent for 147,452 ha, representing 284% and 84% of the
SAR program, respectively. However, of the C$ 6,616 million total credit,
C$ 4,343 million (66%) came from reinvestment of credit. The balance of
C$2,273 million, (98% of the modified SAR target of C$ 2,330 million) was
partially financed by the Bank. The percentage of arrears (more than one



- 4 -
year) amounted to only 5.8% of the amount of outstanding loans through 1983,
but increased to 8.3% in 1984, due to a drop in the price of potatoes, coffee
and panela,1/ all products of major importance. According to the CIE sur-
vey, most of the arrears were attributable to the smallest class of farmers
(O - 1 ha), who over-extended themselves through investments such as for
housing improvements and power connections. In general, the larger the farm
sizes, the lower the percentage of DRI credit used for non-productive pur-
poses:
Diatribution of DRI Credits According to
Farm Size and Purpose
0-1 ha   1-3       3-5      5-10    10-20    20 ha
Agriculture, Livestock        49%      80%      82%       86%       95%      97%
Home Improvement, Power       51%      20%      18%       14%        5%       3%
3.05      The Bank financed C$ 1,133.5 million (US$22.7 million), or 50% of
the original credit amount of C$ 2,273 million. This was 100% of the cate-
gory in the Loan Agreement. Of the total credit, 52% was for agriculture,
35% for livestock and 13% for other purposes, mainly consisting of electrifi-
cation, water supply and home improvement.
3.06      The implementation of the credit component was one of the success-
ful cornerstones of the project, together with the tecnnical assistance and
training components. One of the three most important effects was that it
permitted beneficiaries to take quick advantage of the increased potential
benefits from livestock farming when the Government liberalized the milk
prices in 1979. The second major benefit was that it replaced the farmers'
traditional need of forward sales before harvest to non-institutional money
lenders. Thus, the credit component liberated the farmers from a lien on
their harvest, mak'ag it possible to sell under competitive marketing condi-
tions. According to the CIE survey, direct project beneficiaries obtained
65% of their financing needs from Caja, 33% from their own resources and 2%
from other lending sources. This contrasts with the average for all farmers
in the survey, who covered 38% of their financing needs from Caja, 55% from
their own resources and 7% from other lending sources. The third important
effect of the credit component, combined with ICA's technical assistance and
SENA's training, was that it stimulated the use of, and dependency on, credit
for productive and other needs. The active DRI beneficiaries took out more
credit than other farmers. To assume credit implies risk, and this risk was
smaller among DRI farmers because they had a larger percentage of productive
land, a higher value of assets and larger net incomes than the other
farmers.
3.07      During the implementation period, interest rates and credit
ceilings were adjusted to meet the following externalities:
(a) increases in Caja's non-DRI interest rates;
1/   Unrefined sugar, a Colombian staple.



(b) a speculative increase in land prices, which increased farmers'
assets without a commensurate increase in farmers' income from
agriculture; and
(c) increases in farm production costs.
During early project execution, the following problems surfaced and began
causing delays:
(a) inadequate familiarization of ICA extension staff with Caja's
credit manual;
(b)  the time-consuming requirtient that credit officials visit farms
before credit approval;
(c) separate processing of credit applications for different purposes
from a single farmer instead of consolidating them;
(d) CaJa's insistence (although not supposedly permitted under the DRI
program) to link credit to the purchase of inputs from Caja's waie-
houses, when cheaper inputs could be obtained from other suppliers;
(e)  CaJa's sometime insistence that farmers with rented land first
obtain a guarantor for the proposed loan;
(f)  Caja's application after 1980 of much stricter loan conditions for
credit financed from repaid subloans, which was erroneously assumed
not to be subject to the more lenient conditions under the DRI pro-
gram.  This involved, in particular, the conditionality for land
title. Since many farmers have no title--unsettled inheritances,
sharecropping and other rental arrangements--many farmers, who had
had earlier access to the original DRI funds, were cut off from
using reinvested funds. Under the Bank's insistence, these strict
rules were rescinded in June 1983;
(g) the necessity for Caja to execute the credit component with its own
resources in the beginning of the program, because of the lack of
legal arrangements to transfer external resources to Caja; and
(h) liquidity problems in Caja which stopped credit for DRI benefi-
ciaries during the first part of 1984.
Production Support Services
3.08      Technical Assistance.  This was provided mostly by the Colombian
Agricultural Institute, ICA, but in AntioquiA and Cauca also to some extent
by the departmental secretariats of Agriculture. The early project years,
during the coffee bonanza, showed the greatest increase in farmers' partici-
pation in the DRI program as shown below:
Year             1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1983   1984
No. of New
Beneficiaries  2,934  3,541  6,464  8,392  5,882  4,334  2,931  1,950  2,135
The 2,816 crop adaptation units were eight times the 354 expected at ap-
praisal, and the 3,115 demonstration plots were vastly more than the 232
expected at appraisal. The number of farmers per extension agent ranged
between 78 and 114, while the appraisal foresaw an increase in the early
years from 50 to a final ratio of 100 farmers per extension agent. The
number of professional staff employed wa3 88 and lower staff 397, correspond-
ing to 78% and 83%, respectively, of what was foreseen at appraisal.



3.09      The extension efforts were successful in increasing production, not
only through increases in yields, but also in increasing the productive area
per farm, as shown below for the CIE survey area:
Land Use (% of farm area)
Total
Crops      Livestock       No Use     Productive
1976  1984   1976  1984   1976  1984   1976  1984
DRI Beneficiaries        44%   47%    23%   36%    33%   17%    67%   83%
The liberalization of the milk prices in 1979 contributed to the great in-
crease in livestock operations. Farmers in particular appreciated the tech-
nical assistance for livesto:k, because for many this was a new activity in
which they had no experience.
3.10      Another result of the technical assistance was the reduction in the
area under traditional intercropping, except for the maize/beans combina-
tion, since much higher yields were demonstrated through mono-cultivation.
During project implementation, labor costs increased more than other costs.
This did not lead to an increase in mechanization--difficult in the steep
terrain--but to an increase in sharecropping arrangements that proved detri-
mental to an easy access to credit.
3.11      There is some doubt as to whether the large increases in adaptation
and demonstration plots were necessary, although the SAR estimates were too
low given the diversity in climate, soil conditions and in traditional farm-
ing practices. But, it seems ICA tried to investigate almost every possibi-
lity, rather than concentrating on the most promising lines of farming activ-
ity. Belatedly, the DRI directorate in 1983 introduced "district plans"
under which DRI would concentrate its activities on promoting the tl'ree or
four crops in each district with marketable surpluses.
3.12      In spite of ICA's efforts, the CIE survey revealed that, of all
possible losses in farm income, farmers considered plagues (insects and
diseases) as the major threat. This would point to either a gap in the
extension effort or a lack on the farmers' side of applying the technology
learned. However well trained in agriculture, ICA staff was poorly trained
to translate recommended farm practices into increased net benefits to the
farmer. This vacuum was partially compensated through the National Appren-
ticeship Service's (SENA) training efforts. Nevertheless, the extension ef-
fort contributed to a highly satisfactory increase in production and farmers'
income.
3.13      A major problem which plagued ICA and all other agencies with large
field etaffs throughout the project, was lack of transportation. Tendering
for vehicles was still taking place in 1981, the fifth year of implementa-
tion.
3.14      Training.  SENA provided program induction courses to 59,364 farm-
ers, about 150% of the target. In addition, it provided technical courses to
124,288 farmers or aoout 300% of the SAR estimate. SENA provided courses for
induction into the DRI program to 3,454 staff of participating agencies or
84% of the SAR estimate. Only 1,657 participants from other agencies, or 19%



- 7 -
of the SAR estimate, attended SENA's technical courses, since such staff were
not encouraged to participate. Overall, SENA's efforts were successful in
raising the level of farm management among the beneficiaries.
3.15      Natural Resources.  The 9 million tree seedlings produced, was only
32Z of the appraisal estimate. The area planted was 4,610 ha or 61% of the
7,600 foreseen at appraisal. INDERENA, in charge of the program, was unpre-
pared to deal with small farmers and to prepare credit requests, the result
being that the area reforested with subloans was 2,210 ha or 50% of the
appraisal estimate. Overall, the forestry component was not successful.
However, INDERENA did provide technical assistance for the construction of
654 farm fish ponds that were not planned at the time of appraisal.
Marketing
3.16      The SAR project concept had identified marketing problems as a
major bottleneck. It was assumed that the creation of farmers' marketing
organizations would be the solution and the Union of Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives, Cecora, was entrusted with this task. Cecora organized market-
ing groups, but the number of members amounted only to 1,174 or 2% of the
appraisal estimate of 55,000. The production marketed through these groups
was 63,766 tons or three times the appraisal estimate of 20,210 tons. The
subloans for this component amounted to C$ 25 million or 18% of the appraisal
estimate. The proposed price information services with telex networks were
never realized. Cecora suffered from major administrative and financial
problems and coordinated poorly with other DRI agencies. At the erd of the
project, Cecora had virtually ceased its contribution to the program.
Without Cecora's assistance, the farmers marketing groups disintegrated, but
were left with their debts.
3.17      The execution of the marketing component through the organization
of farmer groups was a costly failure and yet the DRI project as a whole was
successful. It is plausible that the management training, the breaking of
the pre-harvest financing stranglehold by intermediaries through increased
use of credit under easier conditions, the construction of roads and external
economic conditions (higher milk prices) more than offset the failure to
organize the marketing grou- . The CIE survey indicated that only 11% of the
farmers perceived marketing as a major problem, in spite of the fact that
over 80% of the production was commercialized.
Infrastructure
3.18      Roads.  The roads program, executed by the National Fund for Rural
Roads, Cavecinales, completed 430 km of new roads and improved 217 km of
existing roads, a total of 647 km, or 93% of the appraisal estimate of
694 km. The actual cost amounted to C$ 1.89 million (US$33,300) per km, or
281% (in dollar terms) of the appraisal estimate of C$ 0.39 million
(US$11,850) per km. Roads were important to the technical assistance and
training components, and for getting inputs in and production out. The major
problem with the roads' component is the lack of maintenance.
3.19      Electrification.  The electrification program was executed by the
departmental power companies under supervision of the Colombian Institute for



- 8 -
Electric Power, ICEL, which provided the designs and supplied the construc-
tion materials. A total of 1,747 km of transmission lines was constructed,
or 152% of the target of 1,153 km. The latter figure was an increase over
the appraisal target of 829 km, because during project execution the depart-
ments of Antioquia and Cundinamarca were included in the program. The number
of house connections was 15,276, or 107% of the appraisal target and the
number of transformers 913, or 211% of the appraisal target. The increase in
the number of transformers was required because the existing medium tension
lines were unable to take the increased load.
3.20      The cost of a house connection amounted to C$ 29,622 (US$522) or
140% in dollar terms of the appraisal cost of C$ 12,319 (US$373). Farmers
were supposed to contribute 15% to the cost of power installation, equivalent
8 to 72 times the minimum daily wage, indexed every month for inflation. In
addition came the service tariffs, also indexed, which were still not enough
to cover the real cost per kwh. For the rural population without a regular
and indexed source of income, these contributions became unsustainable in
Antioquia, and it was therefore decided to change from the departmental power
company to the municipal one from Medellin which charged one peso less
per kwh.
3.21      In spite of the high cost of power, the CIE survey revealed that in
the Rionegro sample area, by the end of the program, 70% of the houses had
electricity. Farmers ranked power supply second only to production increases
in their evaluation of the program (Annex 2). A major improvement from the
electrification program was the change to electric cooking from using fire-
wood.
Social Services
3.22      Wuter Supply.  This component was executed by the National Insti-
tute of Health, INS. It installed, or completed, 204 systems, or 82% of the
248 foreseen to serve a population of 135,212, or 92% of the SAR target of
147,000. Although close to the target and, therefore, appearing successful,
few, if any, of the installed systems have chlorination and the quality of
operation and maintenance is very poor. The benefit of distributing untreat-
ed water from surface supplies through pipes seems questionable. The cost
per house connection was C$ 31,196 (US$550) or 252% of the appraisal estimate
(in dollar terms) of C$ 7,208 or US$218.
3.23      Health.  The Ministry of Public Health, MinSalud, was responsible
for: constructing and equipping 75 new health posts, restructuring and
improving 26 existing health posts and 8 health centers and 17 local hospi-
tals. A total of 246 existing and new posts and centers were to have been
the focus for health teams consisting of about six health visitors
(promotoras) and two auxiliaries. The project further was to provide 64
ambulances, (later reduced to 23) health and nutrition training for 1,500
promotoras and 500 auxiliaries. Special training was to be provided for
staff, including physicians, and a VHF communication system was to be estab-
lished to operate among all health posts, centers, ambulances and hospitals
in the project areas.
3.24      The execution of the health component was a failure.  Of the health
posts and centers, 68 were constructed or renovated (62% of the SAR target);



- 9 -
48, or 20%, of the 246 health posts were operational, and oaly with reduced
staff; 504, or 25%, of the 2,000 health visitors and auxiliaries were
trained; no ambulances were bought; and no VHF, or other communication
systems, were installed. Only the rural hospitals were well equipped. One
new hospital was constructed although the Bank did not agree to finance it.
Most of the newly constructed health posts were not used, since MinSalud's
budget and pay scale did not permit hiring of the necessary staff.
3.25      From the CIE survey, it becomes clear that the only serious health
function in the field is provided by the promotoras, who spend 98% of their
time providing vaccinations and thus are responsible for 66% of all vaccina-
tions farm families receive. The normal pattern for farmers needing medical
help, is to go directly to the rural or regional hospitals and, to some
degree, to private doctors. The health posts and centers are bypassed and
the hospitals waste the physicians' time in providing health services which
could easily be provided by para-medical personnel at a lower echelon. The
question remains whether the proposed system would have been more cost-
effective than MinSalud's preference for hospitals. Given the difficulties
in attracting and maintaining staff to work in the health posts together with
the difficulty of providing sufficient operation and maintenance budget, it
may well be that these systematic problems require policy changes at the
national level that can only be effected through special operations.
3.26      Education.  The project was to finance the purchase of furniture
for 2,300 existing classrooms plus 3,800 teaching aid kits. The Colombian
Institute for School buildings, ICCE, distributed 1,276 sets of furniture, or
56% of the SAR target and 3,263 teaching kits, or 86% of the SAR target. In
1979, during a revision of appraisal targets, the construction of 69,500 m2
for new and existing schools was added; in fact only 38,200 m2, or 49% of the
target, were executed.
3.27      The Ministry of Education, MINED was to train 11,700 primary school
teachers in the use of the newly developed teaching kits. Actually, 7,238
teachers, or 62%, received such training. Overall, the success of the edu-
cation component was modest.
C. Cost Estimate
3.28      The total cost at completion is estimated at about US$146.7 million
equivalent, compared to an appraisal estimate of US$131.0 million. Except
for project management, health, water supply and electrification, where the
actual cost is virtually the same, credit and the natural resources advisory
service were lower than estimated. This was so because credit started recy-
cling earlier during implementation and the national resources advisory
service did not accomplish its task to stimulate farmers to plant trees and
because the agency lacked administrative capacity. The increases in the
other components were financed from the transfer of funds from the unallo-
cated category and from additional Government financing, in particular for
the technical assistance component. The roads and water supply components
suffered from major unit cost increases. The following table presents the
actual and estimated cost at appraisal.

3.30      By December 31, 1982, the original closing date, US$43.1 million,
or 83% of the loan had been disbursed, and it took 29 more months to disburse
the remaining 17% of the loan. There were major problems and delays in the
disbursement process. Many executing agencies were unfamiliar with Bank pro-
cedures. Preparation, submission and receipt of disbursements followed a
most complicated process, first within the agencies themselves and then from
the agency through Caja and the DRI management to the Ministry of Finance.
The reverse process of distributing disbursed amounts back to the agencies,
followed the same process. The average time lapse between preparation of a
disbursement application and the agency receiving the funds, was 326 days
(average of 65 disbursement applications). The shortest time for the cycle
was 235 days and the longest, 446 days.
E. Procurement
3.31      Procurement of vehicles and equipment was slow, resulting in immo-
bilization of field staff during the early years of the project. A major fi-
nancing problem was that Colombian law only permits counterpart funds to be
included in the budget, and not the advance needed to cover the Bank's part
of the financing, which subsequently is reimbursed. The higher the disburse-
ment percentage, the more serious the problem became. This problem has re-
cently been overcome through the creation of revolving funds (project and
special accounts) in which both Government and the Bank deposit money up
front.
F. Reporting
3.32      Each agency was to provide semi-annual reports and forward them to
the central project administration which was located in a specially created
branch of Caja Agraria. Caja, in turn, produced semi-annual reports on the
basis of its own activities plus the documents received from the participa-
ting agencies. Caja's report and the individual reports were supposed to be
reviewed by the overall DRI management unit in DNP. Many agencies were late
and deficient in their reporting and needed continuous prodding. As a re-
sult, semi-annual reports were consistently six to nine months late. Caja's
reports were, in general, satisfactory although they lacked an evaluative, or
qualitative, judgment.
G. Audititg
3.33      For all participating agencies, the Controller General of the
Republic is the designated auditing agency, except for Caja Agraria, whose
audit is performed by the National Superintendency of Banks (Superintendencia
Bancaria). In general, financial statements were submitted late to the
Conttzller General, who in turn needed about four months to perform the
audits. Many financial reports were deficient: in 1982 five out of ten par-
ticipating agencies received negative or heavily qualified opinions. Caja's
audit reports were received up to 1-1/2 years after the close of its fiscal
year and over most years it received a negative opinion from the Superinten-
dencia. For the last project year, 1984, the audits of ICCE (School cons-
truction), INS (water supply), ICEL (electrification) and INDERENA (environ-
ment) were qualified, while Cavecinales (roads) and ICA (technical assist-
ance) received disclaimers.

H. Organization, Monitoring and Evaluation
Organization
3.34      The original organizational structure was that each semi-autonomous
agency was responsible for the execution of its own segment of the program,
while a separate administrative unit in Caja was responsible for operational
coordination of all activities and the collection of progress data of the
project. The overall management, programming and budgeting functions were
entrusted to a specially created unit in the National Planning Department.
The programs and budgets of the individual agencies were reviewed by DNP/DRI
at the national level and then went down through departmental and municipal
committees to the community committees. At each level, the committees con-
sisted of representatives of all agencies.
3.35      At the lowest level this system guaranteed the participation of the
target population. At the community level, Caja, ICA and SENA, with the
largest presence in the field, were the leading forces to organize and stimu-
late the committees. The beneficiary participants in the community commit-
tees were mostly interested in procuring infrastructure for their communi-
ties. Once this target was achieved, the beneficiaries' interest waned, and
without the presence of Caja, SENA or ICA staff, the community committees
disintegrated, with no apparent detriment to the project.
3.36      In 1981, the management of the National Food and Nutritional Plan
(PAN) was merged with the DNP/DRI management which now became DNP/DRI/PAN.
This meant that DNP's DRI/PAN directorate had more employees than the remain-
der of the National Planning Department. The need arose for the DNP to
divest itself from the responsibility of managing such complicated projects,
or any projects for that matter, and on October 13, 1983, the Government
decided to move the DRI/PAN management to the Ministry of Agriculture.
Monitoring
3.37      Caja's function was to collect and process data on the physical and
financial progress from all participating agencies. However, DNP had set up
its own additional monitoring unit to analyze the Caja data and to draw
attention to critical points. The monitoring system functioned well in
alerting project management to deficiencies and bottlenecks in project
execution.
Evaluation
3.38      The function to evaluate the data monitored by Caja was entrusted
to DNP/DRI's original management unit. In reality, the management of such a
complex project was overwhelmed by the task of controlling the activities of
all participating agencies and there w8as little time for quality-oriented
evaluation. The Bank had early on insisted on the necessity to establish an
evaluation unit, but given the priority task of just managing the project,
DNP gave the evaluati\n function too little attention.
3.39      The first contracted evaluation effort on a sample area in the
Rionegro district in Antioquia, took place in 1978. Near project completion,



- 13 -
in 1984, a major survey was carried out in the same area by the Centro de
Investigaciones Economicas (CIE) of the University of Antioquia in Medellin.
CIE produced a 436-page report with a wealth of statistics. In addition, ICA
produced a set of 14 representative farm models, with before and after proj-
ect situations, for the entire project area.
3.40      Since the Rionegro sample area was located in one of the regions
where the DRI project had been very successful, there are doubts about the
validity of prorating its findings over the three project regions. What has
been lacking is a continuous sampling exercise, probably under the responsi-
bility of ICA, to follow the development of, say, every fiftieth beneficiary
from the start of his involvement in the program to the end. Such a proce-
dure would still not have obviated the need for the CIE survey at the end of
the project, because on.y such a survey can take into account the influence
of externalities--such as the liberalization of milk prices--on the DRI bene-
ficiaries and the non-DRI control group, as well as the indirect beneficia-
ries of the program.
I. Compliance with Loan Conditions
3.41      Beginning in 1981, lack of counterpart funds resulted in non-com-
pliance with the Loan Agreement (LA Section 3.01 (a)) which requires that
sufficient counterpart funds be made available. The borrower did not provide
funds and resources (LA Section 4.02) for adequate operation and maintenance
of constructed project facilities, and in particular for the health, educa-
tion, roads and water supply components.
3.42      Other covenants iot complied with in the Project Agreement were:
P.A. Section 2.08 (b): Caja shall cause other entities to maintain adequate
records of project costs; P.A. Section 4.01 (b): Caja's project accounts
shall be audited and submitted to the Bank no later than four months after
the fiscal year; and P.A. Section 4.03: Caja shall maintain a ratio of
current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1. The latter
covenant was not complied with due to Caja's liquidity problems. The Bank's
opinion was that this problem could not be solved on a project basis. The
borrower did not establish a communication system among the health compo-
nents, L.A. Section 3.04 (b).
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      The institutional performance of the key agencies for the success-
ful implementation of the project, DNP, Caja, ICA, SENA and Cavecinales has
been good. Given the managerial problems, the financial and disbursement
complexities, and the mobility problems of the hundreds of field staff in the
early years, the performance was often outstanding. Three circumstances
assisted in meeting the targets: (i) the outstanding managerial qualities of
the two DNP/DRI program Director Generals up to early 1981; (ii) the suffi-
cient availability of counterpart resources prior to 1981; and (iii) more
than anything else, the dedication of the, often junior, field staff. In
fact a "project mystique" was created that made people perform above the call
of duty and that resulted in excellent cooperation between Caja, ICA and SENA
at the grass roots level.



- 14 -
4.02      Another good performance was provided by ICEL for the electrifica-
tion component. Less satisfactory were the performances of INS for water
supply and the ICCE for the education infrastructure and the Ministry of
Education for the training of its primary school teachers.
4.03      The performance was not satisfactory for agencies responsible for
the marketing component, CECORA; the reforestatiop component, INDERENA; and
the Ministry of Health. Poor cooperation, internal conflicts, weak finances
and poor linkage between the national, regional and local echelons all con-
tributed.
4.04      A general problem was the delays in providing budget funds, vehi-
cles and equipment to the departmental (regional) and municipal levels. This
was one of the points where the DNP/DRI management frequently had to inter-
fere. Frictions also existed because of salary differentials between higher
payed agencies, such as DNP and SENA, and lower pay-scale agencies such as
the Ministry of Agriculture and ICA. Even for the better paid DNP/DRI unit
it was impossible to attract experienced computer programmers because of its
non-competitive pay-scale.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
5.01      The role played by the Bank, throughout the execution of the proj-
ect, was satisfactory and relations with the participating agencies remained
cordial. The Bank was flexible in responding to requests for reallocation of
proceeds of the loan and in extending the closing date to allow completion of
the project. The complexity of the project required an extraordinary effort,
first during project preparation, mortly by PAO/CP and later during appraisal
and supervision. The appraisal mission was overly optimistic in assuming
that the project could be completed in five years. In the early and most
successful years--in view of the number of beneficiaries recruited--12 super-
vision missions took place during four years, between January 1977 and
December 1980. However, when major financial problems started delaying the
project after January 1, 1981, Bank supervision missions in the 3-1/2 years
between that date and the closing date of September 30, 1984, dropped to
eight. For the vital element of evaluation, the Bank should have taken a
much stronger lead at the start. Rather than leave it up to the Borrower to
devise a methodology, the Bank should have provided more guidance on how to
carry out the evaluation.
5.03      During the supervision of the less than satisfactory components,
the Bank's missions concluded that integrated rural development projects were
not the appropriate vehicle for institution building of the separate partici-
pating agencies. This appears correct, because no single agency was
responsible for the overall success of the project and only a small fraction
of the loan was allocated to each.
VI. PROJECT IMPACT
Value of Production
6.01      The primary strategy, to improve farmers' income through increasing
yields, reducing idle land, and introducing a managerial approach to farming
and marketing was successful. Annex 3 shows the increases in volume and

value of production; milk production in particular showed a spectacular 700%
increase in volume, wnich indicates the strong impact of external influences,
but also how the project taught farmers to react quickly to market signals.

Whereas the value of livestock production accounted for only 10% of the total
value of production before the project, it increased to 29% under the
project.
Farmers' Income
6.02      On the basis of the CIE survey in Antioquia, Annex 4 compares
income, spending and savings for the following categories of farmers: active
DRI participants at the time of the survey, former DRI participants, non-DRI
participants living in an area covered by the DRI program (indirect benefi-
ciaries) and farmers living in villages outside the DRI program. There is a
clear relationship between farmers' degree of involvement in the DRI program
and their average income:
Farm Income
Active DRI     Former DRI      Indirect DRI      Outside DRI
-------------------Col$ '000------------
Total income          407.1            359.3           320.0             284.3
Total consumption    329.7             304.0           280.0             254.0
6.03      The foregoing estimate is based on the sampling in the Rionegro
district in Antioquia. When the data from the farm models for the entire
project are used, as in Annex 5, the following before and after project
incomes are derived:
Equivalent in 1984 Col$ '000
Year 0                 Year 9
Farm family Income, from farming only          163.6                   381.3
Family income from all sources                 199.6                   465.2
Rural family poverty level                                 298.8
The project succeeded in lifting the average farm family income from 67% of
the rural poverty level before the project to 156% after the project.



- 16 -
Rate of return
6.04      Two methods were used to compute *lie rates of return.  The first
used the 14 project farm models covering all three project regions. The
rest:It is an average financial rate of return for the farmers of 23% against
57% estimated at appraisal, and an economic rate of return of 16%, against
22% estimated at appraisal. The difference between financial and economic
rates of return is caused by the cost of the services which were required to
achieve the results. Of the cost of the production-related services, tech-
nical assistance accounted for 41%, the roads component for 35%, farmers'
organization and training for 16%, aid central administration for 8%.
6.05      The second method of estimating the rate of return used the 1984
CIE survey of 616 farms in the Rioiegro district. Here, a difference in
average net value of production of C$ 24,700/ha/yr was found to exist between
active and former DRI farmers on the one hand, and non-DRI farmers living in
non-DRI villages on the other. Assuming the same incremental area each year
and the same cost of services as under the previous method and that the
incremental net benefit of C$ 24,700 C$/ha/yr was reached over a nine year
implementation period, an economic rate of return of 28% results. The gener-
ally recognized better performance in the Rionegro district in particular,
and in Antioquia in general, explains the higher rate of return. In the
Rionegro survey area, 58% of net farm income is derived from crops and 42%
from livestock, while before the project started, only 15% came from live-
stock operations.
Non-productive components
6.06      There is a problem in quantifying the benefits of the project's
social components. The health component was a failure, and, in the education
component, school attendance and drop-out rates between the DRI and non-DRI
areas in the CIE survey showed no differences. Probably the best indicator
can be found in the farmers' appreciation of the DRI program as given in
Annex 2. The income-increasing components received the highest tecognition,
followed by the direct services of electrification and water supply.
VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Summary
(a)  The project was successful in lifting the target population above
the poverty level at a cost that still permitted an acceptable rate
of return. Production increases were significant, but they were
partly due to non-project related external market conditions.
(b)  Against the odds of extreme complexity, later lack of counterpart
resources, shortage of transportation and slow movement of funds,
the project management performed very well and achieved a project
mystique that inspired the hundreds of field staff.
(c)  The performance of the implementing agencies was mixed, but those
that were vital to the project's success performed well. The
influence of the social components was minimal.

7,02      Lessons Learned
(a) Integrated rural development projects, although complex, can work,
provided that they receive political support at the highest level,
and that they are executed under strong project coordination with
consensus among principal agencies that are institutionally well
developed.
(b) The grass roots approach of community committees was viable only
for obtaining infrastructure. Once this was achieved, the
committees disintegrated.
(c) The project was unnecessarily complex, attempting to do everything
at the same time: improving farmers' income, as well as improving
their qual4ty of life through the cre '{on of social amenities. It
would have been simpler to have first oncentrated on improving the
farmers' income and only thereafter improve other conditions in the
rural environment.
(d) The project at first suffered from a shotgun approach in searching
for ways to improve farmers' income. Instead, it would have
benefitted from an earlier focus on a few profitable agricultural
farm investment options and the agricultural extension workers
concentrating on these aspects.
(e) Rural development projects are inappropriate vehicles for achieving
institutional improvements in participating agencies.
(f) The Bank should insist more, and provide more direct guidance, in
establishing adequate evaluation systems at the start of the
project. The systems should be clear and simple, given the
educational level of the lowest echelon field staff that has to
carry them out.
(g) Means of transportation are vital and should be procured at the
beginning of the project.
(h) The rural population perceived electrification as a greater amenity
than piped water supply, because farmers already obtain water from
somewhere, but the provision of electric power is outside the
possibility of self-help solutions.
