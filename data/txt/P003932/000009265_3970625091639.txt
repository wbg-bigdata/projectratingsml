ENDONESIA
TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower:                 Republic of Indonesia
Executing Agencies:       Bank Indonesia and Ministry of Finance
Amount:                   US$300 million equivalent
Terms:                    20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate
Project
Description             The proposed loan would support the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI's) efforts to respond appropriately
to the sharp fall in oil prices, through reducing
dependency on oil while regaining stability in the
balance of payments and government budget. Specifi-
cally, the loan would support steps taken by the
Government in 1986 to: (i) restrain government
spending through a 24Z cut in the 1986/87 development
budget; (ii) maintain an appropriate exchange rate,
including a 31Z devaluation; and (iii) reform trade
policy through measures designed to provide inter-
nationally-priced inputs to exporters and to reduce
import restrictions. Important aspects of these
measures are steps to shift from nontariff barriers
(NTBs) to tariffs as the primary instrument of import
policy, and to promote foreign investment, especially
in export activities. The loan of US$300 million
equivalent would finance general imports of goods to
meet part of Indonesia's near-term foreign-exchange
requirements, while supporting GOI's ongoing deter-
mination to take appropriate measures to promote the
efficiency and longer-term viability of the
economy. It is envisaged that such further actions
could form the basis for a subsequent loan in about a
year.I\
Benefits and Risks:       The adjustment measures taken by COI over the past
year will provide balance of payments and fiscal
stability, in the face of sharply lower oil prices,
and help develop the non-oil economy over the medium
term. In particuilar, the recent trade reform
measures represent an imiportant first step in COI's
efforts to reduce long-standing distortions in
Indonesia's highly protected industrial structure;



improve international competitiveness of non-oil
exports; and increase potential for foreign invest-
ment, especially in export-oriented industries. In
addition, greater transparency and administrative
simplicity would be introduced in Indonesia's trade
regime. The principal risk in that the far-reaching
nature of the policy reforms could encounter domestic
opposition to full implementation of already-
announced meamures and to efforts to take additional
measures after further study. These risks are offset
by GOI's demonstrated ability in the past to carry
out difficult and sensitive reforms.
Estimated Disbursement: US$300 million equivalent would be disbursed in FY87
Economic Rate of Return: Not applicable
Appraisal Report:         None

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUICTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED TRADE POLICY
ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Trade
Po.icy Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US4300 million. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grave, at the standard variable interest rate.
PART I - ECONOMIC BACKCROUND
2.        An economic report, entitled "Indonesia:  Adjusting to Lower Oil
Revenues" (No. 6201-IND, dated May 20, 1986), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 27, 1986. Annex I gives selected economic indicators for the
country.
A.   The Oil Boom (1973-81)
3.        At the time of the first large oil price increase in 1973, the
Indonesian economy had already begun to respond favorably to the new economic
policies instituted in the post-1967 period. This response was reinforced by
the advent of higher oil (and later, LNG) earnings, which led to a period of
unprecedented growth. Net oil/LNG earnings (i.e., after accounting for all
import and service payments from the sector) rose from US$0.6 billion in
1973174 to a peak of US$10.6 billion in 1980/81. In that year, the oil/LNG
sector accounted for 24% of total value added in the economy, 76% of gross
export earnings and 68% of budget revenues. Compared to many other oil-
exporting countries, Indonesia used these additional resources well. GDP grew
on average by 7.5% p.a. during 1973-81, supported by a steady expansion of
agricultural output, especially rice, and a rapidly growing manufacturing
sector. Significant improvements were also made in education, health and
social services. By many social indicators (e.g., primary school enrollment,
per capita food availability, poverty incidence) Indonesia reached approximate
parity with the relevant reference group of countries, despite having started
from a lower base in the early 1970e.
4.        During this period, the Covernment of Indonesia (COI) maintained
sound macromanagement and a prudent external borrowing strategy. By the end
of the decade, the current account of the balance of payments was in surplus
and the debt-service ratio was less than 13%. However, the economy still
suffered from several structural weaknesses. The agenda for policy action
included: (a) reducing economic dependence on oil; (b) moderating the high
rate of inflation (average 17% p.a. in 1973-81); Cc) expanding and
diversifying the manufacturing base; (d) training skilled manpower for more
rapid socioeconomic development; and (e) strengthening the weakly developed
administrative and financial systems.



-2-
B. Declining Oil Prices and Policy Response (1982-85)
5.        After nearly a decade of rapid progress, Indonesia suffered major
economic setbacks in 1982 and 1983, primarily due to the weakening of oil and
other commodity prices from the high levels of the 1979-80 period. By
1982/83, the current-account position had deteriorated substantially to show a
deficit of US$7.2 billion (8.0% of GNP). The adverse impact of international
economic events persisted, leading to a 15% decline in the overall terms of
trade between 1981 and 1985.  In response, a comprehensive process of adjust-
ment was initiated by the Government in 1983. The specific objectives were
the mnaintenance of balance of payments and fiscal stability and a reduction of
dependence on oil/LNG earnings.  The major policy initiatives introduced
through 1985 for macroeconomic adjustment and structural change are summarized
below.
6.        Macroeconomic Adjustment.  From the first signs of weakness in the
oil market, GOI acted promptly to control public spending and adjust the
exchange rate:
(a)  Public Investment.  The buoyancy of oil revenues in the late 1970s
had led to optimistic market forecasts and the initiation of several
large capital-intensive projects. Reacting to the changed macro-
economic outlook, COI announced a major rephasing of these invest-
ments in May 1983, resulting in foreign exchange savings estimated
at US$10 billion. Since 1984/85, the Government has also placed
strict limits on the utilization of import-related credits for
public investment.
(b)  Budget Subsidies.  Subsidies channelled through the budget reached
Rp 1.9 trillion in 1981/82, accounting for 152 of government
spending and 2% of CDP. Since then they have been steadily
reduced. Subsidies for food were phased out in 1982/83, with
BULOC's funding shifted entirely to the banking system. Petroleum
subsidies decLined steadily after 1981/82, mainly due to domestic
price increases totalling more than 200%. Despite price increases
of 11% in 1984/85 and 25% in 1985/86, fertilizer subsidies continued
to rise as fertilizer consumption increased. Overall, budget subsi-
dies were reduced to Rp 1.2 trillion (6% of government spending) by
1985/86.
(c) Exchange Rate. The Rupiah was devalued by 28% (from Rp 703 to
Rp 974 per US dollar) in March 1983, and the exchange rate was
subsequently set by a managed float against a basket of curren-
cies. As domestic inflation was brought under control, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) remained relatively stable over the
next two years, and the rupiah was allowed to depreciate from mid-
1985. By March 1986, the REER was about 10% lower than immediately
after the 1983 devaluation.
7.        Financial Sector.  In June 1983, the Government launched a far-
reaching reform of the financial sector, aimed at increasing domestic resource
mobilization, improving the allocation of credit and encouraging greater



market orientation in the operation of financial institutions. The reforms
included the removal of interest rate controls on state bank deposits, elimi-
nation of credit ceilings for all banks, and reduction in the qumber of
programs qualifying for new Bank Indonesia liquidity credits.-   Subsequently,
Bank Indonesia introduced a range of new monetary instruments to improve
monetary management and encourage the development of an active interbank money
market. Bank deposit rates are necessarily market-related, as there are no
constraints on Indonesian residents holding financial assets abroad, and are
heavily influenced by anticipated changes in the exchange rate. Following the
financial deregulation of 1983, lending rates have risen sharply and now
average around 17%.
8.        Taxation Policy.  The Government introduced a comprehensive package
of tax reform, aimed at increasing non-oil revenues by broadening the tax
base, simplifying the structure of rates and improving administration. The
major elements of the package are as follows:
(a) The income tax reform introduced in January 1984 included: (i) a
vastly simplified tax structure, based on three relatively low rates
(15%, 25Z and 35%) and limited deductions; (ii) "self-assessment' of
tax liability, with considerable emphasis on withholding at source;
and (iii) a drastic simplification of the tax code, including
revised procedures for appeals and refunds. These changes were
designed to increase the number of income-tax payers and improve the
administrative efficiency of tax collection.
(b) The value-added tax (VAT) introduced in April 1985 replaced the old
sales taxes and the transition has been smoothly implemented. The
basic VAT rate is 10%. Although confined to the manufacturer-
importer level, the VAT has increased revenue potential by;
(i) subjecting domestic sales of petroleum and tcbacco products to
VAT; and (ii) imposing an additional tax (10-20%) on luxury goods.
Cc) The new property tax introduced in January 1986 replaced seven
ordinances, including the old land (IPEDA) and net wealth taxes.
The new law is conceptually simpler than its predecessors, based on
a proportion of the market value of land and buildings, and a single
tax rate of 0.5%. Implementation arrangements still require a lot
of work. A related action plan is being defined by GOI for review
by the Bank under the proposed urban and irrigation sector loans.
As a result of the tax reforms, non-oil tax revenues have risen by about two-
thirds since 1983/84 and the medium-term buoyancy of revenues is expected to
be significantly improved. There are also plans to mobilize additional
revenues through further improvements in tax administration.
1/   In addition, the on-lending rate for most loans under the liquidity-
credit programs was set at 12% (previously there was a range of rates,
with the average considerably below 12%).



-4-
9.        Customs, Ports and Shipping.  The reorganization of customs, ports
and shipping operations in April 1985 represented a direct attack on the
problems of overregulation in an important section of the Indonesian
economy.  The major elements of the reorganization were:
(a) Custom procedures were reduced almost to a formality. Imports are
now inspected at the points of origin by government-appointed
private surveyors (ScS). Exports and interisland traffic are no
longer subject to customs inspection in Indonesia.
(b) Port charges were simplified and related directly to services
provided. Dues payable by foreign-flag vessels were reduced to the
same level as for Indonesian oceangoing ships. Cargo handling
charges were reduced.
(c) Foreign-flag vessels are now free to call at any Indonesian port
open to international trade, without prior approval. They may also
choose any local agent to act on their behalf.
Tnese measures have had a major impact on port delays and costs of shipping
and freight handling. For example, the cost of shipping is estimated to have
been reduced by 20-40%, the average time spent on customs procedures for
imports has been cut by several weeks, and the cost of freight forwarding has
declined enormously (due primarily to savings in payments to intermediaries
and reduced paperwork).
10.       Table 1 summarizes recent developments in the major economic
indicators. Clearly, the boLd measures uindertaken by the Government since
1982 had succeeded by 1985/86 in restoring macroeconomic stability. The
external deficit declined from 8% of GNP in 1982/83 to less than 3Z in
1985/86. Significant progress was made in mobilizing domestic resources, and
inflation had been brought down below 5%. Inevitably, these adjustments had
corresponding costs in the form of slower growth of output and incomes
(relative to the 1970s), reduced private and public investment, low rates of
capacity utilization, and the emergence of financial problems among many
industrial and construction enterprises. Problems in the manufacturing sector
were compounded by high and variable levels of protection provided by a
proliferation of import licensing restrictions. Nevertheless, prior to the
collapse in oil prices in 1986, Indonesia seemed by and large to have overcome
its balance of payments and macroadjustment problems, and was set 0!. a path
which would potentially restore stable growth to the economy.

PART II - ADJUSTMENT IN 1986
A. The Oil Price Collapse
11.       Indonesia's crude oil export price collapsed from US$28/barrel in
January 1986 to below US$10/barrel by August. Althoigh some recovery has
since occurred, the price for 1986/87 is expected to average around
US$12.50/barrel, half the level of the previous year. As LNG earnings are
zalso partially linked to the price of crude oil, Indonesia will experience a
sharp decline in total oil/LNG export receipts for the year. It is estimated
that gross oil/LNG export earnings for 1986/87 will fall to US$6.9 billion,
compared to US$12.5 billion in 1985/86. Even more striking, net oil/LNG
earnings are estimated to drop from US$5.7 billion in 1985/85 to US$2.2 bil-
lion; this is only 20% of the peak level in 1980/81. Combined with the fall
in other export prices, the overall terms of trade are projected to deterio-
rate by 35% during the year, resulting in a decline of 8-9% in national
income.



-6-
12.       In the face of such a large external shock and in the absence of
timely adjustment measures, it was clear that a severe imbalance would appear
in the external payments account. In 1986/87 alone, the current account
deficit would have widened to well over US$5 billion and, even with higher oil
prices in 1987/88 and 1988/89, the cumulative deficit for the 3-year period
could have exceeded US$13 billion. In the short term, Indonesia had available
over US$10 billion in external reserves and over US$2 billion in undrawn lines
of commercial credit to help finance a larger current account deficit.
However, faced with a high debt service ratio and an uncertain oil price
outlook, it would not have been possible, nor prudent, to continue financing
such large deficits over the medium term.
B. Macroeconomic Adjustment
13.       Anticipating its payments difficulties, GOI put into place a series
of adjustment measures intended to narrow the balance of payments deficit by
bringing national spending, especially public expenditure, more closely in
line with the reduced level of national income. In January, an austere budget
was announced for 1986/el (see Table 2). The budget was based on the assump-
tion of lower oil prices (US$25/barrel) and a crude-nil production level
(including condensates) averaging 1.33 mbd. A conservative projection of non-
oiL tax revenues was adopted (8% higher than in 1985/86), despite the signifi-
cant tax reforms that were introduced in the previous two years. Overall,
revenues (i.e., including oil/LNC taxes) were projected to decline by about
4%, SO that cuts in government expenditures were required to maintain budget
stability.
14.       Current expenditures, other than interest on external debt, were
budgeted to remain basically flat in nominal terms. Capital expenditures
(including transfers to public enterprises) were reduced by almost 25%, with
the Rupiah development budgets of government departments cut by 40-55%. In
making these cuts, COI has also focussed the composition of the public invest-
ment program, giving priority to: (a) the completion of ongoing projects;
(b) the provision of counterpart funds for foreign-aided projects; (c) proj-
ects with a particular focus on equity and employment; and (d) the funding of
operations and maintenance (O&HM) expenditures. The expenditure allocations
suitably reflect the findings of the public investment review carried out by
the Bank in 1985. The World Bank also assisted GOI in identifying expenditure
priorities in selected sectors, including the counterpart funding requirements
for foreign-aided projects. There is now very little scope for further reduc-
tions in COI's capital expenditures without jeopardizing medium-term growth
prospects. However, savings could be realized from closer scrutiny of the
financial performance and investment plans of public enterprises. The Govern-
ment has requested technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank in
this area (see para. 35).

15.       The budget for 1986/87 had projected an overall deficit of
Rp 1.4 trillion (1.7% of GDP). However, with the unexpected coLlapse in oil
prices, oil/LNG tax revenues are now projected at only Rp 4.8 trillion, less
than half the budgeted level. Some of this shortfall has bec. made good by
increased non-tax revenues from domestic sales of petroleum products (esti-
mated at Rp 1 trillion in 1986/87), improved non-oil tax performance and
selected cuts in expenditure (e.g., funding of BULOG's food stocks). Never-
theless, the budget deficit is still expected to rise to Rp 5.0 trillion (6.0Z
of CDP). Given projected drawings of external commercial loans for balance of
payments purposes, the Government will not have to resort to domestic financ-
ing of the budget.



- 8 -
16.       By itself, the austere budget for 1986187 would not have been suffi-
cient to bring the current account deficit down to manageable levels. There-
fore, faced with the prospect of lower oil prices over the medium term, the
Government decided to devalue the rupiah by 311 (from Rp 1,134 to Rp 1,644 per
US dollar) on September 12. This adjustment is considered appropriate in
light of the projected loss of oil revenues and helped to preempt speculative
capital outflows. GOI also wishes to alter the present market psychology,
which focusses almost exclusively on the rupiah/US dollar exchange rate,
making it difficult to accommodate sharp or sustained changes in the relation-
ship of the US dollar to the yen or major European currencies. To this end,
Bank Indonesia now quotes five mid rates and the SDR rate for the rupiah. It
is hoped that this strategy will permit greater flexibility in future
exchange-rate management.
17.       Throughout 1986/87, a significant component of GOI's adjustment
effort has been the maintenance of a conservative monetary stance. During the
first 6 months of 1986/87, total rupiah liquidity grew at an annual rate of
14% and domestic credit at 28Z. This marks a considerable slowdown from the
previous year (1985/86), when rupiah liquidity rose by 27% and domestic credit
by 42%. As already noted, the Covernment is not expected to draw on domestic
financing during 1986/87. In addition, only a part of the increased demand
for credit emanating from the public enterprise sector (resulting from slug-
gish market conditions and the impact of the devaluation on cash flows) is
likely to be accommodated. Similarly, preliminary data suggest that credit to
the nonfinarncial private sector will be substantially less than in 1985/86.
Deposit rates ac financial institutions continue to range around 11-14%, which
are compc ltive with interest rates elsewhere in the region and a powerful
instrument for resource mobilization within Indonesia. Lending rates average
around 17%, which implies a high real interest rate given the current rate of
inflation. The growth in domestic liquidity is judged to be broadly
consistent with the Government's objectives of moderating inflation, and
supporting both the projected level of economic activity and the balance of
payments.
C. Trade PoLicy and Foreign Investment
18.       While C0I's performance has been outstanding in macroeconomic
management, a conspicuous exception with regard to structural reforms has been
its policy framework for trade and industry. In general, the trade regime has
been inward-looking, promoting industrial investment with high levels of pro-
tection from imports, often in the form of nontariff barriers (NTBs). By the
end of 1985, more than 1,000 products (20% of the total number in the tariff
schedule) were subject to import license restrictions. Not all of these
restrictions were binding, and only about 300 items were subject to formal
quotas.  Even so, the proliferation of NTBs created distortions in the struc-
ture of protection, which often led to high costs for downstream industries
and reduced the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-oil exports. Consequently,
recent Wcrld Bank economic reports have strongly advocated the replacement of
NTBs by tariff-based protection as a first step in trade policy reform.
19.       The first major shift in the direction of trade policy came in May
1906, when the Government announced a package of measures designed to provide



- 9 -
internationally priced inputs to exporters. Under the scheme, "producer-
exporters" were given the option of importing their inputs free from licensing
restrictions and exempt from import duties. Preliminary results suggest that
the scheme is being implemented efficiently and is highly effective in sup-
porting exporters (see paras. 47-49). During the first four months of opera-
tion, producer-exporter status has been granted on US$228 million worth of
imports, with over 90% of these items (by value) under license restrictions.
On an annual basis, this amounts to roughly 6% of non-oil imports. However,
while the May 6 measures are highly significant in providing a free-trade
environment for producer-exporters, they do not address the fundamental
distortions arising from the system of protection granted to Indonesia's
manufacturing sector.
20.       The September 12 devaluation significantly improved incentives for
domestic producers of import substitutes and exports alike. As such, it
provided an opportunity for rationalizing the disparate additionaL incentives
provided to some import-substitution activities by the existing trade regime
and to reverse the tendency toward proliferation of NTBs. GOT seized this
opportunity through a package of trade reforms announced on October 25,
designed to reduce import restrictions, improve industrial efficiency and
promote non-oil exports. In particular: (a) all restrictive import licensing
arrangements have been removed for 165 items (e.g., tires, glass, paper, dyes,
synthetic fibers, some electrical appliances and vehicle parts); (b) import
licensing restrictions have been relaxed on 110 items (e.g., chemicals and
machinery) for actual users and licensed agents; (c) tariff rates were
increased for 154 items, to compensate for the removal of NTBs noted above;
and (d) tariff rates for another 152 items not produced domestically (e.g.,
certain chemicals, steel products and electrical components) were lowered,
mostly to the range of 0-5%.
21.       The significance and impact of these recent trade reforms are
analyzed in Part IV of this report. In summary, the 275 items for which
license restrictions were removed or relaxed account for 27% of all items and
44% of total import value previously restricted (i.e., could be imported only
by approved importers). Equally important, the reform signals the Govern-
ment's intention to shift to tariffs rather than NTBs as the primary instru-
ment of import policy and provides a systematic framework for further reduc-
tions in NTBs and rationalization of the system of protection.
22.       Related changes have also been made in the regulatory environment
for foreign investment. As part of the May 6 package, the Government took a
number of steps to promote foreign investments: (a) the requirements for
local participation in joint ventures have been relaxed for investment in
certain priority subsectors which are important for exporters and employment
generation; (b) the validity of investment licenses has been extended to 30
years; and (c) the operational limitations on joint ventures with majority
local participation have been eased. Further changes were introduced in
October 1986, to treat foreign investors more like domestic investors. In
particular: (i) foreign investment is now allowed in existing firms in
priority sectors, especially for exports (whereas previously foreign investors
had to set up new joint-venture companies); (ii) investment by multilateral
financial institutions (IFC, ADB, IDB) is to be treated as national participa-



- 10 -
tion; (iii) foreign-investment companies have been given access to export
credit from state banks on the same terms as domestic firms; (iv) foreign-
investment companies may now be allowed to act as a marketing channel for
export products of other companies; and (v) ceilings on the swap facility for
foreign exchange coverage have been removed, thereby providing joint ventures
access to investment credits from state banks on roughly the same terms as for
domestic companies. Combined with the recent devaluation and trade reforms,
these measures are expected to lead to a significant improvement in the
environment for foreign investment, especially in exporting activities. The
impact on actual investment flows, however, is difficult to predict, as market
prospects in Indonesia are currently weak and other regulatory constraints on
investment remain (see para. 34).
D. Impact on Economic Performance
23.       Real growth in the economy is expected to slow during 1986, as the
contractionary effects of cuts in government spending and the devaluation are
felt. Most seriously affected will be the construction sector, which could
decline by 8% during 1986. Agricultural growth is expected to be less than
2%, reflecting a slight decline in rice production from the record level of
1985. However, there has been a noticeable shift to other food crops, includ-
ing soybeans and corn. Production of tree crops, especially palm oil and
kernels, is also expected to rise during 1986. In the manufacturing sector,
activity has been surprisingly resilient to date. However, the sluggish
domestic economy is expected to constrain manufacturing output over the
remainder of the year, reducing its annual growth rate to about 2%. Overall,
non-oil CDP growth is projected to be less than 1% in 1986. With output
restraint in the oil sector, in line with OPEC quotas, there will be little
growth in total GDP.
24.       Prior to the September devaluation, slack demand conditions and the
Government's conservative monetary management had succeeded in holding annual
inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) below 5%. Following the
devaluation, consumer prices rose by 2.8% in September and 2.0X in October.
However, stocks of basic commodities (especially rice) are high and the Govern-
ment has announced that it will not immediately increase prices of electricity,
teleconmunications, railway and city bus transport. Therefore, with continued
monetary restraint, it should be possible to keep inflation to an average rate
of 9% during 1986 (12% on a year-end basis). Although some spillover of the
postdevaluation price increases into the next year is likely, Indonesia is
expected to retain most of the gains in competitiveness obtained from
devaluation.

25.       The combination of demand restraint, devaluation and trade reform is
expected to lead to a significant improvement in the balance of payments, com-
pared to the "without adjustment" case (para. 12). Despite weak world market
conditions and falling prices, earnings from non-oil exports are projected to
rise by 8% during 1986/87. Manufactured exports, including plywood, textiles
and garments, and some public sector products (e.g., cement, fertilizer and
steel) are doing particularly well. At the same time, non-oil imports are
expected to continue falling, leaving them more than one-third lower in real
terms than in 1982183. Overall, the current account deficit is estimated to
be around US$4.3 billion (7.8% of CNP) in 1986/81.
26.       The current account deficit will be partialLy financed by estimated
net disbursements of US$1 billion from the Inter-Covernmental Croup on
Indonesia (IGGI) members. The Indonesian authorities are also expected to
make substantial use of external commercial bank borrowing (gross disburse-
ments of US$2.7 biLlion) in 1986/87. This amount includes a partial utiLiza-
tion of credit lines negotiated during the previous year, in anticipation of a
tighter resource position. A strengthening of private capital inflows follow-
ing the devaluation should enable the authorities to hold official reserve use
to about US$200 million. Including the net foreign assets of commercial



- 12 -
banks, totaL external reserves are estimated to remain over US$10 billion at
the end of 1986/87, equivalent to 9.7 months of imports. After excluding
prepayments, debt servicing is estimated to rise from US$5.1 billion in
1985/86 to US$5.5 billion in 1986/87. With the sharp oil-price-induced
decline in gross export earnings, the total debt-service ratio will rise from
26% in 1985/86 to about 37Z in 1986/87.
PART III - MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
A. Economic Outlook
27.       Indonesia's medium-term prospects will be tightly constrained by the
balance of payments. In particular, the oil outlook remains uncertain and it
is difficult to plan on a substantial recovery in oil prices in the near fu-
ture. Nevertheless, as a result of the impact of measures already taken and
the Government's commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and further
structural adjustment, as well as a somewhat more favorable external outlook
than in 1986, Indonesia is expected to reduce its external imbalance rapidly,
allowing for a recovery of growth and incomes over the medium term.
28.       Indonesia's oil prices had recovered to above US$13/barrel in
November 1986. Based on the Bank's latest forecasts, crude oil prices are
projected to continue rising to US$18/barrel over the next two years (see
Table 4). Combined with some recovery in volumes, this would boost
Indonesia's net oil/LNG export earnings to US$4.4 billion in 1988/89, about
double the current level (see Table 5). Subsequently, oil/LNG earnings are
projected to flatten out, as prices stabilize and production constraints limit
grow:h in export volumes. Non-oil exports are expected to grow strongly in
respanse to the recent devaluation and trade reform measures. Assuming con-
tinued progress on trade reform and related policies volume growth is pro-
jected to average about 6% p.a. through 1990/91. The declining trend in world
prices for Indonesia's non-oil exports also appears to be arrested, with a mo-
dest recovery projected over the medium term. The result is a relatively
rapid expansion in export earnings by more than 50% over the next 4 years.
29.       Following the impact of the devaluation and recent budget cuts, non-
oil imports are projected to decline in real terms during 1987/88. This would
leave the volume of non-oil imports about one-third lower than their peak
level four years earlier, and help reduce the current account deficit to about
5% of GNP. Over the medium term, the current account deficit needs to be
brought down sharply to sustainable levels. However, given the projected
export earnings, there would be scope for real increases in import levels in
later years. Accordingly, non-oil GDP and domestic income could recover to a
mediumr-term growth rate of close to 4Z p.a. by the end of the decade. With
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, inflation could be brought back down to
below 7% by 1988/89. This is important, as higher rates of inflation in the
medium term would jeopardize the effectiveness of the recent exchange rdte
adjustment.

30.       Debt service on MLT loans contracted through 1985 is projected to
rise from US$5.1 billioz; in 1985/86 to a peak of US$6.4 billion in 1988/89
(accounting for 312 of projected export earnings). Therefore, despite the
expected recovery in export earnings and even with continued restraint on
import demand, there will be a substantial financing requirement. As defined
in Table 5, the financing gap is to be covered by special IGGI assistance, new
commercial borrowing and ura of reserves. A number of IGGI members (e.g.,
Japan and ADB) have already committed additional assistance, especially for
local-cost financing. Several fast-disbursing Bank adjustment and sector
loans, including this trade policy adjustment loan, are also planned. It is
estimated that disbursements from this quick-disbursing assistance could total
US$2 billion over the next two years. In addition, based on the projected
amortization payments, commercial banks could lend Indonesia up to US$1.5 bil-
lion over the next 2 years without increasing their net exposure. Together
with special ICGI assistance noted above, this would be sufficient to cover
the projected financing gap, without any reserve use, through 1988/89. With
the projected adjustment in the balance of payments, the financing gap is
steadily reduced in later years.

B. Policy Framework
31.       As already noted, the projected adjustment in the Indonesian economy
assumes continued restraint on aggregate demand over the next couple of years.
Accordingly, as noted in the Policy Statement (Annex rv), the Government intends
to maintain its prudent fiscal and monetary stance as well as its strong
commitment to the present exchange rate system. Exchange rate policy will also
remain flexible, so as to preserve Indonesia's competitiveness in international
markets. It is equally important for the Government to continue the process of
structural reform, so that economic growth can recover over the medium term. To
this end, the Policy Statement identifies a number important areas for follow-up
action to the recent trade reforms: (a) further elimination of NTBs and
preparation of a plan for tariff rationalization; (b) review of restrictions on
domestic investment and trade, with the objective of initiating extensive



- 15 -
deregulation in this area; and (c) review of the performance of selected public
enterprises, to identify appropriate areas for reform.
32.       The Government intends to announce another austere budget for
1987/88.  Revenues ore projected to rise due to higher oilLNUG taxes and
improved implementation of the recent non-oil tax reforms. Proposals have been
made to extend the coverage of VAT. COI also is working with the World Bank to
define an action plan to improve collections from the new property tax. Even
so, total expenditure will have to be severely constrained. As noted in the
Covernment's Policy Statement, highest priority will be given to providing
satisfactorily for operations and maintenance (0M) expenditures, so that
greater output can be obtained from available capital stock, especially in
infrastructure facilities. Ongoing projects will be reviewed and only those
that promise satisfactory economic returns will be funded. This implies that
several projects, including some supported with foreign aid, may have to be cut
cack. New projects will be undertaken provided they have very high economic
benefits and only where external financing is available on suitable terms. An
important consideration will be the capacity of the project implementing units
to execute projects at the required pace.
33.       In the area of trade policy, the October 25 measures reduced the scope
of import license restrictions and signalled the Government's intention to move
to tariffs as the primary instrument of import policy. However, non-tariff
barriers (NTBs) still affect a number of important agricultural and manufactured
products. As noted in the Policy Statement, it is the Government's objective to
eliminate gradually all NTBs on imports except on a small group of products that
are harmful to health, strategic to national defense or involve special economic
and social considerations. Tangible progress in this direction is expected
within the next year. Over the medium term, it will also be necessary to
rationalize the tariff structure in order to reduce excessive and disparate
protection. The Government intends to prepare a plan for tariff
rationalization, based on regular monitoring of the levels and dispersion of
tariff rates. The process of tariff rationalization will start with an early
review of imports that currently attract tariffs above the notional maximum rate
of 60Z established in the 1985 tariff reform, followed by a gradual reduction in
the tariff ceiling.
34.       To realize the full potential of these trade reforms, complementary
actions will be required to relax restrictive licensing arrangements on private
investment and domestic trade. The three important economic objectives of the
licensing system are to: (a) prevent excess capacity in domestic industry;
(b) encourage domestic competition by avoiding monopolistic or oligopolistic
market structure; and (c) achieve balanced regional development. However, the
Government needs to consider whether investment licensing is the most efficient
instrument to achieve these objectives. For example, recent experience
indicates that government projections of market demand are not necessarily any
more accurate than those of the private sector. More fundamentally, this policy
can block the competitive pressure generated by the entry of more efficient pro-
ducers, which is probably the most effective way to keep costs low. In the case
of industries where scale economies are significant, import competition could be
used to control monopoly power, thereby limiting differentials between domestic
and import prices. Finally, given the present difficult economic environment,



- 16 -
use of the licensing system to encourage investments in the Outer Islands may
simply dissuade some potential investors from investing at all. Therefore, the
emphasis of licensing policy needs to shift from investment regulation to
investment promotion. Important steps in this direction for foreign investors
have already been taken in the May 6 and October 25 packages. As noted in the
Policy Statement, the Government intends to study other restrictions on domestic
investment and trade with the objective of initiating extensive deregulation in
this area. We expect the study to be completed in about one year. Greater
freedom from licensing procedure would unleash entrepreneurial talent and
mobilize more financial resources for investment.
35.       The unsatisfactory financial and operating performance of public
enterprises has imposed a major burden on the Government's budget and, even more
importantly, has inhibited progress toward enhancing the efficiency of economic
activity in Indonesia. A range of factors impinge on public enterprise perform-
ance. Some can be addressed through relatively simple improvements in internal
planning and operational procedures; others are outside the control of the
enterprise (e.g., government policies and market conditions) or require long-
term solutions (e.g., management weaknesses). Recognizing these concerns, the
Government has initiated a program to review the performance of public enter-
prises and to identify appropriate areas for reform, including changes in the
system of government supervision and control, as well as in the management and
financial structure of individual public enterprises. During the next year, the
Government expects to prepare consolidated accounts for the public enterprise
sector, develop an appropriate classification for public enterprises, and
prepare a plan for sector restructuring through rehabilitation, merger or
divestiture. This program will be supported by technical assistance from the
IKF and the World Bank.
C. Social Impact
36.       The recent collapse in oil prices has had a major impact on incomes
and employment in Indonesia. Adjusting for the terms of trade loss, per capita
incomes fell by about 3X from 1981 to 1985 and by another 11% during 1986. The
Government has acted to contain the social costs by: (a) giving priority to
public spending on agriculture and local infrastructure; (b) promoting non-oil
exports, which are generally more labor-intensive; (c) containing the infla-
tionary impact of adjustment measures; and (d) adopting a more supportive
attitude toward informal sector activities, particularly in urban areas. For
example, the share of agriculture and regional development programs in develop-
ment expenditure was increased from 18.3% in 1985/86 to 24.7% in the 1986/87
budget. Social programs were also protected, with the share of education,
health and urban services rising from 19.7% to 21.6%. Since the devaluation in
March 1983, the volume of non-oil exports has risen by more the 50%. Many of
the fastest growing items--including agricultural products, textiles and
garments--are important employment-generating activities. Finally, by following
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, the Government has succeeded in containing
the inflationary impact of the September 12 devaluation. Monthly price
increases were held to 2.8% in September and 2.0% in October.



- 17 -
37.       Despite these efforts to minimize the social costs of adjustment, the
Government remains legitimately concerned about the medium-term prospects for
income growth and employment. Indonesia's labor force is expected to expand by
an estimated eighL million over the next five years. The Bank has previously
estimated that a non-oil CDP growth rate of 4-5% p.a. is required tS absorb this
growing labor force at adequate levels of productivity and incomes.-   As
already noted, the prospect of reaching these growth rates over the next two
years, consistent with financial stability, is bleak. However, with the
projected recovery in oil prices, it should be possible to restore medium-term
growth to 4% p.a. by the end of the decade. The Government's program of trade
reforms, together with the proposed actions on domestic regulation and public
enterprises, are essential to achieve this objective. In the interim, continued
attention to public spending priorities and inflation control will be required
to avoid unnecessary erosion of incomes and employment opportunities.
PART IV - TRADE POLICY REFORM
A. Evolution of the Import Regime
38.       At the start of the decade, Indonesia's import regime was charac-
terized by high and disparate tariff rates (from 0% to 225%, with 25 tariff
categories) coupled with a range of nontariff barriers (NTBs). The NTBs
included an importer licensing system, import bans and quotas, and various
informal quantitative restrictions (e.g.. the complex port and customs clearance
procedures).
39.       The licensing system classified products into two broad categories.
The majority of products were classified under the general import licensing
category. This is the standard type of license used in many countries to
register importers, and is not considered restrictive. To obtain this license
the applicant must have assets above a given level and a bank reference. The
remaining products could cnly be imported by holders of an "approved-importer"
license. Initially, the approved-importer license was to be used to encourage
product specialization and develos, an after-sales service capacity, with no
limit on the number of license ho'dera- However, over time, these licenses
were issued on a restrictive basis to a smaller number of traders or large
producers which created a significant NTB. The actual degree of restriction
depended on various factors, such as the number of license holders and whether
there was a formal quota on the permissible amount of imports.
40.       During the 1980s, there have been significant shifts in trade
policies and the relative importance of the different instruments. The first
trend was toward increased government control via an expansion of the product
coverage and a reduction in the availability of approved-importer licenses.
This partly reflected an industrial strategy, backed by public investment
financed from the oil boom, designed to push the process of import-
2/   See the World Bank Report, Indonesia:  Policies for Growth and Employment
(Report No. 5597-IND, April 23, 1985).

substitution "upstream" toward basic goods such as cement, chemicals,
fertilizers, synthetic fibers, and iron and steel. Some of these activities
required a higher level of protection than that nrovided by the existing trade
regime, particularly after 1982 when the onset of the world recession lowered
the prices of a wide range of traded goods. Pressures for increased license
restrictions also arose from the slowdown of the domestic economy, wkich left
many of these newer upstream plants carrying excess capacity.
41.       Due partly to these pressures and partly to the deterioration in the
overall balance of payments, the Ministry of Trade issued several decrees in
late 1982 increasing the number of products requiring an approved-importer
license. At the same time, the number of approved traders was reduced, often
to as few as two or three (usually state-owned) companies. Besides nominating
who may import, each decree also established the Ministry of Trade's authority
to fix quotas. For manufactured goods these decisions were based on consulta-
tion with the Ministry of Industry, and were often linked to the deletion pro-
gram: a program designed to increase the local content of various domestic
assembly activities (e.g., motor vehicles, tractors, diesel engines, and
motorcycles).
42.       The iniitial strategy was to select an approved importer for all
products (i.e., put all goods under the approved-importer license category).
The bulk of the decrees extending the coverage of approved-importer licenses
occurred in 1982 and 1983. By 1986, some 1063 CCCN items (202 of the total)
required an approved-importer license, bringing US$2.7 billion worth of
imports (27% of the total) under license restriction (see Table 6). This
control of traders apparently had other objectives besides providing
protection. One such rationale was to establish traders that had a long-term
commitment and professional expertise to import a particular group of
products. It was felt that the approved traders could reduce the range of
brands of a particular imported commodity, which in turn would assist in
developing an after-sales service and eventually an indigenous production
capacity limited to one or two product types.

43.       Partly because the rationale for bringing a particular commodity
under an approved-importer license varied, the degree of protection provided
by the license also varied. In the most restrictive cases (e.g., some iron
and steel, plastic and agricultural products), imports have been channelled
through one approved importer, often accompanied by a binding quota. In other
cases, the one or two approved trading companies apparently set their own
limits on import quantities with consequent price-raising effects. At the
other end of the spectrum, approved-importer licenses were awarded to severaL
trading companies with no overall quota. Of the 1,063 items under
approved-importer license, less than one third (accoijying for 4-6Z of total
imports) are or have been subject to official quotas.-   As a result of the
complexities associated with license status, the degree of protection provided
by the license restriction varied significantly across products.
3/   Of the 296 items listed as eligible for quotas, 7 have zero quotas, 149
have had value or volume quotas, and 140 have no fixed quotas (but
require administrative approval at the time of import). In addition,
there are 9 products for which imports are banned (including automobiles,
motor cycles, TVs and radios in CBU condition). Banned items are not
included in the number of items under license and quota in Table 6.



- 20 -
44.       While license restrictions were on the increase, the Covernment
implemented two policy reforms designed to reduce other trade-policy-related
distortions. First, in March 1985 the Government announced an across-the-
board reduction in the range and level of nominal import tariffs. The tariff
ceiling war reduced from 225% to 601, with tariff rates for most products
ranging from 5% to 35%. The number of tariff categories was also reduced from
25 to 11 (see Table 7). The full benefits of this tariff rationalization were
mitigated by the proliferation of license restrictions. Even so, the fact
that over 80% of the CCCN product items were not under license, together with
the non-discretionary nature of the change in the tariff schedule, resulted in
an unambiguous improvement in the trade regime. For the first six months of
1986, it is estimated that 2yer 70% of total imports by value entered
Indonesia at a 0-5% tariff.'
45.       Second, in April 1985 the Government completely reorganized the
customs, ports and shipping operations. It placed the sensitive job of
certifying imports in the hands of private surveyors (SCS). As SCS has the
capacity to inspect goods at the point of origin, this enabled the Government
to reduce customs procedures in Indonesian ports considerably. After SCS has
certified the import duty rate and the value of the shipment, the importer
pays the import duty directly to his bank. This has reduced both the numbers
of custom officials required and the discretion used at the port of entry. As
a result, the average time spent on customs procedures has been cut by several
weeks, and the cost of freight forwarding has declined enormously (see
para. 9).
4/   This includes those imports that have a tariff greater than 5% but are
exempt under the May 6 export scheme (see paras. 47-49).

46.       Thus, at thie beginning of 1986, the relative importance of the
different tariff and NTB policy instruments had changed. The distorting
effects of the tariff structure had been reduced and important NTBs--
especially the port and customs clearing procedures--had been removed.
However, by reducing the impact of these instruments and by expanding the
coverage of approved-importer licenses, the Government increased the relative
importance of the import licensixig system. As shown in Table 8, this system
has led to Wy1atively high rates of protection in many important manufacturing
activities.-   The high level and variability of protection undermines the
efficient development of the economy in a 'ariety of ways:
51   These estimates relate to 1984.  Recent events, in particular the
devaluation, are likely to have narrowed the difference between domestic
and international prices. Nevertheless, the table still provides a broad
indication of the degree of protection provided to these activities.

(a)  Users in Indonesia have to pay more for the products they
purchase. This reduces consumer welfare and limits the size of the
domestic market. Furthermore, industries that enjoy the highest
protection are those which have tended to show the slowest
improvements in efficiency over the past decade.
(b)  The high protection for upstream industries draws resources into
relatively inefficient capital-intensive activities. This imposes
additional costs on downstream producers and reduces their competi-



- 23 -
tiveness. Restraining the growth of efficient downstream producers
is particularly undesirable because they are generally more
important in providing employment.
(c)  Protection levels are higher for import-competing than for export-
oriented industries. Consequently, the structure of protection
imposes a bias against exports of manufacturers that could
jeopardize Indonesia's non-oil export drive and inhibit the
development of a dynamic and efficient manufacturing sector.
(d)  Finally, the system of import licensing and quotas creates "rents"
for those who are allowed to import.  This in turn diverts resources
and manpower from productive activities, eliminates a potential
source of government revenue (tariffs), and creates opportunities
for abuse.
Recognizing these problems, the Government has introduced two important policy
reforms in 1986 aimed at reducing the impact that import licensing has on the
trade regime.
B. May 6 Package
47.       Indonesia's accession to the GATT Code on Subsidies and CoueteEyail-
ing Duties in 1985 required withdrawal of the Export Certificate Scheme.- As
a result, it became necessary to attack directly some of the factors affecting
the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-oil exports. Accordingly, on May 6,
1986, the Government announced a package of measures designed to provide
internationally priced inputs to exporters. The program allows all "producer-
exporters" (defined as those who export at least 85Z of their total
production) the option of importing their inputs free of restrictions and
exempt from import duties. The significance of this reform goes beyond
allowing imports to be brought in duty-free as it also allows producer-
exporters to bypass the approved traders. Non-specialist exporters (firms
exporting less than 85% of output) are also covered by the scheme, if it can
be established that local suppliers of their raw material are not matching
import competition in regard to quality or price. The scheme also allows
indirect exporters to reclaim import duties through a duty drawback facility.
61   As a scheme for rebating exporters, the Export Certificate Scheme
suffered a number of drawbacks. The level of payment often did not
relate to actual duty cost and was often viewed in importing countries as
a direct subsidy. In addition treatment was uneven, in some cases actual
payment was less than the duties borne: usually for the more competitive
exporters able to compete without subsidy. A final difficulty was that
even if import duties were fully rebated the scheme did not provide a
method for bypassing the approved traders, and therefore did not
compensate exporters for the costs imposed on them by the restrictive
import license system.

48.       Preliminary indications are that the system is working far more
smoothly and covering a larger percentage of imports than might have been
anticipated. As opposed to limiting the scheme to producers that export 85%
of their total production, access is being granted to any 9porter on the
basis of past export history and a confirmed export order.-   This approach
removes the need for the producer-exporter to prove that he is exporting 85%
of total production and enables the executing agency (P4BM) not to become
drawn into the difficult administrative decision of deciding whether local and
foreign prices are comparable, to what extent sole importers are manipulating
their quoted prices, and whether quality considerations are being taken into
account. These characteristics have greatly assisted in implementing the
scheme quickly and in a nondiscretionary manner. Indeed, P4BM has been able
to reduce and standardize the information required to grant producer-exporter
status (basically an export order verified by the exporter's bank and a
"treconciliation" of input-output coefficients). This has several benefits:
(a) it enables P4BM to remain at arm's length from exporters, which reduces
the possibility of negotiations over each application (applications are only
accepted by post or courier); (b) the discretionary power of officials in
determining eligibility is lessened; (c) once exporters become familiar with
the scheme, the costs of applying will be small; and, more importantly, (d) it
should encourage new exporters, as potential investors should be able to
readily assess whether they will have access to the scheme.
49.       The results to date are impressive.  During the first 4 months of
operation, producer-exporter status has been granted on US$228 million worth
of imports (see Table 9), with over 90% of these items (by value) under
license restrictions. This entailed exemption from US$46 million in taxes.
If we extrapolate from this base to a full year, the scheme would cover about
6% of non-oil imports. As with previous export schemes, the major bene-
ficiaries are textile and garment producers (accounting for 54% of all imports
approved for exporters). However, the scheme is also important for other
export activities, including processed foods, chemicals and wood products.
The scheme has therefore been successful in reducing the restrictiveness of
both tariffs and import licensing restrictions across activities.
C. October 25 Reforms
50.       Overview.  On October 25, the Government announced two decrees
concerning trade policy. The first, issued by the Ministry of Trade, revoked
six previous docrees under which 321 items had been restricted to the
approved-importer license category. Over haLf of these items were shifted to
the general-importer category, while the remaining items were reclassified
into four license categories. Two of these categories (allowing imports by
actual users and licensed agents) represent a significant relaxation of
previous license restrictions. Furthermore, these more clearly-defined and
open license categories provide a systematic framework which can be extendtd
71   For example, a domestic firm that sells only 20% of its total production
on the export market can be granted producer-exporter status for the
imports required to produce that 20%.

to cover items not affected by this reform. The second decree, issued by the
Ministry of Finance, altered the import duty applicable to 306 product groups
and stipulated a list of 33 imported goods which could have a surcharge
imposed. About half of the tariff changes were increases, to moderate the
effects of license removal on domestic manufacturers. The tariff reductions
were for inputs not produced domestically, to offset the impact of the recent
devaluation.

51.       The primary objective of the two decrees was to move the majority of
these products away from binding license restrictions toward tariff-only
protection. As such, the October 25 measures signal GOI's intention to shift
to tariffs as the primary instrument of import policy. As noted in the Policy
Statement, this decision is based on several considerations. First, tariffs
provide a more transparent form of protection which automatically prevents
domestic suppliers from increasing prices above world prices by more than the
tariff rate. Second, tariffs are simpler to administer; NTBs create the
potential for abuse and can lead to protracted negotiations among the parties
concerned. Third, tariffs are easier to adjust so as to rationalize the
structure of protection. Finally, tariffs will contribute to GOI's budgetary
revenues and help support priority development programs.
52.       The major impact of the October 25 measures was to remove or relax
import restrictions on 276 items, accounting for 27Z of all items and 44Z of
total import value previously restricted (see Table 10). As discussed below,
the reform focussed an a number of highly protected activities: in parti-

cular, most chemicals, paints and dyes, tires and tubes, paper an4,glass. The
October 25 measures had little impact on the agricultural sector.- Within
the manufacturing sector, a number of important import licensing restrictions
remain, particularly for basic iron and steel, plastics and textiLes (other
than clothing).

53.       Import Licensing.  The underlying rationale of the first decree on
import licensing was to reduce both license coverage and the degree of
restriction implied by a particular license. Over half (166 items) were moved
into the general-importer (IU) category. These products account for 162 of
the CCCN items and 13% of the import value previously restricted to approved
importers. This effectively removes all license restrictions on some
important blocks of products such as tires, glass, paper and dyes (see
8/   About two thirds of the agricultural import value affected by import
restrictions is accounted for by three items: soybeans and soya
flour/meal, cloves and milk products. The World Bank is presently
looking at the impact of these restrictions within the context of an
agricultural incentives study. The findings are expected to be available
for discussion with GOI before the end of the fiscal year.

Table 11). Other important import items affected include synthetic fibers
(for the textile industry), akyl benzene (for detergent manufacturers), some
electrical appliances (e.g., air conditioners, deep freezers, washing
machines, irons and telephones) and motor vehicle parts (e.g., shock
absorbers, radiators and mufflers). Within the manufacturing sector, the
proportion of items removed from restricted licensing is 21% for intermediate
goods, 212 for capital goods and 26% for consumer goods. Most of the items
(127) are intermediate goods, reflecting the prevalence of NTBs (602) in this
category prior to the reform. Tariffs have been raised for 70Z of these
products to offsetyhe removal of license restrictions. However, except for
three minor items,- the new tariffs are within the 60% ceiling set in the
March 1985 tariff reform.
54.       The license restrictions on the remaining items that had been
covered by the six previous decrees were cLarified and, in some cases,
relaxed. For this purpose, four categories of license have been defined, of
which only the first two may be viewed as relaxations of the existing
licensing system:
(a)  Sixty items were classified under the actual-user (IP) license
category. These items can now be imported without restraint by any
producer in the amounts required as inputs in his production
process. Prior to October 25, most domestic producers could only
obtain direct access to those inputs that were on the general import
list. To import commodities on the approved importer list, domestic
producers either had to go through a local approved trader or, in
very few cases, become an approved importer themselves. For those
activities that are characterized by a number of smaller firms,
which may not be able to import directly, approved traders are also
permitted to import the inputs. The direct access of domestic
producers to importer status should prevent the exercise of monopoly
power by any one importer. Most of the items classified in the IP
category are CKD kits or components for machinery and vehicles.
(b)  Fifty items were classified under the licensed-agent (AT)
category. The licensed agent to import a particular brand of
product will be selected by the overseas supplier, subject to
approval by Ministry of Industry. The licensed agent will be free
to appoint subagents. The rationale is to encourage the licensed
agents to provide a limited number of products by brand type, so as
to encourage the development of improved after-sales service
capacity and to standardize spare parts reauirements. Under the new
decree, there will be competition between brands and no import
restrictions on approved product types. All of the products placed
under the AT license category are either mechanical and electrical
equipment or vehicles. Most of these (excluding motor vehicles) are
the completely built-up (CBU) counterparts of the CKD kits placed
under the IP license category. For the most part, the CBU units
9/   The tariff rate was set at 80% for hinges, bolts and staples.

under the AT license have tariffs about 20% above the corresponding
CKO kits, and many are covered by the surcharge provision discussed
below.
(c) Six product groups were classified under the producer-importer (PI)
license category. This restricts access to the domestic producer of
the same final product. Only explosives and cement (3 items each)
were placed in this restricted category.
(d) Last, 39 items were kept under the approved-trader (IT) license
category, which restricts the importation of these products to a few
trading companies.  Although no fundamental change has tak87 place,
t.ie number of approved traders has been broadened to six -   for all
products. Prior to October 25, imports of these products were
restricted to only one or two trading companies. The use of the IT
category has been limited primarily to iron and steel products and
the remaining mechanical and electrical equipment.
55.       In evaluating the significance of the October 25 measures, three
broad judgments are necessary: (a) do the measures focus on those activities
that were highly protected under the previous regime; (b) to what extent are
the new licenses less restrictive than the previous approved-importer license;
and (c) at what level were the tariffs set for those products moved from
license to tariff control. These judgements are best made at the industry or
subsector level where the degree of protection and the extent of the change in
license coverage can be more clearly assessed.
56.       By relating the license changes to the relevant CCCN chapters, the
"block" nature of the October 25 changes becomes apparent. This is
illustrated by the relatively large percentage of items removed from license
restriction or reclassified under the IP or AT category. By comparing tables
8 and 11, it can be seen that the October 25 measures did focus on several
highly protected activities: in particular, most chemicals, paints and ::yes,
tires and tubes, paper and glass. For equipment and vehicles, the story is
more complex. For approximately one third of these products (primarily
electrical appliances and motor vehicle spare parts) license restrictions have
been completely removed. Another one third have been placed in the actual
user (IP) category. These products are mostly mechanical and electrical
machinery--such as bulldozers, tractors and road graders--that are imported as
completely knocked-down (CKD) kits. Before October 25, only a few
manufacturers would have been allowed to import directly and assemblers would
also have been disadvantaged by the deletion program. Under the October 25
measures, all domestic assemblers will be able to import IP products. In
addition, some locally produced components (such as shock absorbers, mufflers
and radiators) have been moved from license to tariff protection which
increases competitive pressures.  The remaining items in the categories of
mechanical and electrical equipment and vehicles are mostly completely built-

up (CBU) units and these have been placed in the licensed-agent category. The
tariff margin of 20% between the CKD and the CBU should result in increased
competition for domestic assemblers (except for automobiles and motorcycles,
where CBU imports are stiLl banned).
57.       It is our judgement that both the Ir  and AT license categories
represent a significanL relaxation of the import licensing restrictions. The
goods under these license categories are no longer subject to quantitative
restrictions, and the access of either domestic producers or traders will be
more open. In particular, the broadening of the import-producer (IP) status
to include all domestic producers, coupled with the movement of a number of
important items into this category, supports the Government's strategy of
moving toward tariff-only control. In the case of the licensed-agent (AT)
category, the fact that the License is defined by brand and not product type,
together with the removal of quantitative restrictions and the freedom to
appoint subagents, should increase competitive pressure in the domestic
markets. For the products classified within these two license categories, the
NTB created by the previous approved-importer system is substantialLy
dismantled. The same cannot be said of the items classified under either the
IT or PI license category, although there is some move toward increasing
domestic competition in the IT category.
58.       As with the May 6 package of reforms, realizing the full benefits of
these trade reforms will require careful monitoring of their implementation.
In particular, the Government needs to monitor licensing under the IP and AT
categories.  In the IP category it is important to ensure that the licensing
requirement is not used to deny producers direct access to imports of their
inputs; and in the AT category sole agents should not be required to restrict
the import of specific items to designated levels. In implementing the new
importer arrangements, other industrial regulations will have to be reviewed
and adjusted in order to avoid negating the positive impact of the trade
reforms.
59.       After the October 25 measures, import license restrictions probably
provide significant protection to less than one-third of domestic value added
in the manufacturing sector.-lt Import license restrictions remain important
in the following manufacturing activities:
(a) the most severe license restrictions (i.e., those generating high
effective rates of protection) are on pharmaceutical products,
plastics, hides and leather, textiles (other than clothing) and
basic iron and steel. Together, these activities account for about
18% of value added in the manufacturing sector. For the textiles
11/ In addition, there are import licensing restrictions on fertilizer and
pesticides (accounting for 26% of manufacturing value added). However,
these do not provide significant protection to domestic industry. In
1984, the effective rate of protection on this activity was close to
zero, and the Indonesian fertiLizer industry has demonstrated that it can
operate at high capacity-utilization and efficiency rates.



- 31 -
and steel subsectors, the World Bank is presently financing studies
aimed at helping the Government design appropriate programs of
subsector restructuring and trade policy reforms. It is expected
that action programs can be defined and some tangible programs
achieved in about a year. In the interim, exporters can import
these items under the prGvisions of the May 6 scheme.
(b) For other metal products, vehicLes and transport equipment
(accounting for another 18Z of manufacturing value added) the
October 25 reforms made significant inroads into import licensing
restrictions. However, some important restrictions remain,
especially import bans on CBU automobiles and motorcycles
(para. 56). Although the number of restricted items is now less
than 10Z of the total in these product groups, they still affect a
relatively large share of the value added in these activities.
60.       Tariffs and Surcharges.  The changing structure of the Indonesian
tariff schedule is illustrated by the frequency distribution of tariff rates
in Table 7. As can be seen, the major tariff reform occurred in 1985, and the
net impact of the October 25 changes is relatively small. Of the 154 items
for which tariffs were increased, 147 items were directly related to the
reuoval or relaxatior. of license restrictions. Based on estimates of nominal
protection rates and selected case studies of activities affected by the
reform, it would appear that the new tariff rates reasonably approximate the
protection provided by the license restrictions. However, the Government
intends to monitor the situation and reduce tariffs if there is evidence of
excessive protection. This will be done in the context of a systematic
medium-term plan for tariff rationalization, which will lead to lower and more
uniform levels of effective protection.
61.       One of the important objectives in moving from NTB to tariff
protection is to set a clear and observable ceiling to the degree of
protection, which is uniform across all domestic producers. Given an
appropriate tariff, this increases the competitive pressures on the least
efficient producers and encourages structural change. The October 25 packages
represents a step toward achieving this objective for a number of important
activities. For example, both container glass and flat glass are manufactured
in Indonesia. Prior to October 25, glass imports were predominantly under
license, with an import ban being used to protect the less efficient flat
glass producers. This has been replaced by an across-the-board tariff on all
glass of 60%, a level at which the domestic manufacturer of flat glass will
face increased competition. In the case of tires, a new specific duty
replaces a virtual ban on imports. While the specific duty does appear to be
on the high side, dowz 7tic producers are likely to face increased competition
for some tire types.-   For paper, license restrictions have been replaced by
a 60% tariff. However, in this case, domestic prices are already close to
121 The new specific duty is Rp 6,000/kg, which translates into an ad valorem
duty of 30-70% depending on the tire weight and value. Domestic prices
in 1984 were 20-40% above world prices.



- 32 -
world prices for many grades of paper due to domestic competition. The main
change is therefore the replacement of a nonbinding import license with a
nonbinding duty.  But having established tariff-only protection, the tarirf
can be lowered to increase competitive pressure. The October 25 reform also
removed rayon and polyester staple fiber from license control with the tariff
rate left at 15%. Synthetic staple fiber is produced by four domestic firms.
with imports previously restricted to one approved trader. According to Bank
estimates, the more efficient domestic producers would be able to operate witn
tariff protection of 15%, but some of the less efficient producers would be
under competitive pressure to reduce costs. This item is covered by the
surcharge provision, but to date this has been set at zero.
62.       The 152 tariff reductions focused on industrial inputs that are not
produced locally. These inputs were apparently selected on the basis of iheir
importance in local production costs, with the objective of offsetting the
cost-raising effects of the SepLember devaluation. For those items that are
inputs into export or lightLy protected import-substituting activities, the
changes have improved the structure of assistance by raising low levels of
effective protection. But for those items that are inputs into license-
protected import-substituting industries, the reduced cost of imported inputs
will encourage domestic output in already highlv protected activities. An
analysis q3 the items for which tariffs were reduced produces a fairly mixed
picture.>    In general, the significance of the changes is small and no
overall pattern emerges.
63.       The October 25 package also specifies 33 goods as potentially
surchargeable. The Covernment intends to use import surcharges as a safeguard
mechanism to protect domestic oroducers against predatory dumping. however,
they will only be imposed on a highly selective and temporary basis, and only
after balancing the interests,2j producers and consumers. To date, oniy three
surcharges have been applied.-    Most of the surchargeable items remain under
a restricted license category. In some cases, the duty has been lowered
(e.g., tin of the type used for packaging goods under pressure) and the sur--
charge provision appears to be a basis for protecting the local tin plate
producer as required. The surcharge provision also applies to the two impor-
tant man-made Fibers taken off license (poiyester fiber and rayon fiber).  'n
t;his case, the degree of protection will involve balancing the demand& of a
large number of downstream users and a few local fiber producers.  The rera.n-
der are focussed on CHU imports of h-eavy machinery (e.g., road rolers, bull-

under license restriction. Of these. 40 were iron and steel goods. a
further 20 items had license rest,-ctions removed at the same tuae as
duties were lowered.  In addition, some 80 items are newly defined, i-e.,
involve a partitioning of an existing tariff item.  For example, the CCCY
classification for wire rope was split into two, which will allow wire
rope over 64 mm to enter at 5% while all other wire rope will be at 20%

dozers, hydraulic excavators, motor graders, tractors and forklifts) to
protect the local assembly of CKD kits.
PART V - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Loan Objectives
64.       The proposed loan was prepared following COr's announcement of the
October 25 reform measures and builds on ongoing active consultations between
the Bank and GOI on macroeconomic management and trade policy issues, both of
which were highlighted in the most recent economic report "Indonesia:
Adjusting to Lower Oil Revenues" (No. 6201-IND, dated May 20, 1986). The loan
was appraised in November/December 1986; negotiations were held in Jakarta
from December 15-19, 1986. The Indonesian delegaLion was led by Mr. Sujitno
Siswowidagdo, Managing Director, Bank Indonesia and included representation
from BAPPENAS and the Ministries of Finance and Trade. Supplementary loan
data are provided in Annex IrI.
65.       The objectives of the proposed loan of US$300 million equivalent are
to:  (a) support the substantial reforms, especiaily in the area of trade
policy, undertaken by the Government during 19e6 and to ensure that they are
i.;plemented well; (b) assist CO.. to bring about an earLy recovery in economic
activity consistent with external and domesLic financial stability; and
(c) maintain the policy dialogue on further reforms for promoting the effici-
er.cy and longer-term viability of the economv. These objectives would be
achieved in part through support to the balance of payments provided by the
proposed Toan and in part through ongoing dialogue on policy issues and
improved institutional arrangements for administration of the trade system. A
related technical assistance loan will be presented to the Executive Directors
in the near future.
B.  'oan Administration
56.       Disbursement.  The proposed loan of US$2-00 million equivalent would
be available for disbursement upon loan effectiveness and would be used to
reimburse 10O0 of foreign expenditures for eligible imports for uhich payments
are made after the date of Loan signing.  The list of ineligible imports for
the purnoses of this loan would be the standard, i.e., goods intended for
military or paramilitary purposes, or for luxury consumption; goods financed
fron, other official multilteera! or bilateral sources; uranium; and goods
procured under contracts of less than US$100,000. Disbursement for reimburse-
ment of eligible import expenditures would be based on documentation prepared
by Societe Generele de Surveillance S.A (SGS) in the course cf their customs
inspecti.on services (see para  9) and which is routinely provided to Bank
Indonesia. The SCS certificate provideS verification of shipment of goods and
their value as well as other information needed to ensure compliance with
eligibility requirements for purposes of the Bank l oan. Disbursement for
eligible import expenditures would be based on Statements of Expenditures
'SOEs) for imports valued at less than US$5 million; for imports valued above
this amount full documentation would be provided.  Applications for
withdrawals based on SOEs would be submit-ted in amourns not less than US$1



-- 34 -
million and supporting documentation would be retained by Bank Indonesia. All
of the proposed loan is expected to be disbursed by June 30, 1987.
67.       Procurement.  Both private and public sector imports would be
eligible for financing. Contracts under U5$5 million each would be awarded on
the basis of normal procurement practices of the purchaser. Contracts for
goods and services estimated to cost US$5 million or more each, would be
procured through International Competitive Bidding in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.
68.       Accounts and Audits.  Bank Indonesia would maintain loan accounts
and supporting documentation. Audits would be carried out by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank within six months of the closing of the GOI
Fiscal year in which disbursements under the loan are made.
C. Monitoring and Follow-up
69.       The Bank would monitor closely, through frequent consultation with
GOI, the progress on implementation of GOI's package of neasures on trade
reform and macroeconomic management. Particular regard would be given to:
(a) continued prudence on fiscal and monetary policies, including scrutiny of
the public investment program; (b) continued appropriate exchange rate manage-
ment; (c) further measures to reduce NTBs and rationalize the tariff
structure; and (d) progress on studies of investment regulations and public
enterprises. Satisfactory progress in these areas could be the basis for a
follow-up loan from the Bank in about a year.
D. Program Benefits and Risks
70.       The adjustment measures taken by GOI over the past year will provide
balance of payments and fiscal stability in the face of lower oil prices, and
help develop the non-oil economy over the medium term. In particular, the
recent trade reform measures represent an important first step in COI's
efforts to reduce long-standing distortions in Indonesia's highly protected
industrial structure; improve international competitiveness of non-oil
exports; and increase potential for foreign investment, especially in export-
oriented industries. In addition, greater transparency and administrative
simplicity would be introduced in Indonesia's trade regime. The principal
risk is that the far-reaching nature of the policy reforms couLd encounter
domestic opposition to full implementation of already-announced measures and
to efforts to take additional measures after further study. These risks are
offset by GOI's demonstrated ability in the past to carry out difficult and
sensitive reforms as described in Parts I and II above.

PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
71.       As of September 30, 1986, Indonesia had received 48 IDA credits
totalling US$908.10 million (leas cancellations) and 113 Bank loans amounting
to US$8,835.10 million (less cancellations). IFC commitments totalled
US$163.2 million.  Annex Ir contains a summary of IDA credits, Bank loan" and
IFC investmenti as of September 30, 1986. The share DE the Bank Group in
Indonesia's public (disbursed) external debt outstanding at the end of 1985
was 14.8%, and the share of debt service 9.72, compared with 14.5% and 8.8%,
respectively, in 1984q From 1968 until 1974, all lending to Indonesia was
made through IDA. Due to the country's improved creditworthiness following
the commodity and oil price boam in 1973174, the bulk of the Bank Group's
lending in the remainder of the 1970. was through [BRD loans, with a modest
amount of IDA lending being justified primarily on poverty grounds, as the per
capita GNP was well below the IDA cut-off level. IDA lending was discontinued
in FY80. Given the critical importance of agriculture (including
transmigration) for employment, food security and exports, over one third of
Bank Croup-assisted projects have been in this sector. In addition, loans and
credits have been extended to virtually all other sectors of the economy,
including transportation, education, urban development, water supply, ruraL
development, industrial development financing (including small-scale
industry), power, telecommunications, population and nutrition, and technical
assistance.
72.       During Repelitas I (1969-74) and II (1974-79), and in line with the
objectives of these first two Five-Year Plans, a high proportion of Bank Group
lending was directed initially toward the rehabilitation and then the expan-
sion of infrastructure and production facilities. Special attention was also
given to meeting the shortage of skilled manpower and technical assistance
needed for preinvestment studies and project execution. Repelita III (1979-
84), published in early 1979, stressed the need for continued high growth and
stability, but departed from previous plans by placing special emphasis on
more equitable income distribution and poverty alleviation. This focus, which
was fully in line with the conclusions of the basic economic report, required
greater attention to employment generation (particularly in the industrial
sector) and to improvements in basic public services. W}:le Bank lending was
already consistent with these objectives, increased emphasis has been given to
these prioritics. However, the adverse economic developments that occurred in
the latter half of the plan period, and the measures taken to address them,
led to a reshaping of development objectives for Repelita IV (1984-89). These
emphasize restoring growth of incomes and employment whil. continuing finan-
cial prudence, promoting structural change toward a more aiversified economy,
and maintaining efforts to improve income distribution an' alleviate
poverty. This shift in focus has underscored the need to follow through on
reforms that have already been initiated, seek increased efficiency in the
economy, mobilize domestic resources to finance needed investments and
recurrent expenditures, and foster a policy environment conducive to the
achievement of required changes.
73.       The Bank has geared its lending and economic work program to address
these needs and to maintain a high level of resource transfer. The approach
is to continue to emphasize the ongoing dialogue on economic policy that has



-- 36 -
been a cornerstone of the Bank's relationship with the Government for many
years, and to coordinate discussion of macroeconomic issues with advice on
institutional and policy reform in important sectors and subsectors, coupled
with lending operations and technical assistance that meet priority needs and
suppcrt institutional improvements in specific areas. Emphasis in economic
work is being given to trade and industrial issues, development of the finan-
cial system, and public resource management. In the lending program, agricul-
ture continues to receive the most attention. However, the program is broadly
based, and includes increasing emphasis on efficiency improvements in the
infrastructure sectors and on education and human resource development.
Continued attention is being given to power and energy, where the Bank is con-
centrating on policies to diversify Indonesia's energy base, rationalize
pricing and improve sector planning. In transportation, the Bank is focusing
on efficiency improvements in the maritime sector and on improving the
national network of highways and rural roads. In urban development and water
supply, lending is being directed toward establishment of appropriate sector
policies and institutional development aimed at strengthening local government
and regional enterprises, in order to minimize demands on the central govern-
ment budget and decentralize the responsibility for addressing basic needs.
In all, the Bank's lending program is intended to contribute about 20% of
Indonesia's capital requirements during the next three years and is expected
to be an important catalyst in attracting other funds. Where possible, we are
seeking also to widen the impact of Bank lending through technical assistance,
as well as complementary investments and coordinated policy dialogue with
other donors.
74.       Implementation, as reflected by disbursements, has gyn steadily
improving gyer the past three years.  The disbursement ratio -  has risen
from 15X 1  in FY84 to about 18.5% in FY86. Although this is not yet a
satisfactory level, this improvement reflects the results of efforts which the
Government and the Bank have been making to address key implementation problem
areas. These include budgeting and budget-release procedures, procurement
procedures, managerial capacity, capacity in the local consulting and con-
tracting industries and land acquisition. Several special Bank missions have
addressed various aspects of these problems and made recommendations, many of
which have been adopted by the Government. Seminars on procurement and dis-
bursement procedures, as well as others which have addressed implementation
problems of specific sectors, have been held, in addition to regular formal
meetings between the Bank and the Government to review implementation and
disbursement performance and project- and sector-specific problems. As a
consequence of these joint initiatives, the Government has acted to streamline
some complex budgetary and financial procedures, improved its information
system, and instituted training programs in procedures and project manage-
ment. In addition, a ministerial-level committee responsible to the president

has been established to monitor implementation performance, as well as a
ministerial comittee on land acquisition. To continue to assist in alleviat-
ing the problems which persist, the Bank has been, and will be in future,
working with the implementation monitoring committee as well as on specific
problem areas agreed with the Government. Activities already underway
include: developing the consulting and contracting industries, improving
budgeting and financial procedures, simplifying reimbursement procedures, and
strengthening management information systems for procurement and pout-contract
implementation monitoring.
PART VII - RELATIONS WITH IMF
75.       The latest IMF Consultation Report, under Article IV, was released
in January 1986, and this year's consultation mission has recently been
completed. OI has not had any standby or extended arrangements with the IMF
since 1973. COI's last purchase from the IMF was for SDR 360 million in 1983
under the compensatory financing facility (CFF). Of the total amount, SDR 318
million had been repurchased by end-1985, and the remaining SOR 42 million is
due in 1988. The authorities are considering making a request for a CFF
drawing based on an anticipated export shortfall in 1986. After the last
consultation report, the IMF Executive Board expressed its satisfaction with
Indonesia's exchange rate arrangement.
PART VIII - RECOMMENDATION
76.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

1818 H St., NM.W
Washingto, D.C. 20433
U. S. A.
Dear Mr. President:
Governunnt's Statemnnt on Economic and Trade Policy
Me Covernuent of Indonesia wishes to request a loan from the
World Bank in support of a program of economic adjustment, especially
in the area of trade policy. Ihis letter provides a description of the
current situation, the actions which the GovenrrEnt has taken and the
direction of future actions.
Macro-Ecoomc Background
1.       Indonesia has faced many challenges in the economic sector mainly
caused by the start of a considerable oil price decline and the wrld
ecomic recession.  In order to cope with the toug situation, the
Gaverrrent in 1983 started to take various actions that were of a short-
term nature as well as those that had a long-term scope, beginning with
the rephasing of large projects, devaluation, overall and fundamental
revision of the taxation system, reductions in subsidies and deregulation
of the banking sector. For the purpose of increasing non-oil export,
fiPRES (Presidential Instruction) No. 4 of 1985 was issued with the
objective of overcoming the "hi'Et cost econofy"' problem, particularly
in the custons, port operation and sea transportation sectors.

2.      In 1986, the sharp drop in the international price of oil caused
severe deterioration in Indonesia's balance of payments and the Govern-
ment's budget. The Govenrnent has taken a series of measures to deal
with the situation as it unfolded. Anticipating weakness in the oil marcet,
tie Govenmyant intwduced an austere budget. incorporating sharp
cutbacks (24'A) in development expenditures. With the exception of some.
foreip aided Projects, there were no new investments started with govern-
umnt funding in this fiscal year. Mnetary policy was also tightened,
leading to a considerable slowing down of credit expansion. As oil prices
continued to slip in mid-year and as it became clear that even in the
medium term the oil price would remain far below the levels prevailing
in 1985, the Government decided to devalue the Indonesian RuLpiah by
31 percent. This substantial devaluation prevented the loss of foreign
excLange reserves throughl speculation and should be a powerful means
of stabilizing the balance of payments and inproving the conditions for
an early recovery in ecornmic activity and incones.
3.      With continued prudence in fiscal and mnnetary policies, the
GovenlTnt expects to halt the deterioration in the balance of paymWnts.
Rapid adjustlient of the balance of paynnts is essential because the
burden of extLrnal dkebt, despite recent constraints (A public borrowing.
is high in relation to the now reduced levels of export earnings.
kIile che tocal debt service ratio was 26% in 1985/86, it is now estimted
at about 377. in 1986/87. While the current account deficit will unavidably
widen to about ; 4.1 billion in 1986/87, an inportant objective of macro-
ecormic management would be to reduce the anual current accotft deficit
to a level below $ 2 billion within the next two years.
4.      The key to ipro t in the balance of payments is accelerated
growth of non-oil exports.  Lthe Governmt is heatened by their growth

-3-
in recent years, from $ 3.9 billion in 1982/83 to $ 6.2 billion last year.
No doubt, the recent devaluation will give an added boost to non-oil
exports, encouraging the utilization of available excess capacity in
the short run and enhancing opportunities for profitable export-oriented
inves tIrents in the medium term. Recogaizing the vical iuporrance of
encouraging non-oil exports, the Govenment introduced i-n Mav L986
a special package of measures designed to ensure that exporters are able
to buy their inputs at internationally compecitive prices. One elenanc
of this scneme is the icport duty exemption/draack available to
exporters. Another important facility provided by this scheme is that
major exporters can irport their inputs directly as needed, corpletely
bypassing the prevailing non-tariff restraints to inports. Our experience
in the last several mnths indicates that the May 6 scheme is being
inplemnted suDothly and efficiently, providing tangible support to exporters.
*.      The Goverruent is fully aware that providing special exemrptions
to exporters is only an interim stage in completing the necessary reforms
in the underlying trade regulation themselves.  Sustained growth in non-
oil exports in a highly competitive international market, with the ever-
piesent threat of protectionism in the industrial countries, requires
that Indonesian manufacturing enterprises operate at much higher levels
of efficiency. Achieving this goal will require changes in the
structure of incentives to redress their current bias against exports-
Twe present system of protection is contriouting to the high
costs in the Indbnesian economy and it is the intention of the Governnent
to rationalize this system as speedily as possible.
Principles of Trade Policy
6.       Mhe policy of rationalization of protection is aimed at the
following objectives



- 48 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 9
MINISTER COORDINATOR FOR THE ECONOMY, FINANCE.
INDUSTRY AND DEVELOPMENT SUPERVISION
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
-4 -
- establislhng a protection structure based mainly on tariffs
rather than import licenses and thus permitting nmre precise
neasurement of the actual degree of protection granted to
Indonesian producers;
- reducing the current bias in incentives against export
activities and in favour of imort substitution;  and
- limiting the level of protection, with special provision
for infant industries which would enjoy higher levels of
protection for specified time periods.
7.       The decision to mnie away from non-tarff barriers and rely on
tariffs is based on several considerations. First, tariffs provide a
more transparent forn of protection, which automatically prevents
domestic suppliers from increasing prices above world prices by mnre than
the tariff rate. Second, tad ffs are simpler to administer; non-tariff
barriers create the potential for abuse and can lead to protracted
negotiations amongst the parties concerned. Third, tariffs are easier
to adjust so as to rationalize the structure of protection. Finally,
tariffs will contribute to the Government's budgetary revenues and help
support priority development programs.
Recent Trade Measures and Future Directions
8.       During the early 1980s, restrictive importer arrangements were
imposed on a range of products. By 1985, about one quarter of inports
were subject tc licensing restrictions. Of these, very few were actually
subject to formal quotas. There have been no new inport restrictions
introduced since March 1986 and the measures of October 25 siguify the
beginning of the trend in the apposite direction.

9.       Under the October 25 nrasures, the Govenrrent revoked 6 decrees
restricting import licensing for 317 items. bbst importantly, approved
importer restrictions were abolished for 165 itans, including tires,
glass, paper and some engineering goods. Another 55 iteim, including
chemicals and knocked-down equipment, can now be inporred without
restraint bv any producer in the mi.ts r-euired is inutCS in. '-3
production process. For 50 items, primarily transport machinery, selected
overseas suppliers will be allowed to appoint licensed agents approved
by the Ministry of Industry, for the purpose of standardizing the product
types and ensuring satisfactory after sales services. There will be no
other restriction placed on these agents by the Government.
The remaining 47 items will continue to be inported by approved traders
and producers of the items only.
10.      For 154 of the item  where import licensing restrictions were
renuved or relaxed, tariffs were increased to protect the balance of
paymmts and provide transitional protection to donestic producers.
Hwever, with only 3 exceptions, the naw- tariffs are within the tariff
ceiling of 6C0/.. Tariffs on another 152 items not produced dotistically
were reduced, mostly to 0-57.. To protect domestic producers against
predatory duxAping, inport surcharges may be incroduced on specified
itces. However, the Governumt will only do this on a highly selective
and temporary basis, and only after balancing producer and consuner
interests.
11.     The recent package of neasures has still left import restrictions
in place on some important product groups such as agricultural output,
steel, plastics, etc. These areas are currently being scrutinized with
a view to achieving further progress in rationalising the system of
protection as rapidly as possible. It is the Government's objective to

eliminate gradually all non-tariff restrictions an imports except on a
small group of products that are hanful to health, strategic to national
defense or involve special economic and social considerations. We expect
to make further tagible progress in this direction within the next year.
12-     The process of aving frm  o-canr:r^ oar-.ers co a car:: f ased
system of protection has involved some increases in tariff levels.
The Coverrint has accepted this as an interim measure in order to gain
wider acceptance of the removal of imporc restrictions.  In the xediun
term, however, it will be necesse-y to rationalize the structure of
tariffs in order to make the industrial sector more efficient, rationalize
the excessive level of protection and increase export capacity.
13.     The process of rationalizing tariffs will start with an early
review of imports that currently attract tariffs above the national
matnun rate of 607. escablised in the 1985 tariff reform, followed by a
phased reduction in the maxinuma nominal tariff rate over the next couple of
years. Thn  Governmnt intends to prepare a systeuatic medium term plan for
tariff reform. For this purpose, it will establish appropriate organization
and processes to uonitor regularly the levels and dispersion of tariff
rates, both nominal and effective, with a view to reducing the differential
between maxnmm and miniman rates.
Investuent Licensing and Public Enterprises
14.     The purpose of tih progressive rationalization of the level and
system of protection is to expose Indonesia's industry to increased
competition from abroad. This will induce it to make the structural
adjustmeats necessary to improve the efficient utilization of existing
resources and foster the creation of a productive system capable, of
ccmeting with foreigi goods an a firm footing. The Government

recognizes that realizing the full potential iirpact of these inprovemnts
wuld also require relaxation of restrictive licensing arrangements on
private investment and domnestic trade. Inportant steps in this direction
for foreign investors have already been taken in the May 6 and October
25 packages. Restrictions on donestic investmnt and trade will be
thoroughly studied during the next year. mhe objective would be to
nitiate extensive deregulation in this area based on the findings of
the study. Greater freedM, from licensing procecdures would unleash
entrepreneurial talent and nobilize rwre financial resources for
investment.
15.     The unsatisfactory financial and operating performance of public
enterprises has inposed additional strain on the Govenmnt budget and,
even more inportantly, has inhibited progress towards enhancing the
efficiency of economic activity in Indonesia. The Goverrnent has
initiated a program to review the performance of selected public enter-
prises and to identify aPpropriate areas for reform, including changes
in the systen of government supervision and control, as well as in rhe
management and financial structure of individual public enterprises.

16.     A stable macro-econonic environmet is iiportant in promoting an
outward oriented industrial structure and enhancing produtive efficiency.
As noted earlier, regaining stability in the balance of payments in the
face of lower oil prices  is  an irportant objective of the GovennPt.

Ever since the first sigis of weakening in the oil markets, the Covnnet
has imposed strict limits on external borroing and austerity in its
own budget operations. The-se policies have helped to restrain inflation
to low levels, but have also led to a dramatic slowdown in economic
growth. It is hoped that the ongoing reform of industrial and trade
policies will provide the incentives to tap new sources of growth and
lead gradually to a recovery in economic activity and incomes. At the
same time, continued budgetary and monetarr restraint is vital in
maintaining macro economic stability and achieving the required adjust-
ment to lower levels of oil revenues.
17.     In view of the continued uncertainty regarding the price of oil,
it is necessary to continue an austere budget for 1987/88. The Goverrmnt
is taking steps to mobilize greater domestic revenues and intends to
restrain budgetted expenditures to the same level in real terms as in
the current year. In allocating development expenditures, the highest
priority will be given to providing satisfactorily expenditures for operation
and maintenance so that greater output can be obtained from available
capital stock, especially in infrastructure facilities. Ongoing projects
will be reviewed and only those projects that promise satisfactory econanic
returns will be funded- This will iMply ChaL several projt4cts,  including
sore with foreign aid, may have to be cut back. New projects wilt be
undertaken providedr they have very high economic benefits and only where
foreign assistance is avaiLable on suitable tenns. An inportant consideratimn
will be the capacity of the project inplementing units to execute the project
at the required pace.
18.     The Governent maintains its strong comitment to the present foreign
exhange system. Exdhange rate policy will continue to epbhasize the objective

of maintaining international corpetitiveness of the Indonesian econWy,
taking account of price and exchange rate mnemets in trading parmers
and competitor countries. An austere budget will assist in restraining
the growth of mney and credit to levels consistent with the growth of
real incomes. While some price increases are inevitable in the afternath
of the last devaluation, the Governmnt ains to reduce the ixxflation rate
to below 7 percent per arrnmn by 1988.
19.     As in the past, the Goverrmnt will act prorrptly to make the
requisite policy adjustments if a fundamental macro-econordc disequili-
briuw emarges.
