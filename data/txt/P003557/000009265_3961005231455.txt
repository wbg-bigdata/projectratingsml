MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FOREST RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed credit of SDR 141.7 million ($200 million equivalent) to
the People's Republic of China to help finance the Forest Resource Development
and Protection Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds of the development credit would be
on-lent to the provincial governments as follows: the portion of the credit
for establishment of timber plantations and related activities would be onlent
for 20 years, including 8 years of grace on principal repayments, with inter-
est at 4.5 percent per year; and the portion of the credit for establishment
of protection forests and related activities would be on-lent for 25 years,
including 10 years of grace on principal repayments, with interest at 2.5 per-
cent per year. The foreign exchange risk between Special Drawing Rights and
local currency would be borne by the provincial governments. Cofinancing for
biodiversity conservation activities will be requested from the Global Envi-
ronment Facilitv (GEF), once it has been replenished.
2.        BackcTround.  The forestry sector plays a critical role in the Chi-
nese economy, providing 40 percent of rural household energy, almost all of
the lumber and panel products for the large construction sector, and raw mate-
rial for the large domestic pulp and paper industry. The resource base is
small and the forest cover amounts to only 0.11 hectares per capita, which is
significantly below the world average of 0.77 hectares per capita. Forest
land is divided into two categories: natural forests, which are located in
isolated areas in the northeast and southwest and account for 95 percent of
standing wood volume; and plantations, which account for 25 percent of forest
area but only 5 percent of standing volume, since most are newly established.
China's forests are managed primarily for four different end-uses: timber,
shelterbelts, nature reserves, and fuelwood.
3.        China, the third largest consumer of timber in the world, faces a
worsening imbalance between supply and demand for wood products. The present
consumption level exceeds the annual growth increment of the forests and total
imports by about 50 million m3 per year. As a result, about 500,000 hectares
of forest area are lost each year, equivalent to one-half of one percent of
total forest area, leading to increased soil erosion, loss of plant and wild-
life habitat, and other environmental degradation. Most of the deforestation
occurs in areas of mature and over-mature forests, which is contributing to a
severe imbalance in the age-class structure of forests.
4.        The Government is taking a number of steps to expand supply and
manage demand, including extensive investment in a wide variety of afforesta-
tion programs and promulgation of new regulations encouraging conservation and
substitution. The Government's sectoral development program is supporced by a
relatively sound policy framework (including secure land tenure, marrket-based



-2-
resource pricing for 90 percent of all timber, and increased emphasis on pri-
vate sector activity) and a good institutional framework (the Ministry of
Forestry has effectively managed national afforestation programs, including
three earlier IDA operations). Key issues for continued sustainable develop-
ment of the sector in the medium-term include: (a) raising the productivity of
resource use through improvements in planting stock development and silvicult-
ural management; (b) strengthening institutional capacity for long-term sector
planning and management; (c) developing comprehensive integrated management
plans for forest resources, particularly nature reserves and shelterbelts; and
(d) improving the efficiency of the wood processing sector through continued
reform of the policy framework for state-owned enterprises.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  The three previous
forestry projects in China, the 1991 forestry report by the Operations Evalua-
tion Department (Report No. 9524), and the 1991 Board paper on forestry
(Report R-91-96/1) have generated the following lessons for China: (a) the im-
portance of new technology development in raising timber productivity, such as
performance-selected species, improved planting materials, and more efficient
planting practices; (b) the need to imrrove the links between silvicultural
research and afforestation establishment to facilitate technology transfer;
(c) the importance of integrating managc2ent of protected and unprotected
natural forest areas into sector resource management plans; and (d) the impor-
tance of applying policy reform at field level and enhancing institutional
capacity in the sector. In response to these lessons, the proposed project
has been desi yned to introduce new silvicultural technologies; strengthen
institutional linkages between research and afforestation activities; incorpo-
rate protection forests and nature reserves into project activities; review
key policy issues in pricing and trade; and strengthen institutional capacity
for sector plannina and management.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project complies with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for China, as presented to the Board on
August 3, 1993. The strategy highlights the need to support interventions in
the agricultural sector aimed at income enhancement, poverty alleviation, and
sustainable environmental development in regions of concentrated absolute
poverty. The proposed project is a direct outgrowth of this strategy, as it
supports a comprehensive environmental investment program in poor, remote
areas across China. The project, which continues IDA's role as the leading
donor in forestry in China, would support several technology, institutional,
and policy changes that would likely not occur without IDA involvement. These
include introduction of new silvicultural techniques, watershed land use
models, environmental management guidelines, research trials, information man-
agement systems, and human resource development programs. In addition, IDA
involvement would facilitate mobilization of GEF invest,"ent funds and techni-
cal assistance for biodiversity conservation. The three earlier operations
have demonstrated IDA's comparative advantage in developing large investment
projects that redress technical deficiencies in China's traditional silvicult-
ural system, restructure institutional arrangements, and disseminate best
practices.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project is designed to enhance the produc-
tivity of forest resources, the efficiency of resource use, and the institu-
tional capacity for sustainable management in the three major types of forest



- 3 -
land in China: plantations, watershed protection forests, and nature reserves.
The project would expand the supply of commercial timber and pulpwood; develop
improved models for watershed management; enhance biodiversity conservation
through the protection of nature reserves; strengthen the operating efficiency
of technical support services in the forestry sector, particularly planting
materials, research, and extension programs; and strengthen the capacity of
forest sector institutions in planning and management.
8.        Prolect Description.   The project would comprise the following six
components. The Intensively Managed Plantation Component would establish
620,000 hectares of plantations for timber, pulpwood, and pit props on barren
or degraded land in sixteen provinces as the second phase of the improved
plantation program initiated under the National Afforestation Project (NAP)
(68 percent of total costs). The Multiple-Use Protection Forest Component
would establish 280,000 hectares of watershed protection forests in the middle
and upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin in Sichuan and Hubei Provinces
based on new silvicultural models and improved land-use planning (13 percent
of total costs). The Nature Reserves Management Component would enhance
biodiversity conservation through support for new management programs in five
nature reserves, improved management of natural forest habitats for Giant
Pandas and other endangered species, and development of new training, re-
search, and information management programs (6 percent of total costs). The
Planting Stock Development and Nursery Management Component would raise the
quality of planting materials through introduction of improved genetic materi-
al and nursery management technologies, and support the production of the 2.1
billion seedlings required under the project (12 percent of total costs). The
Research and Technology Transfer Component would strengthen the operational
focus of research and extension through provision of technical assistance and
operating support for eleven priority research programs, demonstration planta-
tions, and extension activities (1 percent of tota': costs). Finally, the
Institutional Capacity Building Component would strengthen the capacity of
forestry institutions through support for training and technical assistance,
development of information management systems, development of a new private
sector investment promotion agency, improved natural forest management, and
policy studies (1 percent of total costs).
9.        The project cost is estimated at $356.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of $58.0 million equivalent (16 percent of total
costs). The Association would finance $200 million equivalent (56 percent of
total costs). :4 Global Environment Trust Fund (GET) grant of $18.4 million
will be requested under the first tranche of GEF operational phase projects to
finance the nature reserves component (5 percent of total costs). To facili-
tate early start-up activities of the project, retroactive financing of up to
$11 million equivalent is proposed for expenditures made after September 1,
1993 related to first-year afforestation requirements. A breakdown of project
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methiods,
disbursement amounts, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Project map
IBRD No. 25549 is also attached. Tne Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12762-CHA,
dated May 9, 1994 is being distributed separately.
10.       Proiect Implementation.  The Ministry of Forestry (MFO) would have
overall responsibility for implementation. A national leading group has been



- 4-
established under the leadership of the Minister oL Forestry that sets the
principles and policies for the afforestation program, approves the overall
implementation plan, and coordinates inter-ministerial discussions. The Pro-
ject Management Center in MFO, which currently manages NAP, would have direct
responsibility for implementation arrangements, including establishment of
technical standards, approval of provincial work and financing plans, supervi-
sion of provincial inspection and reporting programs, and management of a
variety of centralized administrative services such as international procure-
ment and selection of consultants. Similar leading groups and project manage-
ment offices (PMOs) would be established at provincial and county levels. In
addition, Seedling Production Coordination Groups would be established to
supervise production and distribution of planting materials; the Research and
Extension Support Panels established under NAP would continue to identify
research and extension priorities; and the Central Research Groups established
under NAP would continue to manage the agreed research programs. The selec-
tion of afforescation entities has emphasized non-state production units (pri-
marily collective forest farms, share-holding forest farms, and individual
households) with a demonstrated commercial focus, including financial autonor..y
from government, strong profit performance, and complete responsibility for
all project debt service.
11.       Prolect Sustainabilitv.  Institutional sustainability is addressed
through a comprehensive program of technical assistance, training, ar.d study
tours to strengthen existing capacity and ensure development of long-term
management skills in PMOs, research and extension institutions, and project
beneficiaries. Financial sustainability is addressed through an appropriate
cost recovery program based on project taxes and charges. Environmenta'l sus-
tainability is addressed through the introduction of detailed environmental
protection and monitoring guidelines for the plantation and protection forest
components, which are designed to strengthen safeguards against problems from
insect and disease outbreaks, soil erosion and fertility loss, fire, and eco-
logical degradation.
12.       AcTreed Actions.  The following are the main assurances obtained at
negotiations: (a) all plantations and protection forests would be established
in accordance with afforestation models acceptable to IDA; (b) the arnual work
and financing plans for the plantation and protection forest programs for the
next calendar year would be furnished to IDA for review by December 31 of each
year; (c) an evaluation report for the current year and a work plan for the
next calendar year for the planting stock development and nursery management
program, the research program, and the extension program would be furnished to
IDA for review by December 31 of each year; (d) all project activities would
be carried out in accordance with an environmental management plan acceptable
to IDA; (e) the portion of the IDA credit for establishment of plantations
(and related planting material, research and extension, and capacity building
activities) would be on-lent to the final beneficiaries at an annual interest
rate not to exceed 4.5 percent for funds on-lent in foreign exchange and 6.5
percent for funds on-lent in local currency, with a repayment period of 20
years, inclusive of eight years' grace period on principal repayments; (f) the
portion of the IDA credit for establishment of protection forests (and related
planting material, research and extension, and capacity building activities)
would be on-lent to the final beneficiaries at an annual interest rate not to
exceed 2.5 percent for funds on-lent in foreign exchange and 4.5 percent for
funds on-lent in local currency, with a repayment period of 25 years, inclu-



- 5 -
sive of ten years' grace period on principal repayments; (g) MFO and the prov-
inces would undertake with IDA a midterm review of the progress of and pros-
pects for implementation by September 30, 1997; and (h) as a condition of
effectiveness, the government would issue Project Implementation Rules (PIR),
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, and would provide written acceptan-
ces that all afforestation project provinces agreed to abide by the PIR and
on-lending terms.
13.       Environmental Aspects.  The project would generate significant envi-
ronmental benefits, including increased forest cover, protection of
biodiversity of global significance, and reduced soil erosion, flooding and
river sedimentation. However, the project would support some activities with
potentially adverse impacts, such as earthworks in plantations, small blocks
of monoculture, and pesticide use. Consequently, an environmental analysis
report was prepared that identified specific mitigation measures, including
strict controls on the size of single species planting blocks, prohibitions on
clearing of existing forest areas, and detailed specifications for site prepa-
ration, water conservation, and pest and fire control requirements.
14.       PL.oqram Obiective Categories.  The project relates to three areas of
special operational emphasis. First, the project contributes to environmen-
tally sustainable development since it supports income generation through
afforestation of denuded forest land and environmentally fragile watersheds.
Second, the project would have a particularly strong impact on poverty reduc-
tion since it focusses on resource constrained, remote areas, which are char-
acterized by limited access to productive land, low agricultural productivity,
limited off-farm employment, and underdeveloped human capital. Twenty percent
of the project beneficiaries fall below the absolute poverty line. Third, the
policy and institutional reforms supported under the project would promote
private sector development, particularly increased levels of direct foreign
investment in wood processing and domestic investment in afforestation.
15.       Project Benefits.  The project would produce about ii1~ million m3 of
timber, lJ.8 million tons of fuelwood, and miscellaneous forest products such
as bamboo and resins, with a total value of $6.0 billion at current financial
prices over the 33-year life of the project. The focus on afforestation and
watershed rehabilitation would create significant environmental benefits, as
reviewed above. For example, it is estimated that the protection forest pro-
gram would reduce sediment discharge in the Yangtze River basin by a total of
412 million tons of soil over a thirty-year period, for a total value of $11.8
million based on the current costs of sediment removal in dams in project
areas. The project would generate over 350,000 person-years of work for
600,000 rural households during the six-year implementation period. Project
employment and production would lead to a five-fold increase in annual per
capita income for beneficiaries. This would support greater levels of
consumption and investment and, consequently, would break the poverty cycle
for the poor households. The project has an overall economic rate of return
of 18 percent, excluding the valuation of indirect environmental benefits.
16.       Risks.  Since MFO has a strong record in managing large afforesta-
tion programs, there are few technical and institutional risks. The main
risks include: (a) an unexpected decline in domestic prices for certain pro-
ject outputs, which has been addressed through a high degree of diversifica-
tion of species and end-products in the project design; (b) inadequate provi-



-6-
sion of local counterpart funding during implementation, which has been
addressed through an understanding that failure to provide local funds on a
timely basis would result in the exclusion of the afforestation entity, coun-
ty, or provincial government in continued inxvolvement in the project; and (c)
an outbreak of pests or diseases, which has been addressed through a compre-
hensive forest health monitoring program and provision of pesticides as re-
quired during implementation.
17.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
