MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR AN EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for SDR 19.7 million
(US$26.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit, on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, would help finance
the rehabilitation of primary education and of the education cector's
institutions.
2.        Background:  Education in Somalia is in a state of crisis:
education's share of Government's recurrent expenditures has declined
dramatically from an already low 112 in FY80 to only 1.57 in FY88,
endangering the continued existence of public education. School
enrollmenits are down (in 1988, only 10 percent of primary age children were
in school) and the quality of instruction is low. Factors which have
contributed to this decline at the primary level include: (a) low teacher
salaries. which at about US$70 yearly amount to only one quarter of per
capita GDP, compared to an average in Eastern Africa of live times per
capita GDP; (b) the inexperience and lack of training of many primary
teachers, whose average stay on the job is only 4.3 years; (c) severe
shortage of textbooks and instructional materials; (d) dilapidated state
of school buildings and furniture; (e) lack of educational supervision and
school inspection; and (f) absence of a sound examination and achievement
testing system. Similar problems exist throughout the education sector
except at the National University or Somalia which receives considerable
budgetary and technical assistance from Italy. The average annual rates of
decline for primary, secondary and technical and vocational education from
their peak levels in the 1980s were, respectively, 7.4 percent, 9.1 percent
and 11.1 percent. In contrast, enrollments in higher education increased
steadily and consistently with an average annual increase of 24.7 percent.
3.        The decline of public education, especially at primary level,
inhibits Somalia's ability to build a literate and numerate labor force and
thut. jeopardizes its long-term development prospects. The Ministry of
Education and Culture (MOE), aware of the long term consequences of past
and present neglect of education, has initiated actions to address these
problems: In 1990 the education budget was increased by about 82% in real
terms over the 1989 budget, compared to an increase of about 25% in real
terms between 1988 and 1989. In addition, following IDA's advice, MOE is
in the process of: (a) introducing policy and institutional changes in
order to improve the operational efficiency of the system; (b) dismissing
non-working primary teachers from the civil service; (c) strengthening the
communities' involvement in and support for the operation and maintenance
of their primary schools; and (d) reducing the financial burden on the
population by adjusting the school calendar to the agricultural seasons and
by waiving requirements for school uniforms. These last measures will be
on an experimental basis in four administrative regions and will be closely
monitored and evaluated.

4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  To prevent a collapse of the
education system, Somalia urgently needs both a restructuring of its public
expenditures to increase the share of education, as well as support from
the donor community. At the same time, it needs to establish an orderly
strategy for the full recovery of the education system, starting with
primary education as the building block. This is why government approached
IDA as the agency best placed to coordinate a multidonor analytical and
financial effort. In the context of recent discussions on resource
allocations through the Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER), agreement has
been reached that the share of education s#ill be raised significantly over
the life of the proposed project. The proposed project is intended to make
an initial contribution to the longer term process of rehabilitating
primary education. Further investments in education would be required in
the future. The project, anticipating that improvements will occur,
therefore also focuses on strengthening the institutional capacity of the
MOE and on laying the foundation for further investments in education by
IDA and other donors, including OPEC and EEC.
5.        Project Objectives:  The central objective of the proposed
project is to revitalize the education system through sustainable measures
designed to restore teaching quality and to reverse the decline in
enrollments. To achieve this objective the project will: (a) improve the
quality of primary education nationwide through teacher and headmaster
training and provision of textbooks and teachers' guides; (b) strengthen
the  uOEis institutional capacity for planning and managing the education
system and for implementing investment projects; and (c) increase access to
primary education in 4 of the country's 18 administrative regions through
the construction and/or rehabilitation of primary schoo'.s.
6.        Project Description:  The proposed project would provide support
for:
(a)  Teacher Upgrading:  Development and delivery of (i) in-service
upgrading programs for about 1,500 primary teachers (about one-
quarter of the current teaching force); and (ii) professional
development programs for about 300 headmasters, school
inspectors, regional and district education officers.
(b)  Textbooks:  (i) printing of about 1.6 million locally-developed
textbooks and 100,000 teachers' guides and their distribution to
all primary schools; (ii) establishing a pilot cost recovery
scheme in the Benadir region; and (iii) further strengthening
the textbook writing and manuscript preparation programs of the
Curriculum Development Center (CDC).
(c) Institutional Development: Strengthening of the MOE with
support for: (i) the Departments of Planning, Finance, Personnel
and Primary Education to improve data collection and analysis,
strengthen budget preparation, improve personnel management,
strengthen management of primary education and community
mobilization, and streamline operational systems and procedures;
(ii) the School Inspectorate for effective school inspection on
a regular basis; (iii) the National Examinations Board (NEB) to



- 3 -
improve its competence in test construction, measurement and
evaluation; and (iv) the Office of the Minister to establish
monitoring and evaluation functions.
(d) Physical Facilities: Rehabilitation or construction of about
120 primary schools in four regions (Lower Shebelle, Middle
Shebelle, Bay and Gedo), benefiting about 48,000 students;
provision of school furniture, book storage space, community
meeting space, water supplies and latrine blocks; construction
and furnishing of about 120 staff houses for headmasters, and
office space for district education officers and school
inspectors; and establishment of in-service training facilities
for 600 teachers per annum in three locations.
(e) Project Management: Strengthening the existing project
implementation unit (PMU) for effective implementation of the
rehabilitation program and for coordinating and monitoring all
educational activities financed by the project.
7.        The project would be implemented by the Ministry of Education
and Culture over a seven year period. The project would finance civil
works, furniture, equipment, materials, training programs, specialist
services and selected operational costs. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$32.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$25.2 million (77Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Somalia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Map and the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8180-SO dated March 9, 1990 are also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions:  The government has submitted to the Association
(a) a letter of educational policy intent; (b) a plan of action on policy
and institutional development identifying specific measures for
implementing the policies; (c) a five year education sector financing plan
for FY90-94; and (d) evidence indicating that the 1990 budget has allocated
to MOE the agreed minimum amount required for financing of the education
sector. The 1990 budget includes provisions for 130 percent increase in
basic salaries for teachers and a raise between 200 percent to 400 percent
in professional teaching allowances for different categories of teachers.
9.        During negotiations, the government gave assurance  regarding:
(a) preservice teacher training capacity; (b) timing of teacher career
incentives; (c) policy measures for primary teacher caLedr development; (d)
conditions of service for Somali teachers and headmasters; (e) pilot cost
recovery schemes for textbooks in the Benadir region; (f) conclusion of
contractual arrangements between MOE and Community Education Associations
(CEA) before funding of school rehabilitation; (g) joint annual reviews of
the implementation of policy measures, budget allocations, expenditures,
and project components; (h) institutional arrangements for the proposed
PMU, including its Educational Facilities Section (EFS); (i) the
establishment of NEB; (j) and conduct of monitoring and evaluation



- 4 -
functions. As a condition of effectiveness, the PMU within MOE would have
been established, and the Director of the PMU and the Advisor on Evaluation
and Monitoring would have been appointed. Conditions of disbursement for
the primary school reconstruction component would be: (a) satisfactory
progress in establishment and operation of CEAs (b) satisfactory operation
of the EFS.
10.       Benefits:  The project will concentrate on the rehabilitation of
primary education, which plays a seminal role in the development of
Somalia's human resources. It will provide resources needed for quality
improvements and increased access to education, and restore the financial,
institutional and human basis for long-term sustainable sector development.
The project will also support community participation on an experimental
basis. The project will directly benefit about 480,000 students and 8,000
teachers country-wide by providing textbo ks and teaching materials over
the project period.
11.       Risks:  The major risks associated with this project are: (a)
that the Government may not provide an adequate budget for education for
the years 1991-199i,; (b) that teachers and officials of the Ministry of
Education and Culture will leave the education system for more lucrative
employment; (c) that rural communities may not be able to provide sustained
support for their schools; and (d) that the civil unrest may spread,
drawing more resources away from the social sectors and undermining the
developmental goals of the project. The problems of under-financing will
be reviewed annually at the macro-level through Policy Framework Paper
(PFP) discussions and PER process and at the project level through annual
implementation reviews. The risk at (b) will be addressed by establishing
a more attractive career structure for teachers and introducing incentives
linked to teacher training. With respect to the risk at,(c) project-
financed community education officers will assist communities in developing
viable and sustainable mechanisms of support. This aspect of the project
is of a pilot nature, and it is understood that community support may only
be realized in the form of services, not financing. To cover the risk at
(d) the design of the project allows for flexibility in implementation,
such as relocation of construction activities to more secure administrative
regions and adjustments to the number of textbooks to be provided.
12.       Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
