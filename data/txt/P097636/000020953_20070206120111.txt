          THIRD PUNJABEDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                              CREDITAND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:      Islamic Republic o f Pakistan

Implementing   Government o f Punjab
Agency:
Beneficiary:   Province o f Punjab

Amount:        SDR 69.6 million (US$lOO million equivalent)

Terms:         Standard IDA terms; 35-year maturity with 10-year grace period

Description:   The purpose o f this proposed third development policy credit i s to support the Punjab
               Province's three year Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP). This proposed
               credit would complete the series o f annual programmatic development policy credits
               (DPC) in support o f PESRP. Phase I1o f PESRP i s being prepared by the Punjab
               Government, and the Bank has been requested to support it through a new series of
               annual DPCs.

               Key pillars o f the PESRP are:      (A) public finance reforms to increase public
               spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal
               sustainability; (B) reformsthat strengthen devolution and improvethe fiduciary
               environment and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve
               quality, access, and sector governance.

               There has been steady progress during the past two years, and the Program i s
               showing improvements in enrolment and in reducing the gender gap at the primary
               and middle school levels. The proposed third credit will assist the Government in
               completing the agreed reformframework.

Benefits:      Before the first Credit this programwas considered a high-benefit, high-riskprogram
               but progress to date inimplementation shows a reduction inrisk and higher benefits
               than anticipated.    The main benefits o f the Program are resulting from the
               improvements in primary and middle school enrolments, reduction in gender
               disparities, and changes in sector management and monitoring. The Program has
               introduced performance-based incentives for districts, which has led to strengthening
               o f the decentralization process and to improvements in service delivery and
               outcomes. If the Program maintains its performance, it would contribute to helping
               the country move towards the MDG related to universal primary enrolment and
               closing the gender gap.      It was anticipated at the time of the first credit that
               improvements in education outcomes in Punjab, which i s the largest province o f
               Palustan, would have a country wide impact. This impact i s happening sooner than
               expected.    The initial success o f PESRP i s demonstrating to other provinces,
               especially NWFP and Sindh, the potential rapidbenefits that can be brought about by
               a comprehensive reform effort.

R i s k s and    Before the first credit, a major risk expected came from Pakistan's history o f
Mitigation       stagnation in education indicators due to lack o f sustained high level support to the
Strategy:        education agenda. The experience shows that the riskmitigating measures identified
                 were appropriate. The program continues to have political support at the highest
                 political level. However, there i s always an inherent political risk in democratic
                 systems that change in government through the electoral process can shift priorities.
                 The intensive awareness campaign and early indications o f enrolment increases have
                 generated rising expectations among the public. It i s likely that continued public
                 pressure would help in ensuring reform continuity despite any change o f
                 government.

                 Enrolments continue to show rapid increases. This can be a major risk if quality
                 improvements do not keep pace with enrolment increases. Factors mitigating this
                 risk are: (a) provision o f teachers and infrastructure based on school-specific needs;
                 (b) launch of a comprehensive teachers' professional development program; (c)
                 establishment o f an independent Examination Commission; and (d) Government's
                 agreement to increase sector expenditures in accordance with the growing demand
                 for education.

                 Another major risk i s related to the evolving roles and responsibilities o f the local
                 governments relative to the Provincial Government. While the riskremains, it i s less
                 significant.   Moreover, the early successes have added to the credibility o f the
                 program. The provincial government i s buildingthe ownership of the newly elected
                 district governments. The risk mitigating measure i s that given the early successes
                 o f the program, and the incentive o f increased resources for education, the district
                 governments will continue the partnership with the Provincial Government.

                 A potential risk i s related to possible weakening o f the macroeconomic framework
                 due to increasing fiscal and trade deficits.      The Government, however, remains
                 committed to take all necessary actions to maintain macroeconomic stability.

   PROGRAMDOCUMENTFORA PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                          TO THE ISLAMICREPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
       FORA THIRD PUNJABEDUCATIONDEVELOPMENTPOLICY CREDIT
                                           I.OVERVIEW

1.       The Punjab Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC-111) would be the third' and
last of a series o f development policy credits to support the first phase o f the Punjab Province's
Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP), covering 2003-2006. The program was supported
through the US$ 100 million Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), which was
approved by the Board inFebruary 2004, and through the Second Punjab Education Development
Policy Credit (PEDPC 11) o f US$ 100million, which was approved by the Board inMarch 2005.
The proposed PEDPC I11would support completion o f the first phase o f the medium term sector
reforms. It would build upon the past achievements, and would also help to deepen reforms as
the Program moves into Phase 11. Based on continued good performance on reform
implementation, it i s expected that the Bank will provide continued support to through a new
DPC series.

2.       Key pillars o f the three year PESRP are: (A) public finance reforms to increase public
spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B)
reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and
governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and sector
governance.

3.       Government commitment to reform has been a key factor driving the successful
implementation of the first phase reforms.            The Program has received national level
recognition, and other provinces, especially NWFP and Sindh, are seeking to replicate the
experience o f PESRP. Political commitment and ownership have been maintained as evidenced
by: (a) the continued oversight by the highlevel Program Steering Committee, directly reporting
to the Chief Minister; (b) annual increases to the education budgets in accordance with the agreed
Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF); (c) continued updating o f school data and use for
analysis and policy development; and (d) maintenance o f annual terms o f partnership (TOP)
agreements between the provincial and district governments.

4.       An integral part of the PESRP has been the formal terms of partnership (TOP)
arrangement between the provincial and district governments and the introduction of
performance-based incentives to improve service delivery. The TOP agreements include very
specific performance indicators and annually updated targets for each district. Performance
against the agreed targets has been encouraging fiom the start o fthe program to-date.*

5.       Participation of stakeholders has been instrumental in the development and
implementation of the reform program. An extensive consultation process was undertaken
duringthe design o f the reform program, and continuing dialogue with stakeholders at all levels
forms an integral part o f PESRP.        After the August 2005 local government elections, the
provincial Government has renewed the consultation process to ensure that the newly elected
district governments develop an understanding and ownership o f the reformprogram.




  The lst (PESAC) was approved prior to the issuance of the new guidelines which changed the Adjustment
          Credit
  Credits to DevelopmentPolicy Credits.
  See Table 2 for details.

6.        The initial impact of the program in enhancing access to education is encouraging
and Punjab's performance during the past two years has been better than the other
provinces. After years o f stagnation, from Academic Year 2004 there have been significant
improvements inpublic school enrolment at the primary and middle levels, with an additional 1.8
million children enrolled in the public system since the start o f the reformprogram. Second, the
gender gap i s also narrowing, moving Punjab closer towards achieving gender parity inenrolment
ingovernment schools. These improvements have been accompaniedby on time delivery o f free
textbooks to elementary level students and stipends for girls studying in grades 6 - 8 in
government schools o f targeted fifteen low-literacy districts3.

7.        These achievements have been underpinned by an overhauled monitoring and
evaluation system. A comprehensive monitoring system continues to be implemented by the
Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) o f the Department o f Education. The
efforts at the provincial and district levels are being supplemented through third party validation
exercises to verify program inputs and progress. Punjab's education monitoring and management
information system (EMIS) i s now recognized country-wide, and the Government o f Sindh
province and the Federal Ministry o f Education have initiated technical dialogue with the Punjab
team to benefit from the systems developed under PESRP.

8.        The program being supported under the proposedthird credit seeks to accelerate
progressin the quality agenda, and deepen the effortsto expand access as well as retention.
In particular, teacher professional development, measurement o f student learning outcomes
through an independent Examination Commission, and reform in the area o f textbook
development are part o f the quality agenda.                 Programs have been launched by the Punjab
Education Foundation (PEF) to support the low cost private sector including direct financial
assistance to private schools, teacher training for low cost schools on a cluster basis, and vouchers
of choice to households. While these initiatives are still at a nascent stage, a serious effort i s
being made to support the low cost private education sector through public financing.

9.        Building upon the experiences, achievements, and lessons learnt, the Punjab
Government is now preparing the framework for Phase IIof PESRP. I t recognizes that a
longer time horizon is required to accomplish both quantitative and qualitative
improvementsin the sector. The enrolment increases mask the grade by grade transition rates
which continue to show high drop out rates especially from pre primary to Grade Iand from
Grade IV to Grade V. In addition, quality o f education remains low as determined through
student performance in sample assessments. Thus, in the next phase, the provincial authorities'
focus i s on deepening reforms for improving education quality, taking specific measures to
reduce the drop out rate, and providing support to l o w performing schools and districts. Analysis
o f school results will enable provision o f differentiated support especially in the poorer regions
and districts. Governance reforms will be further strengthened to focus on teacher accountability,
including by adding a performance indicator on teacher attendance inthe TOPS. Interventionsto
reduce gender and regional inequities will be strengthened, including scaling up feasible models
withprivate sector support beingimplemented through PEF4.

 10.      After the completion o f this DPC series, future IDA support for education would be
formulated in parallel with the Government's preparation o f Phase I1o f PESRP. The indicative
triggers and actions under the new series o f DPC credits will be firmed up after the design o f
Phase I1i s completed.



   Free textbooks were distributed to 6.5 million children inApril 2004 at the start o fthe academic year (Katchi -

          12.       Owing to the economic and structuralreforms implemented by the Government of
          Pakistan, the national economy's growth continues to accelerate. A healthy growth in
          agriculture reinforced the continued robust performance o f the large-scale manufacturing sector
          to post a growth rate o f 8.4 percent in FY05 -- the highest rate in two decades and among the
          highest in the world during the year (see Table 1). The FY06 data available to date indicate
          that economicgrowthwould continueto be strong, at around 6.3 percent.

          13.      Unlike the last two years, growth in FY05 was generated by strong domestic demand, as
          growth in domestic consumption and investment overcame the negative effect of net exports.
          Although exports grew at a healthy 16percent, a sharp increase inoil prices and continued strong
          import demand led to a 38 percent increase in total import. This exerted heavy pressure on
          foreign exchange reserves, which fell to US$ 10 billion (over 4 months of imports), despite
          increased non-debt inflows and higher concessional financing from the World Bank and the
          Asian Development Bank (ADB).

14.      Despite some increase in budgetary deficit, overall fiscal balances have remained
sustainable. Through the Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw, the Government has committed itself to an
ambitious fiscal adjustment. The fiscal deficit i s to be maintained at below 4 percent o f GDP
through increased revenue collection and prudent expenditure and debt management. The public
debt is to fall to about 60 percent o f GDP in FY06. Despite some increase in fiscal deficit in
FY05, the Government has remained on-track on its debt reduction policy. The fiscal space
created by this sensible debt policy helped the Government in increasing its allocations for pro-
poor expenditure. The PRSP expenditure increased steadily as a percent o f GDP to reach 4.8
percent inFY05 (from 4.3 percent inFY03). However, subsidies to the power sector (on account
o f operational losses and investments) have not diminished as planned and continue to represent a
sizeable claim on the budget. Inaddition, over Rs.55 billion inpetroleumtaxes were foregone to
maintain a lower price o f petroleum products in the domestic markets, in the wake o f the
escalation in international prices. Despite losing a large amount o f revenue from the petroleum-
basedtaxes, and sharp increases in defense' and provincial development expenditures, the overall
fiscal deficit increased to 3.3 percent o f GDP, 1percent higher than the FY04 level. To a lesser
extent, subsidies, especially to power sector utilities (Water and Power Development Authority
[WAPDA] and Karachi Electrical Supply Corporation [KESC]) also increased. Government debt
fell substantially to just below 60 percent o f GDP.
15.       Inflationary pressures remain, in spite o f a limited pass-through o f international
petroleum price increases. Broad money has expanded rapidly over the past two years, driven by
private sector credit growth and more recently by Government borrowing from the State Bank of
Pakistan (the central bank). Nominal asset prices (land, housing, and the stock market) have also
increased considerably over the past two years. There was some tightening o f monetary policy in
the first half o f 2005, which helped contain inflationary pressures. Consumer price inflation
(twelve-month) declined somewhat from a peak o f 11.5% in April 2005 to 9% inJuly 2005. For
FY06, inflation (as measured by the period-average CPI) is projected to be in the range o f 8-
8.5%.

16.      The current account has gone from a surplus (of 1.5% of GDP in FY04) into a
projected deficit of over 4% of GDP in FY06, in spite of strong export growth. Rapidly
growing imports o f oil, but also o f a wide range o f consumer and investment goods, are
translating into sharp increases in the import bill. The trade deficit rose sharply in FY05 to US$
4.4 billion, and is projectedto increase further to $7 billion inFY06.

17.      The October earthquake in the northernareas of Pakistan is likely to have a deep
and long-lasting fiscal impact. However, it i s expected to have only a marginal impact on
economic growth which i s likely to decline to 6.3 percent against the pre-earthquake target of 7
percent. Although government revenue i s also not expected to be adversely affected, the fiscal
impact o f the earthquake i s expected to be substantial due to large additional expenditure on
relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction. The fiscal deficit is, therefore, projected to increase to
4.4 percent o f GDP in FY06 and to remain at that level (as a share o f GDP) in FY07. It i s
expected that a significant part o f the deficit will be financed through donor grant and
concessional assistance, so that the debt reductionpath can be maintained.
18.      Under the amended National Finance Commission (NFC) Award announced in
January 2006, Punjab, like other provinces, will get more revenue from the federal
government. Through the amendment made by the President inthe 1997NFC Award, the share
o f provinces in the divisible pool of federal taxes has increased from 37 percent to 41.5 percent.
Moreover, this share will increase over time to reach 46.25 percent by 2010/11. Under the
amended Award, Punjab (along with Sindh) i s now also eligible for subventions from the federal
government, which previously were available only to Balochistan and NWFP. While the share of

24.      Punjab's fiscal strategy to strengthen provincial finances focuses on: (i)improved
revenue mobilization throughrestructuring o f provincial taxes and rationalization o f user charges;
(ii)reprioritizing provincial expenditures towards the core functions o f the government; and (iii)
creating additional space for high-priority expenditures and programs through effective
management o f provincial debt, and its contingent and deferred liabilities. Owing to its prudent
fiscal strategy and increased revenue transfers from the federal government, Punjab's fiscal
situation i s sound and appears sustainable over the medium-run. Nonetheless, the provincial
government i s aware that there i s little room for complacency on fiscal management and it i s
committed to carry forward its fiscal reform strategy inthe future to further strengthen provincial
finances.

25.      The reform program in Punjab is closely linked to major national level initiatives:
(1) The national PRSP' which includes human development as an integral part of the
Government's reform strategy o f which education i s a key sector, and which recognizes that the
responsibility for service delivery implementation rests with the districts; and (2) the national
devolution plan which, through the Local Government Ordinance (LGO) 2001, has devolved
decision making and finances to districts. Punjab i s leading the other provinces in its effort to
fully implement the national decentralization initiative, using education as the leading sector.
The education sector reforms complement the broader governance and economic management
reforms undertaken by the provincial government, with support from the Asian Development
Bank (ADB). The ADB i s supporting these reforms through the Provincial Resource
ManagementProgram (PRMP) which includes a focus on financial management and procurement
reforms. The sector reform program i s also in line with the objectives o f Punjab Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (P-PRSP) which inturn supports the goals o f the national PRSP.

26.      Inadditionto these, there are recent nationallevelinitiatives inthe education sector
which have a bearing on PESRP, including on Phase 11. These initiatives include the National
Education Census, commissioned by the federal Ministry o f Education (MOE) to gather
information on all schools    -  public, private, and madrassahs, which will provide useful data on
private education institutions. This could potentially be used by Punjab EMIS as a baseline for
integrating private sector data. The MOE i s also undertaking a review o f the National EMIS
including bringing required technical improvements to enable regular analysis o f sector data
including primary completion rates.

27.      A review o f the 1998 National Education Policy is underway which aims to diagnose
shortcomings in the current policy in order to bring improvements in the ongoing reforms at the
federal and provincial level. A National Curriculum Council comprising members from the public
and private sector i s currently reviewing the technical content and prescription in the curriculum
for all subjects to better align the curriculum with modem and child-centered learning. Punjab's
own efforts to improve textbook development and examination system are expected to benefit
from the curriculum reform being led by the MOE. The establishment o f a National Teacher
Accreditation System for federal teachers i s under consideration as a part o f the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC). This i s an important area and national level changes could
facilitate development o f similar systems at the provincial level.



' The PRSP titled "Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty: The Road Ahead" i s on the web at
  www.finance.gov.ukluoverty/ursu 03.udf. It was endorsed by the Board on March 11, 2004. The PRSP is being
  updatedby the Governmentof Pakistan.

         111.EDUCATION         SECTORACHIEVEMENTS INTHE PUNJAB& KEY CHALLENGES

28.      Several challenges faced the education sector in Punjab when the PESRP was designed
and launched.* Since its launch, several achievements have emerged, which are presented below
in Section A. However, major challenges remainwhich are being addressed under the program
supportedby this proposed credit and under Phase 11. These are presented in Section B below.

A.       Key Achievements of the Sector

29.      Increased public sector enrolments and progress towards gender parity in enrolments.
Total enrolment (Pre-Primary to Grade 10) has increased from 8.8 millionin 2003 to 10.6 million
in 2005 (see Figure 1) - a total of almost 20 percent since the start o f the reform program. In
October 2003, girls made up 43 percent o f total public school enrolment, moving to about 45
percent by M a y 2005 (see Figure 2). At the primary level, girls' enrolment has moved from 44
percent to 46 percent o f total primary enrolment between October 2003 and M a y 2005, and at the
middle level, girls now account for 41 percent of total enrolment up from 36 percent in October
2003.

30.      Positive impact of girls 'stipends program in public schools. There has been a positive
impact on enrolments o f the target population and on retention as demonstrated by the increase in
the number o f qualifying eligible girlsg. Inaddition, increases inboth girls' and boys' enrolment
are evident at the primary and middle levels in both stipend and non-stipend districts, although
more for girls. At the middle level girls' enrolment in the stipend districts has increased by about
37 percent versus 19 percent innon-stipends districts; at the primary level, girls' enrolments have
increased by 33 percent in the stipend districts versus 20 percent in the non-stipend districts.
There i s also a greater increase for boys' enrolment in stipend districts versus non-stipend
districts (see Figures 3 and 4).

31.      Establishment of strong monitoring systems. Significant progress has been made in
implementing a monitoring system, which i s based on a revamped management information
system, active field monitoring, and a regular third party validation system."                                             It has enabled
ready access to updated and dynamic information that i s being used for analysis and policy
decisions at political and administrative levels.

32.      Performance-based incentives to improve service delivey, and strengthened ownership
of district governments.                  Punjab has taken the lead in formulating partnerships for service
delivery between the provincial and district governments, including performance indicators that
are tied to funding levels for subsequent years along a needs-cum-performance based formula
where performancehas been incrementally given greater weightage over the years (now increased
to 40 percent for performance up from 30 percent under the Second Credit).

33.      Increased Jinancing for the sector.                            The expenditures on education have gradually
increased in accordance with the MTBF. Additional funding for district education programs has
been provided -on the basis of the need for programs (such as provision o f missingfacilities, free
textbooks, and stipends), and performance.

34.      Demonstration of successful implementation of education reform. Punjab's experience i s
paving the way for more aggressive reform efforts in other provinces. The Sindh Government
has taken the lead in developing new arrangements to improve the effectiveness o f its ongoing
education sector reforms. It i s engaged with the Punjab education team to identify strategies for
improving implementation and for strengthening its monitoring systems. The NWFP education
programi s also developing similar linkages with the Punjab team.

B.       Key Challenges

35.      The main challenges confronting education sector service delivery and performance
in Punjab include poor quality of education as demonstrated by poor learning outcomes,
weak governance and public sector management, and inequitable and inadequate access to
education. These issues are presented infurther detail below.

         (i)PoorLearningOutcomes
36.      The quality o f education delivered through the government managed school system has
been poor due to low levels o f teacher competence, lack o f class roombased support for teachers,


loOED inits review ofthe ICRfor PESACrated Governmentperformance as highly satisfactory.
                                                                        8

poor quality o f textbooks and learningmaterials, and lack o f systems to measure student learning
outcomes. This has been further affected by uneven supervision and insufficient school budgets
that restrict the inputs that are available for critical teaching and learning material.               Student
learning i s also directly linked with weak sector governance and management, including teacher
absenteeism (see paragraphs 39-41).

37.      All o f these shortcomings have over the years resulted in low levels o f student learning
outcomes. Information has recently been made available on student achievement in government
schools through pilot testing o f Grade IV students through the National Education Assessment
 System (NEAS)."        These results provide useful baseline information (see Box 1) on student
learning.

Box 1: Resultsof the NationalGrade 4 Testingunder NEAS
The first national level testing in Pakistan has been conducted under the NEAS. This exercise provides a
national benchmark for student learning outcomes. Tests were administered on a sample basis to about
 12,000 grade 4 students in government schools only inlanguage and mathematics, and to about a 50 percent
sample size o f teachers inthe schools covered.

At the national level, the achievement o f the majority o f students was found to be below the minimum
target level o f 500 points for both language and mathematics. In language, writing was found to be the
weakest area, with only 17 percent o f students able to write a story, and achievement o n reading ranged
between 20 percent - 61 percent. About 20 percent o f the students were able to understand basic grammar.
In mathematics, the results were equally disappointing, with better results in simple computation and
weaker results inproblem solving, fractions, and overall handling o f information.

                                                          The preliminary results show a positive

   200                                                    than the national average, it still falls below the
   100                                                    mean scaled score o f 500 inboth subjects, and

38.      In addition to NEAS, there is emerging information and analysis to compare student
achievement in government schools with that o f students inprivate schools, which suggests that,
on average, student achievement in private schools i s relatively better than in public schools. A
study to assess the learning achievement o f Grade V students studyinginboth randomly selected
public and private schools in 14 districts across Pakistan was conducted by the Academy o f
Education Planning and Management12 recently. This study found the average scores o f students
inprivate schools to be higher than that o f students inpublic schools inmathematics (51percent
private, 45 percent public), Urdu (62 percent private, 57 percent public) and Science (55 percent
private, 52 percent public). Although this study i s based on a small sample size, its results are in
line with preliminary findings o f other ongoing studies (such as the World Bank's study on public
private partnership in Punjab). Preliminary findings o f the World Bank study show that while
private schools, on average, perform better, there i s a sharper dispersion o f quality within public

schools (ranging from very good to extremely poor). The Government's analysis o f matriculation
examination results also show similar sharp differences among public schools.

           (ii)       Weak Governanceand Sector Management
39.       The education sector in Punjab, like in the rest o f Pakistan, has been marred by
governance problems. These include lack o f transparent procedures and practices in: teacher and
staff recruitment; postings and transfers; textbook printing and publishing (see paragraph 102);
and in award o f civil works contracts. All o f these have led to poor quality and inefficiency in
public service delivery.

40.       The national devolution reform i s an effort to improve pubic service delivery by
reversing the over-centralized management o f the system. However, there i s weak management
capacity at the district level, especially for procurement, financial management and quality
supervision. At the provincial level, the functions o f planning and overall management at the
education department are yet to be streamlined and strengthened. For a public education system
that includes more than 63,000 institutions fkom the primary to higher secondary level serving
about 11million students with a staff o f more than half a million, an organizational set up that i s
inline with the spirit of decentralization, and one that ensures quality of service delivery through
planning and management oversight i s essential. Given the sheer size o f the sector, it becomes
even more pertinent to have a strong district educationmanagement system.

41.       Accountability, particularly of teachers, has been an issue affecting school
performance. Although recent reforms inteacher recruitment have brought about improvements
inteacher qualifications, weak accountability of staff continues to affect overall education sector
performance in the province. Supervision and management o f the district education system i s
weak, A system for monitoring and managing teacher absenteeism has yet to be implemented
systematically.

42.       Limited stakeholder participation at the locallevelhas also hindered accountability.
Although School Councils (SC) have intermittently had control over school maintenance funds,
they were not empowered to take administrative decisions, making them largely ineffective.
Despite recent reforms to support SCs, further clarity in the role and relationship o f SCs with
district education management i s required.             Progress in mobilizing SCs has been slow, and
requires more intensive capacity building support to enable SCs to function effectively.

          (iii) InadequateandInequitableAccess

43.       While Punjab fares better than the Pakistan average in most education indicators
and is progressingwell in moving towards gender parity, it has still a long way to go to
achieve universal primary enrolment. According to preliminary results o f 2004-05 PSLSM
Survey data, a very large proportion o f the adult population (48 percent) i s illiterate and much
less than two thirds o f the province's school-age population i s enrolled in primary schools. The
primary Net Enrolment Rate (NER) stagnated in the 1990s even declining slightly until 1998,
before improving to 45 percent in 2001-02, and to 58 percent in2004-05 (compared to 52 percent
nationally).I3



l31999-2000 and 2001-2002 data based on Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS); 2004-2005 data based on
  Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLSM) Survey 2004-05 (CWIQ Approach), FederalBureauof
  Statistics, Statistics Division, Government of Pakistan. The PSLSM Survey 2004-05 data is based on preliminary
  reports, as raw data has not yet been analyzed. More definitive analysis will be possible once this analysis is done.
  The Punjab Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2004 while showing an improvement in the trend over
  2001102, shows a lower NER(Overall 51, male 53, female 49).
                                                         10

44.       In addition, of those enrolled in the first year of primary school, only about sixty
percent complete four or moreyears of education. Analysis o fpublic school census data from
2003-2005 shows that the public education system continues to face highdrop outs at the primary
level. While there i s an increase in the absolute number o f children in each grade, 24 percent o f
pre primary students do not progress to Grade I,           while 16 percent do not progress from Grade IV
to V. As there were no passifail grades given during this census period and a l o w rate o f
repeaters (about 2.6 percent), one can by proxy assume that these students dropped out o f the
system. While there i s little gender difference in progression from grade IV to V, there are
marked gender differences inthe transition from pre primary to Grade 1(see Figures 5 & 6). The
primary completion rates in government schools are estimated at about 61 percent in 2005
compared with 58 percent in 2004. While there i s an improvement in trends over the past two
years, it i s still distant from the MDG target o f full completion of primary cycle.I4 Overall,
primary completion rates in government schools are better for girls than for boys though girls'
show lower completionrates inrural areas.

45.       Improving access beyond primary level of schooling is                                  also a challenge.
Improvementsinnet enrolments as witnessed at the primary level are not happening at the middle
and secondary school levels          -  the middle NER for Punjab has only increased from 18 percent to
20 percent between 2001-02 and 2004-05, while remaining stagnant at 11 percent during the
same period at the Matriculate (Grade 10) level (see Figure 7).15

46.       There are also substantialregionaland gender disparities. While the overall primary
NER for the province is 58 percent, inurbanareasit is 68 percent compared to 54percent inrural
areas, Although the gender gap in enrolment in government schools i s slowly bridging, gender
disparities are more visible when literacy i s considered: rural female literacy rates are 35 percent
compared to 66 percent for urban females, 59 percent for rural males, and 78 percent for urban
males (see Figure 8).



 l4Inthe absence of student tracking in school census data and absence o f cohort analysis, this primary completion rate
   has been estimatedby proxy using the time series school census data. Enrolment data in grade 1 has been compared
   with enrolment data in grade 5 over a five year period to develop a proxy estimate o f primary completion rate in
   government schools. The data has been compared for grade 5 students in two academic years 2004 and 2005, with
   corresponding data of grade 1 in2000 and 2001.
 l5Data inFigures7-8 i s from PIHS 1998199 and 2001102, and PSLSM Survey, 2005. The literacy data in 2004-2005 i s

   47.           The public sector enrolments fall sharply from primary to middle, from middle to
   secondary, and to higher levels. With 44,000 schools and about 7.7 million children at the
   primary level, there are less than 6,000 middle schools and 2.06 million students, and
   approximately only 4,425 secondary schools with about 800,000 students (see Figure 9). Overall
   data on numbers for the both public and private enrolments will be available once the National
   Education Census report i s ready.

   48.           Access to higher levels of educationis also an area of concern. Inaddition to the lack
   of adequate institutions offering college and higher education, both in the public and private
   sector, there are questions about the relevance of education offered at the higherlevels interms of
   preparing graduates for the workforce. There are no aptitude tests available to enable students to
   select their areas of specialization, and inthe absence o f a tracking system it i s difficult to assess
   the market employability of college graduates by skill type. The Government has requested the
   Bank to support a college sector study that will enable it to identify and develop strategies for
   future programs in the college sector. A World Bank Policy Note on Higher Education i s also
   under preparation that is exploring university level issues, which would provide useful
   information to the Government for developing its strategy for improving college education.

   49.           The growing low cost private sector needsto be harnessedto contributeto improve
   overall access to educationin the province. The last Census of Private Schools (2000) showed
   that Punjab has almost 24,000 private schools16,nearly two thirds (65 percent) of them in urban

         Census (covering all Pakistan), which will provide more up-to-date information on the share of private sector in
         enrolments.
                                                                12

         areas, and the vast majority (80 percent) o f them primary and middle schools. Analysis o f
         household survey data o f 2001-02 and 2004-05 shows that the share o f primary enrolments in
         private schools as a percentage o f total primary enrolments has marginally increased from 31
         percent in 2001-02 to 32 percent in 2004-05, with much of this increase coming from a higher
         share o f private sector in rural areas, where the share o f private enrolment in total primary level
         enrolment has increased from 20 percent to 23 percent." This trend o f increasing share o f private
         sector i s growing inrural areas o f all provinces (see Figure 10).

         50.       While the public sector in Punjab continues to be the major source o f primary education
         (68 percent o f total enrolments), the increasing contribution o f the private sector, especially in
         rural areas, has clearly helped inimproving net enrolment rates and it can enable Punjab to move
         closer towards UPE.

         51.       The PESRP is structured around three pillars. These are described in paragraph 2.
         The first two pillars o f the reforms are also being supported by the Asian Development Bank
         (ADB) under the Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) during FY2004 to FY2006
         period. Table 2 below captures the policy actions and measures implemented during the first two
         years of the reformprogram supported by two IDA credits, and their initial impact.

third credit, with a brief summary o f overall progress, actions taken under the third credit22,and
the indicative future actions under Phase 11.

A.        Pillar I:Public FinanceReforms to Increasethe Level and Share ofEducation
Expenditures

54.       Punjab has been increasing provincial and district expenditures on education based on the
MTBFina fiscally sustainable manner.

           (1)IncreasePublicExpenditureonEducation

55.       The MTBF supports large increases inprovincial expenditures on education (and other
pro-poor services).        A revised MTBF for 2004-06 had been formulated and contained several
features to ensure sustainability o f provincial finances and o f high-priority programs and
expenditures o f the provincial government, including PESRF'.23 The framework also provided
additional funding for district education programs on the basis o f need and if the districts
allocated more for the education sector from their own overall district budgets and if they met
performance targets set out inthe TOP agreements.

56.        While the basic philosophy o f the provincial MTBF i s likely to be followed, the overall
fiscal paradigm for provincial finances changed on January 19, 2006, when the President using
hisconstitutional powersamended the 1997NFC Award. Underthe amended award, the share of
provinces in the divisible pool o f federal taxes has been increased from 37.5 percent to 41.5
percent. Further, this share will increase overtime to reach 46.25 percent by 2010/11. However,
unlike the past arrangement where only 37.5 percent o f revenue from 2.5 percent o f GST was
included in the provincial share, the amended Award includes 100 percent o f this revenue in the
provincial share. Under the previous arrangement the federal government used to provide 62.7
percent o f the revenue from 2.5 percent o f GST as Octroi Zilla Tax (OZT) replacement grant to
the provinces for onward pass-on to the local governments. Under the new arrangement, the
provinces will provide 100 percent o f these funds from their own share. Moreover, as against the
original Award, under which only Balochistan and NWFP qualified for subventions from the
federal government, the amended Award makes each province eligible for receiving these grants.
Although no criterion i s specified for determining these subventions, they appear to be varying
inversely with provinces' development indicators.



22 The prior actions for PEDPC I11are presentedin italics.
23 The MTBF i s being revised in light of the amendment made in the NFC Award. However, as resource transfer to
   Punjab government is larger under the amended Award there i s reason to expect that allocations for the high-priority
   sectors would not be reducedinthe revised MTBF.

57.           Under the amended Award, the share o f Punjab inshared revenue seems to have declined
somewhat (see Table 4). However, in quantum terms Punjab (and other provinces) will get Rs.
2.7 billion more revenue from the federal government in FY06. Gains to Punjab from the new
Award would continue to increase overtime, and overall, Punjab i s likely to get Rs. 84 billion
more in the next five years. Further, the direct transfers o f energy-related revenues and o f hydel
profits from WAPDA will continue as per the existing practices.

58.           Overall Progress. The strategy of creating additional fiscal space for high-priority
expenditures through better revenue collection, sound debt management and improved
expenditure management has started to yield results but the fiscal position still remains
constrained and necessitates continued external budget support. Increased allocations for
education are financed mainly through increased revenue, lower non-priority expenditure and
donor funds. None o f the other priority expenditures has been reduced to accommodate these
increases. Inview o f heavy reliance o f the province on federal revenue transfers and competing
demands from other priority sectors, large scale investments in education will require continued
donor assistance even beyond the program period. The MTBF projects an 18.2 percent per
annum increase in provincial revenue and an 18.8 percent increase in provincial expenditure,
Due to its prudent debt management strategy, debt servicing expenditure i s expected to decline by
15 percent per annum, whereas high priority expenditure i s projected to increase, with highest
increase (23 percent per annum) projected for education sector expenditure.

59.           Actions Taken under PEDPC III. There is continued good progress in maintaining
the commitments under the MTBF (see Table 5). Compared with the revised estimates o f
FY05 expenditures, budget allocations for the education sector in the provincial FY06 budget
have been increased by 50 percent. The overall approved education budgetfor 2005-06 shows at
least I 2 percent increase. There has been an 8 percent increase inrecurrent allocation and a 91
percent increase in the development b~dget.'~In the recurrent budget, a 24 percent increase i s
budgeted for the PMIU, and adequate funds have been provided for all other initiatives
undertaken under PESRP (see Table 6). The Punjab Government has also prepared an updated
MTBF. The provincial real education expenditures include an increased level for non-salary
expenditures, and the level o f real middle school expenditures has also been increased.




24 This i s likely to increase further for a simple reason that the 27 percent increase in salaries o f government employees
   has not yet been fully accommodated in sectoral allocations. The lower increase in development spending is to
   accommodate the delays in utilization by the district government o f funds provided under PESW for missing
   facilities. The low utilization is primarily due to late start o f the program inFY04, which left the district government
   with sufficient        funds from the previous year to utilize in FY05. The missing facilities program follows a CY
   implementation cycle.
                                                                           17

                60.         Future Actions. The Government i s committed to: (i)                         update the MTBF annually; (ii)
                increase FY07 provincial expenditures for education by 12 percent according to the MTBF; (iii)

                                                                                 18

maintain fiscal sustainability o f the program by creating fiscal space through improved debt
management; (iv) enhance own revenue, better prioritization and management o f expenditure; (v)
reduce future claims o f pension liability on the budget by making a budgetary allocation for
capitalization o f pension fund; (vi) increase the level o f real middle and secondary school
expenditures from base year 2004; and (vii) pay-off more expensive federal debt.

B.       Pillar 11:Devolutionand Public Sector Management Reforms

61,      The reform supports devolution through measures that: (i)decentralize financing and
decision malung to the district level; (ii)increase accountability o f districts for resource use
through improved financial management and procurement reforms at provincial and district
levels; and (iii)  clarify the roles o f all levels of government.

         (1)SupportFiscalDecentralization

62.       Overall Progress. Fiscal decentralization and decision making at the district level
continues to be supported by: (i)           transferring general budget resources as a single line budget
transfer to the district governments' accounts (Account 425) in accordance with the resource
allocation formula developed by the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC); (ii)                          fully transferring
to Districts' Account 4 additional allocations (over and above the single line transfer) as outcome-
based conditional grants, using a formula that reflects both need and performance, in accordance
with the TOPs, with agreed annual targets; and (iii)               re-aligning district budgets with all districts
increasing the level o f non salary budget for schools. The TOPs have been revised gradually to
provide financing increasingly on the basis o f districts' performance.

63.      Actions Taken under PEDPCIII.TheFY06 TOPs include afurther revisedformula for
FY06 funding, reflecting a 60 percent need and 40 percent performance ratio.                                       Annual
performance targets have been agreed to inthe TOPs. The need-based factor includes enrolment
and literacy levels, while the performance-based factor includes districts' own FY06 budget
increase, realignment in the FY05 budget towards actual release for school councils and non-
salary items, and improvements in education indicators, including enrolment and drop-outs. The
revised conditional grant formula for FY06 has been approved by the Provincial Finance
Commission. All thirty-Jive districts have signed TOPsfor FY06, and need-based conditional
grants have been transferred to the district accounts. Overall districts' non salary budget has
increased for education by 15 percent. School census data and expenditure tracking data has been
used to determine districts' share under the conditional grants provided by the provincial
government. Further, improvements in education sector governance (described under Pillar 111)
have been made by strengthening district capacity to implement and monitor education sector
expenditures through training o f district education staff, and through enhanced participation o f
School Councils.

64.      Future Actions. The Government will continue to strengthen fiscal decentralization and
decision making by: (i)providing greater incentives for performance and FY07 TOPs are
expected to have 50 percent performance weight; (ii)                ensuring that all districts increase their own
level o f non-salary budgets for education; and (iii)implementing district capacity building
program for all districts. Under Phase 11, TOPs will be revised to reflect the agreed program
focus. In addition, performance indicators could vary over time and improvements in student

25 Provincial Government funds move through different accounts. Account 1 is for resources managed by the province,
   and Account 4 i s for resources managed by the district. The funds transferred to Account 4 (district Account) are
  transferred as a single line (non-earmarked) transfer. The districts prepare their annual budgets (development and
  recurring) on the basis of this single line budget transfer. In addition to this transfer, the conditional grants provided
  under the PESRP are earmarked for the education sector and are also transferred to Account 4.

learning outcomes and districts' performance in standardized examinations could also be included
as performance indicators.

         (2) Strengthen Governance and the Fiduciary Environment

65.      The reform program supports an improved governance and fiduciary environment
through measures that strengthen financial management and procurement capacity at both the
provincial and district levels. These are also supported through the ADB-supported PRMP.

66.      Overall Progress in Financial Management. At the overall provincial level, the Punjab
Government's commitment to the financial management reform agenda has been incrementally
robust. Since the PFMA was conducted for the province and the report finalized in April 2005,
Punjab continued to show satisfactory progress on the overall financial management reforms. The
following specific areas demonstrate the Provincial Government's commitment to the reform
agenda: (a) the maintenance o f an adopted policy o f orderliness and participation in the budget
formulation process through a well articulated and coherent `budget call circular'; (b) cash
balances o f the provincial and district governments are generally consolidated into a daily report
for effective cash flow planning and management, although public enterprises accounts and Zakat
accounts are not included; (c) as required under the New System o f Financial Control and
Budgeting, the whole year's budget, in the case o f recurrent expenditures are released by the
Finance Department and, similarly, about 40 percent o f the approved annual development
program budget i s released at the start o f the fiscal year to support more timely expenditure
commitments by Principal Accounting Officers; (d) since the budgeted resources reach the
spending departments on a timely basis, the spending departments have, in general, now begun
their planning in advance o f releases o f funds instead o f waiting until the funds are released; (e)
the pensionand provident fund modules under the PFRAregime are now activated so as to begin
the process o f generating pension and provident fund data for purposes of ascertaining the
contingent liabilities o f the superannuation schemes for public employees; (0 timeliness in data
reconciliation has improved due partly to the increase innumber o f IT connected accounting sites
in the province; (g) the good practices of introducing and replicating monthly expenditure
monitoring systems are being adopted at the district government levels for development programs
also; (h) the office o f the Auditor General at the province has commenced the implementation o f
the new audit methodology that would enhance audit quality and timeliness; and (i)        two Public
Accounts Committees, operating inparallel, are functioning to support a faster and timely review
o f audit reports and audited accounts at the provincial level.

67.      At the level o f the Education department, the PMIU continues to pursue satisfactory
financial management arrangements, using systems and processes which together support the
achievement o f the program's outcomes.         Timely, comprehensive, and accurate expenditure
reporting arrangements for the entire sector remains a key area o f attention at the PMIU. The
program remains on track in ensuring that the monitoring and reporting o f the releases o f
budgetary funds to the districts, the monitoring o f expenditures against those releases, the
consolidation o f monthly expenditures for provincially financed specific program activities o f the
sector as well as major, minor, and detailed heads o f expenditures i s well maintained. The timely
availability and use o f the financial information generated has, in general, served as the basis o f
decision-making in the pursuit o f the program's objectives. It continues to provide the basis for
fostering financial accountability at both the provincial and district government level. In effect,
the Education Department, through the PMIU, continues to maintain a system o f `regular
reporting o f financial flows (quarterly with a lag o f 6 weeks) on expenditure and outputs. The
format o f the reports as well as the expenditure nomenclature has, since the start o f the FY
2005l06,been made consistent with the New Accounting Model (NAM)under the PIFRA project
as the provincial government and district governments' budgets are now prepared on the new

                                                  20

chart o f accounts following NAM principles.        The fact that the provincial and district
governments are on a uniform chart o f accounts will ensure that financial and fiscal reporting
would be consistent for both governments. This provides reliability and consistency o f whole-of-
government data. A system o f instituting fortnightly Departmental Account Committee (DAC)
meetings resulting in progressive resolution o f audit issues and the application o f sanctions,
including cashrecoveries, have beenpursued.

68.     Actions Taken under PEDPC III. The Government is convening fortnightly DAC
meetings to review and settle arising audit observations (paras) in the Provincial Account I,as
well as progressively clearing backlogs. Between January 2003 and September 2005, the overall
un-reviewed audit observations o f the entire Education Department stood at 46,062 paragraphs.
Duringthe same period, a total o f 6787 paras were reviewed and cleared after 87 DAC, and 11
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meetings.         The remaining number o f un-reviewed audit
observations raised against the department under the Provincial Account No. 1, therefore, was a
higho f 39,275 as at September 30, 2005. This was further reduced to 32,481 paragraphs as at
March 28,2006 - a reduction o f 6,794 paragraphs (17.3%) over a period o f six months. The PAC
also reviewed and cleared 500 draft paragraphs submitted to it during its 11meetings held during
the period September 2005 to March 2006. These actions demonstrate the heightened focus on
improving financial management in the sector. The Government has continued to computerize
financial management processes, and district capacity buildingprograms have been financed and
are being implemented. Further, a Provincial Public Financial Management and Accountability
Assessment (PFMA) has been conducted by the Bank in association with the Government and
with the full participation o f DFID and European Commission (EC). This has led to the
development and implementation o f a `self-assessment' system o f reporting and monitoring o f the
performance indicators against specified indicator benchmarks agreed for the province. The self-
assessed reporting and monitoring report o f the Government, the first to be delivered in June
2006, will serve to continuously inform the Bank and other donors o f the concrete progress or
otherwise achieved by the province inimproving financial management and accountability.

69.      Future Actions. In moving forward to the second phase o f the program, the financial
managementreformmeasures would include the following areas:

(a)      Multi-donor conduct of a PEFA PFM PMF26Assessment: The final framework
version of the PEFA PFM PMF was released in June 2005 while the Punjab PFMA report that
was released in April 2005 had used the transitional indicator framework settings for the
assessment. The key development partners (WB, DFID, ADB, EC) are desirous o f conducting a
harmonized assessment, using the new, reinforced, donor consensual methodology as this would
form the basis for collective donor dialogue on financial management reforms inthe province. A
joint assessment, usingthe new framework, would be carried out during FY07. The output o f the
assessment will be a more comprehensive report which would constitute the single-reference
document for incentivizing reforms in the area o f financial management, accountability,
procurement, and public expenditure management.

(b)      Fortnightly reviews of backlogs of un-reviewed audit observations: To deepen the
financial management reform agenda within the Education Department, further measures will be
taken to reinforce accountability not only on provincial account No. 1 but also on the devolved
district governments' account No. 4. This means that the post-devolution audit observations
linked to the 34/35 district governments' Education Department will now constitute part o f the
accountability net since these governments have now established their own respective District

  PerformanceMeasurementFramework (PMF).
                                               21

Departmental Accounts Committees (DDACs). The Education Department at the provincial level
will provide a baseline number (as at January 1, 2006) o f un-reviewed audit paragraphs for each
district education department so that progress inreviewing and resolving those paragraphs, along
with arising ones, canbe monitored alongside the provincial government's.

(c)      Updating of General FinancialRules (GFRs): The guiding principles o f committing
expenditures, making payments and accounting for these are contained in the General Financial
Rules of the government. The GFRs are, in a majority o f cases, obsolete and require amendment
through the appropriate codification and consolidation o f new rules that were, overtime,
introduced through administrative circulars and official policies. With the transition to the new
system o f accounting under the principles o f the NAM, and with the province-wide adoption o f
the new Chart o f Accounts, some fundamental changes in the existing rules and procedures will
be required.     For consistency and for assuring proper financial management processes and
procedures guidance, a reform action that entails the updating o f the Rules, their dissemination,
and relatedtraining o f staff, will constitute a key action to be pursued.

DistrictRecruitment
(d)                        and deployment of InformationTechnology (IT) qualified personnelin
          Finance Offices: The province is gearing itself to achieving full IT connectivity under
the PIFRA regime during calendar year 2007 (not later than September 2007). In light o f this,
and based on the very weak IT capacity o f existing staff in all but about one district (Faisalabad),
the government would need to sanction about 35 budgetary posts, recruit adequately qualified IT
persons (with at least an IT level Diploma) into the government service structure, and deploy
them to each o f the 35 district finance offices inFY07.

70.      Overall Progress in Procurement Reforms. Procurement reforms have been introduced
with contracts for civil works above a reasonable threshold now based on open competition and
transparent procedures.         The requirement o f composite schedule o f rates (CSR) have been
removed and replaced with realistic cost estimates based on prevailing market rates.                           The
requirement for pre-registration o f contractors has also been removed. Standard procurement
guidelines for the purchase o f goods have been developed. School Councils are now authorized
to carry out small civil works at the school level, up to a threshold o f Rs. 400,0002'. Annual
independent ex-post procurement reviews o f a sample o f procurements have been conducted
through a third party. The findings o f the first independent ex-post review, which was based on
work carried out in four districts, point to a large number o f deviations from established Punjab
Government procedures, including insufficient time given to bids, absence o f administrative
approval o f scope changes in a contract, no preparation o f site drawings for administrative
approval, over-payment and post bidnegotiations. These deviations are not only symptomatic o f
deficiencies in procurement procedures but also o f the capacity constraints o f staff. Steps have
been initiatedto address these deficiencies.

71.      Actions Taken under PEDPC III. On the basis o f the findings o f the ex-post
procurement review, the Punjab Government has taken steps to initiate corrective action. It has
begun preparation o f rules for procurement o f goods, works and services that meet international
best practice. It has implemented capacity buildingprograms for district and provincial officials.
To guide overall procurement reforms, a procurement reform strategy has been prepared in
consultation with key stakeholders. The strategy has been prepared and submittedfor the Chief
Minister's approval. It has taken steps to ensure proper enforcement o f the procurement system
while ensuring adequate safeguards.             As a part o f this effort, it is conducting the second
independent ex-post procurement review on a sample basis to assess compliance with

*'This  amount i s sufficient for school boundaries, toilets, repairs and maintenance, and construction of additional
   rooms
                                                          22

procurementrules and systems. The review also includes an enduse survey at the facility level to
assess the availability and quality o f inputs supplied to schools such as furniture and civil works.
An assessment o fthe quality o fcivil works implementedthrough SCs has also beeninitiated.

72.      Future Actions. In the area o f procurement, future actions include: (i)        establishing
monitoring and reporting mechanism to provide relevant and appropriate statistics on public
procurement inPunjab, and postingresults o f awards o f contracts on the official website to ensure
transparency in procurement at the local level; (ii)   commencing work to enable e-procurement;
(iii)continuing to improve procurement capacity and within two years train all district
procurement officials; (iv) adopting and implementingregulations for Public Procurement Rules;
(v) establishing a second tier appeals mechanism for procurement; (vi) adopting StandardBidding
Documents for goods, works and services; and (vii) providing training to build the capacity o f
district procurement teams. The Government will also take necessary actions based on findings
of the study to assess quality o f civil works implementedthrough SCs.

C.       Pillar III:EducationSector Reforms

73.      There are two core areas addressedin PESRP: (1) improvements in education sector
governance; and (ii)improvements in access and quality.               Government recognizes that
implementing far-reaching, sector-wide reforms i s a formidable exercise, and the agenda cannot
be completed in a three year period. Several o f these reforms will continue and deepen under
Phase 11. Details o f each area of education sector reform are presentedbelow.

         (1) StrengthenEducationSector Governance

74.      The reform supports improvements in education sector governance through the
implementation o f measures to: (a) improve education sector management; (b) improve teacher
management; (c) strengthen School Councils; and (d) strengthen monitoring and evaluation.
These improvements are also linked to actions inthe area of procurement (paragraphs 70-72) that
include establishing more transparent rules and practices incontracting o f civil works to improve
the quality o fschool construction.

                 (a) Improve educationsector management

75.      Overall Progress: These reforms, initiated under the second credit are under progress
now.    This is the first time that a serious effort has been made to re-orient the provincial
Education Department in line with its responsibilitiesand functions under a devolved framework.
Although implementation has been slow, various parts o f the provincial Education Department
have been reoriented to reflect the department's new role where service delivery i s a district
responsibility while policy development, planning, and overall monitoring & evaluationremain a
provincialresponsibility.

76.      Actions Taken under PEDPC III. The Chief Minister has approved the reorganization
of district education management along a functions-based structure (see Box 2 below). It has
approved a capacity buildingprogram which i s linked to this restructuring. Although it has been
a slow and phased process, restructuring is now underway.             At the provincial level, the
Education Department has created a unifiedPlanning Wingby merging the two wings for college
and school education, with a focus of the Planning Wing now on planning and monitoring
functions.   This has assisted in mainstreaming the management and information systems
developed under PESRP within the core functions o f the PlanningWing.



                                                  23

Box 2: Restructuringof the DistrictEducationDepartment
The Government, in consultation with district governments, has approved the reorganization o f the district
education management along a functions-based structure.              The current structure provided education
managers for each levels o f schooling i.e. separate managers for primary, elementary and secondary
schools. The new designation i s along the following functional lines: district managers for human resource,
monitoring, finance and planning, and academics (covering examination, student assessment, and teacher
training). A phased action plan for capacity building o f district managers has been approved, including
training through the National Institute o f Public Administration (NIPA) which has prepared a tailor made
program.    In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the Punjab Local Government Ordinance
(PLGO), a detailed implementation plan for the creation o f district cadres has been prepared by the
provincial Government. Under this plan, district cadres will be created for non-officer level grades.

77.       Future Actions. The Government will provide capacity buildingsupport to the different
tiers o f district education management staff in all districts. It will provide financing for these
programs through the provincial budget. It will ensure that within two years all district education
managers and staff will have received the required training in line with their job descriptions,
requisite budget and facilities so that districts are hlly functioning after reorganization. The
reorganization o f the provincial Education Department will also be fully implemented to better
align it with its functions.         All budget and expenditure data for the entire education sector
(including colleges) will be maintained and linked to EMIS. The Government will also initiate
work to assess feasibility o f separation o fteaching and administrative cadres.

                   @) Improve Teacher Management

78.       The reforms aim to improve teacher management by increasing transparency in
recruitment, enhancing qualification at entry, reducingteacher absenteeism, and achieving greater
local involvement inteacher selection through changes inthe recruitment policy. These measures
are also linked to bringingimprovements inquality o f learning (paragraphs 96-103).

79.       Overall Progress.          The problems o f teacher accountability and high rates o f
absenteeism are being addressed by introducing greater transparency in teacher recruitment,
transfers and posting including through: (i)         recruitment o f all new teachers along revised higher
qualifications through site-specific, fixed-term contracts, with more than 50,0002*teaching staff
already recruited through such contracts and posted to schools which were previously closed due
to lack o f teaching staff, and to fill vacancies in schools where enrolments have increased; (ii)
implementation o f district monitoring mechanisms to curb absenteeism and monitor local schools
by the District Monitoring Officers (DMOs) and increasingly through SCs; and (iii)                    evaluating
performance o f the contract appointees through an approved criteria, which i s part o f the contract
signed by each contract appointee. Both the Teacher Management Study (Box 3) and the results
of NEAS (Box 1) show that student performance i s positively correlated with higher academic
qualifications o f teachers.

Box 3: TeacherManagementinPunjab
A Punjab Teacher Management Study, commissioned jointly by the World Bank and the Department for
International Development (DFID), was completed in February 2005 to review the policies pertaining to
teacher management and recruitment. One o f the areas reviewed included assessing the effectiveness o f the
contract teacher employment policy by looking at teacher absenteeism and teacher quality by type o f
employment. O n the day o f the survey, 24 percent o f regular teachers were found to be absent, while about
17percent o f contract teachers were absent. Grade IV sample NEAS tests were administered for language
and mathematics to both contract and regular teachers. There were marked differences in results between
the performance o f graduate contract and matriculate regular teachers, with graduate contract teachers



28 20,000 site specific contract teachers had been recruited prior to the start of PESRP in 2003. 30,000 additional
  teachers were recruitedafter 2003 based on the revisedrecruitmentpolicy.
                                                        24

performing better. Students taughtby contractteachers also showedbetter performanceinmathematics (28
percent attained passing marks compared to 21 percent for students who were taught by matriculate
teachers).

The Government has modified its recruitment policy to improve the recruitment process.Trained graduates
would continue to be recruited on school-specific contract basis. To ensure that more and more local
candidates are selected to increase probability of teacher's presence, 10 marks (instead of 5) have been
allocated for a candidate belonging to the same Union Council where schools are located. Similarly, to
encourage female candidates to apply for boys schools, 10 marks will be awarded to female candidates.
Preference will be given to graduates with Mathematics and Science in order to meet the shortage of
Mathematics and Science teachers at primary, elementary, and secondary level.                  Salary package for the
contract teachers has beenrevised for the current as well as future teachers.

80.       Actions Taken under PEDPCIII.Processesfor the recruitment of teachersfor the third
phase of recruitment have been completed for the contract recruitment of 1~5,000~~                           teachers,
based on a comprehensive need analysis exercise. School-specific data was used to determine
actual teacher vacancies and requirements taking into account the new enrolments. Based on the
experience o f previous recruitments, the government has revised its policy (see Box 3). Another
element o f the governance reforms i s improving school management and monitoring, and
reducing teacher absenteeism. In this connection 3,000 absenteeism cases were reported by the
Education Department and action was taken on 1,600 cases. The Chief Minister's monitoring
teams are also capturing information on teacher absenteeism, which i s being provided to each
district government for necessary action (see paragraph 126). These actions are part o f the
Government's program for improving teacher management systems.

81.       Future Actions. The Government will continue to take steps to improve the management
and performance o f teachers (see paragraph 101). The teacher management study (Box 3) also
revealed a slightly higher incidence o f absenteeism among female teachers as compared with
male teachers (25 percent and 20 percent respectively), which points towards a whole range o f
issues, including mobility, transportation, enabling and conducive workmg environment relating
to female teachers (whether contract or regular) that hinder their regular presence in schools.
Such findings are compelling the Government to consider providing special incentives for female
teachers, particularly inrural areas. Introduction o f performance-based awards, improved career
structures and linking performance to promotion will also be considered as a strategy to motivate
teachers to perform better. Additional 12,000 teachers will be recruited on the basis o f school
specific needs. The government i s also committed to providing new teacher positions based on
school-specific needs. It will also start the process o f appointing teachers based on a teacher
rationalization exercise using student-teacher ratios inthe school census data, and targets will be
included in the                   Systems for monitoring teacher absenteeism will be developed and
progress will be included inannual TOP performance indicators.




29 The Chief Minister has approved the recruitment o f 19,000 teachers including new vacancies. At present, 16,000
   teachers are beingrecruited to first fill the existing vacancies.
30 At the start o f PESRP, teacher re-deployment and rationalization was envisioned in the last program year because
   of: (a) a ban on transfers due to past experience o f over-politicization in this area; (b) district government had
   recently beenestablished and clarity on their role inposting and transfer was not clear at the time; and (c) there was
   no credible database o f teacher vacancies. PESRP focused on filling the huge backlog of vacancies due to past
   recruitment bans. Phase I1will now focus on teacher redeployment based on teacher rationalization exercise.



                                                              25

                  (c) Revitalize School Councils

82.       The reform program revitalizes School Councils (SCs) in order to strengthen the link
between stakeholders (clients) and providers (schools), and to improve service delivery. SCs
were re-established in FY04 based on new guidelines which included a majority membership o f
parents.

83.       Overall Progress. The provincial government and district governments have taken
several actions to strengthen SCs, including: (i)      the issuance o f guidelines by the provincial
government clarifying the role o f SCs, including enhancing their authority to undertake small
civil works up to a threshold o f Rs. 400,000; (ii)   start o f school based budgeting for non-salary
recurrent costs and implemented through SCs; (iii)       authorizing SCs to hire contract teachers in
accordance with the recruitment policy; and (iv) launch o f a pilot program for 2,400 SCs in six
districts in partnership with two NGOs using two different models (contracting out management
to the NGO and a capacity building approach). There has been slow progress in this capacity
buildingpilot as it has taken time to finalize the tripartite contracts between the province, district
government and NGOs.

84.      Actions Taken under PEDPC III. School-based recurrent budgets have been provided
to SCs in 19 districts, and an analysis has been conducted to assess their level o f activity (see Box
4) and to identify the needs for capacity building. Based on this, funding for the SC capacity
building program is being extended to all other (non-pilot) districts in partnership with other
NGOs. Consultations with several NGOs were conducted to develop the parameters for a phased
SC capacity building program. An Expression o f Interest from the NGO community has been
advertised based on which a request for proposal has beenprepared. A review o f quality o f civil
works undertaken by SCs has been launched with support from the Bank. The TOP include a
performance indicator on utilization o f school based recurrent budgets transferred to SCs by
district governments.

Box 4: School Councils (SCs)
The Education Department has prepared a detailed analysis o f SCs in Punjab, using the M a y 2005 school
census data. According to the findings, SCs are present in 53,741 schools (or 84 percent o f total schools).
51,075, or 80 percent of the schools, have SCs with functioning bank accounts. Although SCs are present
in a large percentage of schools, and are now receiving funds inthe form of school-based budgets, they
were not active in spending funds on school improvements. While the average balance ina primary school
SC was Rs. 11,334, only Rs. 4,135 (or 36 percent o f available funds) was spent duringthe past year. The
number i s even lower at the high and higher secondary level, where only 7 percent o f available funds were
spent. Based on this analysis, the Government will finance community mobilization and capacity building
activities through NGOs to strengthen SCs so that they are activated and mobilized, and begin to actively
perform their functions for improving school performance, including utilization o f school funds for school
improvements.

85.      Future Actions. A key future action in this area will be implementation o f the program
for capacity building o f SCs across the province, initially in at least six non-pilot districts. Given
the large scope o f schools, the program will be phased, but the Education Department will focus
on encouraging NGOs to further develop local capacities (such as local Community Based
Organizations and local level welfare NGOs) to enable them to work with SCs. All SCs will be
provided school based recurrent budget. SCs in at least 6 non pilot districts will be provided
school-based development budget for school civil works, and they will be provided capacity
support through NGOs. The role o f SCs in monitoring teacher attendance and performance will
be clarified to make school-based monitoring more intense. Based on findings o f the review o f
civil works undertaken by SCs the role o f SCs in school civil works will be expanded. The


                                                   26

results o f the World Bank's evaluation o f the impact o f SC capacity buildingprogram in the six
pilot districts will be used to develop future interventions in support o f SCs.

                   (d) StrengthenMonitoring& Evaluation(M&E)

86.        The education reform program strengthens monitoring and evaluation to monitor
progress, inform education policy and allow performance-based financing o f education services
inthe public school sector.

87.        Overall Progress.     Significant progress has been made in this area. The revamped
monitoring and information system i s independently scrutinized by periodic third party
validations, and also complemented by impact studies and evaluations.                 PMlU continues to
monitor, analyze and report progress on the various inputs of the reform program and sector
performance. One major gap inthe administrative data i s the absence o f credible information for
capturing drop-out and completion rates, and teacher absenteeism. This i s now being addressed
inthe next school census. Although monitoring at the district level has been undertaken by the
DMOs, the system o f monitoring within the district education management system has not been
fully streamlined due to delays in capacity building support for district education teams. The
importance o f evaluation i s increasingly beingrecognized for further program development, and
impact evaluations have been built in for specific program interventions such as stipends and the
School Councils' pilot in six districts (also see paragraphs 123-128 on overall monitoring and
evaluation).

88.        Actions Taken under PEDPCIII. Two school censuses have been conducted duringthe
academic year (in M a y and October 2005).             This census data is now the official Punjab
Government school statistics, replacing the school census database earlier held with the
Provincial EMIS Cell to avoid duplication.         The Government has initiated preparation o f an
analytic report based on the latest census data, and will place this along with detailed census data
on the official website that i s currently under construction.          This effort aims to strengthen
dissemination o f information to supplement the efforts o f the ongoing education awareness
campaign (see Box 5). To further strengthen monitoring o f program progress at the district level,
the databases created by P M l U have been placed with the DMOs. External validation exercise
has now been institutionalized. The second independent Third Party Validation (TPV) has been
initiated for assessing availability of reform inputs and sector performance.                    This i s a
comprehensive survey to assess the delivery o f inputs as well as school enrolment, and teacher
absenteeism. Preparation for the evaluation o f the girls' stipend program has commenced which
would inform Phase I1reforms. A composite monitoring index has been finalized by analyzing
information from various data sets including TPVs, school census data, and the Chief Minister's
monitoring teams' data. District performance has been analyzed and a baseline o f district ranking
has been prepared. The performance o f districts and education management teams will bejudged
on the basis o f this baseline.

Box 5: SpreadingPublic Awareness for Education
A widespread awareness campaign has been an integral part o f the program. This campaign, designed to
create and enhance the importance o f education among the people o f Punjab, has created awareness o f
specific components of the reform program such as provision o f free textbooks, stipends, and missing
facilities. It has also sent out messages that education is a topmost priority o f the province's leadership.
This campaign has relied on national, regional and local print media, national television and radio
networks, closed circuit television (CCTV) to target passengers traveling through railway stations, and
cinemas in 27 cities across Punjab.     Data shows that the outreach o f the print media campaign was
approximately 21.65 million people, or over 26 percent o f the province's population. The outreach o f the
electronic (television and radio) campaign has been even wider, as has the use o f CCTV and cinema-based
messages.

                                                    27

89.        Future Actions. The Government will complete the composite district profile inthe next
census to assess PESRP performance inthe first phase and to update baseline targets for Phase 11,
which will form the basis for agreements with districts under the FY07 TOPs. Based on the
census data from different sources o f monitoring, a composite district monitoring index will be
prepared and its baseline incorporated inthe TOPs. Districts' performance will be ranked on this
basis. It will strengthen its monitoring system to capture information on the private sector in
order to report on overall outcomes in the education sector. It will regularize bi-annual school
census with technical improvements to enable computation o f primary completion and drop out
rates in public schools. Tracking o f students and cohorts will be done to determine completion,
drop out and attrition rates. The results o f initially Grade V and then Grade VI11 standardized
examinations will be merged with the MIS data to enable ready analysis o f school performance
with other variables. It will make more intensive efforts to widely disseminate information and
analysis on the program and outcomes. The education website will link all data sets and will be
regularly updated.       It will develop and implement strategies to gather more qualitative
information from the primary stakeholders and communities on their satisfaction levels with
education service delivery (such as through citizen reporting kiosks and citizen report cards). All
district MIS Cells and monitoring offices will be linked online with the databases maintained with
the provincial EducationDepartment. Evaluations o f programs such as public-private partnership
models, teacher professional development programs, teacher management systems, and School
Council capacity development programs will be carried out. The capacity o f the teams in the
Education Department and the Punjab EducationFoundation will be strengthened to enable them
to develop and manage impact evaluation studies.

           (2) Improve EducationQuality and Access

90.        PESRP aims to enhance the performance o f the education sector by coming closer to
achieving universal primary enrolment, improving primary completion rates, improving student
learning outcomes, and achieving gender parity. The reforms seek to remove the constraints to
access and retention, andto improve the quality o f education services, including o f civil works.

  Box 6: GivingDisadvantagedGirls an Opportunityto Continue and Complete their Education

Since its launch, the girls' stipend program has made steady progress. In the f i s t quarter, October -
December 2003, there were 186,000 girls enrolled inGrades 6 - 8 inthe target districts, and 152,000 (or 88
percent) qualified on the basis o f minimum 80 percent attendance requirement. In the seventh quarter of
distribution in 2005, there were 252,000 girls eligible for the stipend.   The program has led not only to a
significant  increase (almost 37 percent) in the number of enrolled girls in the target schools, but has also
improved attendance- from 88 percent to over 99 percent. Buildinguponthe early success of this program
and to enable girls to complete schooling till Grade 10, the Government has expanded this program
vertically to provide continued support to the girls inthe same target districts at the Grade 9 and 10 levels.

                   (a) Improve Access to Public Education

91.        Overall Progress. Progress inimproving access has been demonstrated and achieved by
provision o f various inputs and actions, including free schooling up to the matriculation level
(tenth grade), timely provision o f fi-ee textbooks to government school students and stipends to
middle school girls in low literacy districts (see Box 6), missing facilities for schools, with 62
percent o f approved schemes for missing facilities completed (see Table 7), and appointment o f
new contract teachers to fill critical vacancies on the basis o f needs analysis. The overall impact
o f these actions has been promising on primary and middle enrolment levels inpublic schools and
inthe progressive reductioningender gaps. However, as noted inparagraph 44, there has been
no discernible shift inreduction in drop outs from Grade K - 1and Grade IV-V.

92.      From the onset o f the program, the provincial government established systems to monitor
the quality o f civil works. While construction was the responsibility o f the district governments,
the Chief Minister established monitoring teams and assigned them to progressively visit all
schools to verify all dimensions o f the reform program, including quality of civil works. The
quality o f civil works construction has emerged as an area o f concern as reports o f the Chief
Minister's monitoring teams who have been undertakmg school visits in all districts reveal flaws
inthe quality o f civil works. These flaws range fromuse oflow grade bricks, lowratio ofcement
with sand, and use o f inappropriate material for reinforcement o f structures.                     While no new
schools have been built under the program, additional classrooms have been provided to over
7,500 schools, and Government is concerned about the quality o f construction o f these
classrooms. School safety issues have also emerged as a major issue after the recent October
2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan in which lives o f thousands o f school children perished
because o f collapse o f school building.

93.      Actions Taken under PEDPCIII.The stipend program has been extended vertically to
cover female students o f Grade 9 and 10 inthe same fifteen targeted districts and disbursements
have commenced. An evaluation o f the stipend program i s underway with support from the
World Bank3*. The free textbook policy has also been expanded to include Grades 9 and 10
students, as a result o f which approximately 11 million students from primary through grade 10
will be provided free textbooks at the start o f the new Academic Year (AY) in August 2006.33
The textbook distribution plan has been re-formulated to accommodate the shift inthe AY and to
cater for the much larger number o f books that will be distributed this year (approximately 24
million books).      The Government has continued to open closed schools by filling the critical
teaching vacancies. Allocations for provision o f missing facilities have been provided to the
district governments. In response to the reports o f the Chief Minister's monitoring teams, an
externally contracted sample-based technical review o f the 7,500 schools provided additional
classrooms under PESRP i s being commissioned. Quality o f civil works through the Civil Works
department i s also being assessed.

94.      Future Actions. Further changes and improvements o f the stipend program will be
considered based on findings o f the impact evaluation, including extending such a program for


31While the Program commenced in July 2003, implementation began from January 2004, as systems were being
  devisedinthe first six months (e.g., TOPS,stipends, textbook distribution). The missingfacilities progress,therefore,
  follows a calendar year rather than the fiscal year andthe table providesupdate on progress for two calendar years -
  January 2004-December2005.
32This studywas originally plannedto take place last year but was delayed in order to allow two full annual cycles to
  be completeprior to launchingthe evaluation.
33The federal government has changed the schedule of the AY, with schools in all provinces and federal areas to
  commence the new AY inAugust (rather than April).

the l o w cost private school sector through the Punjab Education Foundation. The Government
will take further actions to improve access including provision o f infrastructure and staff to
remaining closed primary schools, and to middle and high schools on the basis o f need. It will
use the findings o f its May and October 2006 school census to assess the requirements for
remaining missing facilities such as boundary walls for girls' schools, toilets, additional
classrooms, and requirements for new infrastructure to meet the demands placed on the system
due to new enrolments. The number o f missingfacilities i s not static, especially with new needs
arising due to increasing enrolments, and even after steady progress there will be gaps in facilities
which will need to be met under Phase 11. To fill the information and analysis gap on the college
sector, a study o f the college education sector will be undertaken. Criteria for up-gradation o f
middle and secondary schools, and for the establishment o f new secondary schools, where
required, will be developed. Steps will be taken to ensure better quality standards for school civil
works.    These include more stringent ongoing external supervision; procurement actions to
safeguard against poor quality o f construction; conducting independent ex-post procurement
reviews; and postingresults o f contract awards on the official website.

95.      T o address the issue o f large drop outs, special programs will be considered to reduce
drop outs from pre-primary to Grade 1(such as providing a separate teacher for Katchi classes on
a pilot basis), and Grade 4 to 5 to encourage greater completion o f primary cycle. It will also
develop a strategy for rural areas in southern districts to address low girls' enrolment in the
primary sector.

                  (b)Improve Quality ofEducation

96.      Overall Progress: The Government recognizes the need to improve the quality of
education to complement the improvements made in enhancing access to education.
Implementationprogress inthis area, specifically inteachers' professional development, has been
slow. Government efforts initially focused on restructuring o f the institutional setup (Directorate
of Staff Development   - DSD) for managing the professional development o f teachers. The DSD
has now become fully functional, and it has finalized the Professional Development framework
which gives the direction for teacher training programs. Teacher training and ongoing follow up
support for primary school teachers has been initiated. The programs for class room based
support, especially for least qualified primary school teachers have been finalized.        DSD, in
collaboration with GTZ, has initiated a baseline survey o f learning achievement o f students o f
Katchi, Grade Iand Grade I1(these grades are not covered inNEAS).

97.      Progress inimproving student learning achievement has been slow as it has been difficult
to assess quality improvements in student learning inthe absence o f a province-specific baseline.
This baseline has now been established through NEAS. However, there has been progress in
improving the quality o f teaching materials through the textbook reforms underway. Under the
new policy, textbooks coming up for renewal will be contracted to authors external to the
Textbook Board and selected by an independent selection committee established for this purpose.
Textbook quality i s being improved by initiating award o f textbook printing contracts through a
transparent and competitiveprocess.

98.      Actions Taken under PEDPC III.For improving teacher quality, an action plan for the
restructured DSD, based on the framework for professional development o f teachers, has been
approved. Progress under this action plan includes: (i)    developing in-school support networks,
including creating clusters; (ii)
                                preparation o f lead and district level trainers for training primary
school teachers, and a quality assurance mechanism for this training; (iii)      preparation o f lead
trainers for head teacher training and support; (iv) initiating review o f all teacher training
materials through the establishment o f a materials review group; (v) establishment o f a materials

                                                 30

development group for developing materials, especially for English language teaching for
primary school teachers; and (vi) development o f the teacher training database to take stock o f all
teacher training and competencies.        Private sector service providers are being contracted to
undertake training o f Lead Trainers.         A framework for teachers ' Continuous Professional
Development (CPD) has been approved. Teacher training has commenced in 11 districts, and
almost 500 District Teacher Educators have been trained.               Over 11,000 teachers have been
provided training. Steps to improve quality o f teaching also include the reforms in the area o f
teacher management (see paragraphs 78 - 81 and Box 3).

99.      Theprocess of opening up of textbook development toprivate competition, which started
with the Katchi grade Primer, has been extended to Grade 6 books in FY06. Printing and
publication o f Grade 6 books for all subjects has been undertaken through a competitive process.
The total number o f textbooks that have been printed and published through this has risen from
2.37 million in 2005 academic year to 5.2 million in2006. An action plan has been developed for
textbook reform, including restructuringo f the Textbook Board to realign its functions.

100.     Quality of learning i s being monitored by the NEAS which has established a system o f
ongoing student assessments and completed the first pilot assessment o f grade IV students in
language and mathematics that provides the baseline o f student learning outcomes at the
provincial and national levels34. The establishment o f an independent Punjab Examination
Commission has been approved to improve the quality of examinations (see Box 7), and the first
set o f test papers already developed by this Commission are being piloted during M a y 2006
Grade 5 examinations.        This Examination Commission was not a part o f the original program
framework, but has now become an important addition to support reforms for improving
education quality.

Box 7: IndependentPunjabExaminationCommission (PEC)
A province wide examination o f all Government grade 5 and grade 8 students was conducted by district
governments inFebruary 2005, and was subsequently evaluated by UNICEF. This independent technical
evaluation found serious flaws inthe system (including technical problems with setting o f the examination
papers, derivation o f marking scales, and analysis o f student results).      The evaluation provided very
specific recommendations for improving the system o f school examination. Government has approved
establishment o f an independent Punjab Examination Commission (PEC) that will develop standardized
examination papers to bring uniformity across the province.       With continuing technical support from
UNICEF, PEC has started to work on developing the test papers for this year's examinations, and is inthe
process o f setting up the system for administering and marking the papers. The PEC will be subsequently
established as a statutorv bodv.

101.     Future Actions. The Government will deepen the reforms to improve the quality o f
teaching. After the completion o f the Lead Trainers training, the training program for teachers,
with a priority for primary school and subject teachers, will be implemented in accordance with
the action plan prepared by DSD. The DSD will provide support in establishing clusters and
designated district support staffkainers, and in establishing monitoring mechanisms. It will also
support clusters o f schools to come up with their own plans for in-school teacher support based
on their own particular needs and school environment.                DSD will also pilot a designated
supporter/mentor program as part o f these activities. As a part o f its medium term program, DSD
will establish benchmarks for core competency standards for teachers and will center subsequent
training, post training follow-up and in-school support on these benchmarks. A comprehensive
and holistic teacher professional development program will be prepared to incorporate HR and




34The EducationDepartment has notified the establishment of a separate center for "Punjab Education Assessment
  System" (PEAS), andpositionsfor PEAS have beenapprovedby the Finance Department andpostedinPEAS.

career structure issues, incentives, and technical trainings. An independent evaluation o f the new
teacher development programwill also be initiated.

102.     In order to further improve quality of textbooks and learning material, a phased
restructuring of the Textbook Board will be implemented. This will be part o f the policy for
opening up development, printing and publication o f all textbooks coming up for renewal. In
2007/08 the development, printing and publishing of all titles will be opened to competition.
Considerable thinking has gone into planning a revised lean structure for textbook development
and production which will involve the EducationDepartment, the private sector and the Textbook
Board. Punjab i s also moving towards a sample testing process (in schools) for new textbooks
coming up for renewal. Although it will lengthen the time required to develop and produce new
textbooks, ifproperly managed, it will ensure that their quality i s superior to that o f the books that
they will replace and that they meet the needs o f teachers and students better than their
predecessors did. At the national level, the MOE i s holding dialogue with the four provinces on
moving towards multiple choices o f books. This entails that several different textbooks could be
approved for use in schools inany subject and at any grade level.

103.     Further reforms to improve student learning outcomes will include two key
dimensions. First, it will include monitoring student learning achievements, requiringthe Punjab
Government to ensure that PEAS i s functional and provides measurement o f student learning
against the baseline. Second, the PEC will be made fully functional to serve as the independent
statutory body to examine student learning and the first province-wide standardized examination
for grades 5 and 8 will be conducted inAcademic Year 2007. Punjab will be the first province in
Pakistan to implement this system. It will use the results o f the standardized examination to
provided specific support to districts and schools with greatest academic needs. The data fkom
the examination results will be merged with the MIS data maintained with the department to
enable more comprehensive analysis, and benchmarks on district performance will be included in
future TOPS. The PEC will also encourage private schools to take the same examinations, on
voluntary basis, so that there can be greater competition inthe school system.

                 (c) ImproveAccess by StrengtheningPublicPrivatePartnerships

104.     Overall Progress. The reform program facilitates greater private sector participation in
education service delivery. As a first step the Punjab EducationFoundation(PEF) has been made
autonomous and it has now become operational. It has developed programs to support the low
cost private and NGO sector.

105.     Actions Taken under PEDPC III. Governmentfinancing has been made available to
PEF to support low cost private sector. PEF has launched a Cluster Based Teacher Training
(CBT) Program, which has already trained more than 600 teachers from 88 private educational
institutions from 9 districts o f Punjab.    Eighty two percent o f the participants were female
teachers from schools that charge less than Rs. 400 per month per student. The CBT i s supported
by an in-house Academic Development Unitthat is made up o f subject specialists to help design,
deliver, and monitor training.    PEF has started its flagship program -Financial Assistance to
Schools (FAS), through which it i s supporting low cost schools charging less than Rs. 300 in
monthly fees as indirect stipend for children (see B o x 8).    A pilot voucher scheme has been
designed targeting low-income households in urban slums, inpartnership with the Open Society
Institute, using data of 5,000 households in Lahore. Design features o f this voucher scheme
include: (a) targeting children 12 years and younger, preferably girls; (b) voucher only to be
redeemed at any participating school within a one-kilometer radius o f the target slum settlement;
(c) schools to be selected along criteria developed for the FAS program; and (d) voucher to be
linkedclosely to school development and teacher support by PEF.

Box 8: PunjabEducationFoundation: FinancialAssistance to Schools (PAS) Program
FAS i s the flagship program o f the PEF to promote access to quality education in the l o w cost private
sector. For the current financial year, the PEF has made a budgetary allocation o f Rs.70 million for the
financial assistance o f private schools in less affluent areas on a per child enrolled basis. A s the bulk o f the
enrolment inprivately runinstitutions is inprimary classes, 70 percent will be spent on primary education,
of which 80 percent i s earmarked for existing schools and 20 percent for new schools that are charging up
to a maximumo f Rs. 300 per month as tuition fees and related charges, excluding any amounts in respect
o f the provision o f stationery and textbooks. The financial assistance o nper child enrolment basis, provided
by PEF, cannot be spent on infrastructure development, and is meant to support education activities such as
salaries o f teachers, development o f teaching material, purchase o f science equipment, etc. Preference i s
given to districts with lower rates o f literacy. Inthe initial phase, five districts have been selected, with 60
percent o f finds within these districts earmarked for rural areas. Initially, ten schools are being supported
ineachdistrict, whichhavebeenselectedthroughanopen advertisement process.

PEF will provide quality support to the schools, including through the CBT program and other outreach
efforts. Continued fmancial assistance would be contingent upon the school meeting minimumacceptable
quality standards and performance indicators. The selection process and eligibility criteria have been
posted on the PEF website. Selected schools enter into a formal Terms o f Partnership agreement with PEF,
which calls for the school to register with the District Registration Authority within one year o f association.

106.      Future Actions. The schemes to support low cost private schools will continue to be
financed by the Government. The impact o f these programs will be analyzed before taking them
to scale. The Government will also extend ongoing incentive schemes in the public sector such
as free textbooks and stipends for girls inmiddle schools to low cost private schools, through the
institutionalmechanism o f PEF. PEF's work on setting quality benchmarks will be reviewed as a
step towards establishing standard quality guidelines for private schools. The Government will
analyze the private school data made available through the National School Census to determine
the nature o f the private sector in the province. A study on the private sector will be initiated,
with support from the World Bank. Based on this, appropriate support measures for different
types o f private schools will be prepared. Analysis o f the National Education Census will enable
the Government to develop strategies for encouraging and stimulating private sector response in
underservedrural areas.


         V. THEPROPOSEDTHIRD PUNJABEDUCATION                       DEVELOPMENT         POLICY CREDIT

107.      The objective of the proposed Credit is to provide continued financing to the
province of Punjab to enable it to progress toward the MDG targets related to primary
education and gender parity. This operationwould be the last ina series o fthree single tranche
development policy credits to complete the agreed three year PESRP agenda. Although it started
as a medium term program, it i s evident that sustaining education sector improvements requires a
longer term program and continued assistance. This proposed Credit would continue to create
incentives for sustaining the gains as subsequent funding for Phase I1o f PESRP will be based on
both outcome improvements and overall performance.                      Furthermore, it would continue to
promote Bank's engagement on policy reforms at a time when improvements in the
macroeconomic situation allow increased fiscal space for support to education. Finally, the
Credit would support deepening the reform program by increasing and deepening the focus on
institutional andquality reforms to buildupon the initial success o f PESRP.

108.      The Development Policy Credit @PC) instrument has been appropriate in
supporting the Punjab Government's education reform program.                                 Punjab has been
implementing system-wide reforms, which are backed by a significant increase in the education
budget. The DPC i s the appropriate instrument to support cross-sectoral areas linked to the

                                                        33

education reform program such as fiscal decentralization process and governance reforms. The
Government has a good program and strategy in place to improve education quality and
outcomes, malung it suitable to support through the DPC instrument which can help leverage
more intense focus on these areas.

109.      The Bank's support to PESRP was developed and continues to evolve on the basis o f
underpinning analytic work that has been undertaken by the Bank, other donors, and the
Government at both federal and provincial levels. The proposed credit draws upon the national
and provincial Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Pakistan Poverty Assessment
(2002).     The Punjab Economic Report, the PFMAA, and the Country Gender Assessment
(CGA)35have also helpedto informthe continuing support for PESRP. A draft Strategic Country
Environmental Assessment has been prepared which focuses on institutional arrangements for
environmental management, the environmental impact assessment system, water supply and
sanitation, and urban air quality. Other analytic work includes a Teacher Management Study that
made recommendations for improving the policies for teacher management and recruitment.
Findings o f a World Bank study on public private partnership in education in Punjab will also
provide more information and policy options on the role o f the private sector, as well as a
baseline for the SCs in some o f the districts where a pilot capacity building program through
partnership with NGOs i s under implementati~n~~.Many o f PESRP's interventions are in line
with the findings o f the World Bank's CGA relating to girls' education.                               The Program i s
implementing special programs for girls and for female teachers, including changes inpolicy to
give preference to qualified local women teachers. A key quality reform i s the establishment o f
the independent Punjab Examination Commission. UNICEF supported evaluation o f the existing
examination system and subsequent technical support enabled the Government to develop a
framework for this Commission.

Country Assistance Strategy

110.      The programmatic support to PESRP through a series o f DPCs was developed in 2003
and was in line with the Bank Group's program priorities in the Pakistan Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) FY03-05. The CAS was presented to the Bank's Board in June 200237. A new
CAS i s beingpresented to the Board inJune 200638. Some o f the lessons drawn for the new CAS
also emerge from the lessons o f the federal and provincial DPC operations. These include the
positive experiences with programmatic approaches in Palustan, which provide the flexibility to
support reforms while managing risk. A second important lesson i s the need to focus on results,
and the new CAS lays out a results framework. PESRP i s linked to the achievement o f national
goals highlighted in the CAS, including increased learning achievement o f primary students,
reduction o f gender gaps, increase in literacy rate, and improvement o f post-primary access and
quality.    The proposed Credit i s in line with the priorities o f the new CAS which seek to
accelerate progress inhuman development, focusing on the poor and vulnerable. The three inter-
linked and mutually reinforcing pillars o f the CAS correspond to the strategic priorities o f the
PRSP: (i)sustaining growth and improving competitiveness; (ii)improving government
effectiveness and service delivery; and (iii)                improving lives and protecting the vulnerable.
Bank's support to PESRP i s in line with these pillars, and this proposed operation i s central to
improving delivery o f education services which i s a key objective o f the thirdpillar o f CAS.

   111.     Future annual Punjab Education Development Policy Credits under a new DPC series are
  included in the FY06-09 lending scenario o f the new CAS. IDA support to PESRP i s linked to
   other operations in Paktstan that are also included in the CAS, including the PRSC, the
  Balochistan Primary Education Support Project, the Human Development DPC under preparation
   for NWFP, and the planned Sindh Education DPC.

   Coordinationwith the IMFand Other Donors

   112.     The Bank has been working closely with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and has
  been encouraging donors to build stronger partnerships in support o f the Government's reform
  program and Pakistan's PRSP. The final IMF review o f the PRGF arrangement in December
  2004 was successfully ~ompleted.~' The Bank's work i s well coordinated with the ADB-
   supported PRMP. Gesellschafl         fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), Canadian International
  Development Agency (CIDA) and UNICEF are also providing parallel support for the education
   sector.    The Department o f International Development (DFID) o f the Government o f U K ' s
  assistance is supporting the PRMP and the future ADB-supported Devolved Social Services
  Program.

  Prior Actions Completed

   113.     The choice of prior actions is linked to the reform pillars of PESRP. These prior
   actions are critical to achieving the development objectives ineachreformpillar, mitigating risks,
   and ensuring sustainability. The prior actions support those actions that would show an impact in
  the long term, would be less amenable to reversals, and could be sustained in the long term.
  Thus, these actions focus on sector policy and financing, governance aspects, institutional
  restructuring and reform, strengthening the relationship between the provincial and district
  governments, and bringing about structural changes for improving quality. Adjustments to the
  prior actions for the third Credit have been made to reflect changes where actions have advanced,
   and where progress has been sooner than anticipated. These include increasing performance
  weightage to 40 percent in the TOPS; approval o f a provincial Procurement Strategy; approval to
  establish the Punjab Examination Commission (PEC); approval o f a Continuous Professional
  Development framework for teachers; and restructuring o f district education teams on functional
  lines. Triggers on teacher redeployment and expansion o f girls stipend program (see paragraphs
   8 1 and 93 respectively for the rationale) identified earlier have now been sequenced in Phase 11.
  The Government has submitted an updated Letter o f Sector Development Policy for the third
  program year to reflect the progress and the program direction during the coming years (see
  Annex 1).

   114.     Significant prior actions were taken before the first and second Credits, and these are
  listed inTable 2. Table 8 lists the original triggers for the third Credit, and the prior actions taken
  for the third Credit.

      Sustainability of Sector Financingafter the ReformProgramPeriod

       115.     The sustainability o f the program i s assured through the continued strong commitment o f
      the Provincial Government to education. T o buildupon sector improvements and to come closer
      to achieving MDGs, the Government has extended the programbeyond the three year period with
      assured financing as reflected in the revised MTBF. The PESRP, as designed, i s likely to
      generate a stream o f recurrent expenditure needs in Phase 11. These expenditure requirements,
      which are over and above the normal growth in sector spending, are required to meet the
      recurring costs for the institutions developed under the Program, and for continuation and further
      deepening o f Program initiatives. These factors will lead to a more than 12 percent per annum
      increase in education sector recurrent expenditure inPhase I1o f PESRP. Additional funds would
      be required to meet the needs for growing enrolments at the primary level and to meet the
      growing pressure on the middle, secondary and higher education systems. Moreover, new teacher
      positions and additional infrastructure may also be warranted.          The requirements for missing
      facilities in primary schools are expected to be reduced and large allocations for the missing
      facilities will no longer be required. The net effect o f these factors will lead to a 9 percent



                                                         36

increase in the development budget o f the education sector in 2006107-201 1/12.40 Overall,
expenditures inthe education sector are projected to increase at 13 percent per annum inPhase 11,
and are likely to be sufficient to meet the significantly increasedneeds o f the recurrent budget as
well as some increases inthe development budget.

116.       Increased revenue transfers from the federal government would help the Government to
finance these and other high priority expenditures.                  Nonetheless, the Government intends to
continue with the strategy it has devised to strengthen its finances, which requires improving
provincial revenue collection, reducing non-productive expenditures,                         and improving the
efficiency and quality o f its expenditures.

117.       This implies that after allowing for the increase in education and other high-priority
expenditures, the fiscal position o f the Punjab Government will continue to improve and the large
fiscal deficit o f FY04 i s projected to reduce, eventually turning into surplus by 2009/10.
Therefore, if Punjab implements its overall reform program as designed and in accordance with
i t s medium-term strategy, the fiscal sustainability o f PESRP will be maintained, even under the
scenario o f mild fiscal shocks (e.g. some moderate increases inpublic sector salaries, or shortfalls
in federal revenue collections). Bank support for Phase I1will provide continued incentives to
government and would also assist inmaintaining a focus on quality o f expenditures.

Poverty, Gender and SocialImpact Analysis

118.       Policies and programs supported by this Credit are pro-poor and aim at reducing
gender inequities. The program seeks to provide access to schooling for poor and underserved
areas.       Incidence analysis of public education expenditures in Pakistan shows that these
expenditures are clearly pro-poor and thus, even without the full impact o f reforms, the increased
spending on public education will benefit the poor. PEF i s providing financial support to low-
cost private sector institutions and NGOs to help increase access to schooling among the urban
and rural poor. The Government aims to ensure equity by focusing on districts with the lowest
education indicators, and emphasizing reductions in the urban-rural disparities by encouraging
private sector provision inunderserved rural areas.

119.        The program has been designed on the basis of extensive consultations with
stakeholders and beneficiaries, including in-depth meetings and discussions with local
government officials, district education teams, and NGOs. The emphasis on SCs i s a key
element o f the program, which aims to enhance community and parental involvement in
education, particularly to improve teacher and school management and enhance enrolments.
NGO participation i s a major delivery mechanism for capacity building and social mobilization
aspect o f the SC program. NGOs are providing support to SCs in six pilot districts, and the SC
capacity buildingprogram i s being extended to other districts with the participation o fNGOs.

120.       An overarching objective of the PESRP is to reduce gender inequities in theprovince.
The female stipend program targeting girls in middle school has been helping to increase girls'
enrolment and retention. Other efforts to address the gender gap include the Government's policy
o f giving priority to provision o f missing facilities such as boundary walls and toilets for girls'
schools. Over one half o f the expenditures for provision o f missing facilities have been spent on
improving girls' schools.          The appointment o f facility specific teachers at the local level benefits
female teachers who will not need to travel long distances. The CGA cited female teacher
transportation issues and this i s being addressed under the new contract policy where higher



40  As this increase of 9 percent will be on an already increased base established under PESRP, the development budget
    increases are deemed as appropriate for meeting the needs o fthe sector.
                                                            37

points are given to local teachers so that long travel distances can be avoided. Preference i s also
given to recruitment o f female teachers for primary schools.

EnvironmentalAspects

121.    The program i s environmentally benign, and will not have significant effects on the
environment, naturalresources, or forests. Inparticular, the policies supported under the program
will not lead to higher levels o f physical investment, and the TOPs include environmental
guidelines. No new schools are planned. Should a need for new schools arise, land will be
identified by the community and acquired through voluntary donation with adequate environment
and social due diligence. Environmental screening has been conducted, and the environment
impact assessment i s includedinthe Policy Matrix indicating the potential environmental impact.

122.    A key environmental concern is the needto ensure the provision o f safe drinkingwater at
schools, and the provision and maintenance o f adequate sanitation. The program ensures that
water supplied to schools will be tested annually, and that water supply schemes are located at a
sufficient distance from toilets and septic tanks to prevent contamination o f drinking water. The
proposed milestones for the fourth credit include development o f a revised policy for
implementationo f civil works to ensure better quality standards, including provision o f safe water
and sanitation.

Monitoring andEvaluationSystem

123.    Systemic Changes. The PMIU i s responsible for both: (a) monitoring and evaluating the
impact o f the overall program on public primary schooling; and (b) overseeing implementation of
certain key components o f the reform program itself, such as textbook and stipend distribution. It
has revamped the EMIS, and the systematic strengthening o f monitoring data by PMIUhas made
their dynamic database thereference point onpublic school data for the province.

124.    Outcome and Output Indicators.          The proposed Credit will support the Punjab in
accomplishing the outcomes and outputs listed in the Matrix o f Policy Reforms (see Annex 2).
These indicators are also aligned with the monitoring matrix developed by the Government o f
Pakistan for the education sector inthe PRSP, and with the MDGs. After the thirdcredit, updated
indicators (including quality indicators), and baselines will be established for Phase 11, and also
includedinthe TOPs.

125.    Outcome Indicators. The outcome indicators that are included in the PRSP monitoring
framework are being used, including enrolment rates for primary and middle school levels, and
completion rates at the primary level. Some o f these indicators are household-based measures.
Currently the education database does not have the ability to track individual pupils through the
system given that it does not assign nor collect unique student identification umbers.
Recognizing this gap in data, the government i s now putting in place measures in the school
census to enable it to determine drop out and completion rates for public sector schools. The
introduction o f a system o f unique student identification numbers would provide information on
public school completion rates. However, overall completion rates, including private school
completion rates, would have to be obtained through household survey data.

126.    Baseline and Impact Data. Baseline data on public school enrolment i s available from
the Education Department's district profile prepared inApril 2003. A public school census was
conducted in February 2004 to fill the gaps in this database and repeat censuses were conducted
inOctober 2004, May 2005 and inOctober 2005'to assess the enrolment trends and other critical
school data. The recent PSLSM Survey also provides data on overall school enrolments, showing

                                                 38

an increase in net primary enrolment rates. The reduction o f teacher absenteeism i s one o f
PESRP's main objectives.        Through the ongoing monitoring conducted through the Chief
Minister's monitoring teams, over 25,000 schools have been visited during2005. The monitoring
teams found low teacher absenteeism. However, this cannot be considered as a baseline as the
data was gathered through a one time visit to schools and did not include repeat visits. The
government i s committed to establish a more systematic measure o f this important PRSP
indicator in Phase 11. Questions on teacher presence have been included inthe current round o f
thirdparty validations.

127.    Independent Third-party Surveys. External agencies have been contracted to conduct
independent third-party surveys to verify implementation o fprogram interventions. Inaddition to
the textbook and stipend validation surveys, independent TPVs are also being carried out on
procurement and P M I U data systems on an annual basis. Altogether this constitutes a significant
achievement ininternal and external data harmonization.

128.    Impact Evaluation. An impact evaluation i s being conducted with Bank support to
assess the impact o f the reform program, especially the impact o f stipends. The evaluation i s
taking into account the possible influence o f the reformprogram interventions on parental choice
between private and public schools. The positive effects o f the stipend program on public school
enrolment have already been established through an analysis o f public school data.             The
evaluation study attempts to assess the source o f this enrolment increase (e.g., whether the
increases are coming from girls previously out o f school or previously inprivate schools) and to
better understand the socio-economic constraints that hinder access and retention despite the
reformprogram. The evaluation o f the School Councils capacity support inpilot districts i s being
conducted through the World Bank study on public private partnerships, which will provide
information on the impact o f this program on school and student performance.

Fiduciary Aspects

129.     An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) was conducted in
2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities at the SBP particularly as relating to its financial
statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable Central Bank standards.
However, since a program o f reformhas been agreed with the IMF and i s being implemented, the
risks associated with foreign exchange management control have been mitigated. The State Bank
of Palustan has transitioned to producing financial statements which accord with international
accounting standards and formats. An independent review o f the SBP's internal audit function, as
recommended by the Safeguards Assessment, has since been completed and recommendations
implemented. The SBP has also established a formal process o f reconciling data reported to the
Fundas well as implemented guidelines to prohibit operations that pledge or encumber reserves,
or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability o f foreign exchange reserves outside
an authorized framework. The SBP's Act has been accordingly amended to strengthen and
guarantee its independence and autonomy in the management o f reserves as required under the
Safeguards Assessment. For this operation therefore, and considering the provincial financial
management reform measures being undertaken, the financial management risk continues to be
rated `low'.

130.    The key fiduciary issue i s the Government's ability to ensure that government's
budgetary funds are used inthe manner and for the purposes for which they were intendedby the
legislature. From the financial management perspective, the CFAA revealed several weaknesses
in data reliability, particularly below the federal level. A number of initiatives and actions are
currently being implemented to remedy a significant number o f lapses, in order to further
strengthen the accountability process. The CFAA however concluded that notwithstanding the

                                                 39

lapses which are currently being addressed through a series o f reform measures, the fiduciary risk
to Bank funds and other donor funds managed through mainstream government systems in
Pakistan i s low. It cited improvements in expenditure monitoring and tracking and concluded
that development policy credits and loans disbursed and managed through reliance on
government-own financial management systems have shown overall satisfactory outcomes. The
report recognized however that greater effort i s required in building institutional and personnel
capacity to engender increased comfort and support the transition to full reliance on government
systems, controls and financial reporting. At the provincial level, the outcome o f the Punjab
PFMA as mentioned inparagraph 66, shows that the province i s achieving results in the reform
agenda. Among the initiatives being implemented at the moment i s the PIFRA at the federal,
provincial and district levels. Punjab i s committed to fast-tracking the implementation o f PIFRA,
and has demonstrated this by preparing the provincial budget for FY06 on the basis o f the new
chart o f accounts, which i s IMF `Government Financial Statistics' (GFS) compliant. It has also
adopted, and i s progressively introducing, an integrated computerized financial management
system under the project with an expected full connectivity by September 2007. For the FY06,
Punjab i s one o f two provinces in Pakistan that has also prepared the budgets o f the district
governments on the new chart o f accounts. This provides the platform for a uniform accounting
and reporting o f financial and fiscal data for the province and obviates the possibility o f data
distortion and unreliability.

131.     The Provincial Finance Department has responded to the need to improve financial
management at the district level and in all provincial departments by initiating the recruitment o f
qualified finance and accounting staff, many o f whom are to be located in the districts. The
Education Department has also developed internal audit and control functions through the P M I U
in the Department o f Education which, in addition to program monitoring and evaluation, is
overseeing the implementation o f need-based capacity programs at the district level. Recruitment
of internal audit staff at the district level i s underway, albeit slowly.

 132.    As a further measure for fiduciary risk management and control at the province, the
provincial government in collaboration with the Bank has carried out a comprehensive `Public
Financial Management and Accountability (PFMA) Assessment for the Province in 2005, This
study captures the additional specific strengths and weaknesses in financial accountability inthe
province with a view to introducing further capacity building measures where required.           The
report will be further updated in FY07 using the approved PEFA performance measurement
framework.

 133.    To ensure proper monitoring and reporting o f education sector expenditures under the
reform program the following specific measures are being implemented:

      Education expenditures are being regularly reported in detail through the introduction o f
      specific heads o f accounting, usingthe new chart o f accounts;
      The District Accounts Offices (DAO) regularly prepare and submit consolidated reports o f
      expenditures to the Education Department (PMIU), and the provincial Finance Department.
      This information is reconciled with information available from the Executive District
      Officer (EDO-Finance);
      Information on utilization o f funds i s tied to physical progress and targets for each district.
      This enables the Finance Department to justify additional financing requests for each
      district, when necessary; and
      The PMIU has been staffed with qualified staff who are worlung with the districts to
      develop focused programs to build district education departments' financial management
      capacities.


                                                     40

134.     The Government has also undertaken broad procurement reforms to improve economy,
transparency and accountability in the procurement process and to eliminate procedures and
practices that impede competition.        Under the ADB supported PRMP the Government has
developed streamlined and simplified rules and procedures for use by the procuring agencies at
the provincial and local government level. The education sector program i s benefiting from
reforms at the provincial level. These include the following:

  0      The Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) has been replaced by market-based schedule.
  0      The biddingprocess has now opened up with contractor qualification requirements and
         evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents, and evaluation o f bids i s
         conductedaccording to the specified criteria.
  0      Adequate time i s now allowed to bidders for preparation and submission o f bids, and the
         practice o f Gallop tendering has been restricted to emergencies in exceptional cases with
         prior approval o f the Head o f the implementing agency.
  0      Capacity development and training programs for procurement staff have been
         implementedat the provincial and district level.
  0      Thirdparty annual sample ex-post procurement reviews are being conducted.
  0      A provincial procurement strategy has beenprepared.

Credit Administration,Disbursements,andFiduciaryAssurance

135.     Borrower and Credit Agreement. This proposed third Credit would be made to the
Islamic Republic o f Pakistan, represented by the Federal Ministry o f Finance.           The Credit
proceeds would be transferred by the Federal Government to the Government o f Punjab under the
terms and conditions consistent with the Government o f Pakistan's on-lending policy.

136.     Funds flow arrangements for the Credit are as follows: The Government o f Pakistan
shall identify a Foreign Exchange Deposit Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) into
which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis upon Credit
effectiveness. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds inthe Account will, within two worhng days,
be transferred into the Consolidated Fund o f the Government o f Punjab (Account No. 1 N o n  -
Food) held with the SBP.

137.     Disbursements. Disbursements from the Consolidated Account No. 1 (Non-food) by the
Government o f Punjab shall not be tied to any specific purchase and no special procurement
requirement shall be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance
expenditures in the negative list as defined in the Schedule o f the Financing Agreement. If any
portion o f the Credit i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined inthe Schedule o f the
Financing Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA
upon such request shall be cancelled from the Credit.

138.     Accounting and Assurance Requirements for the Credit. The SBP, on behalf o f the
Government, shall maintain an appropriate accounting system in accordance with generally
acceptable accounting principles. N o additional assurance requirements in the form o f a formal
audit i s required in light o f the fiduciary environment as established with the management o f
foreign exchange reserves by the SBP. However, within 45 days o f disbursement o f the Credit by
IDA, the Finance Secretary o f the Province shall provide a certificate to IDA confirming the
receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the Credit into the Consolidated Fund Account o f the
Government o f Punjab, the date o f the receipt,aiand the exchange rate applied to translate the
Credit currency into Rupees.

                                                     AND

LessonsLearned

139.     This proposed Credit draws upon and benefits from the lessons learned from the first two
credits, the experience o f provincial adjustment programs inPalustan, Bank-wide experience with
development policy lending, and experience o f sector investment projects inPakistan. Instructive
lessons have been learned since work on the first credit was initiatedin2003:

      Strongpolitical championship, government ownership and commitment i s essential for the
      success and continuity o f a reformprogram. This leads to high level monitoring and
      oversight, which creates a momentuminthe system to focus on outcomes. Alignment of
      vision and strategy among the key set o fpolicy makers and implementationteams i s
      essential. These conditions need to be matched with champions at the implementation level,
      supported by strong dedicated teams.
      A programmatic lendinginstrumentbasedon a series o fannual single tranche
      disbursements works well when based on strong quantiJiableprior actions, and when
      backedby intensive ongoing dialogue anchored on policy and implementation reviews.
      Analytical work prior to the program i s important, but equally critical i s ongoing analytical
      work that can feed into annual program design.
      Iti s necessary to ensureeflcient implementation of new reform areas inorder for the
      program to remain credible.
       Thefocus on results is critical but is possible only if there is credible data and a dynamic
      monitoring system, backed by external and independent validation.
      In a sector such as education, it is not possible to tackle all challenges at one go and
      phasing of reforms is important. However, the reformprogrammust not loose momentum
      and needs to have the in-builtflexibility to respond to emerging needs.
      Institutionalization of reforms in the mainstream government systems i s important as stand
      alone support unitsdo not leave behind capacity.
      Capacity building is an extremely important ingredient for sustaining initial gains of a
      program. This i s an area where progress has been slow, but the third credit focuses on this.
       Targeted interventions havepositive impact on enrolment levels. However, improved
      learning outcomes require much deeper and multipronged interventions.

BenefitsandRisks

140.     Before the first Credit this program was considered a high-benefit, high-riskprogram but
progress to date in implementation shows a reduction inrisk and higher benefits than anticipated.
The main benefits o f the Program are resulting from the improvements in primary and middle
school enrolments, reduction in gender disparities, and changes in sector management and
monitoring. The Program has introduced performance-based incentives for districts, which has
led to strengthening o f the decentralization process and to improvements in service delivery and
outcomes. If the Program maintains its performance, it would contribute to helping the country
move towards the MDGs related to universal primary enrolment and closing the gender gap. It
was anticipated at the time o f the first credit that improvements in education outcomes inPunjab,
which i s the largest province o f Pakistan, would have a country wide impact. This impact i s
happening sooner than expected.         The initial success o f PESRP i s demonstrating to other
provinces, especially NWFP and Sindh, the potential rapidbenefits that can be brought about by a
comprehensive reformeffort.

141.     Before the first credit, a major risk expected came from Palustan's history o f stagnation
ineducation indicators due to lack of sustained highlevel support to the education agenda. The
experience shows that the risk mitigating measures identified were appropriate. The program
continues to have political support at the highest political level. However, there i s always an
inherent political risk in democratic systems that change in government through the electoral
process can shift priorities. The intensive awareness campaign and early indications o f enrolment
increases have generated rising expectations among the public. It i s likely that continued public
pressure would help inensuring reformcontinuity despite any change o f government.

142.     Enrolments continue to show rapid increases. This can be a major risk if these expanded
numbers overwhelm the system by causing pressure on the already extended physical
infrastructure, and if quality improvements do not keep up with the increasing numbers o f
children entering the public education system. Factors mitigating this risk are the specific
measures to: (a) provision o f teachers and infrastructure support based on school-specific needs;
(b) launching a comprehensive teacher's professional development program; (c) establishment of
an independent Examination Commission; and (d) Government's commitment to increase sector
expenditures inaccordance with the growing demand for education.

143.     Another major risk lay inthe evolving roles and responsibilities o f the local governments
relative to the Provincial Government, as the evolved system o f government was still gradually
taking shape. While the risk remains, it i s less significant. Moreover, the early successes have
added to the credibility o f the program. The provincial government i s taking steps to build the
ownership o f the newly elected district governments. The risk mitigating measure i s that given
the early successes o f the program, and the incentive o f increased resources for education, the
district governments will continue to maintain the partnerships with the provincial government.

144.     Weak institutional capacity, especially at the district level, to implement and monitor the
program poses another risk. This risk remains and i s being managed through the capacity
development programsbeing implemented with provincial resources.

145.     There were potential risks from weak financial management capacity at the provincial
and district levels that could hamper implementation o f the reform program. These risks are
being mitigated by actions taken during the past two years and inthe progressive implementation
of PIFRA. Essentially, the fiduciary risk for this sectoral program i s now rated `low' due to the
series o f reform actions taken within the education sector to address the hitherto core lapses o f
financial control.

146.     An ambitious quality focus is on the agenda of the Punjab Government. This can pose a
risk as the reforms involve significant institutional changes. Factors mitigating this risk are: (a)
the strong ownership and political leadership; and (b) the phased steps being taken to implement
these reforms.

147.     There i s still continuing risk that School Councils (SCs) will not be allowed to function in
accordance with their mandate or would continue to have weak capacity. This risk i s being
mitigatedby contractingwith NGOs for capacity development o f School Councils. Also, the SCs
are being strengthened and are now authorized to receive school-based budgets for both civil
works and recurring expenditures.

148.     Finally, there i s a riskrelatedto macroeconomic management. Although the policy stance
o f the federal government has remained appropriate, continued high inflation and external trade
deficit indicate significant excess liquidity in thE economy, and will require resolute actions to
contain money supply. In this regard, the Government i s committed to take necessary steps to
ensure macroeconomic stability.

                                          VII. PHASEI1PESRP

149.     The Government has requested continued IDA support for Phase I1 PESRP after
completion o f the three year IDA support for the current phase o f the program. Support for Phase
I1under a new programmatic series of DPC credits is included inthe Bank's forthcoming three
year Country Assistance Strategy (FY06-09)41.               This support will be based on an agreed
framework for Phase I1reform program and an agreed Medium Term Budgetary Framework.
The Government seeks to deepen the quality agenda, expand public-private partnerships, improve
access beyond elementary level, strengthen monitoring and evaluation, and improve the capacity
of district education systems.         A sector-wide reform program, with sequenced actions and
financing i s being developed for Phase 11. The following (Box 9) presents some indicative
actions which could be supported under the next DPC series. Future actions are also discussed in
more detail in Section IV o f this document. These will be strengthened and finalized along with
the triggers based on the agreed framework for Phase I1PESRP.

continued. The focus on missingfacilities will substantially be reduced as large unmet needs are
likely to have been met. Improvements in middle and secondary schools, including up-grading
primary schools to middle level are also anticipated. Initiatives to strengthen School Councils
and provision o f school basedbudgets will be institutionalizedto ensure greater participation and
decision-making o f communities at the school level. The focus o f Phase I1will be on quality
issues including teacher professional development, achieving measurable improvements in
student learning, and improvement in textbooks.          Teacher professional development needs,
textbook content, and measuring o f student learning outcomes will be linkedto the examinations
system. TOPSwill begin to include indicators on quality, including improvements in student
learning, district performance in examinations and reduction in teacher absenteeism.         More
intensive interventions to further improve access and retention will be developed using school-
specific data on inputs, outputs and performance. Analytical work will be undertaken to assess
the existing policy framework and investment climate for the private sector. New areas o f reform
will include support for higher education, including development o f a college education strategy
covering both public and private delivery. Evaluations will be embedded in Phase I1and its core
interventions.     A full independent program evaluation will commence during 2006 to
systematically assess the impact o f the program. Some o f the core quality areas under Phase I1
are presented below.

151.    Experience to date points towards the urgent need to focus on the teachers in a
comprehensive manner. There i s recognition that the quality o f each school i s largely dependent
on the quality o f teachers and what they are able to do in the classroom to facilitate learning.
Teacher performance i s influenced by many inter-related factors that include motivation,
monitoring o f performance, use o f resource materials, management support, conducive physical
classroom environment, training, and classroom based support. To date, significant progress has
been made on some o f the HR issues including improving the entry qualification for teachers,
incorporating merit into recruitment policies, and recruiting additional teachers based on a needs
analysis. Some progress has also been made on improving classroom environment facilities,
providing missing infrastructure, conducting trainings, and planning for teacher training and
school-based support for teachers. However, much o f the reliance to date on improving teacher
performance has been on teacher training.

152.    Recognizing this, a more holistic approach to professional development i s being
developed in Phase 11. The Government i s committed to a coordinated effort for the integration
of the above elements. As part o f this effort, more work will be undertaken on trying to study the
incentive structures possibly linkedto performance, the introduction o f induction training for new
teachers, and linkingpromotion with performance, and training prior to promotion. In order to
linkthe various elements ofthe professionaldevelopment program for public school staff, shared
understanding will be built together with the various stakeholders. The procedure and process o f
recruitment will continue to evolve and improvements inthe process will be made inlight o f the
experience gained through previous phases o f recruitment. Results o f rationalization exercise in
provision o f teachers will be implemented, and the government will consider creation o f
additional positions o fteachers for schools, where enrolment increase so warrants.

153.    For textbook improvement, the focus so far has been on improving the physical quality o f
textbooks, opening up printing and publishing to completion for two grades, and on-time
availability o f free textbooks to all children in the province. Phase I1will focus on opening up
printing, publishingand development o f all textbooks to competition, improving the content of
the textbooks, along with developing supporting materials for teachers.       The process o f new
textbook development will start after the federal Ministry o f Education has approved new
curricula that are beingdeveloped.


                                                 45

154.    Capacity support, data analysis, monitoring and supervision and quality agenda will focus
on improving student learning outcomes and improving quality o f teaching and learning. These
dimensions will be aligned so that visible quality improvements take place. The quality
dimensions involving textbook production, examinations, the national assessment, and learning
competencies will be coordinated and sequenced together, particularly with the teacher training
program, on-site classroom support and resource material development for both teachers and
students. Inall the changes taking place, a school and student centered focus will remain and all
interventions will be designed based on the needs o f schools and students, with flexibility built in
to accommodate different needs in different schools. Provision o f school-based budgets and
capacity support to School Councils will be key interventions to meet the on-going needs o f
schools.

     Subject: f                   x                 q



     The Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) is now in its
     third year of implementation. We are pleased with the good progress
     in the results thus far. From 2003 to 2006, PESRP has continued to
     show progress. We expect most of the targets to be met during this
     third and last year of the 3 year program.    The Punjab Government
     has remained committed to this high priority reform program, a
     commitment that is confirmed by the World Bank's support through
     two development policy credits. The full program was presented inthe
     first Letter of Sector Development Poljcy issued by the Government of
     Punjab on December 26, 2003, which was followed by the second
     Letter of Sector Development Policy issued on January 25, 2005. This
     Letter reaffirms the Punjab Government's commitment to education
     sector reforms and policies by continuing the program for another
     three year period. It presents progress since 2003, and presents the
      emerging framework for the Phase I1 of the Program which will allow
      us to take further the reforms launched in 2003.


      One of the main factors driving the reform program has been the high
      level  political  commitment     and   engagement       of    the  Punjab
      Government. The Chief Minister is committed to the education sector
      reforms, and continues to play a leadership role in ensuring high iqvel

                                     7,-


oversight of PESRP.     On April 1, 2004 a high level PESRP Steering
Committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary,
reporting directly to the Chief Minister, and having the participation of
the heads of the planning and development, finance, education, and
other key line departments.       This Steering Committee continues to
regularly review the progress of the PESRP. It plays a central role in
providing policy direction for the program and facilitates strategic
decision making.

                                                               . _ _ _ _   --_    __
We have continued to- spread awareness about education through
electronic and print media which has also helped promote information
about the Program to parents and students. We are further committed
to sharing information of program results even more widely through
means of a new education website that is about to be launched.


The success of the reform program has also been brought about by the
strong partnerships between the provincial and district governments,
 and this process of consultation is becoming stronger with passage of
 time. The provincial government strongly believes that without full
 ownership of district governments, we will not be able to achieve
 sustainability of the reforms.     Therefore, it is being ensured that
 regular dialogue with the new district partners contrnue,      ..         .- _.__  .




 Key Achievements and Proqress


 Public school enrollments are continuing to increase steadily.       Total
 enrollment from Class Katchi to Class 10 has increased by just over
 20% since the launch of the reform initiative, or from 8.84 million to
  10.63 million. Although enrollment increases are happening for both
  boys and girls in all districts, the increase for girls in class$s 6-8*in

1%   for the education sector,    We are meeting our commitments in the
     Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) and are increasing
     provincial and district expenditures in a sustainable manner. Budget
     allocations for the education sector in the provincial budget continue to
     increase, and have registeLed mare than 12% increase in this fiscal
     year (FY2006) over the previous year.

     One of the major achievements of PESRP has been the revamping of
     the monitoring and evaluation system. All the data, based on school
     census, regular field monitoring, and other special data collection
     exercises, is fully computerized and the datasets are professionally
     analyzed. This monitoring system is based on the Program's ongoing
     monitoring, supplemented by a strong field monitoring component in
     the shape of the Chief Minister's District Monitoring Teams, and a third
     party validation system that are carried out annually. The data and
     information is not only analyzed but is actually used by decision
      makers in the education and other provincial departments.             The
      Program Steering Committee also values the analysis and information

      made available through this monitoring system, - -
                                          ._                        - _ --     -.- -
                                                                                  -I.




      The monitoring model and system has been greatly appreciated by the
      World Bank and other international agencies, as well as by other
      provinces. It has been recognized as an international best practice in
      monitoring and management information systems.              After having
      established this at the provincial level, we are now taking this system
      to the district education department level, and will provide training and
      support to district education staff to equip them with the necessary
                                                                           k'

     have also taken actions to make improvements in the          area of
procurement and financial management so that the education sector is
better governed, and leads to better quality and efficiency of service
delivery.   Efforts are being made to reduce the volume of audit
observations in the education sector. An expenditure tracking system
has been set up and is providing timely computerized information on
education expenditures at the district and provincial level - it is the
first time that this is happening for any sector in Punjab. APrQvincial      -   _____
Financial Management and Accountability            Assessment has been
conducted in partnership with World Bank and other donors, and this
will provide us and our development partners continuous information
on progress achieved by the              province in improving financial
management and accountability.           Capacity building of district and
provincial staff in the area of financial management has also been
initiated.

Procurement practices have been made more transparent, including
annual    independent     ex-post     procurement     reviews  to   assess
compliance with Government procurement rules and procedures. The
 third party validation also included end-use surveys to ensure that
 inputs provided by the reform program, -such.Bs--fu?nitu-ETnd civil         ----'-.-

 works, are actually available a t the school level. A level playing field is
 being offered to all contractors to improve both the quality and
 efficiency of civil works and other procurement. School Councils have
                                                                              <
 been authorized to carry out small civil works a t the school level to
 improve quality and efficiency. We have also approved a provincial
 procurement      strategy   to     bring     further  improvements      and
 transparency. We are committed to not only providing the necessary
 inputs for improving education, but also are ensuring that the services
                                                                  P

                  o improve quality of education, the focus of the Program has been on
                    king several institutional changes to allow us to fundamentally
                    prove the way that quality education is ensured. This area will be a
                priority under the second phase. One key aspect of quality is teacher
                professional development.      The institution to oversee all teacher
                training in the province, the Directorate of Staff Development has been
                re-organized, and is now in the process of developing a holistic teacher

                an independent Punjab Examination Commission which was not
                foreseen when we started PESRP. This Commission aims to improve
                student learning and allows its measurement through the conduct of
                standardized examinations of Class 5 and Class 8 students. The first
                such examination will take place in May 2006.          Improvements in
                textbooks are being made through gradual opening up of textbook
                printing and publishing to the private sector, and already textbooks of
                Class Katchi and Class 6 have been developed through open
                competition. These are important initial steps towards longer term
                textbook improvement that will include restructuring of the Punjab
                Textbook Board. This restructuring will shift the Boards focus to
                oversight and quality control rather than just printing and -publishing;-- --  - -

                 All of these changes have required careful consideration, and now that
                 they are in place, we feel confident that we can move further to
                 improve quality.
                 We also fully support the participation of the private sector in delivery
                 of education, and have started to finance low cost private providers
                 through the autonomous Punjab Education Foundation.

          ovision of missing infrastructure in government schools


       The province has 63,909 government schools, including mosque,
       primary, middle, high and higher secondary schools. At the time the
       reform program was being launched, an extensive survey was carried
       out to determine the status of physical infrastructure of--these schools.
                                                           ______-----            -__.
       It was determined that many of these-;nstitutions lacked basic facilities

 i     like classrooms, drinking water, furniture, electricity, toilets and

 t                                                                             I n

       Keeping in mind the safety and security of school children, one key

       construction of all civil works carried out under the Program.
        Subsequent to this initial review, a sample review of all school
        buildings in the province (even those constructed prior to PESRP) will
        also be carried out. Once this technical review is complete, a strategy
        for future civil works will be developed to ensure better quality
        construction,

                                                                               ' j ..

  here are 44,346 primary schools in Punjab and just 7,379 middle
 chools. This skewed pyramid is a big hindrance in allowing children
    continue schooling beyond the primary level, and is one of the
factors contributing to high drop out rate, especially amongst girls
completing the primary cycle. In order to address this issue, a stipend
program (Rs. 200/month) was launched as a pilot in fifteen districts of
Punjab where the lite,racy rate was less than 40%, targeting initially
the girls studying in middle school classes of govefnment schools
                                                          , t

(Class 6 - 8).    Eligibility of girls in-the target schools is based on her
80% attendance in school during a quarter, the monitoring and third
party validation reports are showing that in addition to enrolment the
attendance rates have also improved.


To date, Rs. 1.04 Billion have been dispersed to 254,761 girls. This
initiative is yielding very fruitful results .as the enrolment of middle
class girls in fifteen low literacy districts has shot up by 37%. The
number of eligible girls in 2003 was approximately 175,000, which has
now increased to 254,761.        Keeping in view these results and to build
upon the initial positive response, the intervention has been vertically
extended to cover the gth and loth grades in the same fifteen low-
 literacy districts of Punjab with effect from January 2006. -An'Impact
 evaluation of the stipend program is now being undertaken with
 support from the World Bank.


 Provision of free textbooks


 One of the first steps of the Punjab Government when it took office in
 October, 2002 was the announcement of policy of free education up till
 Class 10. I n order to complement this decision, it was later decided to
 provide free textbooks to the students.            I n the first year of the
  Program, free books were provided to 6.5 million students from Katchi

                                             _ __ _.-

 o Class 5 at the cost of Rs. 471 million, and to 9.8 million students
from Katchi to Class 8 in the second year at a cost of Rs. 731million.
One of the critical success factors of this initiative is not just that
textbooks are being made available free of cost to students, but that
children are now receiving the complete set of books at the start of the
school year, facilitating them to pursue their education without any
delays.    From the next academic year commencing in August 2006,
the Government has decided to __---_this initlagg of provision of
                                    extend
free textbooks up till Class 10, and distribution of these textbooks has
already started.


Teachers recruitment


Punjab's public school system employs 356,033 teachers and a vast
majority of them are Primary School Teachers with Matricu,late/Primary
Teaching Certification (Matric/PTC) qualification. I n order to hire better
qualified teachers and to ensure their availability at school, the Punjab
Government has revised the teachers' recruitment policy as a key
activity under PESRP. The teacher recruitment process is' no longer
limited only to filling teachers' vacancies; rather it is also responsive to

quality and governance issues of school education. It has helped in
enhancing teachers' basic qualifications (to Bachelors of Education,
 and Masters of Science in the case of science subject teachers),
 allocating teachers to schools on the basis of enrollment, ensuring
 teacher's presence through facility specific contract employment,
 encouraging female candidates to apply for vacancies even in boys
 schools at elementary level, meeting shortage of specialist teachers in
 Mathematics and Science, and revising the salary package for the
 contract teachers to make the job more attractive.- already the salary
 has been increased at service entry point to attract a better pool of
 candidates.   Moreover, the selection criterion of teachers has been

                                                                       .-

refined to attract local talent for filling teaching positions. To date
30,000 new teachers stand recruited whereas recruitment of 19,722
additional teachers is near completion.          We intend to continue
recruitment in line with this policy in future also.


Teachers' Professional Development


As part of overall grofessionaL_developmenti--the- tra-irrin-g of the  --

teachers is critical to improving quality of education. The Government
sees training as part of an overall and comprehensive professional
development of teachers.       As a first step, the Directorate of Staff
Development (DSD) has been restructured to enable it to function as
the apex body for teacher's training, and for developing and
implementing ongoing mentoring and support programs for teachers.
A t the moment, DSD is modeling various packages in consultation with
professional private sector institutes. A         Continuous Professional
Development Framework for teachers has been approved. So far, more
than    11,000 teachers     in twelve districts     have been trained.
Partnerships with private sector providers for training are a key aspect
of the program and these are being. put-into place..- The -Education-----
                                      . .

Department is developing linkages with other departments to make
improvements in the career structure of the teachers, it is also
 addressing teacher management by bringing about changes in the
district education hierarchy, so that teachers are better assisted &
 supervised.


 Community Participation


 Effective management of 63,909 government schools without the
 involvement of the key stakeholders like the parents and the
 community is not possible. For this reason new School Councils have

been formed all over the province in which 51%            f members are
parents.    Analysis based on school census data collected by the
Education Department shows that School Councils are active in more
than 80% primary schools, whereby they have membership and are
maintaining accounts.     The financial powers of these councils have
been substantially enhanced (upto Rs. 400,00O/year) for enabling
them to undertake small civil works,    A pilot capacity building project
                                                 -__- -   -- --- --        ---.-
is being undertaken to target 2,400-School Councils in six pilot districts
in partnership with National Rural Support Program and the Punjab
Rural Support Program. I n the second year of the Program Rs. 500
million are being spent on this capacity building activity. A capacity
building program for School Councils outside the pilot area to cover all
schools in other districts in a phased manner is also being launched in
partnership with other NGOs operating in the education sector. The
 Punjab government feels that faster progress is required in this area
so that community participation for all schools is encouraged.


 Awareness campaign


 I n order to sensitize the public regarding UsefuIfiess- of edbGfi-on and:
 to appraise them about major initiatives, an awareness campaign
 costing Rs. 150 million was launched in 2004. Preliminary assessment
 based on Education Department's data and third party validations
 show that the results have been positive. This awareness campaign
 has created awareness of specific components of the reform program
 (such as provision of free textbooks, stipends, and missing facilities)
 as well as sent out a clear message to the people of Punjab, that          I*,
 education is the topmost priority of the provincial leadership.       The
 awareness campaign has relied on national, regional and local print
 media, national television and radio networks, closed circuit television
  (CCTV) to target passengers traveling through railway stations, and
                                                                 -..-

cinemas in 27 cities across Punjab.     Outreach of the print media
campaign has been approximately 21.65 million people, or over 26%
of the province's population, The outreach of the electronic (television
and radio) campaign has been even wider.         These efforts will be
further enhanced by a new website being launched in the near future.




Expanding Public Private Partnership


There is a large private sector offering schooling options throughout
Punjab. A large number of these schools provide low cost education to
fill the access and perceived quality gaps in the public sector.   These
are operating without any support from the Government and not much
information about their enrollments and quality of education has been
documented and analyzed by Government.


The Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) had been in existence since
 1991 but has not had extensive outreach to the low cost private .
 sector.  The Governm.ent, seeing ..the importance -.of--harnessing and
 mobilizing the low cost private sector's participation in schooling to
 extend the outreach to children not being covered by the system,
 decided to restructure PEF so that it would begin to function as. the
 apex body to support the private sector. For this purpose a new law
 was enacted by the Provincial Assembly in 2004, the Board in its new
 form having complete autonomy has started functioning since
 February 2005.     With a new management under an autonomous            6
 Board, the Foundation has now started working to support the private
 sector. It is presently modeling various packages for private pubiic
 partnership in education, including a cluster-based teacher training
 program for low cost private schools, a financial assistance program

                                                  -  .. .. .....--,.

for schools charging fees less than Rs. 300 per month, and a voucher
scheme that is being launched on a pilot basis in low income slum
areas. So far, the Foundation has trained more than 1,500 teachers
from low cost private schools in 19 districts. PEF is extending financial
assistance to 20,000 students in seven districts of Punjab. I n both
programs, the majority of the beneficiaries are females. As 30% of
the total enrolment in the province is in the private sector schools, it is
believed that revamping of-the -F-o-undation w.o-uld not-onLyJelp the
                     -_
private sector improve its service delivery, but could serve as the
vehicle through which the Government can provide more financial
support to the low cost private education sector.        Already this year
the Punjab Government has extended Rs. 400 million to PEF.




RemaininQ Challenaes: Movinq Forward towards Phase I1 PESRP


Although the Program is only in its third year of implementation, there
 are many experiences, achievements and lessons learnt that are
 helping us to design the future course for education sector reforms. A
 decision has been taken to extend PESRP beyond the. initial three year
                                                  ..-.__      --         .---_.
 period, especially to build upon the early results but also to move
 forward in areas requiring more work - such as quality of learning,
 capacity to manage, deliver and monitor education services,, and
 expanding partnerships with the private sector, The World Bank has
 been requested to, continue supporting the Punjab Government's
 education sector reform initiative for an additional three year period.
 Continuity of reforms is essential to institutionalize the reforms already  /il
 started, and to develop further reforms initiatives. Initial thinking is
 taking place to develop a longer term reform framework for Phase 11,
 and the World Bank has expressed its willingness to continue its
 support for education reforms.

                                    13 -



On the quality agenda, the focus will include implementation of
strategies and programs to improve student learning, especially
through revised examination structures, improved management of
teachers and their professional development, and improvement of
textbooks. Already, as mentioned earlier, we have taken a bold step
by establishing an independent Examination Commission with a
mandate to administer Class 5 and 8 examinations. The linkages
between a reformed examination system, revised teaching -metkods,
and improved textbooks and other learning material are important,
and will therefore be prioritized to improve quality of learning.


Institutional strengthening will also be undertaken to improve planning
and management of education at the provincial level, and for
strengthening the capacity of district education teams to better plan
 and deliver services.   The process of reorganization of the district
 education set up along functional lines has already commenced,
 whereby    dedicated   offices   for   examinations/academics,   human
 resources and monitoring including teacher supervision, and finance &
 planning stand established.      A capacity building program for the
 restructured district education system is about ._to- be_--!aLnched.
 Restructuring of the provincial Education Department is also an
 ongoing process, and will be completed keeping in view the emerging
 priorities of the education sector. The planning, monitoring and data
 analysis functions of Program Monitoring & Implementation Unit
 (PMIU) are .being fully mainstreamed into the Education Department.
 Further improvements in our monitoring system are also being
 planned, especially to include information on both private and public,
 and to measure outcome indicators such as retention and primary
 completion rates.    A full evaluation of the program will also be
 undertaken after the completion of the current three year phase. This

evaluation would provide us with the analysis and information for
.further reforming the sector.


Another area of focus will include expansion of access to higher levels
of education,     with  emphasis on improvements          in elementary,
secondary and college education. We have requested World Bank to
support analytical work to develop strategies for strengthening the
 higher levels of education.' This includes a study on th-e-coilege-sector.
                                                                     \
 Further expansion of access will include interventions to reduce gender      ----------_ __

 and regional inequities, and we will also expand our support to the low
 cost private education sector through the Punjab Education Foundation
 and other means. With support from the World Bank, the Punjab.
 Government will conduct a study on barriers for the private sector to
 better understand how we can remove such barriers and create an
 enabling environment for a more active private sector that provides
 low cost quality education. The next policy actions under PESRP are
 included in the attached policy matrix (Flag-A).


 While we recognize the pitfalls in a rapid reform program, we are also
                                                                   PESRP is

 With support from the World Bank, we are starting detailed
 stakeholder consultations to capture the views of the students,
 teachers, School Councils, district education staff, and others involved
 in the management and delivery of education services.


 The Punjab Government also recognizes and appreciates that other
  provinces are embarking on a similar track of education reforms, and
  is therefore committed to share its experiences. In fact our active
  engagement with two provinces has already started in this regard.
  /

The Chief Minister Punjab is committed to the priority of education
reforms, and the Punjab Government will continue to maintain the
right environment to keep the program on track. By moving forward
on developing Phase 11, we are reaffirming our commitment to
education as the priority sector for Punjab, and we hope that
continued progressin PESRP W-~uld.assist Pakistan in cnmingClOSer b---
meeting its targets for MDGs.


This policy-statement has the approval of the Minister, Education and
the Chief Minister, Punjab.

    IMF ExecutiveBoardConcludes2005 Article IV Consultationwith
                                           Pakistan

On November2, 2005, the Executive Board of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultationswith Pakistan.'

Background

In 2004/05 (July/June), Pakistan'smacroeconomicperformancecontinued to be favorable,
despite some inflationary and external pressures. Economicgrowth is estimated to have
reached 8.4 percent in 2004/05, driven by manufacturing,and bumper harveststhat
benefitedfrom timely rains. However, 12-monthinflationreached 11percent inApril 2005,
before easing to 8.4 percent inAugust. Strong growth, includingin agriculture, combined
with rising wages and employment according to some indicators, is expected to have
yielded some reductionin poverty. Data from a householdsurvey to be released later this
year will providefurther informationin this regard.

Fiscal targets for 2004/05were broadly met, with the overalldeficit (excluding grants) at
3.3 percent of GDP. Governmentdebt was reducedtojust below 60 percent of GDP.
The tax-to-GDP ratio fell becauseof the elimination of excises on petroleum products to
offset the impact of rising international oil prices, and a number of tax relief measuresin the
2004/05 budget.



' UnderArticle IV ofthe IMF'sArticles of Agreement,the IMFholds bilaterat discussionswith
members, usuallyevery year. A staff team visits the country, collects economicand financial
information,and discusses with officials the country's economic developmentsand policies.
On returnto headquarters,the staff preparesa report,which forms the basisfor discussion by
the ExecutiveBoard.At the conclusionof the discussion, the ManagingDirector,as Chairman        ,
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,and this summary is transmittedto
the country'sauthorities.

Concernedwith doubledigit inflationand highcapacityutilization, the State Bank of
Pakisfan(SBP) hastightenedmonetarypolicy.Sincethe beginningof 2005, the SBP has
raisedthe six-monthtreasury bill rate by morethan 4 percentagepointsto 8 percentin May,
but has kept it broadly unchanged since then; key interestrates remainslightly negativein
realterms. Despitethe tightening, reservemoney growth has not slowed down becausethe
SBP providedsubstantial budgetfinancingduringthe year as the government'sgross
financing needs could not be fully met from the marketat prevailingrates.

Despitehigherworker`s remittances,the current account movedinto deficit in 2004105.
Exports,and in particulartextile exports followingthe end of the textile quota system, have
performedwell inthe first six monthsof 2005. But import grew evenfaster, reflectinghigher
oil pricesand strongdemand, includingfor machinery.Gross reservesfell somewhatin
2004/05, notwithstandinga continuedincreasein non-debt-creatinginflowsand substantial
concessionalfinancing.The real effectiveexchange rate has appreciatedmodestlyoverthe
lastfew monthsgiventhe stable U.S. dollar-Pakistani rupeeexchange rate and the
substantialinflationdifferential.

The 2005/06 budgettargets a deficit (excludinggrants) of 3.8 percentof GDP. The budget
shows little revenuebuoyancy; again, a numberof tax relief measureswere introducedfor
exportersand the manufacturingsector. Nonetheless,even with the increase in the fiscal
deficit, governmentdebt would fall to 52 percent of GDP. The governmenthastaken steps
to offset pressureson fiscal policy from risinginternationaloil prices and should be able to
achievethe budgettarget. In particular,significantincrease in domestic retailpricesof
petroleumproductswas implementedin Septemberand October. Expenditureswill be
tightly controlled, but prioritywill be givento achievingthe developmentexpendituretarget.

Progresshas been made on the government'sstructural reformagenda, in particularinthe
area of privatization. InJune 2005, the largesttransactionso far in Pakistan's privatization
programtook place,with the sale of 26 percent,togetherwith managementcontrol,of a
 largetelecommunicationcompany. The sale of severalother majorcompaniesis underway.
 Energysector reformshave again provento take longerthan envisaged. While the
 unbundlingof the other large power utility is almost complete, the individualdistribution
 companiescannotstart to operate independentlybecauseregional tariffs haveyet to be
 notified.

 Cooperationwith the Fund has beenfruitful. Incontrast to earlier experience, the 2000
 Stand-byArrangementand the 2001-04 Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF)
were in large part implemented steadfastly.Moreover, many recommendationsmadeat the
 time of the 2004 Article IV consultationshave been implemented. Inanalyzing policy
 implementationunder the PRGFarrangement,itwas notedthat the correctionof a tax
 anomaly that had not beenpreviouslydiscussedbetweenthe authorities and the Fund had
 resultedin an insignificantdeviationfrom a structural performancecriterionbutwithout any
 effect on fiscal outcomes.This does not changethe Fund'sfavorable assessment of policy
 implementationunderthe program.

 Executive BoardAssessment

 ExecutiveDirectorsexpressedtheir sympathy and condolencesfor the loss of life and the
 large-scaledestruction caused by the recent earthquakethat hit the northern partsof

                                           - 5 -

Pakistan. They welcomed the pledgesof support that have been made by the international
community to address urgent needs and assistwith the reconstruction, and calledfor
substantial additional assistance, especially grants, to help the government overcome the
crisis without adversely affectingimplementationof broadereconomic policies.Inthis
regard, several Directorsnotedthat they would support a requestfor Emergency Natural
DisasterAssistance from the Fund, if the Pakistaniauthoritieswere to make such a request.

Directors commended Pakistan'simpressivemacroeconomic results in recentyears-in
particular,the accelerationof economicgrowth-which have laidthe ground for a decline in
governmentdebt, financial market stability, and the recentre-accessto internationalcapital
markets. Directors noted the significantimprovementin various healthand education
indicators.At the same time, they observedthat poverty remainswidespread, and that
achieving the Millennium Development Goalswill be a challenge, particularlygiven the
added need to rebuild northernPakistan. Going forward Directorsconsideredthat the key
challengefor the mediumterm will be to sustain the high growth rate and reduce poverty in
the context of price stability. Directorstherefore welcomed the Pakistaniauthorities'
determination to maintain macrostabilityin the face of the earthquake.They also
emphasized the importanceof continued structural reforms, particularlythe need to create a
business climate conducive to investment.

Directorsnoted that, in light of the earthquake, some wideningof the budget deficit in
2005/06 might be unavoidable. However,they did not expect this to alter significantlythe
decliningtrend of Pakistan'sdebt indicators.They cautioned, however, that the overall debt
burdencontinuesto be high and needs close monitoring,and welcomed the adoption of the
Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw that requires a further reductionof the debt burden. Directors
commendedthe authorities for having passedon much of the increasein internationaloil
pricesto consumersto help contain fiscal pressures, and recommendeda continuationof
this policy.

Directorsstressed that meetingthe authorities' medium-termfiscal objectiveswill requirea
marked improvementin revenueperformance. Inthis regard, they were disappointed by the
lack of progress made over the lastfive years in raising the ratio of tax revenueto GDP.
A few Directorsexpressed concern that the authorities have returnedto the past practiceof
granting exemptions and zero ratings. While agreeing that improving compliance by existing
taxpayers is important to increasetax collections, Directorsurged the authoritiesto extend
the tax net to the services sector and to work with provincialgovernmentsto have the     .
agriculturalsector pay its fair share of taxes.

Directorsexpressed concern about the increase in inflation in the last two years and the
widening of the current account deficit. They cautioned that relief and reconstructionefforts
could add further pressures on both prices and the balanceof payments. Directors
commendedthe State Bank of Pakistanfor raising interest ratessharply in the first halfof
2005, and some urged the central bank to raise interest rates further if inflationary
pressurespersist. Directorsstressedthe need to sterilize effectively central bank financing
of the budget. Directorswelcomedthe continuing improvementin the health of the financial
sector. While noting that the strong credit growth currently appears in part to be the
encouragingoutcome of financial liberalization,Directorscautionedthat this could be a
source of vulnerability in the future. They advised the State Bank of Pakistan to monitor

                                             - 4 -
credit development carefully. Directors generally consideredthat the currentexchange rate
regime has served Pakistanwell.

Directorswere impressedby the overall progress made in privatizingstate-owned
enterprises, and welcomed the authorities' plans for further sales. However,they expressed
concern about the electricitysector`s sizable drain on the budget and urgedstepped-up
reform in this sector. They urged the authoritiesto completethe new tariff framework so that
the successor companies of the Water and Power DevelopmentAuthority could start
functioning independently. Directorswere encouragedby the prospects of the Karachi
Electric Supply Corporationbeing transferred into private hands. More generally,
Directors urged the authoritiesto continuewith structural reforms aimed at improvingthe
business environmentand governance.

Directorsencouragedthe authoritiesto further improve the quality and timelinessof data,
including data on the domesticdebt, in order to allow better analysis and policyformulation,
and with a view to subscribingto the Special Data DisseminationStandard.

Directorswelcomed the ex post assessment of the Fund's involvementin Pakistan.
They noted the dramatic change in ownershipof economic policies compared to much of
the 1990s.While acknowledging the importanceof internationalsupport, Directors
emphasized that steadfast implementationof sound policies and broad-basedstructural
reformswere mainly responsiblefor the economic recovery. Directorsagreed that
conditionalityunderthe 2000 Stand-By Arrangement had been extensive; nevertheless,
the authoritiesdemonstrated commendableperseverancein the implementationof strong
policies and establisheda strong track recordthat pavedthe way for the 2001arrangement
under the PRGF. Directorsnote that Pakistan's program performancesince 2000 compared
favorably to the average Fund-supportedprogram, and even though Pakistanhad a larger
number of structural conditions, the waiver rates were lower than the Fund-wideaverage,
some of which involved minor or temporary deviations from program targets.

Directorssupported management's recommendationto waive the nonobservancein 2002 of
the performance criterion precluding new tax exemptions, stemming from a minor sales tax
adjustment that has had no revenue impact and which had not been previouslydiscussed
between the authorities and the staff. Many Directors, although not representinga majority
of the vote, questioned, however, whether there had beena breach of a performance
criterion, since the sales tax exemptionwas immaterialas it had no revenueimplication,
and saw no need for the Board to grant a waiver.

                      Pakistan-Assessment Letterfor the World Bank
                                         May 22,2006

 This note providesthe IMF staffs assessment ofPakistan's macroeconomic developments
 and prospectsas background forthe three development policy loans being consideredby the
 Executive Board ofthe World Bank onJune l. The assessment is based on IMFstaff
 discussionswith the Pakistani authoritiesduring a staffvisitto Islamabad in March 2006,
 follow-updiscussionsat the April 2006 SpringMeetingsin Washington,and at the sidelines
 of the 2006 Pakistan Development Forum held in Islamabad on May10-1 1.

 Economic developmentsin Pakistan since the 2005 Article consultation have been
                                                               IV
 broadly favorable.

     e  Real GDP growthin 2005/06 (July/June)is likelyto end at a solid6-6% percent,
        somewhatlowerthan anticipated,mainly owing to shortfalls inagricultural
        production.

     e  Inflation is startingto decline.The 12-month change inthe headline CPIfell from
        8-8% percent in the second halfof 2005 to 6.1percent in April 2006.Average
        inflationin 2005/06 is likelyto be around8 percent, down from9.3 percent oneyear
        earlier.
. "
     e  The nominal exchangerate has remained inthe range of 59-60 rupees perU.S. dollar
        since late2004; the real effectiveexchangerate appreciatedby about 11percentfrom       '
        December2004 to February2006.

     e  The October 2005 earthquake lefta heavy tollin terms of human lives and physical
        and social infrastructure,but had limitedeffectson inflation, output growth, andthe
        external currentaccount.Demands for government spending, however,have
        increased.Earthquakerelief and reconstruction spendingin 2005/06 could amountto
        up to 0.9 percentof GDP, whilethe overallbudget deficit (excluding grants) will be
        around 4%percentof GDP-compared with anoriginalbudget target
        (pre-earthquake)of 3.8 percent.

     e  The trade and currentaccount deficitshave beensignificantlylarger than envisaged at
        the time of the 2005 Article IV consultation,and are projected to reach 51/2 and
        4 percent of GDP, respectively,by end-June 2006.The continued rapid growthof
        non-oil imports(representingabout 80 percent of total imports) is not being matched
        by the performance of exportsand remittances.Net international reserves declined by
        closeto US$1 billion duringthe first half of 2005/06, butare expected to more than
        fully recover in the second half on accountof strong capital inflows, including from
        privatization and government bond issues. By end-June 2006,officialreserves are
        expectedto exceed US$10 billion(3%months of imports), comparedto
        US$9.9 billionone year earlier.

     e  Governmentreliance on State Bankof Pakistan (SBP)financinghas complicatedthe
        conductof monetary policy. Duringthe second halfof 2005, the bulk of the
        government's borrowing needs was satisfiedby resortingto SBP financing, partly
        becausethe cut-offrate set at treasury billauctionswas not sufficientlyattractiveto

      commercialbanks, which continued to facea strong demand forcredit from private
      firms and households. While financing pressures fromthe budget mayease somewhat
      in the last quarterof fiscal year 2005/06 (owingto the global bondissue and large
      privatizationreceipts),broad money and privatesectorcredit growth are expected to
      remain high through end-June 2006.

  0   The privatizationprogram is gaining momentum.The sale of the Karachi Electric
      SupplyCompanyand the sale of management controlof PakistanTelecommunication
      CompanyLimited and PakistanSteelMills during 2005/06 constitutesignificant
      landmarksin the privatization processthat generated proceedsin excess of
      US$2 billion.The authoritiesintend to build onthis momentum throughthe offer of
      GlobalDepositoryReceipts of the Oil and Gas Development Company before
      end-July 2006. Prospectsfor privatization inthe energy sector,however, remain
      contingenton settingregional electricitytariffs at levels thatgive potential investors
      assurancesof a reliable revenue base.

  0   Market perceptionsof Pakistan have improved. Standard& Poor'supgraded its
      outlook on Pakistan'sforeign currency debt fromstableto positive in
      December2005, while Moody's upgradedPakistan'scredit ratingto "B2-positive" in
      mid-March.Pakistan's stockmarket index roseby over 60 percentin the 12 months
      to April2006, more than fullyrecovering fromthe large correctionof early 2005. On
      March 23,2006 the government raisedUS$800 million in a two-part 10-year
      (US$500million) and 30-year(US$300 million) global bond dealat very favorable
      terms; this was Pakistan'sthird and largest international bondofferingsincethe 1999
      debt restructuring,and the first with maturities longerthan five years. The abilityto
      place 30-yearpaper is an important indicationof the markets' positive outlook on

0     Thekeynear-termchallenge is to containthedeterioration in the current
     accountdeficitand keep externalvulnerabilitiesin check.The high ratesof import
      growth might deceleratesharply in the coming monthsas the effectsof transitory,
     non-recurrentfactorsthat influencedthe level of imports in2005 (e.g., oil price spike,
     unforeseenagriculturalimports) unwind.If this happens, the currentaccount deficit
     could stabilizeduring the next oneor two years at levelsin the order of U$5-6 billion,
     broadly similarto the one currently projectedfor 2005/06. Underthese
      circumstances,the expected increasein non-debt-creating capitalinflowswould help
     financethe bulk ofthe currentaccount deficit and significant lossesof international
     reserveswould be avoided. However,if the declinein import growthturns out to be
     more gradual,or if there are negative shocks,external vulnerabilities could rise inthe
     months ahead.A tighteningof monetary policyto bring about a faster reductionof
     credit and domesticdemand growth would help reducethis risk byhelpingto narrow
     the current account deficit and facilitating the accumulation of international reserves.
     This strategy will be moreeffectiveif supplemented by fiscal measuresthat ensure
     the decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio mandated bythe 2005 Fiscal

        ResponsibilityLaw (2%percentage points per year), andby greaterexchange rate
        flexibility.

e       The overallbudget envelopefor the yearsaheadneeds to createfiscal spaceto
        accommodate theadditionaldemands on governmentspendingstemming from
        the October2005 earthquake.Six monthsafterthe disaster,government estimates
        of the size, profile, and meansof financingof prospective reconstruction expenditures
        remain highlytentative.Fiscal policy formulationin the years ahead needsto include
        explicitlythe additionaldemands on governmentspendingcreated bythe earthquake,
        and reconcilethose demands withthe requirements ofthe Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw
        referredto above, and, more generally, withothermacroeconomic stabilityand
        poverty-reduction considerations.

e       Effortsto raisethe revenue to GDP rationeed to be reinvigorated.Recent
        reforms in the revenue areahave focused on taxpayerfacilitationto strengthenthe
        investment climate.The focus in the years ahead should be on broadeningthe revenue
        base through continuedtax administration reform, andtax policy measures aimed at
        bringinguntaxed sectorsinto the net. Effortsto increasethe provinces' contribution
        to overall revenue collection shouldalso continue. Much needed increases in social
        and developmentspending hingecriticallyon raisingthe revenueto GDP ratio by
        3-5 percentagepoints over the mediumterm. Concretestepsto attain this goal should
        be laidout at the earliest.
