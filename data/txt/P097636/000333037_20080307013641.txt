F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The purpose of this DPC was to support the Punjab Province's three year Education
Sector Reform Program (PESRP). The PEDPC III completed the series of annual
programmatic development policy credits (DPC) in support of PESRP. Phase II of
PESRP has been prepared by the Punjab Government, and the Bank is supporting it
through a new series of annual DPCs, which has become operational July 2007.

 Key pillars of the PESRP Phase I were: (A) public finance reforms to increase public
spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability;
(B) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and
governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality, access, and sector
governance.



                                          vi

  There has been steady progress in the Program supported by PEDPC III. The Program
has shown improvements in public sector enrolment and in reducing the gender gap at the
primary and middle school levels.

This implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) covers the implementation of a series
of three programmatic operations, the Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), the
Second Punjab Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC II) and the Third Punjab
Education Development Policy Credit (PEDPC III). The contribution of the first credit was
already discussed in the Simplified Implementation Completion Report (SICR) and rated as
follows:

Outcome: Satisfactory; Sustainability: Likely; Institutional Development Impact: Substantial;
Bank Performance: Satisfactory; Borrower Performance: Satisfactory

The World Bank Independent Evaluation Group has reviewed the SICR and agreed to the ratings.
The SICR continues to apply for the first credit. A Simplified ICR for PEDPC II was also
prepared but is not reflected in the system due to changes in Bank policy regarding preparation of
simplified ICRs for programmatic multi-year Development Policy Credits (DPCs). This full ICR
accordingly rates the contribution of PEDPC II and PEDPC III.

At the time of the preparation of the first Punjab Education Sector Credit, Pakistan had started to
come out of a tenuous macroeconomic situation, with growth reaching 5.1 percent in 2003. This
was attributable to good economic management which increased confidence in the country's
economic future. The country's exports rose sharply and foreign exchange reserves increased.
An improvement in revenue collection was also seen due to better collection of General Sales Tax
(GST).     In addition, better debt management was made possible by greater access to
concessionary financing. However, economic growth was not generating major improvement in
income poverty and growth was not translating into adequate improvements in non-income
dimensions of poverty. Conscious of its weak performance in education, the Government of
Pakistan embarked on a comprehensive reform of public finance and governance, including a
major devolution of power to elected local governments which shifted responsibility for basic
social service delivery, including health and education, to elected district governments.

Punjab, the most densely populated province of Pakistan with almost 56 percent of the country's
total population, had better educational outcomes than the other provinces; still, the key
educational indicators were low compared to other countries with Punjab's level of development.
Almost forty percent of the adult population was illiterate and less than two thirds of the
province's primary school-age population was enrolled in school. The enrollment rate was
particularly low in rural areas, especially for girls. Also, of the children who ever enrolled in
Grade I, only about two thirds of the students actually ended up completing four or more years of
schooling.

The population's low education level posed significant constraints to the realization of sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction in Punjab.             The major issues that affected the
performance of the education sector and service delivery in the past were: (i) insufficient
resources allocated to education; (ii) systemic weakness in public sector service delivery,
including over-centralization and inadequate management; and (iii) the poor performance of the
education system (in terms of access, governance, and quality). This was reflected in the stagnant
education indicators during the 1990s. For instance, the percentage of children ages 5-17 enrolled



                                                                                                  1

in school in 1991 was 51.1 percent which remained the same in 1998-99 when it was estimated to
be 51.0 percent.1

To address these fiscal institutional and sector challenges, the Government of Punjab, in 2003,
started implementing a medium term three-year education sector reform program to enhance
access, improve quality of education and improve gender parity in Punjab. The reform program
in Punjab was closely linked to three major national level initiatives: (1) The national Education
Sector Reform (ESR) spearheaded by the Federal Ministry of Education, which intended to
improve the quality of education and improve access across regions, gender and income level; (2)
The national PRSP which specified that: (a) measures taken in the education sector are an integral
part of the government's reform program; and (b) the responsibility for implementation rests with
districts led by elected local governments; and (3) the national Devolution Plan which, through
the provincial Local Government Ordinances (LGO) 2001, established local governments and
devolved administrative decision making and finances to elected local governments; and basic
social service delivery responsibility to district governments.

The Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) aimed at introducing system-wide
reforms, such as new teacher recruitment policies, revitalization of School Councils, restructuring
the Punjab Education Foundation to support low cost private education, and establishing
conditional grants under Terms of Partnership (TOP) agreements between the province and
district governments. It also introduced incentives such as provision of free textbooks to all
public school students, and stipends to girls in selected districts. The reform program was planned
to be backed by a significant increase in the education budget. The World Bank was requested to
support the program and provide technical advice. A Development Policy Credit is an appropriate
instrument to support cross-sectoral areas linked to the education reform program such as the
fiscal decentralization process and governance reforms. Therefore, the Board of Executive
Directors in the Bank approved a three year support for the Punjab Education Sector Reform
Program, where the objectives were to remain the same for the three year period with adjusting
and updating of the annual targets as needed. IDA financing was committed through annual US
$100 million single tranche DPCs, based on performance and progress on implementing the
agreed actions in the policy matrix.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The purpose of the series of DPC was to support the PESRP. Key pillars of the PESRP were:
(A) public finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor
services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve
the fiduciary environment and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve quality,
access, and sector governance.

The credits provided financing to the Government of Punjab and supported all three pillars of the
PESRP in bringing about improvements in the educational attainment of the population of Punjab,
particularly the poor and women, and helping Punjab move towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) of Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Gender Parity in
Primary Education by 2015.

    Input indicators for the PESRP included the total expenditure on education, development and
    recurrent expenditure and expenditure on primary education. Following the monitoring matrix
    developed by the Government of Pakistan for the education sector in the PRSP, the core
    intermediate indicators for the PESRP included, among others: (i) number of functioning schools,
    (ii) number of trained teachers and, (iii) reduction in teacher absenteeism.            The outcome
    indicators included enrolment rates for primary and middle school levels, and completion rates at
    the primary level. The progress in the indicators is given in Table 1 in section 2.1 below. The
    key pillars and objectives of each are detailed in section 1.4.


    1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

    The PDO or key indicators were not revised during implementation

    1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

    The series of the three DPCs that supported the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program
    (PESRP), had three key pillars:

(I)     Improving Public Sector Financing
    The objective was to ensure that public expenditure is appropriately allocated to meet the
    Province's education needs. The province over the three year period, aimed to increase its
    provincial and district expenditures on education based on a Medium Term Budget Framework
    (MTBF) in a fiscally sustainable manner by creating fiscal space through reducing the debt
    servicing burden by mobilizing concessional donor assistance. The reform also aimed to help
    reduce the uncertainty in public expenditures in education both at the provincial and district level.

(II)    Supporting Devolution and Public Sector Management Reforms
    Objectives included (a) facilitating the transfer of resources to the district governments in order
    to improve timely service delivery, (b) to increase the transparency of financial management
    processes and strengthening the provincial and district capacity for monitoring financial flows,
    (c) to improve transparency in procurement procedures and practices.
    The reform aimed to support devolution through measures that (i) decentralize financing and
    decision making to the district level; (ii) increase accountability of districts for resource use; (iii)
    clarify the roles of all government levels; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of districts to assume
    their new responsibilities under decentralization. The reform aimed at an improved governance
    and fiduciary environment through measures that strengthen financial management and
    procurement capacity at both the provincial and district levels.          These reforms were also
    supported through the Asian Development Bank supported Provincial Resource Management
    Program.

(III)   Education Sector Reforms
    The reform focused on two core areas: (i) Improving sector governance in the education sector,
    and (b) improvement in access and quality.          The objectives were: (a) to improve teacher
    management, including better recruitment practices; (b) to revitalize school councils in order to
    monitor school performance and ensure school maintenance; (c) to strengthen monitoring and
    evaluation in order to gauge education performance outcomes and to use these to improve and re-
    adjust education policies; (d) to improve equitable access to education; (e) to ensure the provision
    of quality education through improved teaching and materials; and (f) to expand access to
    education through innovative public private partnerships.



                                                                                                          3

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance

Since the start of the PESRP there has been a steady progress in implementing the reform
program. The first adjustment Credit was provided to support a programmatic approach to
reform, in which subsequent adjustment credits would continue to maintain broader and deeper
fiscal, governance, and education reforms of the Punjab Government. The Government of
Punjab's performance during the first program year was impressive and a number of initiatives
had begun to show early impact. By the second year, the reforms were being implemented on a
faster track than anticipated during the preparation of the first credit. Achievements of the first
operation were sustained, including the continued increases in public sector enrollments and
sector financing. Under the second Credit, progress picked up in some areas that had shown
slower movement under the first Credit, such as the quality agenda and public private
partnerships.2 The satisfactory progress of the program continued in the third PEDPC, though in
a few reform areas the movement was slower than others (discussed in section 3 below). The
third year built on the successes of the first two years and a clear improvement in the outcome
indicators has been obvious (see table 1).

Overall, the progress over the three years was commendable. There was a satisfactory trend in
the increase in education budget and the commitments to MTBF were maintained. The
government introduced new business processes in the education sector such as the introduction of
performance based incentives in the form of the TOPs between the districts and the provincial
government, thus making the districts partners in the process of change; the restructuring of the
Punjab Education Foundation to assist and finance the private schools catering to the poor with
the use of innovative public-private partnership schemes; the development of a very
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system and the use of this information to evaluate the
program performance and make adjustments where required; as well as the introduction of
incentives such as distribution of free textbooks and stipends to encourage enrollment. These
initiatives proved very successful in achieving the access objective, as evidenced by an almost 28
percent increase in primary net enrollment rates (using the official age of 5-9 for these grades)
and 11 percent for grades 6-8 (elementary) over the three years.3

The ICR mission's random, unannounced field visits confirmed that most of the interventions

gross enrollment rates in Punjab compared to the other provinces.8 A few components of the
program, however, showed slower progress, such as the mobilization of school councils, and
capacity building of the district education officials. The teacher professional development
program was delayed as considerable time was taken by the government to establish the
institutional arrangements. Actual implementation of Continuous Professional Development
(CPD) could, therefore, only commence during the third credit. Similarly, though access
increased over the three years, high drop out rates persisted and the focus on quality of education
was largely on institutional reform rather than on directly addressing student learning. This has
been a weak area of the program.


Brief detail of progress in implementation over the three years by the key pillars is discussed in
the remaining of this section. Table 2 details the prior actions for the three credits, all of which
were met in a timely fashion.

Program performance by pillar

Pillar 1: Improving Public Sector Financing

Objective: To ensure that public expenditure is appropriately allocated to meet the Province's
education needs.

Before the first credit was initiated, the Government of Punjab had developed a Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF), which gave high-priority to pro-poor expenditure, especially
education. The revised MTBF during the second year also suggested that the financial position of
the province remained on sound footing and would continue to improve despite the provincial
government's commitment to sharply increase the pro-poor expenditure. A large part of this
improvement in provincial finances was anticipated by increased revenue transfers from the
federal government, as the provincial government expected a higher share for provinces in the
divisible pool of federal revenue in the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award. The
province developed a debt management strategy, which focused on early retirement of expensive
federal government debt by raising concessional donor financing, utilizing its cash balances and
through more innovative means of financing.

In the second year of the program, the government allocated funds in accordance with the MTBF
projections. Specifically, the FY05 budget projected a 21 percent increase in overall provincial
revenue and a 16 percent increase in provincial expenditure. In accordance with the MTBF
projections, the education sector budget increased by 15 percent. Recurrent expenditure on
provincially executed activities increased by 28 percent, while the allocation for education from
the development budget increased by 38 percent. The levels and composition of the education
budget were increasingly aligned to meeting the needs of the sector. Education allocations in the
FY06 provincial budget increased by 12.6 percent. Districts allocated 15 percent more non salary
budget for education from their own budgets.             While overall provincial and district sector
financing had improved in the second year, school budgeting through school councils had
commenced but was still inadequate.




                                                                                                   9

During PEDPC III, the education budget for 2006-07, increased by almost 26 percent.9 There
was a 29 percent and 15 percent decrease in districts' non salary recurrent budget and grants for
School Councils budget respectively in the current year, mainly due to non disbursement under
these heads from the year before.               This reflected the relatively slow progress in certain
components of the program (discussed below).

Pillar 2: Supporting Devolution and Public Sector Management Reform

Objective: To facilitate transfer of resources to the district governments in order to improve
timely service delivery

An integral part of the reform program was the clarification of roles and responsibilities of
provincial and district governments under the devolution reform, and the introduction of
incentives to district governments to improve service delivery. These reforms were embodied in



9The increase is not accurately comparable to 2005-06 because of shifting of college sector from the districts to
provincial government.



                                                                                                                   10

the Terms of Partnership (TOP) agreements (which included annual performance targets) signed
between the district and provincial governments. This was the first time in Pakistan that such an
explicit service delivery contract was initiated between a province and district governments.

Under the Local Government Ordinance, a single line transfer was made from the province to the
districts to meet all devolved expenditures including education through the Provincial Finance
Commission (PFC). During the first year, under the TOP mechanism, an equal additional amount
was given as a conditional grant to each district earmarked for education, specifically for
providing missing facilities to schools. A good data system on education expenditures was
maintained, which included regularly updated district level expenditure trends in education.
Recognizing that district governments are likely to be constrained in their capacity to utilize these
funds in a timely manner, the Government of Punjab initiated district-level capacity building
programs to improve program implementation. However, implementation of these capacity
building programs was much delayed, and these are only now underway.

During PEDPC II, to recalibrate the allocation of funds towards districts with greater educational
needs as well as to give incentives for districts to improve the performance of the education
sector, subsequent annual conditional grants for education were provided by the provincial
government through the TOP agreements between the provincial and district governments on the
basis of needs-cum-performance formula.10 Thus the government provided equal share in the
first year (FY04), shifting to 70-30 percent needs-performance weightage in FY05, moving to 60-
40 percent, respectively, in FY06. Rs. 5 billion were provided annually over and beyond the one
line transfer under this TOP mechanism.11

In PEDPC III, some delays were encountered in the release of performance based funds since the
expenditure data for the previous year was available after a lag; but the needs based funds were
released. The funding formula remained the same for FY07 as well.

Objective: To Increase Transparency of Financial Management Processes and Procurement
Procedures

The financial management reforms under the first credit were well implemented, with strong
financial reporting arrangements put in place. The Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit
(PMIU) established in the Department of Education started maintaining an adequate financial
management system using automated technology that enabled financial activities related to
program funds releases, expenditures, and outputs to be tracked all the way down to the district
level. The maintenance of financial records of salary and non-salary expenditures, and according
to major and minor heads of account within the framework of the government expenditure
classification system, was adequately complied. Over the three year period the overall education
budget and expenditures between the provinces and the districts have become well
institutionalized. There is, however, still need for improvement in district governments' capacity
to manage and monitor the vast amount of education expenditures that account for a large
proportion of the district budget.



10The need-based factor includes enrollment and inverse literacy levels, while the performance-based factor includes
district's own budget increase, realignment in the budget towards actual release for school councils and non-salary
items, improvements in education indicators (enrollment, retention).
11There have been delays in utilization of these development funds, as the implementation cycle follows a calendar
year rather than the fiscal year because. Although the Program commenced in July 2003, implementation began after
January 2004 as systems were being devised in the first six months (e.g., TOPs, stipends, textbook distribution). The
program has continued to follow a CY cycle.



                                                                                                                    11

During PEDPC II, at the departmental level, timely and more reliable financial data continued to
be made available. Proper accounting procedures to track and monitor sector expenditures were
developed by the PMIU, making the education sector the first sector where complete provincial
and district expenditure tracking and monitoring was taking place. The Department's large
backlog of pending audit paragraphs was progressively reduced.           At the broader level, a
Provincial Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment (PFMA) was conducted.
This introduced a form of `self-assessment' system of tracking and monitoring of the
performance measurement indicators of the Province against specified indicator benchmarks.
The seriousness of addressing the pending audit observations signaled a move towards a culture
of transparency and proper use of resources.

Over the three year period of the program supported by the three DPCs, the government
maintained good progress under the financial management reforms. The province adopted and
implemented the new Chart of Accounts at the provincial and district levels to facilitate the
provision of fiscal information on a uniform basis across the province and support coherent and
comprehensive decision making. Further, as required under the New System of Financial Control
and Budgeting, the whole year's budget in the case of recurrent expenditures is now being
released by the Finance Department and, similarly, about 40 percent of the approved annual
development program budget is also released at the start of the fiscal year to support more timely
expenditure commitments by Principal Accounting Officers. Timeliness in data reconciliation
has improved with the time lag reduced to 6 weeks.

During the first credit, procurement reforms had started for increasing efficiency and
transparency.   Contracts for civil works above a certain threshold became based on open
competition, the requirement for pre-registration of contractors was removed and the standard
Schedule of Rates (the previous administrative arrangements of fixed unit rates under civil works
contracts), no longer applied. Annual third party ex-post procurement audits were initiated,
which have been helpful in assessing the transparency and efficiency of the procurement system.

Satisfactory progress was made in the area of procurement during PEDPC II. Reforms achieved
included: contracts for civil works above a reasonable threshold were based on open competition
and transparent procedures; School Councils (SCs) were authorized to carry out small civil works
at the school level up to a threshold of Rs. 400,000; and annual independent third party ex-post
procurement reviews of a sample of procurement was conducted.

During the period of the third PEDPC, a procurement reform strategy was approved by the
government which among other reforms, envisaged the creation of a procurement regulatory
authority for Punjab which was subsequently established under an Ordinance (this was a prior
action for PEDPC IV).        This regulatory authority aims to develop and notify the public
procurement rules. Though these medium-term actions were important in improving the culture
of efficiency and transparency in the use of resources, it is now essential to build the capacity of
district government staff to manage the vast procurement responsibilities, and to regularly
monitor the transparency of the procurement processes.


Pillar 3: Improving Quality, Access and Governance in the Education Sector

This pillar aimed to address two core areas: a) sector governance, and b) quality and access.

Objective: To strengthen education sector management



                                                                                                 12

A new objective was included under PEDPC II to re-orient the education department's
operational structure at the provincial and district levels and to align it with its evolving
responsibilities and functions under a devolved framework. Progress in this area was slower than
anticipated in the initial period. At the provincial level, the Education Department created a
unified Planning Wing to focus on planning and monitoring functions for the entire sector,
including mainstreaming the management and information systems developed by the PMIU
within the core functions of the Planning Wing. At the district level, a plan for restructuring of
the district education management system was approved during the period of PEDPC II as a prior
action for the PEDPC III. This included restructuring district management staff along functional
(rather than level of schooling) lines that include human resource, monitoring, finance and
planning, and academics (covering examination, assessment and teacher training).

A parallel and phased action plan was developed for capacity building of district education staff.
This included skill development through existing public training institutes, and infrastructure and
equipment support for computers and mobility support for field monitoring. These programs
have been fully financed by the government. In addition, this capacity building program included
a three-tiered certification program to make available a pool of certified personnel for
administrative assignments in education.                However, the implementation of the training and
certification programs encountered delays in identifying appropriate institutions and mechanisms
for the programs. Thus, the actual reorganization of district education management teams along
the functional lines has not yet commenced. Moreover, districts have had little resources or
capacity to support schools and teachers. A program for capacity building has only recently been
approved to provide logistical and physical support to the district education departments. This is
also a major area being addressed in the Phase II PESRP. At the same time, the provincial
leadership has created a comprehensive monitoring and inspection mechanism with a District
Monitoring Officer (DMO) in each district supported by a team of mobile Monitoring and
Evaluation Assistants (MEAs). Although this parallel system was needed to ensure the integrity
of the newly developed PESRP at the start of the program, the long-term sustainability of the
program and its effectiveness relies on strengthening the monitoring and supervision capacity of
the district education departments.

Objective: To Improve Teacher Management and Recruitment

To improve teacher accountability and performance, there was a major policy shift towards hiring
of new teachers with school-based term contracts, and higher qualifications.12 The minimum
qualification for teachers was increased to at least post-graduation or graduation in education, or
graduation plus certificate in teaching. From September 2005 all teacher recruitment was being
undertaken using MIS data and related needs analysis to determine school-by-school needs based
on student-teacher ratios.13

Around 50,000 teachers were hired on contract basis during the three year period. Despite the
high number of teachers hired, there is still a shortage of subject specialists in particular for
subjects such as Mathematics and Science. The hiring of teachers appeared to have been
undertaken on a transparent merit and qualification basis. A teacher management study carried
out in 2005 administered some curriculum based tests (intended for students) to the teachers to


12The recruitment policy aims at merit-based, need-based, school-specific contracts with preference to local candidates
and females and is geared towards meeting the shortage of subject specialists in secondary and higher secondary
schools.

basis.

gauge the knowledge of teachers. 14 It found that contract teachers performed better, in both Math
and Urdu, than regular teachers as a whole. However, this result might also reflect the higher
educational qualification of contract teachers compared to regular teachers.

Regular random visits to schools from DMOs and the Chief Minister's monitoring teams have
helped identify the negligent teachers. For instance, the DMOs reported 3,000 absenteeism cases
in 2005 and action was taken on 1,600. The teacher management study also assessed the
effectiveness of the contract teacher recruitment policy. This study found 25 percent of regular
teachers absent as opposed to 17 percent of contract teachers absent on the day of the survey.

Teacher absenteeism has also been included as an indicator in the composite monitoring index
developed by the provincial government to monitor and measure performance of districts (based
on school-specific data) against the key program indicators (discussed in detail below under the
objective of monitoring and evaluation).

Objective: To Strengthen Program Monitoring and Evaluation

The PMIU has been responsible for both: (a) monitoring and evaluating the impact of the overall
program on public primary schooling; and (b) overseeing implementation of certain key
components of the reform program such as delivery of free textbooks and stipends.

A significant achievement of the PMIU has been the development of robust monitoring systems
that oversee and verify program inputs as part of routine program management. Over the three
years, the Education Management Information System (EMIS) has been revamped and
mainstreamed under the Program, with the Planning and Schools Wings, and the Colleges Wing
using these databases for need-based decision-making. The baseline data for the indicators came
from a special Punjab EMIS survey carried out in Spring 2003. However, the baseline in 2003
had certain quality issues and an updated EMIS was conducted in February 2004 to improve upon
the limitation of the earlier baseline. In addition, data from Pakistan Integrated Household
Survey 2001-02 was also used. (Table 1). The intermediate data came from school census now
being conducted once every six months. Because of the Program's efforts to improve the
management and monitoring systems, for the first time in Punjab, data is being collected for the
purpose of analysis, and for feeding directly into policy decisions.

The government hired Monitoring and Evaluation Assistants (MEA) who are responsible for
random visits to schools. Over the three years the number of these MEAs has increased with the
aim to have at least 1 school visit per month for all 63,000 schools by the end of 2007. In
addition the government has supported Third Party Validations (TPVs) to validate the success (or
otherwise) of the various interventions. A detailed discussion of Monitoring and Evaluation of
the programs is given in section 2.3 below.

Objective: To Revitalize School Councils

Under PESRP, the Government of Punjab moved towards revitalizing school councils, which
though existing in most schools since the 1980s, were largely ineffective due to lack of financial
or administrative powers and proactive council members. During the first credit, for the first time,
School Councils (SCs) were given funds for development expenditures. The overall progress

Department for International Development).



                                                                                                           14

under this component, however, has been very slow. The focus was on revitalizing and making
the SCs functional, but efforts to provide deeper capacity building and social mobilization were
not built in. District Governments were notified to authorize district funds to School Councils for
carrying out small works up to Rs. 200,000, which was later increased to up to Rs. 400,000 in the
following year. However, without capacity support, few districts actually made such funds
available to the SCs, and very few SCs, in the absence of mobilization and capacity support for
preparing and financing school development plans, were actually able to exercise this authority.

The government initiated a pilot for supporting 2,400 SCs in six districts in partnership with two
NGOs using two different models (contracting out management to the NGO and a capacity
building approach) by the second credit period. A rigorous impact evaluation for this pilot is
underway to determine the role SCc can play in improving school outcomes with the help of
assistance and social mobilization. Progress report on the pilot shows that of the 2,400 target
schools, 100 percent have been re-organized 99 percent have prepared School Based Action Plans
and on the basis of engineering estimates submitted to the district government by 84 percent of
these schools, funds have been released to almost 58 percent of the schools. An evaluation of this
pilot is expected during 2007.

The Education Department's analysis shows that, in all of Punjab, SCs exist in almost 82 percent
of total schools out of which more than 95 percent had active bank accounts with an average
balance of about Rs.11,000 per SC. However, on average only 36 percent of available funds were
spent during the first year by primary school SCs, and an even lower 7 percent at the high and
higher secondary levels. The ICR mission's visits to the communities also revealed that although
school teachers and head teachers were aware of the requirement of having a SC, the households
were largely unaware of any such requirement and the decision to use the funds were being made
mainly within the schools. While commitment for this objective is seen at the highest level in the
provincial government, a shift in the mind set of the government is required at all tiers to engage
SCs more meaningfully in school level decision making and management through social
mobilization and capacity building in partnership with local NGOs.


Objective: To Improve Equitable Access to Education

This is one area that has shown the most significant progress over the three years, with steady
increases in public sector enrollments and progress in moving towards gender parity. The major
thrust of the program was to improve access to education with all of the output indicators in the
project focusing on improved access.       Total enrollments (Pre-Primary  Grade VIII) have
increased by 25 percent since the start of the reform program. Enrollment increases have been
registered for both boys and girls, although at a higher rate for girls as a result of which Punjab is
seeing a narrowing of the gender gap.

The progress in enrollment in Punjab has been due to a number of interventions that have been
put in place under the PESRP. These include demand-side interventions such as the introduction
of free schooling till grade X; stipends for girl students in 15 low enrollment districts; the
provision of free textbooks; as well as supply side interventions such as making non-functional
schools functional by provision of teachers where needed; infrastructure/missing facility program;
contract teacher recruitment to fill vacancies and to gradually cater to growing load of student
enrollments.

The PESRP interventions mentioned above were also accompanied with a strong awareness
campaign in the first year of PESRP. The awareness campaigns were aimed towards informing



                                                                                                   15

the public about the incentives provided under the PESRP as well as increasing awareness about
the importance of girls' education in national development. Print and electronic media was
extensively used, in addition, colorful posters were used to target all stakeholders and groups and
encourage their inclusion and participation. The stakeholders' focus group discussion, however,
revealed that these campaigns failed to reach the communities that were the least developed.

Under PESRP the government also disburses stipends to girls in grades VI-VIII in fifteen low
literacy districts which during the second DPC were extended vertically to include girls in grades
IX and X. The mechanism of delivery of the stipends is very well organized. The ICR mission in
their unannounced random visits found that most of the girls were getting the allocated amount,
though sometimes with slight delays. A stakeholder survey (summary in Annex 2) pointed
towards few deviances in delivery of the stipends at the post office level, and attempts have been
made by the government to identify, rectify and limit such cases.

Besides providing free schooling to all children up till matriculation level the government started
providing free textbooks up till Grade V, which were extended to cover all Grade Katchi  Grade
VII government school students by the second year of the credit, and to Grade X by the third
year. Third party validation (TPV) of the delivery mechanism shows more than 97 percent
efficiency in the delivery of free text books. Another TPV is currently underway. The average
cost of free textbook per student is estimated at only Rs.97.5 per year.

Prior to the reform program, there were 1,300 non-functional schools, i.e., an empty school
building without any students attending the school.15 This was primarily due to vacant teacher
posts. Surveys till the preparation of the first simplified ICR for the first credit in the series show
that after the recruitment and posting of contract teachers to these schools, 50 percent of the
former non-functional schools had become functional. However, the most recent school census
(October 2006) suggested that the number of closed schools has been reduced to 828 schools.
According to the government, the original baseline of 2003 did not fully capture the all the non-
functional schools in the province, and therefore had underestimated the number of schools
requiring teachers to make the schools functional. Through continued contract recruitment, the
government intends to functionalize viable schools.

The program for the provision of missing facilities only started to be implemented in March 2004
after the signing of the TOPs with the provinces. Hence the program started with almost one year
lag after the initiation of the PESRP, and the missing facilities program followed a calendar year
rather than a fiscal year cycle. In the first year, out of the 32,389 approved missing facility
schemes, about 12,000 were approved in 2005, and more than 60 percent of these have been
completed. In 2006-07, more than 64,000 missing facilities were identified according to the
district profile, of which 19,015 were prioritized. However, till the end of 2006, only 919
schemes were approved and almost one third of these had been completed.

A number of issues were raised in this component; the most important is the quality of the civil
works. The government, through its own monitoring, identified serious quality issues in the civil
works. The construction and civil works were being undertaken under the management of the
Communication and Works department. Due to major issues related to use of poor quality
construction material and construction of substandard buildings, the government decided to move
the responsibility away from this department.                    The government thus adopted a different



15This was based on the baseline district profile done in April 2003. Subsequently, it was seen in EMIS surveys that
the numbers changed due to the earlier insufficient capture of data.



                                                                                                                    16

contracting model by outsourcing the management of civil works in construction of education (as
well as of health facilities) sector infrastructure to another agency, that is, the National Logistics
Cell (NLC), a federal government autonomous body. Under the new arrangement, the NLC signs
contracts with districts to construct the infrastructure and is monitored by the concerned district
government. While this approach may improve the quality of construction, in the long run, the
government also needs to improve the capacity of its institutions to deliver quality civil works.

Objective:      To Ensure Provision of Quality Education through Improved Teaching and
Materials

In terms of quality, the program focused initially on reviewing the fundamental structural and
institutional systems relating to the quality agenda, and not on focusing on student learning.
Teacher professional development necessitated restructuring of the institutional framework for
teacher training in the province. Similarly, textbook improvement required gradual changes such
as first opening up of textbook printing of two grades to private competition, before moving
towards complete opening of printing and publishing for all textbooks. This however, did not
relate to the content of the textbooks, only the quality of print and durability, and reducing costs
as a result of the open competition.16 During the three years of PESRP, systems to monitor
student learning were also being developed in conjunction with national efforts.                               These
institutional changes led to slower implementation on the quality agenda, but laid the foundations
for meaningful reforms to improve quality.

The various steps taken to improve the quality of teaching and learning included recruitment of
teachers with higher qualifications and continuation of filling the vacancy gap. The Directorate
of Staff Development (DSD) initiated the teacher professional development program with the
approval of a framework for Continuous Professional Development of teachers, linked to future
plans of direct classroom support, mentoring, incentives, and monitoring. Training of Lead
Trainers in partnership with the private sector providers was being conducted. Programs for
classroom-based support, especially for least qualified primary school teachers were finalized. A
teacher data management information system to assist in planning and managing teacher
professional development was in the process of being developed. Since the process under this
component involved comprehensive institutional arrangements, the progress remained slow and
encountered a number of problems. For instance, the DSD was only restructured during the
second credit; it took time to put in place a comprehensive CPD framework; and rolling out
teacher training took time for putting in place partnerships with private providers. As a result, it
was by the end of the third credit that teacher training was actually imparted, and the system for
ongoing support is now being put in place. The program for teacher professional development
has so far focused on short teacher training events. However, the CPD envisions regular on-site
support to teachers through the newly created position of District Training Educators.

The process of textbook improvement has also been underway with opening up of textbook
printing and publishing to private competition. Building upon the positive experience with the
Katchi grade Primer under the first Credit, printing and publication of Grade VI books for all
subjects has now been undertaken through a competitive open process. The total number of
textbooks that have been printed and published through this rose from 2.37 million in 2004 to 5.2
million in 2005. The department is now phasing the opening of printing and publishing to



16Textbook content and curriculum is a federal subject in Pakistan. Recently the Federal Ministry of Education has
revised the curriculum as a part of a national curriculum reform program. In the next phase of the PESRP, textbooks
will be developed under the new curriculum.



                                                                                                                   17

include four more classes. An action plan has been developed for phasing textbook reform,
including restructuring of the Textbook Board to realign its functions. To reform an established
institution with multiple interest groups is a challenging task, and will require continued high
level commitment to develop alignment among the various stakeholders.

A major reform for measurement of quality of learning is the approval to establish an independent
Examination Commission for undertaking primary and elementary terminal examinations.17 This
was not foreseen at the start of the Program but was started at the government's own initiative.
This has emerged as core reform as it has strong linkages with content and quality of teaching.
Examination data is already being used to establish district ranking in quality (and this will be
updated after the next round of examinations) and will enable provision of performance-based
incentives to schools and districts. Since this was the first year of such a practice, there were
some shortcomings in the process and logistics of the exam and the government will need to take
steps to rectify them to improve the quality of the examinations.

Another significant development was the establishment of baseline for monitoring the quality of
learning through assessments and examination through the National Education Assessment
System (NEAS). The first and second pilot assessment of Grade IV students in language and
mathematics provided the baseline of student learning outcomes at the provincial and national
levels. It showed that although Punjab performed slightly better than the national average, it still
fell below the mean scaled score of 500 in both subjects (430 in mathematics in 2005, and 404 in
2006 and 382 in language in both years, out of a total score of 1000).

Objective: To Expand Access to Education through Innovative Public Private Partnerships

Recognizing the growth of the private sector as an indication of the increasing demand for
education, the PESRP envisioned an engagement of the government with the private sector
through the introduction of public-private partnerships in education. The Punjab Education
Foundation (PEF) was restructured as an autonomous but publicly funded institution to support
public-private partnership programs, especially low cost private schools. This part of the reform
program moved slower than expected in the first year because of the strategic planning and the
legal requirements needed to give the PEF an autonomous status. Public funding for the PEF was
maintained at Rs. 400 million a year.

By the period of the second credit, PEF was fully functional and staffed, with a vision and
strategy in place and has been operating a number of programs for low cost schools and children
from low income households. In order to ensure quality, PEF's in-house Academic Development
Unit has helped to design, deliver and monitor training, provide ongoing support to teachers, and
conduct periodic assessments of students and teachers.                 As PEF prepares to scale up, the
academic support functions are gradually being outsourced.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
The good progress in PESRP supported by the DPC series is a result of a combination of factors.




17The Commission was established with technical support and guidance from UNICEF.




                                                                                                     18

Continued high level political support and commitment has kept the Program on track. The
Chief Minister of Punjab introduced the PESRP as his flagship program. This enabled the
government to take on challenging institutional reforms, such as establishing an independent
Examination Commission and moving forward on the restructuring of the Textbook Board and
the restructuring of the Punjab Education Foundation as an autonomous apex body for public-
private partnerships in education. At the same time, the government maintained its financing
commitments under the MTBF. This in part resulted because of continuity in leadership and the
continued commitment to the reforms.

Alignment in the senior provincial management and bureaucracy was maintained which
also facilitated implementation.     The team was forward looking and continued to seek
improvements in program design and aims to deepen the reforms. Similarly, continuity of
management team at the education department level and the continuity of overall reform team at
planning and finance level helped maintain the momentum of the reforms. At the same time, high
level oversight by the reform steering committee headed by the Chief Secretary of the province
helped maintain the integrity of the program.

The provincial reform program was closely linked to major national level initiatives
including the national PRSP and the national devolution plan which aimed to devolve decision
making and finances to the districts. Thus the reforms were not isolated attempts to improve
education sector but were introduced as a part and parcel of wider reforms taking place
throughout the country which helped garner support and ensure continuity.

Strong MIS and data analysis helped to monitor progress, to identify areas that required
further support, and most importantly to enable need-based decision making. This has been one
of the strongest components of the reform which helped monitor the major initiatives under the
PESRP. The program's MIS also evolved over the life of the program to bring in other indicators
not envisioned at the start of the program, to better monitor the effectiveness of the PESRP. For
instance, the provincial examination system was developed under the PEC and examination
results are now being monitored to gauge district and school performance. At the same time the
incentives for districts to perform were introduced by developing the composite monitoring index.

The regularity of dialogue with the Bank, transparent exchange of issues and information at
all levels including the districts and schools ensured credibility and predictability of Bank
financing. A valuable relationship between the Bank and the government was enabled as the
DPC instrument allowed for focus on policy level discussions, and adding value on the direction
of reforms rather than the micro aspects of implementation.

The government ensured that other donors come in to support its reform framework and
discouraged supply side donor programs. For instance the strategic planning of the program
managers effectively used the UNICEF support to develop the examination reform. Similarly the
GTZ support was steered to assist the government with teacher training. Such strategic planning
avoided cluttering the agenda and doing multiple reporting for various donors under stand alone
projects.

There were, however, factors that hindered progress in implementation and outcomes in
certain areas. Under the national devolution plan, service delivery responsibility moved to the
district governments with the provincial education department responsible for providing policy
direction and overall monitoring of outcomes. While under the PESRP, Punjab managed to
strengthen provincial monitoring and policy development functions, delays in reorganization of
the district education system delayed the start up of district capacity building programs. This in



                                                                                               19

turn affected the capacity to monitor school performance, including setting up a streamlined
system to monitor teacher absenteeism at a school by school level within the districts, and provide
systematic follow up support for quality to teachers.

The slow progress in capacity building of School Councils also delayed activating them to play a
more effective role. The lack of social mobilization hindered the community's participation in
the process, in particular that of female community members; and the lack of ability to create
school financing plans and effective decision making at the school level led to low or non-
utilization of school funds. There also appeared to be a lack of awareness and misinformation at
the school levels regarding the role and responsibilities of SCs which limited the effectiveness of
the School Councils.

This issue is also linked to lack of adequate outreach by the government to inform and engage
civil society in the program. While a large scale awareness campaign was launched through the
print and electronic media, the government needs to undertake systematic and pro-active
engagement with stakeholders in the civil society. This will be important during Phase II which
requires deeper work on quality related reforms and programs.

In addition, the institutional reforms required for improving quality, took longer than anticipated
at the start of the program. With information now becoming available on quality of student
learning, the key challenge will be to develop a coherent strategy to align the various inputs for
quality at the school and classroom level.

Before the first credit, the program was considered a high benefit- high risk program. The
risks came from Pakistan's history of uneven support to the education sector, weak financial
management capacity, new evolving roles under the devolution plan, and the monitoring capacity
of the government. These risks were mitigated by ensuring that the reform had political backing
and commitment, introducing TOPs with the districts for successful implementation of the
devolution plan, ensuring that other partners were also supporting capacity development of the
government and establishment of a program implementation unit that was responsible for
monitoring and evaluation of the reform program.

By the second credit, it was evident that the risks were lower than the benefits. High enrollment
rates and successful devolution of authority to the districts led to two other major risks that
included the risk of overwhelming the education system by burdening the already limited
infrastructure and teacher resources, and the lack of monitoring capacity at the local levels. Thus,
in the second credit, the government tried to mitigate these risks by continuing to support
additional infrastructure and developing a detailed teacher development plan. The governance
capacity at the districts level was strengthened by creating positions of District Monitoring
Officers and monitoring assistants, as well as designing of a capacity development program of the
existing district education staff. In addition, the potential risk from weak financial management
capacity at the district level persisted.

Similar risks were identified for the third credit, with the recognition that the benefits have been
higher than anticipated. However, a risk that the SCs might not be able to function as needed or
have weak capacity, remained throughout the program period of three years and the planned
mitigation strategies of providing SCs with NGO support and appropriate administrative and
financial guidelines were not implemented as a concerted effort. Thus the SCs were unable to
take up the role envisaged for them. This can be attributed to the lack of familiarity with such
programs on the implementers' part to the particular component.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

In accordance with the government's program approach, the government of Punjab selected very
few and focused input indicators, including the total expenditure on education, development and
recurrent expenditure and expenditure on primary education (Table 1).

Following the proposed monitoring matrix developed by the Government of Pakistan for the
education sector in the PRSP, the core intermediate indicators for the PESRP included: (i)
number of functioning schools, (ii) number of trained teachers and, (iii) reduction in teacher
absenteeism. The outcome indicators included enrolment rates for primary and middle school
levels, and completion rates in government schools at the primary level.

The government developed a very comprehensive system of monitoring and evaluation. At the
district level, the government hired MEAs on contract basis to conduct random checks in schools
all over the province. The number of these MEAs has now increased to 929, with an aim to have
at least one visit per month in each of the 63,000 primary/elementary schools in the province.
The MEAs collect information on student attendance, teacher presence, receipt of stipends and
textbooks, pace and quality of civil works, and on the school environment. Together, these
indicators form the composite monitoring index (see below) which was developed to monitor
school performance and allow for aggregated monitoring of districts' performance in the program
indicators. According to the PMIU, using the data collected over the two years by the MEAs,
such intensive monitoring mechanisms reduced the rate of teacher absenteeism to about 9
percent.18 In addition to the regular school information in the EMIS systems, the PMIU also
strengthened the system to include full human resource information on teachers.

For effective knowledge management and information sharing, the PMIU developed a website
which has general information on the education reform program, including general statistics such
as number of schools, enrollment, teacher statistics as well as program specific information
including the information of free textbooks distributed and stipends given out to date. The
website has also introduced an online complaint reporting system to give the public a venue to
report mishandling of the incentives at any level.19

The ongoing monitoring being undertaken by the PMIU has been supported by external
monitoring and validation exercises such as Third Party Validation (TPV) and impact evaluations.
TPVs have been undertaken for the girls' stipend program, textbooks delivery, procurement
process, and to validate enrollment data and trends of increased enrollments. In addition, there
has also been a strong commitment towards conducting rigorous evaluations to assess the impact
of programs including the girls' stipend program, free textbook distribution, and physical
infrastructure improvements on enrollments.

Because of the Program's efforts to improve the management and monitoring systems, data is
being collected for the purpose of analysis, and for feeding directly into policy decisions. MIS
data is being used for the purposes of analysis and reform program planning and policy decisions
(e.g., data-based needs analysis for teacher recruitment). As mentioned above, this ongoing
monitoring is supported by regular third party validation (TPV) systems. TPVs conducted in
2005 for the delivery of stipends and textbooks showed more than 90 and 99 percent delivery,
respectively.

An important development during the PEDPC III period was the development of a composite
performance monitoring index for the districts, which has been approved by the Chief Minister.
It is based on twelve indicators derived from the main program interventions. Each of these has
been assigned a weight relative to the importance of that activity in the overall program and the
amount of control a district actually has over performance in that indicator.20 The composite
index is based on school/location-specific data based on the indicators linked to the partnership
agreements with districts. Monthly monitoring reports are being generated (based on actual
school visits by the MEAs), and feedback to districts is being provided. To further encourage the
monitoring mechanisms in the district offices, the government has introduced monetary
incentives to the education managers at the district level for the five best performing districts in
the province on the basis of this index and provides increased support for the districts that fail to
perform well. The index is an evolving one and will incorporate other indicators as relevant in
the next phase of the PESRP.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation :

Following good progress for enhancing access to education as a result of the implementation of
PESRP, but in recognition of an unfinished agenda in access and more focus required to improve
quality in terms of learning outcomes, the government requested that the World Bank continue to
be engaged with the Government of Punjab in supporting Phase II PESRP. The next series of
three annual credits would provide continued support to PESRP after the successful completion
of Phase I reforms from 2003-2006. The objectives of Phase II PESRP are to improve quality of
education at school level, increase participation, retention and transition rates, and reduce gender
and regional disparities especially at primary, elementary and secondary levels, while maintaining
the fiscal and fiduciary framework. The reform program will be based on three pillars: (A)
enhance fiscal sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment; (B) increase equitable
access to education and improve quality and relevance of education; and (C) improve public
education sector governance and management.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


The Bank Group's program priorities in the Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) include
strengthening macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness, improving the business
environment for growth, and improving equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender
equity policies. In the education sector, the Bank's support focuses on interventions that would
help the goal of achieving universal primary education, with particular focus on improving the
quality of education provided, and giving priority to the poor and disadvantaged, particularly girls



20The indicator in the index to date, with the relative weights in parentheses, include: increase in enrollment (8),
students presence in school (8), missing facilities (pace of work) (14), missing facilities (quality of work))(18), free
textbook distribution (9), stipend distribution (7), re-opening of non-functional schools (3), illegal fee/levies being
charged (5), school inspections being done by district staff (5), teacher absenteeism (12), school cleanliness (3).




                                                                                                                        22

and children in the rural areas. In the past, lessons from Bank experience with investment
projects including the Social Action Program Project (SAPP) in Pakistan, in the 1990s, had
shown that policy reforms require support beyond sector line ministries. Development Policy
Credit served as an appropriate instrument to facilitate policy dialogue, attention, and decisions at
the highest levels of government. The three-year reform program required significant financing;
and the DPC instrument managed to influence government's financing levels for the sector and to
provide necessary budget support in a timely manner.




3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The series of three DPCs supporting the government of Punjab in its effort to increase enrollment
rates, reduce gender disparity in education and improve the financial and overall management of
the education sector in Punjab met with good success over the three year period as detailed below.

Education sector budget increased by 50 percent over the three years. The increased budget
financed missing infrastructure and targeted incentives such as free textbooks and stipends,
support to the private sector and teacher deployment and development. Almost 60 percent of the
non-functional schools were opened with the hiring of new contract teachers. PEF was setup and
started implementing models to explore subsidized education delivery to children of low income
households. Following discussion presents the achievements in more detail.

Primary girls' net enrollment in government schools increased from 35 percent to 51.9 percent
between October 2003 and October 2006. At the middle level, girls now account for 42 percent
of total enrollment, up from 36 percent in October 2003. Household survey data also show
improvements in net enrollment rates (NER), echoing the trends in public sector enrollments as
reported by EMIS. The primary NER in Punjab increased from 45 percent in 2001/02 to 58
percent in 2004-05, with the NER for girls at 56.8 percent as opposed to boys at 59.9 percent.

The stipend program targeting Grade VI-VIII government school girls in fifteen low literacy
districts showed enrolment increases and improved attendance over the first two years, and the
number of girls receiving the stipend increased from 214,000 in October 2004 to 252,000 in
October 2005 (almost 18 percent increase), with attendance at over 99 percent (up from 90
percent from the first year). The stipend program was extended vertically to girls in Grades IX
and X in the same districts from the last quarter of CY05 and the total number of beneficiaries
from grade VI-X has increased to 344,111 girls in September 2006. The total amount disbursed
as stipends till September amounts to Rs. 2.061 billion. An impact evaluation of the stipend
program by the World Bank using before and after the intervention survey data sets revealed an
increase of almost six girls per school in grades 6-8 in the targeted districts (see figure 1), which,
starting from a low base and very low levels of enrollment in these grades, is a significant
increase.

Under the free textbooks program more than 20 million books were provided to 9.7 million
students in April 2005. By the time of the third credit in the series, the government had expanded
the delivery of free text books to Grade X. This has helped poor families by reducing the cost of
education.

Under the independent Examination Commission, for the first time, standard Grade V
examinations were universally conducted in April 2006. Approximately 1.2 million children
from almost 50,000 public and almost 26,000 private schools (on voluntary basis) appeared in the
Grade V examinations, out of which 31 percent were from the private sector and 69 percent from
the public sector.     The standard exam will help to establish school-wise and district-wise
performance benchmarks, making it easier to identify and fill gaps in teaching and learning.

The PEF also initiated several innovative programs to support low cost private schools. These
include a Cluster Based Teacher Training (CBT) Program through which more than 6,500
teachers from low cost private schools have been trained; its flagship Foundation Assisted
Schools (FAS) program that provides tuition support to low cost schools enabling almost 63,000
children from poor households to be enrolled in school; and a pilot voucher scheme that is
initially targeting 5,000 low-income households in urban slums in Lahore.

PEF programs will be evaluated to consider further refinements and scaling up. A World Bank
study on public private partnership, using household survey data from three districts in Punjab, is
currently being finalized. This will provide useful guidance for further policy development and
programs for public private partnerships. The government now also has the examination results of
almost 400,000 students of Grade V studying in private schools that appeared in the Grade V
examination in April 2006. This is also helping to provide comparative information on public
and private students. The government under the PESRP has already expanded its free textbook
scheme to the children in the PEF supported FAS schools and discussions are underway to
expand these incentives to other private sector schools in line with further expansion of the FAS
program.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating



                                                                                                24

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

The achievement of the program's objectives for the overall series of the three annual DPCs is
rated as satisfactory for the three year period. Over the period there has been a better re-
alignment of financial resources by the government to the education sector as seen by the annual
budget allocations over the three years. This has helped in providing greater access to education
as well as lowering of the gender gap as measured by the gender disaggregated enrollment rates
in government schools. The monitoring and evaluation mechanisms have been strengthened as
evidenced by the strong database on education indicators maintained by the PMIU. An important
aspect has been setting up of institutions for quality including the Punjab Examination
Commission, and Department of Staff Development, as well as the realignment of the functions
of the Punjab textbook board. PEF which has been made an autonomous body is now taking off
as the strategic window for supporting private sector in education to help cater to the increasing
demand for education. It is providing equitable access to education for children of all socio-
economic levels as evidence by provision of financing to almost 300 low cost private schools and
voucher programs for direct support to children of low income households through the PEF.
There have been sustained attempts to improve quality by hiring more qualified teachers and
initiation of teacher development programs.

The rating for each credit in the series and its justification is given below.

The first Education Sector Adjustment Credit for Punjab
Rating: Satisfactory

A simplified ICR was prepared and submitted for the first credit in the series. This ICR holds the
ratings of the simplified ICR. Though the first year was too early to start seeing an impact on the
outcome variable, systems were being put in place at the right pace. The first credit was rated as
satisfactory for the following reasons:
       Overall education budget was increased in FY04 by 20 percent.
       MTBF was developed giving priority to increasing provincial expenditures on education
          by 50 percent over the three years.
       Annual performance targets were agreed to in the TOPs.
       Conditional grants under the PESRP were fully transferred to the districts.

The Second Credit - PEDPC II
Rating: Satisfactory

The PEDPC II is rated as satisfactory due to the following impacts:



                                                                                                 25

    Targets and commitments under the MTBF were maintained with a 50 percent increase in
        the education budget from FY2004-FY2006.
    Districts' own education budgets were increased by 15 percent for non salary budget, and
        72 percent for development.
    Performance-based incentives were introduced: from pure need based formula in FY04, a
        gradual shift towards equal share for performance and need; 30 percent weight to
        performance in FY05, was increased to 40 percent weight in FY06.
    Full budget tracking system (for both provincial and district budgets) was put in place.
    Progressive reduction of backlogs of un-reviewed audit observations and consolidating
        accountability in the sector continued.
    Procurement was made more transparent, with no requirement for pre-registration of
        contractors, and annual third party ex-posts procurement audits were being conducted.
    School Councils were reconstituted (85 percent of primary schools had SCs), and
        provided the authority to spend development funds on civil works.
    Free textbooks were received by 99 percent government Grade K-8 students on time for
        school year (10.6 million students received free textbooks)
    Eligible girl students regularly received quarterly stipends (90 percent on time delivery)
    There was an estimated 20 percent overall increase in public school enrolments, with
        reduction in gender gaps
    Stipends led to 40 percent increase in girls' enrollment in target districts (and more than
        90 percent increase in attendance), and showed increased enrollments for boys compared
        to non-stipend districts.
    Reduction in missing facilities gap: work on 60 percent of identified missing facilities
        was commissioned, with work completed on more than half.
    Teacher recruitment was being conducted on a basis of needs analysis.
    Over 66 percent of closed schools were opened through appointment of teachers.
    For the first time, teacher development programs were being delivered in partnership
        with private sector.
    5.2 million textbooks were printed through a competitive process.
    The M&E system producing data and information for policy and analysis; received
        national recognition and had started being replicated in other provinces.
    Public private partnerships were in the process of being developed.

The third credit - PEDPC III
Rating: Satisfactory

The third credit in the series has been rated as satisfactory for the following reasons:
    The commitments on increase in education budget were maintained and 2006-07 budget
        increased by 26 percent.
    Timely, accurate, and comprehensive expenditure reporting for the sector continued by
        the PMIU and the lag time in reporting was reduced to 6 weeks.
    Overall reduction in the backlog of audit paragraphs continued showing the government's
        commitment towards transparency and proper use of resources.
    Draft law to create procurement regulatory authority for Punjab was in the final stages of
        review.
    NGO supported capacity building pilot program for SCs was underway in six districts in
        2400 schools.
    More than 50,000 teachers were hired on a contract basis under the new recruitment
        policy including improved qualification requirement.



                                                                                              26

     There was on time delivery of free textbooks to all public school students from K-10
        (almost 24 million textbooks).
     Stipends program was expanded vertically to include girls in grades 6-10 in total and
        continued delivery of quarterly stipends to almost 344,111 girls.
     NER of girls increased to almost 51.9 percent in primary and 27 percent at middle level.
     Approximately 33 percent of all identified missing facilities were provided.
     Under the framework of Continuous Professional Development of teachers, training was
        started for the Lead Teacher Educators and District Teacher Educators with almost
        60,000 primary school teachers trained.
     The publicly funded autonomous PEF had started implementing a number of innovative
        models of public-private partnership to support low cost private schools catering to the
        poor.
     Standardized exams across the province for grades 5 (conducted in 2006) and 8 (to be
        implemented) were introduced under an independent Punjab Education Commission.
     A Composite Index to monitor the performance of the districts on the various dimensions
        of the reform to reward the best performers and provide support to the worst performing
        districts was introduced.




3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The incentives provided under the PESRP helped increase the enrollment of children in school by
reducing the cost of education and providing households an incentive to send their children to
school. As mentioned, the particular incentives that directly impacted the enrollment of children
included elimination of tuition fee for grades I-X, provision of free textbooks, in addition to
stipends targeted at girls in fifteen low enrollment districts. Similarly, provision of missing
school facilities and re-opening of non-functional school helped provide better access to
education. The enrollment increased by almost 24 percent and 30 percent for boys and girls
respectively. Thus the gender gap decreased in the province which will have an overall impact on
the country.

The efficient on time delivery of free textbooks to almost 24 million students in 2006 was a huge
achievement of the government and helped ease the financial burden on the poor households.
The results from stakeholders' focus groups revealed that the parents and communities considered
the delivery of free textbooks a major step in reducing the private direct costs of education and
the timely delivery of the textbooks was highly commendable on the part of the government.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


The series of DPCs supporting the government's PESRP was based on and led to a number of
integral institutional changes in the education system in particular. The government through its
PESRP introduced new business processes that have the demand to be replicated in the other
provinces as well as departments. These include:




                                                                                               27

a) The Terms of Partnership agreements between the province and the districts created a major
institutional shift towards monitoring performance at the district level with the districts being
provided performance-based incentives (the TOPs include annual performance targets). This is
the first time in Pakistan that such an explicit service delivery contract has been initiated between
a province and district governments.
b) A comprehensive transparent system of monitoring and evaluation which can track students
and teachers at the school level strengthened the accountability mechanism, helped reduce teacher
absenteeism and will help improve the quality of education in the long run. Using this strong
database effectively the government initiated need-based and performance based grants to
encourage improvements in the education system at the districts level. A composite performance
index was developed which will help measure and monitor district performance.
c) Establishment of the Punjab Education Commission as an independent agency to conduct
standardized examinations for grades 5 and 8 throughout the province will help the future work
on quality of education which has now attained a central role in all country and World Bank
dialogues.
d) The Directorate of Staff Development (DSD) is now a well established institution leading the
teacher professional development strategy of the province. It will further develop its role as an
apex body to provide support to districts to improve the quality of teaching.
e) The revitalization of the PEF to support low cost private schools helped focus on the reality of
the vast private sector involvement in the education sector. The government is gradually seeing
the private schools as the institutions providing education to "our children" and regards education
as a public good for all. This reflects a major shift in government policy.
f) The PESRP had a greater than anticipated institutional impact with the creation of a momentum
of institutional reforms being replicated in other sectors in Punjab (i.e., irrigation), and for
reforms in other provinces (e.g., Sindh education program, NWFP Human Development
program).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The reform program in Punjab has initiated some major process and institutional change in the
province of Punjab. It is worth noting that it has not only made impact on the education
indicators and outcomes in Punjab, but has had a demonstration effect in the other provinces. The
provinces of Sindh and NWFP are also following a similar program structure for the education
sector. Also, though not intended to have this impact, the PESRP has also had some impact on
the federal Ministry's efforts to revise the National Education Policy and associated initiatives
such as opening up of textbook reforms.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Structured focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted during July 2006 by two NGOs
(Bunyad and SAHE) in a mix of communities (rural, urban) in six districts of central and southern
Punjab (summary of issues and recommendations is attached in Annex 2). The 44 FGDs included
participation of students, parents, teachers, community members/SC members, district education
officials, and local representatives. The overall objective of these consultations was to gain
deeper insight and understanding of communities' perspectives and views on recent education
sector reforms and issues in Punjab, both to assess community satisfaction with recent education
initiatives and to inform the framework of Phase II PESRP.

Certain key issues that came up as problem issues included the delivery of stipends, which was
sometimes irregular; in addition the amount was not considered enough to cover the cost of



                                                                                                   28

transportation for girls. There were also complains of delayed delivery of textbooks in some
cases.

The role of school councils remains low in most of the areas and there was no attempt at capacity
building of the councils. However, School council grants for missing facilities, repair and
maintenance were in evidence in all communities. A few were able to get physical infrastructure
facilities through support of the building department. Although a great deal has been done to
improve the school infrastructure, it is still insufficient to fulfill the desired needs of the schools
as identified by teachers and school councils.

The group discussions suggested that despite certain problems of quantity, quality and
transparency, the Punjab Education Sector Reforms has identified, and has begun to address key
issues in the education sector. Provision of free books has increased enrolments among the poor,
and the stipend has had a positive impact on the majority of the socially and economically
deprived poorer communities especially those living in far off areas and with difficult access to
middle schools.     Attitudes have changed towards girls' education and higher education
opportunities are now being demanded.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The first Education Sector Adjustment Credit for Punjab

Rating: Moderate

The Program Document indicated several risks that could affect program implementation. These
included: the evolving roles and responsibilities of the local governments relative to the
Provincial Government; Pakistan's history of political uncertainty; the potential lack of fiscal
sustainability of the reform program beyond the three year proposed period of IDA assistance;
weak departmental capacity to implement and monitor the program; and the possibility that
School Councils would not be given sufficient administrative and fiscal discretion to effectively
function, thereby restricting expansion of parental and community participation in school-level
decision making. Therefore, the first credit in the series was rated as a high risk  high benefit
program, however, early in the program it was realized that the benefits are high.

A number of risk mitigating arrangements were built in the program, for instance the terms of
partnerships clearly defined roles in terms of evolving roles under devolution plan; the program
was driven by the provincial government with full backing from the Chief Minister; and also the
fact that Pakistan has been at the road to economic recovery. The actual risk to development
outcomes for the first credit is rated as moderate at the time of writing this ICR. In hindsight, the
risk was not high as the program momentum was well maintained during the first year of
implementation with no backtracking


The Second Credit - PEDPC II
Rating: Moderate

In the second credit, the risks identified included the supply side constraints given a large increase
in demand for schooling; weak institutional capacity at the district level, weak financial
management capacity and the risk that School Councils will not be able to work properly because
of low capacity. These risks were being mitigated by identifying areas where supply side issues



                                                                                                    29

were causing a problem and trying to provide facilities and teachers to those areas; government's
commitment to increase sector expenditures in accordance with the growing demand of the
sector; better alignment between districts and provinces, in particular with the TOPs; and creating
management and monitoring positions to set up the organizational framework for the evolving
devolution.

PEPDC II is rated as of moderate risk at this time since the capacity building efforts remained at
initial stages and did not take off during this period.     However, by the second credit overall
institutional changes had started taking place making reversals difficult.

The third credit - PEDPC III
Rating: Moderate

By the third credit in the series it was obvious that the benefits were higher than the risks and that
the risk mitigation measures were appropriate. However, a moderate risk is being retained at this
time. First, throughout the three years of the program, there has been strong political backing of
the program. The government has given top priority to education and PESRP is its flagship
program. Another aspect has been the stability and continuity of the government team working
on the program which has developed a deep sense of ownership at the various levels of the
government. One potential risk arises from the possibility of changing political priorities of a
new government after the forthcoming elections. Also, there could be changes in education
department teams which might lead to slowing down of in the reforms. Second, the relative
difficulty in generating capacity at the lower tiers of the governance structure and delays in
providing timely capacity support, especially the district education offices pose a risk to the
reform process. Third, the school councils are central for improving school performance, and
they remain weak due to lack of capacity and social mobilization support.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


The first Education Sector Adjustment Credit for Punjab
Rating: Satisfactory

The World Bank performance at entry is rated as satisfactory for the first credit. The Bank team
remained proactively engaged with government on the program design, including through regular
policy dialogue and intensive district and field visits. After almost a decade of sector investment
projects and the SAPP, and no significant improvements in human development outcomes, there
was a period of stock taking by both the Bank and the government on what was needed to bring
about visible improvements in the education sector. The experience of SAPP suggested that
sector reforms required critical support and sustained commitment of the government as a whole.
The program was well grounded in research and was in line with the main reforms introduced by
the federal government, in particular, its education reform program, the PRSP and the devolution
reform. Additionally it was a time when the Pakistan economy was starting to grow after a period
of stagnated growth. Further, the program had strong championship from the political leaders
which made it possible to implement a few of the radical components of the program. Given that
this was an adjustment credit, the dialogue with key policymakers outside of the education sector,
particularly finance and planning, played a critical role in helping to formulate education sector


                                                                                                   30

program and resultant strategies within the broader development strategy of the province.
Moreover, this project was well aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Pakistan.

The Second Credit - PEDPC II
Rating: Satisfactory


The quality at entry of the Bank team is rated as satisfactory.22 The task team maintained a
seamless and consistent engagement with the counterparts. The team's responsiveness and
proactive role was acknowledged by government. Continuity of the task team was one major
factor for ensuring the consistency in policy dialogue with the senior provincial leadership and in
working with the Education Department. The Bank maintained intensive dialogue with senior
policy makers outside of the education sector, including ministries of finance and planning, which
helped to address sector issues within the context of the overall provincial development and
financing framework. Besides the dialogue with provincial and federal partners, the Bank team
also coordinated its work closely with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which played a
major role in assisting the Punjab Government to undertake key public finance reforms. The
preparation of a project each year is a laborious task, but the team rigorously used analytical work
to justify the pillars in the project. The project documents and all other relevant documents
maintained good quality.



The Third Credit - PEDPC III
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality at entry for the third credit is also rated as satisfactory for the Bank. The team
remained enthusiastically involved in the program. The good progress over the first two years of
the program had strengthened strong working relationship and trust between the government of
Punjab and the Bank team. The team brought in the required technical resources to further
deepen the dialogue as it was working concurrently on preparing the third credit, and initiating
dialogue on Phase II reforms. The program was developed after intensive brainstorming sessions
between the two teams to ensure that the progress continued and the gaps or weaknesses could be
filled in the last year of the first series of DPCs, with a focus on deepening reforms in lagging
areas under Phase II. Again the continuity of the teams at the Bank and their counterparts helped
in moving on a fast track while not loosing sight of quality. The research base for the preparation
of the project had widened considerably given the data and information developed from the first
two years of the credit. The dialogue with key policymakers outside of the education sector,
particularly finance and planning, continued to play a central role in ensuring that the education
sector reforms remained within the broader development strategy of the province. This process
also ensured buy-in from the important stakeholders in the Departments of Planning and Finance.




(b) Quality of Supervision




22The World Bank's Quality Assurance Group has conducted a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEAS) of PEDPC II, and
has also given it an overall Satisfactory rating.




                                                                                                           31

The first Education Sector Adjustment Credit for Punjab
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory for the first credit. The Bank task team was
composed of members from Human Development, PREM, Financial Management and
Procurement, and Social Development with in-depth country as well as sector knowledge. A
sound and professional relationship with the relevant provincial agencies was sustained
throughout the preparation, appraisal and supervision stages. There was strong continuity of
Bank task team members, PMIU counterparts, as well as key policymakers in the provincial
government. The Bank team undertook supervision missions and each supervision mission
included field trips to districts and schools. Some of the team members would make random
unannounced visits to ensure that the government claims of good performance are correct. The
Bank team also consulted with the civil society on the reform progress.

The Second Credit - PEDPC II
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of supervision for the second credit is also rated as satisfactory for the Bank. The
team undertook regular supervision missions and field visits. Each aide memoire from the
supervision mission identifies and details the critical issues needed to be followed up and
suggestions for the government. The team regularly engaged with civil society to understand
different stakeholder perspectives. At the operational level, consistent engagement with the
PESRP team enabled effective review of progress and discussion on areas needing acceleration.
Coordination with donors was effective and enabled better alignment between available technical
expertise and resources and with the needs of the Program (e.g., UNICEF technical support for
assessing the examination system which led to the decision to establish PEC).


The Third Credit - PEDPC III
Rating: Satisfactory

Quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory for the third credit. The Bank team continued to be
composed of members from Human Development, PREM, Financial Management and
Procurement and Social Development with in depth country as well as sector knowledge. In
addition, there has been continuity in the Bank team as well as the core counterpart team in the
government. This has helped to sustain a coherent dialogue with the provincial government. The
aide memoirs from the supervision missions show a detailed and comprehensive reporting of the
progress with a number of field visits built in most of the missions. The aide memoires precisely
summarize the progress and shortcomings in the implementation and identify areas to be
strengthened. Throughout the three year program period, the team has brought in necessary
international knowledge and expertise, as required.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory for all the three credits for the following
reasons:




                                                                                                 32

      The Bank team was very engaged in the design of the program with the government and
         acted as a catalyst in the process of design and implementation, even though the credit
         amount was small compared to the overall government funding going into the program.
      The team maintained a strong dialogue with key policy makers, not only in the
         education sector but also with the finance and planning sectors of the province.
      The team consisted of strong staff from various sectors of the Bank to maintain efficient
         supervision and monitoring of the various components of the program, including regular
         interaction with government at all levels, and with primary stakeholders through regular
         district/field visits. The World Bank staff undertook biannual field visits to schools,
         communities and met the district education staff to gain first hand knowledge of the
         program performance on the ground.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The first Education Sector Adjustment Credit for Punjab
Rating: Satisfactory

Borrower performance was fully satisfactory during the first credit. The Government of Punjab
had backed its political commitment by instituting key crosscutting reforms in public finance,
solidifying relationships of accountability between various tiers of government, and made
considerable efforts to improve service delivery. The PMIU has also played a key role in
managing and monitoring the program very closely, and in providing regular analysis to inform
the reform program. An important achievement has been that a previously dysfunctional data
monitoring system was turned around in less than a year since the reform began, such that
policymakers at all tiers of government could engage in discussion which was being informed by
timely and credible analyses and reports. Another commendable achievement was been the
timely implementation of several critical inputs such as stipends and textbooks distribution.

The Second Credit - PEDPC II
Rating: Satisfactory

The borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory for the second credit. At the provincial level,
the good progress and satisfactory achievement of objectives has been based on strong political
championship, alignment of vision and strategy among the key set of policy makers, and intensive
monitoring and oversight by the dedicated operational teams. The Chief Minister's keen interest
and monthly reviews of implementation progress helped keep the Program on track. The PESRP
Provincial Steering Committee continued to monitor progress, address bottlenecks, and provide
overall guidance on policy issues. The Education Department maintained its leadership of the
program. The PMIU's intensive monitoring and analysis maintained program momentum,



                                                                                                33

especially in timely implementation and delivery of inputs, and that policy decisions are based on
information and analysis. Quality of education was addressed through the restructuring of the
Directorate of Staff Development (DSD) to oversee teacher's professional development. At the
district level, the commitment of district governments was reflected in progress achieved in the
indicators agreed to in the TOP agreements. The capacity building program was hoped to enable
district education teams to further improve their performance.

The Third Credit - PEDPC III
Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory for the third credit. The Government of
Punjab had undertaken the education program as its flagship program and put in place
crosscutting reforms in public finance, and made considerable efforts to improve service delivery.
The Government of Punjab continues to foster the reform program by dedicating more financial
resources to the education sector, and by continued oversight by a high level provincial steering
committee that is guiding the reform process. The Education Department, with its Schools Wing
remained deeply engaged in overall sector management. The PMIU continued to play the key
role in monitoring the program very closely. It developed comprehensive database on education
inputs and outcomes, and continued providing regular analysis to inform the reform program and
helped in maintaining the progress in the program and identifying the limitations and gaps. The
government itself identified gaps in a few components, such as the quality of civil work and
initial program of teacher training and immediately took steps to rectify it. The PMIU has also
played a key role in the timely implementation of several critical inputs such as stipends and
textbooks distribution. The quality agenda gained more prominence through the implementation
of DSD's programs, and through establishing universal school examination system under the PEC.
The maintenance of financial records of salary and non-salary expenditures, and according to
major and minor heads of account within the framework of the government expenditure
classification system, has been adequately complied. The government, through the reform has
introduced new business processes in the system, ranging from creating TOPs between the
province and districts, to opening up support for the low cost private sector through an
autonomous Punjab Education Foundation. The commitment of the districts is reflected by the
signing of TOPs and progress achieved in the indicators of the TOPs.

6. Lessons Learned

While the enrollment trends in Punjab are encouraging, unfinished challenges remain  primary
completion rates are still low, and drop outs continue to happen. For instance, an analysis of
survival rates of children up till Grade X based on the PSLSMS data for ages 15-19 shows that
only 20.6 percent of the cohort of children enrolled in Grade I reach Grade X.23 This trend
appears to have continued even after the introduction of the PESRP. The estimations using
annual school census data from 2005 and 2006 show that out of the total number of Katchi (pre-
primary) class students, 27 percent did not progress to Grade 1 between October 2005 and
October 2006. Also, between Grade 4 and 5 during the same period, 18 percent of the children
did not make the transition. Linked to this, quality of education remains low as measured by
national education assessment results as well as the results of other specific studies which point
towards poor learning outcomes.                The successes and remaining challenges for the Punjab
Education Sector point to the following lessons based on the experiences of the PESRP:




23Author's calculations for survival rates of 15-19 year old children from PSLSMS, 2004-05.



                                                                                                  34

 Strong political support and government ownership is essential for any program to
  succeed. This leads to high level of monitoring and oversight. Continuity of the same
  team over a project, including officials and politicians at various tiers helps maintaining
  momentum of reforms and enhances the probability of success of a program.
 Any program that generates demand can be considered a success, and the PESRP,
  despite its shortcoming in a few components, has created a lot of interest and desire to
  follow the same model has come from Sindh and NWFP provinces.
 Processes that involve fundamental institutional change need time to establish on
  the ground before taking off and managing to show the desired impacts. As such
  planning should realistically anticipate such time lags while designing the programs to
  avoid disappointments of slow implementation.
 There appears to be very little engagement of the civil society and/NGOs in the
  process. Initiatives such as the SC component cannot succeed without handholding and
  capacity building which is possible with the help of the NGO sector.
 Targeted incentives can encourage enrollment, however, the drop-out rate are still
  high.    It is likely that students who come into the system are confronted by
  overwhelming conditions of over-enrolled schools. Although these gaps are being
  addressed, there is a time lag between the rapidly growing enrollments and availability
  of program inputs at the school level.
 Success of a program requires a flexible approach to implementation with effective
  monitoring and evaluation of the program during the implementation process with
  the help of relevant data and information to identify shortcomings and problem issues
  and be able to rectify them during the course of implementation.
 Strong ongoing analytical work helps deepen and refine policies and programs.
 With about 40 percent of Punjab's primary-school aged children still out of school,
  without public private partnerships, it will be difficult for the province to meet the
  MDG target of EFA. Given that the number of private institutions in Punjab has more
 than doubled from about 23,700 to more than 46,000 from the period, 2000 to 2006
 according to the National Education Census carried out by the federal government, and
 the fact that private enrollment now accounts for almost 40 percent of total enrollment,
 and 42 percent of all education institutions are in the private sector - with a majority of
 these being low cost schools catering to the poor - there is a clear need for deeper
 engagement with the private sector. Furthermore, based on available research findings
 learning outcomes in private schools are better than those of comparable government
 schools. Therefore, in a country like Pakistan, education sector policy and financing
 needs to address the issues and needs of the entire delivery system, both public and
 private. The initiative of restructuring PEF, although took time to establish, has created
 a window for supporting the private sector signaling a major shift in government policy
 for scaling up support to the low cost private sector.
 The need is to adopt a whole school approach in provision of mission facilities. The
  missing facilities have been provided in a piecemeal fashion with almost all of the
  63,000 schools in the province still missing at least one facility. The schools will still
  not be able to attract children if they have incomplete facilities, for instance the
  stakeholders consultations suggested that the schools had, for instance, been provided
  with fans but no electricity, or toilets without water, which did not benefit many
  individual schools (see Annex 2 for a summary of the stakeholders' reports).
 Low capacity can act a barrier to even the best of programs and the best of
  intentions. Despite of all the positive achievements, a number of components took time
  to implement pointing towards a need for better capacity building efforts. There were
  shortfalls in utilization of development budgets. It was realized that capacity constraints



                                                                                           35

          lead to under-spending and delays in implementation. Further, there were limited
          capacities for undertaking civil works which also affected quality of school
          construction. District level monitoring of the use of development funds needed to be
          strengthened to ensure improvements in service delivery. Similarly, capacity issues also
          affected the effectiveness of the SCs, for instance, SCs were authorized to carry out
          small civil works, but this only took place in a few districts. Similarly an ex-post
          procurement review pointed to deficiencies in two areas of procurement policy reform,
          i.e. procurement procedures and capacity constraints of staff.
      Finally, the success of any education system is judged by the quality of its
          graduates. While quality remains the core desired outcome of any education reform
          program, it takes several years to show tangible results. Therefore, education reforms
          require a long term commitment, backed by a clear strategy for improving school level
          performance through both quantitative and qualitative inputs.

   Annex 2. Beneficiary Survey Results

   Summary Findings of Community Consultations

   About 44 structured focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted during July 2006 by two
   NGOs (Bunyad and SAHE) in a mix of communities (rural, urban) in six districts of central and
   southern Punjab. These included:

   Hafizabad (Hafizabad, Pindi Bhattian)
   Lodhran (Kahror Pakka, Dunyapur)
   Multan (Multan, Shujaabad)
   Muzaffargarh (Muzaffargarh, Khangarh)
   Pakpattan (Pakpattan, Arifwala)
   Rahimyar Khan (Rahimyar Khan, Liaquatpur, Khanpur, Sadiqabad)

   The FGDs included participation of students, parents, teachers, community members/SC
   members, district education officials, and local representatives.

   The overall objective of these consultations was to gain deeper insight and understanding of
   communities' perspectives and views on recent education sector reforms and issues in Punjab,
   both to assess community satisfaction with recent education initiatives and to inform the
   framework of Phase II PESRP. The main findings and recommendation are summarized below.


                            Community Perception/Feedback                         Recommendation

General           Widespread awareness of program and recent             Deepen the awareness campaign to

The following is the Implementation Completion Report prepared by the
Government of Punjab and is attached below in its entirety.

           IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS (ICR) REPORT
           PUNJAB EDUCATION SECTOR REFORM PROGRAMME  PHASE I
                                         (2003/04 to 2005/06)

                 The educational scenario in Punjab in 2003 was quite discouraging. Out of a
total school age population (5-16 years) of around 23.76 million, nearly 11.06 million (46.5%)
were out of school, primary completion rate was around 45%, basic facilities like classrooms,
electricity, furniture, toilets etc were largely missing in public schools, female enrolment made
only 43.1% of total public sector enrolment, qualification of primary level school teachers was
predominantly matriculation (secondary), and a significant number of such positions were lying
vacant, school management intensity was inadequate and the school monitoring system was in
shambles. The instruments of stakeholders' participation in schooling services like school
councils were largely inactive and the primary and middle schools had no mechanism of assured
annual budgetary support. Low cost private sector, shouldering around 30% of total enrolment
load in the province, was not getting due support.

2.               The newly elected government of the time assigned top most priority to the
education sector, and in its first cabinet meeting declared education free upto secondary level in
public sector schools. Furthermore, it was decided that an all encompassing and comprehensive
programme be launched in the province to revamp the education sector. At that point the
government entered into negotiations with the World Bank to seek its financial and technical
support for beefing up the provincial education system, and to design and implement a reform
programme that might address the access, quality and governance issues, particularly at the
school level. Keeping in line with successful international experiences, a broad based, sector-
wide Punjab Education Sector Reform Programme (PESRP) was designed that rested on
three major pillars: a) public finance reforms to increase public spending for education and to
ensure fiscal sustainability; b) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary
environment; and c) education sector reforms to improve access, quality and sector governance.

3.               Under reform pillar I, the objective was to ensure sufficient allocation of public
finances to meet Punjab's educational needs. The government fulfilled its commitment through
preparation of a Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) and progressively enhancing its
education budget, from 2003-04 to 2005-06, by 50%. The objectives of reform Pillar II were to
facilitate transfer of resources to district governments for improving service delivery, increasing
transparency of financial management processes and enhancing provincial and district capacity
for monitoring financial flows. Under the spirit of devolution, the provincial government entered
into Terms of Partnership Agreements with the district governments, for the first time, for
provision of tied budgetary support for the education sector in which annual performance targets
were mutually agreed, and largely met. To enhance districts' commitment towards fulfilling
agreed targets, district allocations for the second and third years of PESRP Phase I were made on
need cum performance basis in which the performance factor weightage was enhanced from 30%




                                                                                                 44

in the second year to 40% in the third year1. Resultantly, the districts enhanced their own
education budgets by 15% for non-salary component and 72% for development during the three
years. Information flow lines were operationalized to track district education expenditures for
monitoring & evaluation purposes. Special emphasis was laid to progressively clear backlog of
audit objections through holding of fortnightly DAC meetings.

4.                            The third reform pillar dealt directly with hard core educational reforms with
the objectives of: a) improving equitable access to education; b) improving teacher management;
c) improving education sector management; d) strengthening monitoring & evaluation in order to
gauge education outcomes and take mid-course corrective measures; d) enhancing stakeholders'
participation in delivery of schooling services; e) ensuring provision of quality education through
improved teaching and materials, and f) expanding access to education through innovative public
private partnerships. To achieve the said objectives, nine major interventions were planned for
PESRP Phase I namely: a) provision of missing facilities in schools; b) provision of free
textbooks; c) distribution of stipend amongst elementary level girl students of fifteen low literacy
districts; d) recruitment of better qualified teachers in facility based contract mode; e) teachers
training; f) re-activation of school councils; g) re-structuring of Punjab Education Foundation; h)
launching a focussed awareness campaign to convince parents to send their children to school;
and i) establishment of a robust monitoring & evaluation system for informed decision making
built on authentic time series data. A Programme Monitoring & Implementation Unit (PMIU) was
also established to steer the programme components, and was staffed with adequate skill mix
from both the public and private sectors. PMIU was also tasked to provide secretarial support to
the PESRP Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary, which reported directly to the
Chief Minister. Such high level political ownership and close supervision of programme activities
contributed a lot in Programme's success.

5.                            One of the prime achievements of PESRP Phase I is the creation of biannually
updated, highly authentic2, databases of all public sector schools and the teaching staff posted
therein. It is fairly understood that only reliable data forms the basis and essence of any credible
planning exercise, and PMIU's datasets, refined to the level of decision support systems, assisted


1The performance of districts was measured on four grounds: a) increase in their own educational budgets b) increase
in student enrolment c) reduction in drop out, and d) releasing annual grants to school councils.
2Independent Third Party Validation (TPV) of October 2004 Annual School Census under PMIU by M/s Fergusson (a
subsidiary of Price Waterhouse Coopers) showed a data error of just 1.07% out of a sample of 3237 schools.



                                                                                                                   45

a lot in designing, implementing and refining of educational reforms. In the three years of Phase
I, missing facilities were provided in around 32,000 government schools in a phased manner at a
cost of Rs. 13 billion, and the government has decided to continue budgetary support in this
regard. Free textbooks provision has been taking place annually under a well orchestrated
transportation and delivery system with the involvement of Punjab Textbook Board and the
district governments since 2004. In the first year, 6.5 million students from Katchi upto Grade V
were provided free textbooks3 whereas in 2006, 11 million students were provided such books
uptill Grade X4. Stipend distribution through quarterly money order delivery at the recipient's
doorstep5, contingent upon her achieving 80% or more attendance, fetched a lot of premium. The
eligible population for such conditional cash transfer at the start of activity was 175,000 that
soared to 279,920 (up by 59.9%) by the end of Phase I. Keeping in view the positive outcome, the
government decided vertical extension of the activity to provide stipend to girl students upto
Grade X, benefiting an additional 107,350 students. Such major influx of girl students into
schools resulted in concomitant increase in boys enrolment, in the same districts, by 29%6. At the
start of PESRP, there was a significant gap in teachers' provision in schools, and many positions
were lying vacant. Analysis revealed two major issues afflicting teachers' recruitment and posting
regime. Firstly, quality of teachers and malpractices in recruitment processes, and secondly their
unwillingness to serve in remoter areas. To plug the gaps, the government decided to enhance
qualification eligibility criteria of teachers to graduation level, fixed weightage of educational
testimonials and interview at 80% and 5% respectively to curtail favouritism, and offered
appointment in school specific facility based contract mode alone. It resulted in the recruitment of
around 50,000 better qualified teachers with improved retention rates at places of posting. The
above noted measures have assisted in bridging the huge access gap to a large extent. Enrolment
in public schools from Katchi to Grade X increased from 8.8 million in 2003 to 10.6 million in
20057 with females making up 53% of total increase. The overall female enrolment ratio in public
schools improved from 43.1% in 2003-04 to 44.9% in 2005-068.

6.                      Improving the quality of education in a sick public sector was a gigantic task
and expecting a quantum jump in that direction, in a short period of three years, was un-realistic.
The government was, however, cognizant of adopting a policy line that could address the issue in
due course of time. Teacher's content knowledge as well as pedagogical skills play an important
role in improving educational outcomes. Teacher training as an ongoing process was considered
essential in order to enhance these competencies in teachers. Under PESRP, Directorate of Staff
Development (DSD) was re-vitalized and supported to firm up a feasible teacher training model
that was based on international best practices and had a holistic view of teachers' requirements.
The DSD developed a Continuous Professional Developmental (CPD) Framework with the
assistance of leading teachers training institutions. The finally approved cluster based training
model for the province now looks at both teachers' pedagogical skills and mentoring
requirements. Though no mass teacher training activity could be conducted during PESRP Phase
I yet the work done by DSD during that period has laid the foundation for better outcomes under
Phase II. Textbooks are another important factor that impinges on quality. During PESRP Phase I,
textbook reforms were undertaken with a view to gradually open up textbook development,
printing and publication, and awarding work through competitive bidding process. The policy is
expected to yield better results once textbooks of all subjects would be re-written under the
revised curriculum during PESRP Phase II. The importance of assessment and evaluation cannot
be over emphasized in any discussion on quality. In Punjab, there was no credible system of
evaluating students' learning achievements short of matriculation examination. Grade V and VIII
exams conducted by the district education departments were not only poorly managed but also
poorly designed. Being heterogeneous, these could not be used as the basis of any comparative
analysis across the province. Taking stock of the situation, the government established an
independent Punjab Examination Commission (PEC) to design modern and forward looking
students' examination system where test items were compliant to internationally recognized
examination taxonomies. PEC conducted Grade V examination in 2006 in which 1.3 million
students appeared from 53,566 public and 30,416 private schools. The examination results were
not only digitized but also analyzed by PEC & PMIU to identify deficiencies in educational
inputs affecting learning outcomes. In 2007, PEC shall undertake examination of both Grade V
and VIII under an improved implementing and monitoring regime. The above noted steps
alongwith recruitment of better qualified teachers was the government's initial response towards
improving educational delivery and quality. Government of the Punjab considers the
aforementioned steps as necessary but not sufficient conditions for improving the quality of
education. In Phase II of PESRP, a much more holistic framework will be adopted that would
include school and class room focus among other elements of quality.




                                                                                                   47

7.                Governance of social service delivery in large public sector has always been a
tough job. As stated earlier, the managerial capacity was weak and monitoring ability was almost
non-existent in 2003. It was decided that, under PESRP, administrative reforms would be brought
in both the provincial and district education departments with a view to build up managerial
capacity and efficiency. At the provincial level, Planning Wings of School and College sides were
merged and computer hardware was provided in all offices, which were later on linked up
through networking. PMIU's datasets were also made available to the two Wings of Education
Department for informed and quality decision making. For capacity building of district
educational managers, an elaborate PC-I was prepared that took care of managerial, logistical and
technical requirements of the offices of EDOs down to AEO level. During PESRP Phase II, all
such officers would be provided with transport to bolster their schools monitoring ability,
laptop/desktop computers for promoting their analytical and report writing skills and extensive
modular training in management, leading to certification, at a premier degree awarding institution.
The district education management tiers would be re-structured on functional lines such as
District Education Officers (Monitoring & Human Resource Management), (Finance & Planning)
(Students' Assessment and Teachers Training) as soon as trained and certified professionals are
made available through aforesaid trainings. School Councils are acknowledged by the
government as an instrument of ensuring stakeholders participation in important task of
educational delivery. In that spirit, the government, through a notification in December 2003,
made it mandatory that in all school councils parents participation would be more than 50%.
Furthermore, school councils were empowered to undertake schemes, including minor civil
works, upto Rs. 400,000 in a year. To allay the fears of teachers regarding audit by AG Punjab,
schools councils' expenditures were taken out of the purview of Punjab Financial Rules. A pilot
project for capacity building of 2400 school councils in six districts is currently underway, and its
impact evaluation would be undertaken in 2007 for drawing lessons for replication.

8.                The establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system under PMIU
may be termed as the hallmark of PESRP Phase I. Starting from the creation of an annual schools
database in 2003, it has now acquired the capacity to collect, collate and statistically analyze
information regarding every public school of the province each month. The monitoring reports
are fed into a Composite Performance Index of district schooling whereby districts' performance
against various indicators as teachers' presence rate, students' enrolment attendance gap, schools'
cleanliness, provision of free textbooks and stipends etc are generated, and shared with district
educational authorities for remedial actions. The district level monitoring set up under the District
Monitoring Officers (DMOs) has been strengthened by inducting 929 Monitoring & Evaluation
Assistants (MEAs) whose prime job is to inspect schools. Furthermore, district EMIS Cells have
also been attached with DMOs, and data entry functions are being performed at the district level.
PMIU conducts regular refresher courses of IT related district staff and provides indigenously
developed softwares for most optimum utilization of acquired information.

9.                The government acknowledges private sector as an important partner in the
promotion of education in the province. It is now catering to around 35% of total enrolment load
through 36,842 private schools of Punjab9. To facilitate private schooling, a public sector
organization named `Punjab Education Foundation' (PEF) had been in existence since 1991 but
the desired outcomes were not being achieved. Under PESRP, it was re-structured and a new PEF
Act was enacted by the legislature in 2004. Resultantly, PEF was made autonomous, with
reduced public sector participation in its Board of Directors, to design and implement support
interventions for low-cost private sector. One such intervention was to launch a scheme of

                                                                                                  48

Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS) whereby students' tuition fee was picked up by PEF in
selected schools, and the schools were required to maintain a specific level of students' learning
achievement. The intervention has been welcomed by the private sector, and the demand for its
province-wide roll out is on the rise. PEF is also piloting Education Voucher Scheme in peri-
urban areas to enhance households' options in school selection. Training of private school
teachers has also been initiated under PEF. Under PESRP Phase II, the government intends to
explore the option of supplementing PEF's efforts to address access and quality issues. It is
expected that such public financing of private schooling will address the challenge of bringing in
out of schools children.

10.               The overall analysis of PESRP Phase I interventions reveals that it was largely
successful in meeting the desired objectives. Quantum jumps were witnessed in addressing the
access issues, a road map was laid out for improving quality of education, a holistic view was
taken to address governance issues and a vibrant monitoring & evaluation system was established
that is now being replicated in other sectors and provinces. Fiscal reforms and effort to improve
fiduciary environment also proved sustainable.

11.               Punjab Government's experience with Development Policy Credits (DPCs) has
been highly successful. The assured fiscal support to the Provincial Government strengthened its
resolve to commit further resources towards education. The DPC design, involving oft-repeated
consultative dialogue between the stakeholders i.e., Punjab Government, Federal Government and
World Bank, helped a lot in keeping the Programme on track through regular deliberations for
mid-course corrections. The idea behind adopting the sector-wide approach was also to get wiser
through experience and avoid any cross-cutting reforms or duplication of efforts. The
evolutionary character of PESRP has enabled the government to develop better linkages of school
education with pre-primary and college education. Another important aspect of Programme
design was agreed timelines, triggers and indicators between the government and the Bank. The
matrix approach of agreed and proposed actions over a series of years proved highly successful in
maintaining reform direction.

12.               The Bank's team associated with PESRP brought in a lot of technical and
professional experience that helped in developing a synergistic relationship with the Punjab
Government's team. Timely assistance of the Bank at critical junctures helped to thwart off risks
attached with Programme implementation.

13.               The Punjab Government realizes that a lot still needs to be done in the education
sector. Despite major gains in enrolment, a significant school age population is still out of school
and the state of regional, gender and social class equity is far from perfect. Primary completion
rates are still short of expectations and drop out phenomenon is more pronounced at Katchi to I
and Grade IV to V transition stages. Potential of a vibrant private sector is yet to be properly
tapped. Stakeholders' participation in schooling requires further strengthening. Credibility of
evaluation and assessment systems at higher secondary, secondary and lower levels needs to be
established. Teacher training and improvement in learning environment require a lot to be done.
Enhancement of market oriented subjects choices at higher education level needs to be looked
into. Exit ramps to and from technical education need to be strengthened. Dream of an inclusive
education culture needs to be realized. Last but not the least, quality of education requires special
focus. With better institutional arrangements in place, it is hoped that Phase II of PESRP will
witness a significant improvement in this regard.

14.               The educational agenda is an unfinished one. Items continue to be added but
hardly deleted. The government is resolute to take up the agenda with commitment and



                                                                                                  49

improve educational environment in the province. The initial gains during PESRP Phase I
have laid the foundation of a better tomorrow and enhanced the morale and spirit of the common
man. We are confident that with continued support of our development partners, PESRP Phase II
would yield even better results.
