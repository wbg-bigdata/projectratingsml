3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:



The project aimed to check further deterioration of the state road networks in Maranhao, Piaui, and Tocantins and
improve their serviceability. To this effect, it would specifically: (a) ensure adequate priority and funding for the
maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading components of the state road programs; (b) implement appropriate road
maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading strategies and programs and improve the management of maintenance
activities; and (c) develop and improve compliance with environmental standards for state roads. The project was
also expected to help establish an institutional and technical framework for maintenance and upgrading of state
roads nationwide. The ultimate objective was to contribute to the resumption of economic growth by reducing the
cost of road transport on the state highway networks.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives and description were not revised during implementation, but two of the three loans
(Maranhao and Piaui) were amended in 1995 (see section 3.4).
3.3 Original Components:
Originally the project consisted of three similar subprojects in the borrower states, each supported by a separate
Bank loan. Each subproject included the following components: (A) a policy and institutional development
program to: (a) prepare and annually update the state's pluriannual and annual road expenditure and funding
programs, in accordance with policies and economic criteria satisfactory to the Bank, thereby strengthening the
state road agency's planning system; (b) develop and monitor efficient maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading
strategies and programs, and strengthen the agency's contract and project management systems; and (c) develop
appropriate capability in the Government to implement and enforce environmental standards and guidelines for
state roads; and (B) a rehabilitation and maintenance program consisting of rehabilitation, resurfacing and
periodic and routine maintenance components of the State's 1994-98 road program; and (C) an upgrading
program consisting of the highest-priority upgrading and paving components of the State's 1994-98 road
program. The three subprojects combined would have a total scope of 1,500 km for rehabilitation and resurfacing,
18,500 km for periodic and routine maintenance, and 2,650 km for upgrading and paving.
The original total cost of the project was estimated at about US$602.8 million equivalent, including US$563.4
million for road works, US$2.3 million for laboratory and office equipment and software, and US$37.1 million
equivalent for engineering, technical assistance and staff training. The costs of the individual subprojects were as
follows: Maranhao, US$209.5 million; Piaui US$140.9 million; and Tocantins, US$252.4 million. The project
would be financed from the proposed three Bank loans totaling US$220 million (or 36% of the project cost) and
from the respective State's own resources for US$382.8 million (or 64% of the project cost). The three loans
would help finance road rehabilitation, resurfacing, and upgrading works, engineering, technical assistance and
training of staff. Routine and periodic maintenance would be fully funded from state resources.
3.4 Revised Components:
In November 1995, the Bank agreed to revise the scope of the physical components of the two subprojects in
Maranhao and Piaui, and to amend the two loans accordingly. This decision was taken after it became clear that,
as a result of Brazil's "Plano Real" stabilization program, the two states no longer had the financial capacity to
carry out their subprojects in accordance with the agreed implementation targets. The amendments involved: (a) a
reduction of the scope of the two subprojects, reducing the road upgrading and rehabilitation investment targets but
maintaining the maintenance targets; (b) an increase of the disbursement percentages for civil works from 50% to
75%, and for consultants and training from 50% to 100% of local expenditures; (c) the cancellation of an amount
of US$18 million equivalent from each loan (originally US$79 million for Maranhao and US$54 million for
Piaui); and (d) action programs with specified benchmarks and remedies, to be completed before the mid-term
review of the project scheduled for the end of 1996.
The targets for rehabilitation and upgrading were reduced as follows: in Maranhao the upgrading and paving
component was reduced from 750 km to 605 km and the targets for rehabilitation remained unchanged at 650 km;
- 2 -



in Piaui, the target for rehabilitation was reduced from 600 km to 53 5 km and the target for paving was reduced
from 900 km to 350 km. As a result, the estimated costs of the two subprojects decreased as follows: Maranhao
from US$209.5 million to US$123.2, and Piaui from US$140.9 million to US$72.2 million. The loan amounts
were reduced from US$79 million to US$61 million in Maranhao, and from US$54 million to US$36 million in
Piaui. No significant adjustments were made to the other performance indicators and targets. The implementation
schedule was extended for six months, albeit without changing the original closing date.
The State of Tocantins, with the concurrence of the Federal Government, negotiated a loan of US$48 million
equivalent with the Export-Import Bank of Japan in 1996, in order to help finance the remaining part of the
subproject and to alleviate counterpart fund requirements. Although the Tocantins subproject was not formally
revised, the JEXIM loan, which was signed in March 1997, enabled the state to undertake additional upgrading
works and to exceed the negotiated target of 1,000 km by about 20%. The resulting project outputs are shown in
section 4.2.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry of the project has been given a satisfactory rating because the project objective was in line with
the government priority to implement a broad administrative decentralization in the road sector and to promote
greater participation of the states in the management of the highway system. Consistent with the decentralization
objective, the project as designed would help prepare the three states to accept and carry out the transfer of
operation and maintenance responsibilities of a portion of the federal network, and assist them in the
implementation of their own road maintenance and rehabilitation mandates, using adequate policies and planning
tools. Even though the risk of insufficient provision of budgetary resources by the states was indeed recognized at
appraisal, it is only after the implementation of the stabilization program that it became clear that the states of
Maranhao and Piaui would not be able to provide all the necessary funds.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The main objective of the project, which was to check further deterioration of the states' road networks and
improve their serviceability, was achieved. At completion, nearly one third of the paved networks in the three
states had been rehabilitated or resurfaced. In addition, about 15% of the unpaved networks have been upgraded
and paved. These achievements combined with the efforts made by the States on routine maintenance, helped to
significantly improve the condition of the states' highway networks. The overall proportion of paved roads in poor
condition at appraisal in 1993 was in the order of 31% (1,250 km over a total of 3,970 khi). With the project, the
proportion of roads in poor condition, i.e. with a roughness above 5 IRI, fell to about 13% at mid-term (1995-96)
and ultimately to about 10% at completion (778 km over a new total of about 7,600 km of paved roads). In
parallel, the proportion of roads in good to excellent condition increased from 29% in 1993 to 47% in 1996, and to
62% in 1999. Likewise, the condition of the unpaved networks was substantially improved: at appraisal, 80% of
that network showed a roughness of less than about 12 to 15 IRI. At closing, 80% of the unpaved networks showed
much improved conditions with a roughness of less than 8 to 9 IRI.
The ultimate objective of the project, which was to contribute to the resumption of economic growth by reducing
the cost of transport on the state road networks, also seems to have been achieved. No indicators were defined to
monitor and evaluate such impact. But reports indicate that the potential for agricultural expansion in the three
states, particularly southern Maranhao, southeastern Piaui, and Tocantins, which was identified in the SAR
(Annex 2) substantially materialized as a result of the road improvements made under the project. There has been
large private investments in these areas. The production of soybeans, corn and rice increased rapidly. The
expansion of agriculture also seems to have induced a rapid growth of the service sector in the region.
4.2 Outputs by components:
a. Policy and Institutional Development Component.
- 3 -



The three state governments and their highway agencies have achieved several important institutional objectives:
*   the highway agencies have developed and implemented efficient pavement management systems supported by
road databases on network condition and traffic, and have developed optimized highway expenditure
programs using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM);
*   the highway agencies have established improved computerized systems for contract management, project
accounting and monitoring, and, in the case of Piaui, an entire computer network with various administrative
applications and management information systems, and trained their staff to operate these systems;
*   the routine maintenance activities have been contracted out on the entire network in the State of Maranhao
from 1996-1998, but a broad reorganization of the entire administration of the state disrupted the program in
early 1999. In Piaui and Tocantins, the agencies have been outsourcing some services, but overall there is still
much room for improvement in the way maintenance activities are carried out, with a greater participation of
the private sector, possibly through long-term performance-based contracts;
o   the three highway agencies have developed and are implementing satisfactory environmental standards and
guidelines for state roads, which have been prepared and disseminated with technical assistance and training
services financed under the project; in particular, the Secretariat of Infrastructure in Tocantins has built an
environmental division with four experienced specialists who effectively manage the environmental aspects of
all the state's infrastructure programs;
*   in Tocantins, the Planning and Environment Secretariat has, under the project, strengthened its Environment
Division and its State Environmental Agency (Naturatins), and prepared an atlas and an agro-ecological
zoning of the state which are now used as a basis for the preparation of the govermnent plans and programs,
and for environmental monitoring. In Maranhao, the state environmental agency was strengthened to carry out
a socio-economic evaluation and land use mapping of the southern region of the state, and to prepare for
regular monitoring of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of this and other projects. Also,
environmental protection areas have been established under the project in Piaui and Tocantins.
*   the government of Tocantins established the state highway department DERTINS as a separate agency within
the jurisdiction of the Infrastructure Secretariat in order to allow for increased management autonomy and
operational efficiency in maintaining the road network;
*   the staff of the road agencies in all three states has been downsized through voluntary separation programs
below the agreed targets: 1,347 permanent staff are presently employed versus an agreed target of 2,150 in the
three agencies; and
*   training programs have been implemented in the three states to support the above institutional objectives, but
the training targets were only partially met, by approximately 65%.
b. Rehabilitation and Maintenance Component.
The appraisal targets were to rehabilitate or resurface about 1,550 km of paved roads, and to maintain the paved
and unpaved networks in the three states. The rehabilitation and resurfacing targets were slightly reduced to 1,485
km in aggregate as a result of the restructuring of the subprojects in Piaui and Maranhao, but the routine
maintenance targets remained unchanged. At completion, a total of about 1,443 km of paved sections had been
rehabilitated or resurfaced, representing 93% of the appraisal target. The following table also shows these results
by state. The routine maintenance targets have, by and large, been met or exceeded. Annex 1 shows the results by
state for each indicator.

c. Upgrading Component.
The appraisal targets were to upgrade or pave a total of about 2,650 km of gravel or earth sections in the three
states. The upgrading and paving targets were substantially reduced in Piaui and, to a lesser extent in Maranhao as
part of the project restructuring in these two states; the revised aggregated target was 1,955 km. At completion, a
total of about 2,018 km of earth or gravel roads were upgraded or paved, which represents about 76% of appraisal
target and 103% of the revised target. The following table shows these results by state.

Since the project objective and main outputs have been substantially achieved, the project outcome is rated as
satisfactory
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic analysis carried out at appraisal on a sample of 1,165 km of roads (28% of the total length to be
rehabilitated and upgraded), indicated that the rehabilitation and paving components of the project (representing
56% of total base cost) had an estimated overall Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of 30% and-an estimated
Net Present Value (NPV) of US$146 million. Ex-post analyses were performed on the same sample of subprojects
following the appraisal methodology based on the HDM3 Model (Annex 14 of SAR). The ex-post IERR was
estimated at 43% and the ex-post NPV at about US$ 117 million equivalent. The ex-post economic return of the
project is therefore very satisfactory.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not Applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The establishment of pavement management systems, including the use of the HDM model for analysing
expenditure programs under budget constraints, and the joint reviews of the state highway expenditure programs,
have substantially strengthened the state highway agencies' capacity to prepare and monitor efficient programs on
the basis of technical and economic rather than political criteria, and to obtain improved funding for maintenance.
The project had directly contributed to the contracting out of the maintenance of the entire road network in
- 5 -



Maranhao, resulting, together with the rehabilitation and resurfacing component, into a very satisfactory condition
of the network. Although the contract maintenance program has been disrupted with the above-mentioned
reorganization of the state administration and the termination of the DER, it is expected that the program will be
restarted in the near future. The project contributed to improving various management and administrative systems
in the three highway agencies, and in particular in Piaui where an entire computer network and various technical
and administrative systems were established and had a clear impact on staff motivation and effectiveness. The
project was instrumental in developing and implementing appropriate environmental safeguards under the state
road programs, and more broadly in developing effective environmental planning and monitoring instruments,
such as the agro-ecological zoning of the entire state of Tocantins and the strengthening of the state environmental
agencies. By providing training opportunities which were generally not available, the project also contributed to
the development and motivation of the staff of the states' highway and environmental agencies. For these reasons,
the institutional impact of the project has been rated as substantial.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The following two factors outside the control of the state governments adversely affected the implementation of the
project:
*   the implementation in 1994 of Brazil's new stabilization program called the "Plano Real"seriously affected the
states' finances, in particular by preventing state governments from taking advantage of inflation to balance
their accounts. This situation led to the restructuring of the project in the two states of Piaui and Maranhao, as
previously indicated.
3   the existing conflicts between Brazil's procurement law and the Bank's procurement and consultant guidelines
led to numerous questions on the part of state administrations and their auditors such as Tribunal de Contas,
which resulted in implementation delays in the early phases of the project. However, in the end all accepted
the view that the Brazilian law authorizes the executing agencies of Bank-financed projects to follow the
Bank's guidelines.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The provision by the governments of Maranhao and Piaui of counterpart funds to the project has not been
timely, and this has affected project performance throughout the implementation period, albeit to a lesser
degree in Maranhao after the restructuring of the project.
The broad reorganization of the entire administration of the state in January 1999 negatively affected the project
outcome in Maranhao. As part of the reorganization, the state highway agency was eliminated. Its central
functions and staff were transferred to a newly created Infrastructure Secretariat (GEINFRA), and its decentralized
district functions and staff transferred to 18 newly-created Regional Secretariats. The project coordinator was
changed and little transition occurred with the previous coordinator. As a result, the project was practically stalled
for one year, until closing in December 1999. The maintenance contracts were not renewed, and the network
surveys were not contracted as scheduled.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The disappointing performance of some of the consulting firms or agencies contracted to assist the states' highway
agencies also affected both implementation performance and outcome. The development of pavement management
systems and the preparation of pluriannual road expenditure programs were delayed as a result of the consultants'
inability to propose adequate systems adapted to the needs and capabilities of these highway administrations. Their
implementation was affected by the DERs' lack of involvement in the development process and failure to provide
full-time competent counterpart staff. The transfer of knowledge and technology from the technical assistance
- 6 -



team was, at times, below expectations, and there was room for improvement in the use of consultants. The
geoprocessing work, land use mapping, and socio-economic analysis of the southern region of Maranhao, which
were to be carried out by the State University of Maranhao, was subsequently contracted to private consultants
since the University has been unable to deliver most agreed products.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The actual/latest total cost of the project is US$510.9 million equivalent, which is 15% below the appraisal
estimate of US$602.8 million equivalent. The difference is essentially due to the restructuring of the project. The
actual cost is also 14% higher than the revised cost of US$447.8 million estimated at project restructuring, but this
revised estimate did not take into account the increased scope of the Tocantins subproject which was made possible
through cofinancing from JEXIM, nor the last section of BR-230 in Maranhao, which was to be partly funded from
Federal transfers. The Bank loans contributed to 83% of the appraisal estimate, while the Government contributed
to 74%. Project cost details are given in Annexes 2a (Project Costs by Component), 2b (Project Costs by
Procurement Arrangements) and 2c (Project Financing by Component).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated likely overall. However, while it is likely in Tocantins and Piaui, it is uncertain in
Maranhao. In Tocantins, the planning, management and particularly the environmental management capacities
developed under the project have been firmly established within the state administration, which, because of the
recent creation of the state, is formed by a majority of young, fast-learning professionals. Also, a follow-up rural
infrastructure project is being prepared, which, if approved by the Bank, would contribute to the sustainability of
the completed project. In Piaui, although the state administration's planning and management capacities are very
weak overall, the new planning tools, the computerized management and administrative systems, the technical
standards and the environmental norms introduced by the project have clearly renewed the highway administration
and motivated the staff. The priority given to maintenance and rehabilitation over new construction now has broad
support from decision makers. In Maranhao, many of the institutional achievements of the project seem, at this
time, to have been lost with the administrative reorganization initiated in early 1999 and the termination of the
highway agency. However, the rehabilitation and contract maintenance components of the projects, which have
been very successful in improving the condition of the entire road network, have had a broad demonstration effect
which is expected to lead to a resumption of the policies and programs advocated by the project in the near future.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
In order to ensure the sustainability of the projects' investments and institutional achievements, several actions or
transition arrangements to regular operations are needed:
1. necessary funds must be transferred in a timely manner to the highway agencies for the maintenance and
rehabilitation of the states' road networks, which must be given priority over new construction projects;
2. adequate design and maintenance standards and methodology should continue to be used to prepare
economically sound road expenditure programs based on updated road network condition and traffic surveys
and appropriate technico- economic analyses using the HDM or similar models;
3. procurement of works must be based on transparent and competitive bidding;
4. adequate staff training and development programs should continue to be provided to highway agency staff;
5. the maintenance of the road network should increasingly be contracted out, preferably through
performance-based contracts, and the network condition should be regularly monitored; and
6. the environmental and socio-economic impacts of the project should be regularly monitored on the basis of the
- 7 -



criteria and methodologies developed under the project.
The project can be monitored and evaluated in the future using the performance indicators shown in Annex I
and the monitoring systems in place in the three states.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification , preparation and appraisal was
satisfactory on the whole. Its involvement in the project was consistent with the
government's strategy on decentralization and supportive of the country objective to
resume economic growth, including the provision of efficient and reliable transport
services to targeted sectors of the economy as well as the promotion of the private sector
operations in transport. The appraisal team had a good skill mix of a highway
engineer, a transport economist, an environmental specialist and an organizational
consultant. Project design was simple and consistent with the agencies' implementation
capacity overall. Risks were adequately recognized and performance indicators
appropriately defined.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory, albeit with some shortcomings.
On average, the project was supervised twice a year and implementation progress and
ratings adequately reported. On recognizing the state's financial difficulties in 1994-95,
the Bank approved the needed restructuring of the project and this was instrumental in
bringing about the successful achievement of project objectives. In order to strengthen
its supervision of the highway projects and its support to executing agencies, the Bank
hired a full-time Transport Operations Officer in the Brasilia office. However, field
supervision efforts have sometimes been insufficient to ensure an effective control of the
quality of the designs and works, particularly in Piaui where the highway agency needed
effective technical support.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Fully committed to the project objectives, the Borrowers participated actively in the
preparation of the project. Government staff prepared all the technical and financial
aspects of the project, while economic, environmental and institutional aspects were
discussed and defined in close participation with the Bank.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory overall. All three state
administrations were committed to the project and assigned experienced managers to
coordinate its implementation. Less satisfactory was the provision of counterpart funds,
particularly in Piaui where the fiscal situation was the most difficult.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Implementing agencies' performance was satisfactory. However, in all three states the
technical assistance could have had better results if more experienced counterpart staff
- 8 -



had been assigned to work full time with the consultants.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrowers was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
1. This project has shown that the implementation of an optimized network rehabilitation and maintenance
strategy can effectively bring an entire road network back into satisfactory condition over a period of a few
years and at a reasonable cost;
2. For networks or portions of networks with low traffic, as was the case in all three states, surface condition
targets could be set lower i.e. with roughness thresholds above 5 , possibly up to 6 or 7 IRI;
3. With modern geo-processing and imaging techniques, a comprehensive atlas and geographic information
system to effectively support environmental and land management at the level of an entire state of the size of
Tocantins can be created in about one year at a very reasonable cost (about R$1.0 million);
4. The results of the technical assistance components depend more on the technical experience and inter-personal
skills of the specialists assigned to the specific tasks than on the experience records of the contracted
consulting firms, which are at times deficient in controlling the quality of their services;
5. Proactive supervision and restructuring of the project as soon as critical assumptions have changed (in this
case the funding capacities of the states following the establishment of Brazirs stabilization program) are
essential to achieve the development objective;
6. The increase of the Bank's share for civil works from 50% to 75% drastically improved the attractiveness of
the loans. The Bank could consider offering better cost-sharing arrangements, particularly in the poorest
states of Brazil;
7. The grouping of two or more similar subprojects under one "umbrella" project can lead to some savings at the
project processing stage. But since there are few economies of scale in supervision, each subproject should be
adequately funded to allow for effective supervision, including field visits of the works;
8. Since the grouping of such projects into one project also renders the preparation of PSRs and ICRs difficult
and their average ratings somewhat meaningless, each subproject should preferably be treated as a separate
project.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments from the Piaui State Highway Department
The principal objective of the project was to provide, during the 1994-1999 period, the necessary technical and
financial support to reduce the deterioration of the state highway network and at the same time, to improve the
road network condition. This would also contribute to the development of the state economy through a reduction
in transport costs on the state highway network. Another program objective was to assist in the consolidation of
the State of Piaui's institutional and technical structures with regard to the maintenance, rehabilitation and
improvement of the road network. Another valuable contribution of the program was to raise the consciousness
regarding the need to integrate envirommental concems during project design and execution of highway works.
The project showed that the implementation of a highway network maintenance and rehabilitation strategy could
effectively return a network to satisfactory condition in a period of a few years and at a reasonable cost.
One of the problems that most affected the execution of the civil works between 1994 and 1999 was the
-9-



unavailability of counterpart funds.
At the end of 1995 it was established that the state of Piaui did not have the financial capacity to execute the
project, due to the implementation in 1994 of the new economic stabilization plan "Plano Real". Because the Bank
agreed to reformulate the project, reducing the need for counterpart funds, the reformulation had a positive as well
as a substantial impact on the achievement of the project results and objectives.
Facing the difficult financial situation, but aiming to assure the sustainability of the program, the state took steps to
balance the budget through various mechanisms such as: reduction of high salaries, reduction of operational
expenses and centralized control of capital expenses, reduction of the state bureaucracy, support for fiscal reform,
rescheduling of the debt together with other Northeastern states, and the decision to raise the percentage of the
ICMS tax for fuels and lubricants from 17% to 25%, through the State Law No. 4892 enacted on December 5,
1996. With these and other actions managed by a new economic team (formed in January 2000), the state
managed to comply with the commitment undertaken during the last Bank mission, where the government was
committed to settle all arrears until the end of April.
These factors associated with the intensification of highway maintenance by the private sector, under maintenance
contract, will contribute to ensure that the current performance level of the state in this area will be maintained
during the next period. DER/PI is giving continuity to outsourcing the execution of routine maintenance services
for the state highways.
The knowledge obtained by the technicians of DER-PI during the elaboration of studies, tasks, works and services
realized in the context of the program, contributed towards DER-PI's improved organization to perform its
functions. In addition, DER has given continuity to improving the capacity of its technical staff, and their
efficiency in managing their work. For example, DER is currently financing the participation of a technical staff
in an Environmental Sciences post graduate course for 10 months at the Federal University of Piaui.
In this context and taking into account that adequate models and pavement standards, such as HDM, should
continue to be used to prepare and prioritize economically highway programs and expenditures based on the
condition of the highway network and traffic, DER-PI recently sponsored the participation of two technical staff in
the latest version of the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model - HDM-4 seminar promoted by DNER
with support from the World Bank.
Despite the deficiencies, the program achieved the majority of its objectives and can be classified as satisfactory to
DER-PI.
Due to the importance to the state of the Highway Development Program - PRODER I now concluded, and
considering that there are still bottlenecks in the transport infrastructure, the government of the state of Piaui,
through DER, intends to begin a second prograrn. DER-PI understands that the continuation of a financed project
would guarantee and consolidate the benefits from this project, as well as increase the probability of sustainability.

O principal objetivo do Programa PRODER/BIRD foi fomecer ao Estado Piaui, durante o periodo de 1994 a 1999,
o suporte tecnico e fmanceiro necessario para verificar e reduzir a evolucao da deterioracao da rede rodoviaria
estadual e assim, melhorar as condic6es de sua utilizacao, contribuindo desta forma para incrementar o
desenvolvimento econ6mico do Estado, atravds da reducao do custo de transporte na rede rodoviaria estadual. 0
programa teve como alvo contribuir para consolidar as estruturas institucionais e tecnicas do Estado do Piaui
voltadas para a manutencao, reabilitacao e melhoramento de rodovias. Outra contribuicao valiosa do Programa foi
brotar a plena consciencia da crescente necessidade de preservacao e integra9ao da rodovia com o meio ambiente,
quando da elaboracao de projetos e execuca de obras rodoviarias.
O projeto mostrou que a implementacao de uma estrategia de manuten9co e reabilitacao da rede rodoviaria
pode efetivamente trazer de volta uma rede de rodovias em condic6es satisfat6rias em um periodo de poucos anos a
- 1 0 -



um custo razoavel.
Um dos problemas que mais afetaratn a execu,co das obras civis entre 1994 e 1999, foi efetivamente a
indisponibilidade do aprovisionamento de fundos de contrapartida.
Diante desta constata,co, no final de 1995, que o Estado do Piaui nao teria capacidade financeira para executar
seu projeto, devido a implementa,cao em 1994 de un novo plano de estabilizacao dentro do Plano Real, o
Banco concordou em reformular o projeto a fim de reduzir as necessidades de fundos de contrapartida, e dessa
maneira teve um positivo e substancial impacto na realizacao dos resultados e objetivos do projeto.
Diante da dificil situacao financeira mas com o objetivo de dar sustentabilidade ao programa, o Estado emanou
esforcos para equilibrar as receitas atraves de varias medidas, tais como: reducao de altos salArios, conten,co de
despesas operacionais e controle centralizado de despesas de capital, reducao do uncionalismo estadual, apoio a
reforma fiscal, reescalonamento da divida juntamente com outros estados do Nordeste, bem como, com a decisao
de elevar o percentual do imposto ICM sobre combustiveis e lubrificantes de 17% para 25%, atravds da Lei
Estadual n° 4892 de 05 de dezembro de 1996. Isto posto, somando-se as acoes gerenciadas por uma nova equipe
econ6mica de govemo (composta em jan/2000), o Estado conseguiu cumprir o compromisso assumido durante a
ultimna Missao do Banco, na qual o governo se comprometia a saldar todas as dividas ate o final de abril.
Esses fatores associados com a intensificacao da manutenao rodoviaria atraves do setor privado, por
contrato de manutencao, contribuirao para que o atual nivel de performance do Estado, nesta area, possa ser
assegurado para o pr6ximo periodo. 0 DER/PI esta dando continuidade a terceirizacao da execugcao dos servi9os
de manutencao rotineira das rodovias estaduais.
Os conhecimentos obtidos pelos tecnicos do DER-PI durante a elaboracao dos estudos, trabalhos, obras e
servicos realizados no contexto do Programa, contribuiram e contribuiram para que o DER/PI se tome um 6rgao
melhor estruturado, para o exercicio de suas funcoes. Consciente disto, o DER tem dado continuidade a
capacitacao de seus tecnicos, no sentido de melhorar a eficiencia de gerenciamento de seus trabalhos. Podemos
exemplificar essa preocupacao citando, que atualment esta fmanciando a participac§o de um tecnico do 6rgao no
Curso de Especializacio em Ciencias Ambientais, a nivel de p6s-graduagao, com 10 meses de durarao, ministrado
pela Universidade Federal do Piaui.
Neste contexto e tendo em vista que adequados modelos e padr6es de pavimento como os do HDM devem
continuar a ser usado para preparar e priorizar economicarnente prograrnas e despesas com rodovias aseados na
condicao da rede rodoviaria e contagem de trafego, o DER-PI, recentemente, patrocinou a articipacao de
dois tecnicos no Seminario sobre a ultima versao de Projeto e Manutencao de Rodovia Modelo HDM-4
promovido pelo DNER, com apoio do BIRD.
Apesar das deficiencias constatadas, o Programa atingiu a maior parte dos seus objetivos e pode ser classificado
como satisfat6rio para o DER-PI.
Devido a importancia para o Estado do Programna de Desenvolvimento Rodoviario PRODER 1, ora concluido, e
tendo em vista que persistem carencias em termos de infra-estrutura viaria e que o Govemo do Estado do Piaui,
atraves do DER, pretende viabilizar um segundo programa. 0 DER-PI, entende que com o prosseguimento do
projeto financiado, garantiria a consolida,cao dos beneficios deste projeto, bem como aumentaria a
probabilidade de sustentacao.
Comments from the Infrastructure Secretariat of the State of Tocantins
In response to your request regarding the Implementation Completion Report for Loan 3714-BR, between the State
of Tocantins and the Bank, we have the following cornments:
I) The report presents in a succinct and general form thevarious phases of the project, but this type of approach
makes it difficult to analyze each project in depth;
- 1 1-



2) The economic stabilization plan (Plano Real), as it is emphasized in the report, was a complicating factor for
the states, including the state of Tocantins. Still, the maintenance of the original appraisal targets for our Project,
including the fact that they were exceeded during execution, demonstrates that the Government of Tocantins
assigned a high priority to the Project and was always committed to its execution.
Following is the original Portuguese Text
Conforme solicita,ao feita atraves de e-mail datado de 05/23/2000 e fax de 05/06/2000, referente a
"Implementation Completion Report" sobre o fechamento do Contrato de Emprestimo n° 3714/BR,
firmado entre o BIRD e o Estado do Tocantins, temos os seguintes comentarios a fazer:
i ) 0 Relat6rio em referencia abordou de uma maneira geral e suscinta todas as fases da
implementa,co do Projeto, no entanto, este tipo de abordagem dificulta a analise pontual de cada
Projeto;
ii) Como bem colocado pelo Banco, realmente o plano de estabilizacao econ6mica ( Plano Real), foi um
fator complicante para os Estados, inclusive o Tocantins. Nao obstante a manuten,cao das metas do
"appraisal" para o nosso Projeto, inclusive a supera,co das mesmas quando da execu,co, demontra
que o Governo do Tocantins elegeu este Projeto como prioritario e esteve sempre comprometido com a
sua execu,ao.
