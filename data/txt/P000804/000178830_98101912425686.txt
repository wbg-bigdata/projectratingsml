THE GAMBIA
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geographic and Economic Factors Influencing Transport
1.01      The Gambia consists of a narrow, east-west strip of land some 30 to
50 km wide along the banks of the Gambia River. The country extends about
350 km inland from the Atlantic and is surrounled by Senegal. A population
of about 540,000 in an area of about 11,3002km  gives The Gambia the fourth
highest population density in Africa (48/km ). The population is growing
at about 2.8% p.a. and about 4.2% p.a. in the capital of Banjul. Economic
growth has been slow during the recent past, averaging about 2.6% p.a. in real
terms, nearly the same as the population growth rate. Consequently, gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita, about US$180 in 1976, has remained stagnant
over the past three years.
1.02      The economy is based mostly on traditional rural smallholder activ-
ities. Agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 70% of GDP and employ
about 90% of the active population. Agriculture is based on groundnuts, the
only cash crop. Groundnuts constitute about 90% of the total value of ex-
ports and are the basis of the country's major industrial activity, groundnut
oil milling. Economic activity in The Gambia reflects its structural weak-
ness, namely low productivity in the rural sector, wide seasonal fluctuation
in output and employment, and extreme vulnerability to variations in ground-
nut prices and production levels. The Government is trying to increase pro-
ductivity and to diversify the economy in order to reduce its dependence on
groundnuts. The cultivation of irrigated rice along the Gambia River, cotton
in the east, and vegetables around the urban areas has started. The Government
is also promoting tourism by providing infrastructure, participating in the
equity of some tourist hotels, and granting tax holidays.
1.03      Economic performance, however, continues to be dominated by the
performance of the groundnut sector. In FY1976, higher prices and yields
caused an upturn after the Sahel drought. In FY1977, lower groundnut prices
drove real GDP and exports down; this trend continued in FY1978 when groundnut
production declined further as a result of erratic rainfall. Long-term pros-
pects for groundnuts are not favorable in The Gambia. Projected decreases in
groundnut prices together with an increase in the cost of imports are likely
to cause a substantial deterioration in The Gambia's terms of trade and a
deficit in its foreign trade balance.
B.   The Transport System
1.04      The transport system consists of about 3,100 km of roads, the
Gambia River, a deepwater port at Banjul, a small river port at Kaur and an
international airport at Banjul. The system appears to have been developed



-2-
to a generally adequate degree in terms of connecting the main areas of
economic activity, and facilitating the movement of exports and imports,
which move mainly through the port of Banjul. The Gambia River is navigable
by ocean freighters up to 3,000 dead weight ton (dwt) to the inland groundnut
port of Kaur (230 km upstream). The road network, whose main arteries
parallel the river on both banks, consists of about 300 km of paved and 800
km of gravel or earth roads, plus about 2,000 km of tracks. An important
paved north-south link plus ferry crossing on the Gambia River in the middle
of the country serves Senegalese traffic moving across The Gambia between
northern and southern Senegal. Nine other ferry crossings serve as important
links, traversing the Gambia River or its tributaries. There is no railway
or domestic air transport in The Gambia.
1.05      Transport demand derives primarily from (i) the seasonal movement
of groundnuts from field to depot and thence to the processing plant for
extracting the oil before export; (ii) the movement of imported general
merchandise, fertiliser, and rice from the port of Banjul upcountry; (iii)
Senegalese traffic crossing The Gambia; and (iv) passenger flows, primarily
between Banjul and villages upcountry. In 1977, exports, with significant
annual fluctuations, amounted to 105,000 tons, while imports totalled 170,000
tons after growing over 10% p.a. since 1969. Internal commodity flows are
estimated at 46 million ton-km in FY1977 or about 570,000 tons. About 75%
of downcountry commodity flows travel by river, while 80% of upcountry move-
ments are made by road, resulting in somewhat unbalanced flows and lower load
factors in both modes. The transport of imports by the river and downcountry
flows by roads should be encouraged. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board
(GPMB) could have an important role in improving the balance of traffic flows
(para. 1.10). Nearly all passenger flows are by road and they are estimated
at about 280 million passenger-km per year. Traffic flows are presented on
page 3.
(a) Highways
1.06      Details of the highway sub-sector are discussed in Chapter 2.
(b)  Ports
1.07      The Gambia has a deepwater ocean port at Banjul and a small river
port at Kaur. The port of Banjul handles all Gambia's export/import traffic
(about 275,000 tons in 1977), except some groundnut exports through Kaur and
some commercial fishing traffic. The port of Banjul could serve a hinterland
larger than The Gambia, but this would require port expansion and some improve-
ment in transiting arrangements with Senegal. In the 1970s export traffic has
been irregular, but import traffic has grown rapidly--about 13% p.a. (Table,
page 4). With the introduction into service in 1975 of a new berth provided
under the Banjul Port Project (para. 1.19) port capacity (300,000 tons/year)
has been adequate to cope with the traffic growth. Although there is scope
for further improvement in the port's productivity, additional berth and
storage capacity will be required if shipping delays and congestion are to
be avoided in the future.

1.08      The sole function of the port of Kaur, located about 230 km up-
river, is to evacuate groundnuts for exlport. The traffic, seasonal from
January through June, amounted to 20,000 tons in 1977. The port operates
efficiently and is unlikely to require major investment or to experience
significant operational problems in the near future.
1.09      The Gambia Port Authority (GPA), a financially and operationally
autonomous agency of the Ministry of Works and Communications (MWC), is in
charge of the ports and all ferry crossings (ten) in the country. Since the
Banjul Port Project (para. 1.19), GPA's accounts and financial situation have
improved and GPA operates at a profit. However ferry rates, which are set by
MWC and which GPA is unable to increase, do not reflect economic costs;
financial losses of the ferries are largely subsidized by the profitable
Trans-Gambia Ferry. Banjul port and ferry operations need improvement, and
the Government is expecting Bank assistance in a second phase of Banjul port
expansion.

(c) River Transport
1.10      River transport carries mostly groundnuts.  About 85% of the ground-
nut crop is moved on the Gambia River by GPMB. GPMB is the sole buyer,
processor, and seller of all groundnuts and groundnut products. The crop is
shipped to the ports of Banjul or Kaur by river and to a lesser extent by road;
GPMB designates the form of transport and destination of the nuts from each
buying station, as well as the transport tariff. The river transport fleet
consists mainly of modern tugs and steel lighters owned by Gambia River
Transport (GRT), a GPMB subsidiary. GRT carries about 75% of the total crop
and appears to be efficiently managed. The other 25% of the crop is moved by
locally owned cutters and canoes, which range up to 100 tons of carrying
capacity.
(d) Air Transport
1.11      The country's only airport at Banjul serves international traffic.
In the mid-1960s a steady growth in international air traffic developed, and
since 1972, when tourism became a significant feature of the Gambia's economy,
air transport has almost tripled. To accommodate present and anticipated
traffic, Yundum International Airport underwent reconstruction which was com-
pleted in September 1978. A new terminal building was built and the 2,850 m
runway can now accommodate long-distance jet aircraft.



- 5 -
1.12      The most significant increase occurred in cargo traffic which con-
sists primarily of airmail and freight. From 1972 to 1977 air freight in-
creased from approximately 150 tons to 900 tons or 42% per year. Passenger
volumes also increased, particularly non-scheduled passenger movements, almost
exclusively tourism. In that five-year period passenger traffic increased
21% per year; over 60% was in non-scheduled flights. There does not appear to
be any need to improve Yundum airport in the immediate future nor to provide
additional airports or air services upcountry due to the small size of the
country.
C.  Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
(a) Investment Policy
1.13      The Government's objectives for the transport sector are presented
in the FYs1976-1980 Development Plan. The Government strategy in the sector
puts emphasis on improving (i) the primary road network, (ii) major roads
providing access to river banks, and (iii) river crossing facilities and
river transport.
1.14      Under the plan total investments in the transport sector would
amount to about D 130 million (US$65 million) in 1978 prices or 51% of all
investments. This would mean a substantial increase compared with total
investments of about D 10 million (US$5 million) for FYs1968-1975 or about
20% of all public investments in the period (Table, page 6). The program
for the sector appears ambitious and the share (51%) of total investments
devoted to transport seems excessive. Economic justification of envisaged
projects is needed. Some of the projects do not have external financing
secured, and it is uncertain the Government could provide its share of the
funding. It is also doubtful that the proposed improvements to the road
network (US$45 million) can physically be carried out in a five-year period.
According to the plan the paved road network would be doubled to about 600 km;
in addition the all-weather road system would reach about 1,100 km. Actually,
about 150 km of roads are expected to be constructed by 1980. No major invest-
ments in the Port of Banjul are proposed in the plan period, which appears
sound. However, construction of a bulk groundnut facility or extension of the
cargo wharf will likely be needed after 1980. The investment plan also
allocates funds for river transport, for improving ferry slips, and for
providing bulk and general cargo facilities at river transshipping points.

(b)  Planning and Coordination
1.15      The concept of integrated development planning has only recently
emerged in The Gambia. There is evidence of a growing desire by the Govern-
ment to coordinate transport development and to relate it to overall develop-
ment strategy. Formation of a centralized transport planning capacity has
been hampered by a shortage of qualified and experienced personnel. The
Government has requested the European Development Fund (EDF) to provide
technical assistance to a planning unit which was created within MWC
in 1978 (para. 2.15) to carry out mainly highway planning.
1.16      The Government has several organizations directly or indirectly
involved in planning, operation and regulation of the transport sector.
This administrative complexity does not appear to have adversely affected the
sector to date, since most decisions are made on the basis of informal con-
tacts between key officials, a system which takes advantage of the country's
small size and appears to work efficiently. The Ministry of Economic Planning
and Industrial Development (MEP) is responsible for overall investment plan-
ning, but the President's office and cabinet play a major decision-making
role. In the planning of investments MEP is assisted by MWC's Public Works
Department (PWD) for construction and maintenance of roads, airports, seaworks
and ferry docks; by GPA for ports and ferries; and by GPMB for river and road
transport. There is no separate Ministry of Transport, as MWC fulfills this
function.
1.17      MEP prepared its current five-year plan covering the period FYs1976-80
with UNDP assistance. The plan was assembled on a pragmatic basis, largely
through working level contacts between the technical ministries, the Ministry
of Finance and MEP. The Government took an important step to improve trans-
port planning by commissioning a National Transport Study (NTS), which was
completed in draft in May 1978 by consultants Wilbur Smith and Associates



- 7 -
(WSA, USA) with financing by the Kuwait Fund. WSA proposed a heavy investment
program in the sector through 1997 without sufficient economic justification.
The Bank commented on the terms of reference and later on the draft report.
1.18      The transport system is relatively simple and there are no major
issues in coordinating different modes. However, there are several problems
in the sector which warrant further Government attention:
(i)  improving and extending road maintenance operations;
(ii)  the economic role of river transport in relation to an
improving road network;
(iii) improving north-south trans-Gambia transport, in
particular assessing macroeconomic as well as transport
implications of a proposed barrage/bridge project on
the Gambia River;
(iv)  improving the transport and storage of groundnuts, with
regard to GPMB's activity; and
(v)  deepening the access channel and expanding the port
of Banjul.
D.   Past Bank Group Assistance in the Sector
1.19      The Bank Group has financed only one project in the transport
sector. The Banjul Port Project (Credit 187-GM, US$2.1 million, 1970 and
supplementary Credit of US$2.4 million in 1974) provided a new ocean berth
to replace an old timber structure, repairs to the Government jetty, a public
jetty for river transport and fishing vessels, some cargo handling equipment,
advisory services on operations and accounting, and engineering consultant
services for project design and supervision. The physical execution was
satisfactorily completed in late 1975 with some delay due to unexpected
construction difficulties. The credit covenants have been substantially met.
The economic rate of return after the project was completed was about 14%.
The overall financial situation of GPA has improved and is reasonably sound.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
2.01      The Gambia's road network totals about 3,100 km.  It is adequate
in size but falls short in quality. As shown below there are almost 300
km of paved roads, about 800 km of all-weather gravel roads classified as
primary and secondary roads, and about 2,000 km of dry-weather earth tracks.

2.02      The two main trunk roads extend along the north and south banks
of the Gambia River as far as Basse and Yorobawal (about 400 km east of
Banjul) with a track to Fatoto, 40 km further upstream. The Trans-
Gambia Highway crosses the river by ferry at Farafenni, some 200 km from
Banjul, and provides the principal north-south crossing of the country for
both domestic and Senegalese traffic. Except for the Trans-Gambia Highway,
where crushed stone aggregate is used, surfaced-dressed roads employ a
seashell aggregate. This composition has been determined by the virtual
absence of good rock materials in The Gambia (para. 2.20) and provides a
surface which is generally adequate for current traffic. The other main roads
are gravelled while the rest of the roads are surfaced with laterite, which is
abundant in The Gambia. During the rainy season some of the secondary roads,
particularly in the upper reaches of the river basin, as well as most of the
tertiary roads (earth tracks), are impassable by normal vehicles.
2.03      The general shape of the primary road network is simple.  South-
bank and north-bank roads connecting at Fatoto provide the backbone of the
country's road network. An immediate objective is to provide reliable,
all-weather roads to agricultural areas in the east and in the north.
Priorities in road improvements are:
(a) to pave gradually the south-bank road (up to Basse);
(b) to improve the north-bank road by periodic regravelling;
and
(c) to improve south-north road links, in particular access
to the Gambia River, for export of groundnuts and transport
of other commodities.
Ferry operations (under GPA) also need improvement since they have an impor-
tant role in providing vital connections in the primary road network.

B.   Traffic and the Road Transport Industry
2.04      Statistics on the vehicle fleet are based on vehicle registrations.
In 1976 the total number of vehicles was estimated at about 5,600. Passenger
vehicles, including motorcycles and taxis, constituted about 80% of the total
fleet. The remainder of the fleet was made up of trucks and buses.

Fuel consumption is given below and shows an average annual growth of 16%. In
the absence of past vehicle fleet statistics it is difficult to estimate
vehicle fleet growth in the 1970s, but heavy vehicles have likely been growing
at a faster rate than the light ones as indicated by the consumption of diesel
oil.

2.05      The first country-wide traffic counts were made in 1977 for the
National Transport Study; the traffic counts are mostly based on one day
counts. Average annual daily traffic flows by vehicle type are shown in Annex
1 for 20 road sections throughout the country. Trucks comprise approximately
14% of total flows, passenger vehicles about 80%, and buses the remainder.
Overall traffic flows on gravel roads are one-third of those on paved.
2.06      The traffic flows on paved roads do not differ markedly between
north and south banks but, clearly, the flows are heavier on routes in the
Banjul region, particularly to the northern border with Senegal, and are
lighter as the routes extend eastwards. Traffic volumes on the road network
are relatively high, due to the shape and population of the country. Traffic
near Banjul reaches up to 8,000 vpd on the main road. Traffic on the south
bank road decreases from 600 vehicles per day (vpd) west of the Trans-Gambia
Highway to 200 vpd in the east. The north bank roads carry between 200 vpd in
the west to 100 vpd near Georgetown to the east. The Trans-Gambia Highway and
Ferry carry around 350 vpd, while the road north from Barra (across the river
from Banjul) to Senegal carries around 500-700 vpd. The NTS estimates that in
1977 roads accounted for 60% of total goods movements (27.3 million ton-km)
and 98% of all passenger movements (278 million passenger-km). Based mainly
on an analysis of transport demand development (stagnating internal production,
exports, imports) an overall traffic growth rate of about 5% p.a. is forecast
for the primary road network.
2.07      The trucking industry is limited by The Gambia's transport pattern,
since a sizable part of internal transport is by river (Table, page 3). There
are few heavy trucks (over 12 tons) and most of them are owned by the Govern-
ment and GPMB which controls groundnut transport. Smaller trucks are predo-
minant and generally owned and operated by private truckers. These trucks are
usually in poor mechanical condition, and many are used only during the
groundnut season. At present, there are no officially established tariffs.
Due to competition there is little variation in the charges applied by the
individual carriers. Reported rates for moving goods are in the vicinity of
US$0.25 per ton-km. There are no regulations on entry into the trucking
industry. A valid vehicle registration, minimal insurance, and a driver's
license are sufficient to operate a commercial vehicle. Drivers/owners are
associated with the Motor Transport Association or with the Gambia Motor
Drivers and Mechanics Union. Vehicles owned by members of the Association
operate only in the Banjul area, whereas owners and operators engaged in
long-distance hauling are affiliated with the Union.
2.08      Passenger transport in The Gambia is provided by the Gambia-Libyan
Arab Public Transport Corporation (GLPTC) which owns 35 buses, and by three
private bus transporters who own about 10 buses. GLPTC provides scheduled
local services in the Banjul area and inter-city service between Banjul and
major places in the interior. Private operators provide unscheduled local
services in the Banjul area and inter-city services throughout The Gambia and
into Senegal. GLPTC, which derives 60% of its equity from the Government and
40% from Libya, was established in 1975 as a financially autonomous company
under the control of MWC. Monthly passenger volumes vary between 440,000 and
600,000 passengers and are growing rapidly. Tariffs are set by MWC, and



- 1 ]L -
the company follows a policy of operat:Lng only on paved roads. GLPTC earns
a small profit and appears to be effic:Lently managed. In the absence of
any initiative on the part of private transporters, the Government should
consider expanding GLPTC's services into rural areas served by unpaved roads.
2.09      Vehicle weight regulations are obsolete, as they limit only the
total vehicle load (38 tons) and are not enforced throughout the country.
Senegal, on the other hand, follows French practice with its 13-ton axle
load limit. About 75% of the traffic on the Trans-Gambia Highway is of
Senegalese registry, and vehicles are frequently overloaded. The Gambians
have two weighscales on this road, but due to inadequate regulations their
use is marginal. Overloaded Senegalese trucks are also reported to use other
Gambian roads (Essau-Banjul-Brikama) w'hen Senegalese roads have been closed
after heavy rains. The Government has prepared draft new vehicle load legis-
lation and has agreed to take Association comments into account in the final
text. It was also agreed that the new legislation should harmonize with that
of Senegal and would be introduced by December 31, 1979; this has been included
as a covenant to the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Government should
prepare an enforcement program.
C.   Administration
2.10      Within the Ministry of Works and Communications, the Public Works
Department is responsible for the 1,100 km of primary and secondary roads.
PWD has three branches: Engineering, Mechanical and Building. The Engineer-
ing Branch has the technical responsibility for planning, design, construction
and maintenance of the road network. The Mechanical Branch manages, operates
and maintains the Government's vehicle and equipment fleet, while the Building
Branch is basically'involved in building construction and architectural design.
At the regional level, PWD is represented by three divisions (Northern,
Western and Eastern) which are supervised by division engineers. Coordination
of the activities is done at a high level, adding to the heavy workload of
senior staff. The organization of MWC is shown on the chart on page 12.
2.11      The Ministry of Local Goverrment and Lands (MLGL) is responsible
for the maintenance of all other public roads or tracks in the country (about
2,000 km) through its five administrative divisions. These roads usually
carry little traffic and the extent of the network is ill-defined.  Main-
tenance of some local roads is delegated to area councils or local governments.
The MLGL and the local authorities wouild need to increase significantly their
qualified personnel, equipment fleet and funds to maintain the road network
under their authority at an acceptable level. Bank assistance could be con-
sidered under a follow-up of the proposed road maintenance program when
PWD is expected to be responsible for an expanded network.
D.   Staff and Training
2.12      PWD has a permanent staff of more than 3,000 employees.  About
one-third of them and an additional 1,100 temporary employees are engaged in
road maintenance and related workshop operations. Management is provided by
a senior professional staff of 13, of whom 7 are Gambians and the others are
technical advisors provided by the UK Overseas Development Ministry (ODM).

About five managerial positions are still vacant. The Gambian engineers
have fairly good academic backgrounds and the Government follows a policy
of filling vacant slots with fully qualified personnel only.
2.13      Gambian students are sent overseas for professional engineering
training. Currently, about 10 engineering students are being trained in
different foreign institutions. In spite of the low salaries offered by the
Government, PWD expects most of them to return to The Gambia at the end of
their studies, and about half of them will be available to PWD in the next
four years, particularly in the field of civil engineering. These junior
engineers will require on-the-job training which will be provided by ODM
technical assistance.
2.14      Foremen, gangleaders and specialized technicians such as mechanics,
operators and masons are trained on the job. Since current training require-
ments in specialized areas are relatively small and do not justify large,
formal training programs, PWD does not have the facilities, personnel and
funds for this purpose. The Vocational Training Center (VTC) in Banjul and
the Technical Institute (TI) to be established under a Bank-funded education
project (Credit 792-GM) will provide some basic artisanal and technical
training. These trainees however will need additional on-the-job training
once hired by PWD to obtain their specialization. The Government, in coopera-
tion with foreign financing institutions, uses ongoing road construction
contracts for training Gambian staff by contractors. This method and other
on-the-job training provided by PWD personnel appears to satisfy the country's
needs; due to the small size of the country, this is probably the most cost
effective way of training sub-professional staff.
E.   Highway Planning
2.15      To date there has been no comprehensive highway planning.  In pre-
paring the current Five-Year Plan, MEP had a major role in overall planning
(para. 1.16), including highway investments. While the plan emphasizes rapid
improvement in road infrastructure, the Government realizes the necessity to
improve highway planning. Institutional shortcomings and lack of adequate
staff have been major problems. However, the lack of a specialized highway
planning unit is expected to be overcome, since in July 1978 a planning unit
was established in MWC. The unit is responsible for coordinating invest-
ment programs between the different transport subsectors, in particular for
rationalizing the capital investments in the highway sub-sector. A Gambian
transport economist, already in MWC, is head of the unit. The European
Development Fund (EDF) is expected to provide the unit with a civil engineer
and a transport economist for two years starting in 1979. As investment
decisions in the past were made on an ad hoc basis, the recently completed NTS
will provide basic data for a road program. One of the major tasks of the
unit is the creation of a comprehensive road development program based on
critical evaluation of NTS. The Government has agreed to maintain the Plan-
ning Unit for coordinating investments in the sector and in particular to
rationalize investments in highways subsector.



- 14 -
F.   Highway Financing
2.16      Road construction works have been financed largely by external
aid. Capital investments in roads and bridges have been low and during
FYs1968-75, only about US$3.3 million was invested (para. 1.14). The
FYs1976-80 Development Plan reversed the order of priorities by emphasizing
the development of road infrastructure. The plan allotted about US$45 million
for highways, or about 32% of total planned investments in the country. It
has proved difficult to muster the necessary resources and after three years,
it is evident that the ambitious road component of the plan will not be
achieved on time. One difficulty lies in the current trend of aid donors to
concentrate on projects which directly relate to rural development. Further-
more, the road program lacks sufficient economic justification. The current
road development program presented in the plan should therefore be analyzed
and consolidated by the new Planning Unit.
2.17      Annual expenditures for all MWC's operations (administration, tech-
nical services, force account construction and road maintenance) are financed
from the general budget, consisting of the recurrent budget and the develop-
ment budget. Expenditures for road maintenance stagnated in FYs 1972-74, and
increased sharply in 1978, as shown in the following table:

2.18      Road maintenance amounts to about 2.5% of total budgetary expendi-
tures. However, the available funds are not sufficient to allow adequate
routine and periodic maintenance for the whole road network, and the Govern-
ment budgetary contribution is expected to be increased in real terms at
completion of the proposed road maintenance program (para 3.22).

2.19      Over the past five years revenues from road user charges have grown
from US$1.3 million to US$ 2.7 million as shown below. Total road mainte
nance expenditures, including the servicing of loans for equipment, have
been much less--on average about one- third of the revenues. Fuel taxes
increased in July 1978 to about US036/gallon on gasoline and USi23/gallon on
diesel oil, and contribute more than 50% of total revenues from road user
charges. Existing road-user revenues are sufficient to cover an expanding
road maintenance program.

G.   Engineering
2.20      The Gambia is a relatively flat country along the river.  The
surface soils are alluvial or sea deposits with bedrock at an inaccessible
depth. The available road construction materials are: (i) cockle shells
(unknown quantities) used as aggregate for bituminous surfacing, and (ii)
laterite, in great abundance at shallow depth, used as a course material
sometimes stabilized with cement. The crushed laterite is not a suitable
aggregate for pavement surfacing.



- 16 -
2.21      The paved road construction program is hampered by the lack of
good aggregates in the country. The surface deposits of cockle shells are
being exhausted and substitute materials or deep deposits of cockle shells
have not been found in sufficient quantities. The basalt and other good
quality aggregates must be imported from Senegal or elsewhere. The least
costly solution for the country's ambitious road construction program and
subsequent maintenance would necessitate finding cockle shell aggregates
in sufficient quantities within The Gambia. The proposed project, there-
fore, provides financing of an aggregate exploration study (para. 3.18).
2.22      Geometric and pavement design standards do not exist in The Gambia,
and design specifications have varied widely on projects. Major design works,
preparation of bidding documents, preselection of contractors, and supervision
of construction are performed by foreign consultants under the supervision of
DPW. There are no domestic consultants. Contracts are usually awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding.
H.   Maintenance
2.23      PWD is responsible for maintenance of the primary and secondary
road networks (para 2.10). The remaining roads are occasionally maintained
by local authorities under the MLGL at a very low level (para 2.11). If
systematic maintenance is merited by traffic development, the local authori-
ties may request that PWD maintain the road. PWD engineers plan and directly
supervise the road maintenance works executed either by force account or by
contractors.
2.24      Routine maintenance of the paved and unpaved roads is executed
by force account gangs in PWD's three field divisions. Current maintenance
practices need improvement. The mobility of the gangs is limited by the lack
of service vehicles, thus impeding each gang's productivity. As accounting
practices are limited to a few bookkeeping data, the efficiency of the gangs
cannot be evaluated in quantitative terms. The foremen are insufficiently
trained in maintenance techniques, which was evident from their use of in-
adequate materials in patching operations. Execution of road maintenance
could be significantly improved.
2.25      Until recently, periodic maintenance of laterite roads of the
primary network was contracted to petty contractors/truckers who carried out
the work without selecting the proper materials and then without properly
compacting them because they were neither equipped nor had the technical
know-how to execute these works. This resulted in heavy material losses,
a deterioration of the road network and a backlog of periodic maintenance.
Petty contractors are primarily involved in transporting groundnuts which
coincides with the timing of the busiest road maintenance activities; con-
sequently, maintenance works are delayed. On the basis of past experience
the Government decided in 1978 to use petty contractors primarily for carry-
ing out periodic maintenance of secondary and feeder roads, while PWD would
carry out periodic maintenance of the primary unpaved roads by force account.
This will provide petty contractors with an opportunity to gradually gain
experience through works which correspond more closely to their present
capacity and will give them a sound basis for developing their operations.



-   1 -r
2.26      Periodic maintenance of bitutainous roads, consisting of resealing
and resurfacing about 20-30 km of paved roads per year, has been carried out
by a DPW specialized unit. While its performance has been reasonable, the
unit's equipment is too old and its production rate is too low to handle the
country's expanding paved road network. A backlog is developing which, how-
ever, can be reduced by stepped-up patching activities.
2.27      Many important paved roads alppear to be underdesigned and conse-
quently affected by heavy traffic. It is therefore important to determine
whether it is economically justified to provide expensive materials (imported
crushed stone and asphalt) for simple periodic maintenance, instead of
strengthening the roads with a new base course at the same time. This issue
should be addressed in the proposed stady of a follow-up road maintenance
program (para. 3.17).
2.28      The Mechanical Branch has a Central Workshop in Banjul where the
Government's entire vehicle and equipment fleet is stored, serviced and
repaired. Minor servicing is performed in three regional workshops. Avail-
ability of equipment is hampered by the slowness of key repair works in the
Central Workshop, which has inadequate facilities. In addition, its building
is in poor shape, the parking areas are overcrowded and some of the machine
tools are obsolete. The workshop has a few trained managers and specialists;
more training and a streamlined management system would improve the perform-
ance of the workshop. Since PWD's Central Workshop is overloaded with
repair work for all the departments of the Government, MWC believes that the
separation of the vehicle and equipment fleet used for road maintenance
purposes from the rest of the Government's vehicle fleet would make the PWD
Central Workshop more manageable and has therefore requested a new workshop
for PWD only. Other Government agencies and departments would continue using
the existing Central Workshop. The expected new workshop, being seriously
considered by USAID for financing, could become operational in early 1982, the
fourth year of the proposed maintenance program, thus helping implement the
proposed project during the last year. In the meantime the proposed project
will alleviate current difficulties of the Central Workshop by providing
technical assistance, spare parts and a mobile workshop to repair road main-
tenance equipment (paras. 3.12 and 3.14).
I.   Construction
2.29      Due to an insufficient number of Gambian professionals in PWD and
the absence of local consulting firms, all major civil works are designed and
supervised by foreign consultants and executed by foreign contractors. Three
foreign contractors have worked in The Gambia on the airport expansion and two
road construction projects. The smalL size of the country makes it impossible
to guarantee continuous work for large civil works contractors in the foresee-
able future. As the Government is phasing out building construction by
force account, an opportunity is deve:Loping for contractors, including local
subsidiaries owned largely by foreign firms and domestic contractors.
2.30      While the Gambian contracting industry is very much in its infancy,
it shows healthy signs of growth in the building industry.  Local and comestic
contractors have not participated in road construction or road maintenance



- 18 -
activities with the exception of a few petty contractors/truckers (para.
2.25). It is possible that some of the domestic building contractors and
petty contractors, following the pattern in the region, will expand into
construction and maintenance of secondary and feeder roads in the next
decade or so. With their limited capacities, they have to strengthen their
management, capital base and experience before diversifying into other acti-
vities. A recently approved IDF project (Cr. 814-GM, 1978) channels funds
through the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank to small entrepreneurs,
providing them with the opportunity to expand their operations.
J.   Use of Appropriate Technology
2.31      The Government generally prefers using capital-intensive methods
for road construction and maintenance, arguing that other methods may lead
to unsatisfactory quality. The maintenance units under the proposed project
will introduce different mixes of labor and equipment relying on manual labor
for the tasks identified as most appropriate for execution by labor-intensive
techniques. Certain maintenance tasks that will be performed by manual labor,
such as patching paved roads, repairing shoulders, cleaning drainage struc-
tures and ditches, and eliminating potholes on unpaved roads have been
selected in agreement with the Government. However, the amount of labor to be
used in the proposed project will be limited due to the size of the works and
will not be at the expense of other sectors.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Background
3.01      The project was identified on the basis of a sector mission in
November 1976, and a 1976 UN/Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) study
which concluded that present road maintenance operations were insufficient
to protect investments made in the road network since independence. The
Comite Permanent Interetats de Lutte Contre la Secheresse au Sahel (CILSS)
sponsored a Diagnostic Study of Road Maintenance in the Sahel which reached
similar conclusions in mid-1977.
3.02      The Government's objectives and strategy for the transport sector
contained in the current development plan emphasize the need to improve the
national road network. In October 1977, the Government indicated its inten-
tion to execute a program to improve road maintenance operations and the
Association granted US$100,000 from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
to finance a road maintenance study to prepare the project. The Association
assisted in preparing terms of reference for the study and approved the
selection of consultants RPT Economic Studies Group (UK) in December 1977.
The consultants issued a draft final report in June 1978 and the appraisal
mission was dispatched immediately. During project appraisal it was agreed
with PWD that consultants RPT's program was not implementable at this stage
due to financial and manpower constraints. However, the consultants' report
was used as a basis for the proposed limited program which will gradually
improve the maintenance operations carried out by PWD by force account. The



- 19 -
concept of the proiect was also influenced by the lack of good aggregate
materials for paved road surfacing, which would -impede execution of periodic
mairnenae-rs of pav2d roads on a large scale. To fill this gap, the project
also includes e study to determine the least costly solution for providing
aggregates fox paved road surfacirng and whether periodic mainitenance of paved
roads shoald not be associated with pavement strengthening.
B.   Objectives
3.0-1     The proposed project is the first phase of a long-term effort.
The first phase program is designed to gradually improve current maintenance
operations of the Public Works Department (PWD). In a later project, a
f-ollow--up program would address the periodic maintenance of the paved roads
an(c would expand the network under PWD's responsibility.
-thr. principal objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to prepare and assist the Government in implementing a
road naintenance program for the most-trafficked roads;
(b)  to increase capacity of PWD for proper development and
maintenance of selected primary and secondary roads; and
'ic) to train Gambians in road maintenance operations.
C.   Description
The proposed project consists of:
(a)  a four-year program (FYsI980-83) for the routine mainte-
nance of about 780 km of roads and backlog periodic main-
tenance of about 190 km of major laterite roads, including
training of PWD staff; and
(b)  studies for a follow-up maintenance program and for explora-
tion of availability of aggregates for paved road surfacing.
3.05      To these ends, the proposed credit will assist in financing:
(a)  equipment, vehicles and spare parts;
(b)  materials, supplies and other operating costs for
backlog periodic maintenance;
(c)  installation of a weighing bridge;
(d)  technical assistance to PWD and consultancy services
for studies; and
(e)  a scholarship.

Road Maintenance Program
3.06      About 780 km of selected primary and secondary roads have been
included in the program for routine maintenance (Annex 1) and from among
these about 190 km of major laterite roads have been selected for periodic
maintenance. The program will be carried out by force account by PWD's
three regional divisions with the assistance of consultants (para. 3.23).
3.07      The routine maintenance will be carried out by the following units:
(a) 16 manual gangs to cut grass, clear ditches and culverts,
restore shoulders and repair road signalization, bridges
and culverts along all paved and unpaved roads;
(b) 1 mechanical unit to carry out grading on laterite roads, and
(c) 1 patching unit to fill potholes and provide spot single-
and double-surfacing for paved roads.
The equipment composition and cost, personnel, operating costs and expected
output of these units are given in Annex 2. The maintenance strategy selected
is shown below (length in km projected for situation in the middle of the
program):
Routine Maintenance Strategy
(a)  Paved roads (350 km)             Daily traffic:  310-8,000 vehicles
(average 600)
Manual gang:                     1 unit for 50 km
Patching gang:                   1 unit for 350 km
(b)  Unpaved roads (450 km)           Daily traffic:  60-230 vehicles
(average 160)
Manual gang:                     1 unit for 50 km
Dry grading:                     2-5 gradings/year (according
to traffic volume)
3.08      The backlog periodic maintenance of laterite roads (190 km) will be
carried out by a mechanized unit, which will open and work laterite quarries,
transport, place and compact materials to a final average geometry of an
8-meter carriageway and 15 cm thick compacted surface material. Estimated
annual output of the unit is 60-65 km per year. The equipment composition and
cost, personnel, operating costs and expected output of this unit are given
in Annex 2.
3.09      The appraisal mission and the Government agreed on the following
roads for the backlog maintenance program:



- 21 -
1.   Kerawan-Farafenni (57 km)
2.   Farafenni-Laminkoto (115 km)
3.   Yoroberi Kunda-Bansang (18 km)
The roads are scheduled to be regravelled between October 1980 and October
1983.  Following this initial prugram, the mechanized unit will continue on
other roads to be selected by PWD.
Road Equipment
3.10      The proposed project will provide equipment, vehicles and spare
parts to carry out routine maintenance and backlog periodic maintenance by
force account.  The Government has agreed to assign some equipment and vehicles
to the project. However, the consultants' assessment was that most existing
equipment will be fully depreciated before and during program execution.
Therefore, only eight trucks from the Central Workshop's pool were selected
for the routine maintenance units to complement tihe vehicle fleet provided
under this project. The equipment to be procured under this project and its
estimated cost are given in Annex 2. Spare parts will be procured for the new
equipment and for the trucks provided by the Government.  This will create a
small stock and will assure the rehabilitation of the trucks.
3.11      There is a possibility that key equipment will break down which
would affect project implementation.  In order Lo accelerate the transporta-
tion and repair of heavy equipment, the project provides a 20-ton, low-bed
trailer and tractor for this purpose. The project also provides a mobile
workshop to handle routine repair works.  The consequence of equipment
breakdown will be alleviated by renting the necessary equipment from
contractors. Physical contingencies are included in the proposed project
for the possibility of renting or, if rnot available, purchasing additional
equipment.
Central Workshop
3.12      For the duration of the proposed project, the Central Workshop (para
2.28) will be only partly involved in repair of road maintenance equipment and
vehicles, since the mobile workshop will handle routine repairs. For handling
possible major repairs, the Central Workshop will be assisted by a master
mechanic (para. 3.14) for two years. The master mechanic will also be repon-
sible for (i) repairing the eight trucks to be provided by the Government
(para 3.10), and (ii) training local personnel in the workshop.
Weighing Bridge
3.13      Vehicle weight regulations are obsolete in The Gambia and are not
enforced except on the Trans-Gambian Highway. The Government has drafted a
vehicle weight regulation law based on axle load limits (para 2.09). To help
enforce this new law, the project provides a weighing bridge to be installed
on the southern trunk road (Banjul-Brilcama).



- 22 -
Technical Assistance
3.14      The project will provide technical assistance for a total of 12
man-years to assist in (a) training PWD staff involved in road maintenance
and workshop operations, (b) planning and monitoring these operations and
(c) preparing a follow-up program (para. 3.17). The technical assistance
will help the following branches and units of PWD: (i) the Engineering
Branch to prepare, schedule, coordinate, supervise and evaluate the road
maintenance operations (a team leader for 4 years); (ii) the Mechanical
Branch to select and assure the availability and proper servicing of the
vehicles and equipment for the road maintenance program, and to train local
staff (a master mechanic for 2 years); (iii) the Field Divisions to set up a
simplified cost and performance accounting system (an accounting specialist
for 2 years); (iv) the routine and periodic maintenance units (a) to launch
the operations, resolve organizational, supply and scheduling problems,
provide on-the-job training of personnel in specific tasks and assure an
acceptable production rate for the units (a road foreman for 2 years), and (b)
to set up and manage a mobile workshop and to train a senior mechanic counter-
part and two junior mechanics in equipment maintenance (a senior mechanic for
2 years). At the end of the four-year program, Gambians are expected to
manage all field operations. The consultants' outline terms of reference,
shown in Annex 4 have been agreed upon. The Government has also agreed to
nominate the following Gambian counterparts to the technical assistance
experts prior to their arrival in the field:
-    a highway engineer to the team leader of the consultants;
-    a mechanic to the master mechanic in the Central Workshop;
-    a mechanic to the senior mechanic in the mobile workshop;
-    an accountant and three accounting assistants to the
accounting specialist; and
-    a road engineering assistant and three road superintendents
to the road foreman.
Scholarship for a Gambian Student
3.15      The Mechanical Engineering Branch critically lacks engineering
staff (para. 2.28). The project provides a scholarship for a Gambian student
in mechanical engineering to study abroad to fill this gap. The Government
presented the CV of an acceptable candidate during negotiations.
Reimbursement of PPF
3.16      The proposed project includes US$100,000 to reimburse the Project
Preparation Facility used to finance a road maintenance study (para. 3.02).



- 23 -
Follow-up Road Maintenance Study
3.17      A follow-up study will prepare the second phase of the road mainte-
nance program, which would complement the proposed project. The follow-up
study will be executed by consultants and will address the periodic main-
tenance needs of the paved roads and the expanded road network under PWD's
responsibility. In the course of project implementation, the technical
assistance team (para. 3.14) will acquire the necessary experience to help
prepare this study and will contribute to it. The outline terms of reference
(Annex 5) and the timing of the study have been agreed upon with the Government.
Aggregate Exploration Study
3.18      Lacking good aggregates in the country (para. 2.21) the ambitious
construction program for paved roads and their appropriate maintenance faces
serious difficulties. As the surface deposits of cockle shells are being
exhausted, a geotechnical exploration of underground deposits of the least
costly aggregate for The Gambia has high priority. If results of the explora-
tion are negative, the consultants should recommend feasible alternatives.
The proposed project will provide financLng for the study. The outline terms
of reference (Annex 6) and the timing of the study have been agreed upon with
the Government.
D.   Project Cost and Financing
3.19      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$6.7
million of which US$6.0 million are foreign costs (90%) and US$0.7 million
(10%) are local costs. The cost estimates are given on the following page;
more detailed ones are in Annex 3. Since the Government will exempt the
proposed project from taxes and duties, they are excluded from the cost
estimates.

3.20      Costs for equipment and spare parts are based on estimated ex-
factory prices in early 1979, adjusted to take into account transportation
and insurance for delivery in Banjul. Cost estimates for periodic maintenance
of laterite roads are based on consultants' estimates which were substantially
reduced by PWD during project appraisal. The estimated average unit cost
net of taxes is about US$12,000 per km including equipment depreciation. The
billing rate for consulting services is estimated at US$5,600 per field man-
month, including fees, salaries and overhead (home office expenses, expatriate
allowances, social security, and other indirect expenses). Reimbursable
expenses payable to consultants are estimated at US$2,300 per field man-month
including housing, internal and external travel, telecommunications, etc.
The scholarship was estimated on the basis of current annual tuition and fees
and living expenses at English-speaking West African universities. Price
contingencies for foreign costs have been calculated at 10% per year starting



- 25 -
in January 1979 as a weighted average of price increases for different project
components, in particular for various elements of operating costs. Price
contingencies for local cost components were estimated at 10% per year based
on the Government's projections. Physical contingencies have been estimated
to cover, if necessary: (i) one man-year of technical assistance for a master
mechanic, (ii) equipment rental in case of major breakdown, and (iii) procure-
ment of additional road maintenance equipment or vehicles.
3.21      The capital cost of the proposed project will be jointly financed
by an IDA credit of US$5.0 million and US$1.7 million from the EEC Special
Action Account. The Association will finance 75% of total costs (US$5.0
million), the EEC will finance the remaining costs.

The co-financing from EEC will cover part of the new equipment for the road
maintenance program. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA Credit
will be that the Government signs a co-financing agreement on the EEC Special
Action Credit.
3.22      The recurrent costs of routine maintenance operations for the
selected network and the annual funds needed for equipment renewal to be
financed by the Government are presented in Annex 2. In 1978 there was a
considerable increase in the annual appropriation for road maintenance which
amounted to about US$1.4 million (para. 2.17). This appropriation was in line
with the requirement of the limited maintenance program agreed upon by the
Association and the Government. In FYs] 981-1983, the annual Government
contribution to the program in current prices will be between US$1.2-1.4
million. However, funding of regravellLng operations may become an issue upon
project completion since starting in FYL984, total Government funding for road
maintenance would have to increase to about US$2.1 million in current prices.
Agreement has been reached with the Government on the allocations of funds
(estimated in Annex 2) for road maintenance to be presented as a separate
category in the general budgets. The Government has also agreed to provide in
the budget full operating cost of a brigade for periodic maintenance after
completion of the project.
E.   Project Implementation
3.23      PWD will be responsible for executing the proposed project and
will be assisted by consultants in planning, scheduling and supervising
the maintenance works and in improving the workshop operations. The con-
sultants' team leader will help monitor and coordinate the road maintenance

operations from PWD headquarters, while other technical experts will work
alternately with the different field units for the routine and periodic road
maintenance operations. The accounting specialist will work with the three
divisions to set up a simplified cost and performance accounting system to
monitor execution of the works; the new system will be set up by December 31,
1979. The operating costs will be audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. The auditors' report will be submitted to the Bank annually
within six months of the end of each reporting period. The consultants will
also help PWD in setting up statement of expenditures procedures and in
preparing statements of expenditures for periodic maintenance included in the
project. These arrangements have been agreed upon with the Government.
3.24      Routine and backlog periodic maintenance works will be executed by
force account; personnel will be selected from PWD's permanent and temporary
workers. Consultants will assist in reorganizing the field units according
to the composition presented in Annex 2 when they arrive in the field. The
vehicles and equipment from the central pool and new equipment procured under
the project will be assigned to the field divisions carrying out the main-
tenance works. Similarly, drivers and operators will also be assigned to the
division where they will work during project execution. The chief executive
engineer will rotate the mechanized units among the three divisions to ensure
that the routine and backlog periodic maintenance programs are carried out
according to the timetable. The above arrangements have been agreed upon
with the Government.
3.25      The mobile workshop procured under the project will be assigned
to the unit carrying out the backlog periodic maintenance of laterite roads.
Three mechanics will be selected from the Central Workshop with the approval
of the chief mechanical engineer and will be trained by the expatriate senior
mechanics who will also set up and organize the operation of the mobile
workshop. The Central Workshop will continue to perform all major equipment
maintenance and repair works. After proper servicing in the workshop, equip-
ment will be promptly returned to the units in the field.
3.26      The consultants will assist in working out detailed, routine and
periodic maintenance programs during the first year of project execution. The
program will be submitted to the Association for comments. This program will
present a timetable and specific measurable goals to permit monitoring the
program and the improvements in the performance of the field maintenance
units. The consultant will also assist the Government in procurement matters
and in preparing project a completion report. These arrangements have been
agreed upon with the Government.
3.27       The project will take four years to complete, from October 1979
to October 1983. The first year is a preparatory year (equipment to be
repaired and delivered, detailed program to be prepared, staff to be trained,
etc.); the actual field work will start in October 1980. The timing of
various activities in the project is as shown on the next page.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Introduction
4.01      Development of a reliable transport network within The Gambia and
reduction of transport costs are of prime importance to the country's economic
development. As roads handle about 60% of The Gambia's freight transport and
almost all passenger transport, the maintenance and improvement of the road
network is a basic prerequisite for Gambia's future economic growth.   Further-
more, the road maintenance program will help preserve investments already made
in roads.
4.02      The main goal of the proposed project is to improve road maintenance
operations, particularly the routine maintenance of the paved and unpaved
roads and to eliminate the backlog periodic maintenance of major unpaved
roads, by providing new equipment, additional funds for operating costs, and
by increasing the efficiency of operations. Consultants RPT prepared a road
maintenance program, which, due to the financial constraints of the country
and to the limited absorptive capacity of PWD was not feasible at this stage.
A limited program, therefore, has been proposed, the objectives of which are
to minimize the rate of deterioration of capital investment in the paved
network and to maintain the most trafficked unpaved roads.
4.03      The proposed investments in road maintenance are justified by
savings in vehicle operating costs only. Additional benefits accruing from
reliable and improved accessibility to administrative and commercial centers,
all-weather service on gravel roads, protection of past road investments,
and time savings have not been included in the calculation.
4.04      Traffic data on the road network to be included in the program
was based on 1977 counts carried out by consultants WSA. The traffic is
relatively high, exceeding 150 vpd on 70% of the selected network in 1977.
After 1977, during the economic life of the maintenance program, a traffic
growth rate of 5% p.a. was assumed (para. 2.06). Vehicle operating costs
presented below were based on consultants WSA findings.

B.   Road Maintenance Program
4.05      The evaluation of the maintenance program followed a sequential
procedure involving road selection, determination of the scope of maintenance
needed for the selected network (Annex 1), and the overall economic assessment
of the maintenance program. A Government classification of the road network
made in July 1978 served as the basis for selection. In addition, the selec-
tion of the network for the maintenance program took into account the following
criteria:
(i)  support of economic activity, e.g. maintenance of vital
roads into areas with development projects;
(ii)  current traffic volume; and
(iii)  improved accessibility to the eastern part of the
country which is affected by a drought.
4.06      Routine maintenance will cover 783 km of primary (84% of the
network) and secondary (16%) roads, and periodic maintenance 190 km of
gravel roads of the primary network. In evaluating benefits of the program,
it was assumed that without the proposed project the surface of the selected
roads will go from fair to poor in a few years due to inadequate maintenance.
Economic life of the program was estimated at six years (FYs1981-86) on the
basis of average life of the equipment in the program.

4.07      Project costs of the road maintenance program include capital
expenditures for equipment, spare parts, and technical assistance, as well
as operating costs; the project benefits consist of vehicle operating cost
savings resulting from improved road surface conditions. The capital and
recurrent cost streams as well as the benefit stream are shown on p. 33. The
whole maintenance program is expected to yield an economic rate of return
(ERR) of about 67%, with a corresponding benefit/cost ratio of 2.3:1 at a
discount rate of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in The Gambia.
The routine maintenance program alone is estimated to have an ERR of 88% with
a benefit/cost ratio of 2.6:1 discounted at 10%. The benefits for routine
maintenance program resulted in a reduction of VOC from poor to fair road
condition. The benefits for periodic maintenance on 190 km of roads consist
of incremental reductions in vehicle operating costs (from fair to good road
surface condition), in addition to the reductions effected under routine
maintenance. The incremental rate of return for regravelling operations is
estimated at about 16%, corresponding to a benefit/cost ratio of 1.2:1,
discounted at 10%.
C.   Distribution of Benefits
4.08      Most imports (general merchandise i.e. fertilizer, rice, sugar, etc.)
and part of the groundnut exports are transported by road. With improved road
conditions it is expected that, in the first round of distribution, the major
beneficiaries of transport cost reductions will be truck owners (mostly
private) and operators. Some of the cost reductions are likely to be passed
on to the farmers and their families in the zone of roads' influence in
the form of slower increases in transport costs because of the competitive
situation in the road transport industry. Private car and taxi owners would
benefit directly from reduced vehicle operating costs. Some indirect benefits
are expected to be passed on to passengers since there is competition in
inter-urban passenger transport and possible tariff increases could be post-
poned. The project is also expected to produce general benefits to other
sectors, such as promoting an increase in marketed agricultural production
(in the road zone). In addition, costly reconstruction of some roads will be
deferred due to the maintenance program.
D.   Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
4.09      There are no major risks anticipated in the course of project
execution. However, aggravation of the Gambia's economic situation could
limit road maintenance funds.  More specific risk elements are possible
increases in capital costs and shortfalls in the efficiency of technical
assistance with repercussions on the efficient use of equipment and on road
maintenance productivity. Even if the road maintenance program were reduced
from 783 km to 650 km, it would yield a high ERR of 49%. Assuming traffic
volume were 30% less than anticipated, ERR would be about 38%. With respect
to the regravelling operation, a 30% reduction in the annual regravelling
output (45 km/year) would lower the economic return to 11%, still above the
estimated opportunity cost of capital in The Gambia.

Sensitivity Analysis:
Program Reduced by 30%, ER: 10.6%
(45 km p.a.)
1/  Analysis was done in early 1978 prices, net of taxes.
2/  It is estimated that routine maintenance will reduce voc per pcu by 10-157. for paved and gravel roads;  for periodic maintenance on gravel roads savings in
VOC were estimated between "fair" and "good" road condition.
3/  Includes equipment for both routine and periodic maintenance and US$100,000 for the study.
4/  Also includes spare parts and present value of existing PWD equipment to be included in the program (675,000 Dalasi).
Includes estimated cost of new building, equipment and technical assistance.  Although the expected investment is not part of the project, it will be directly
involved in road maintenance.
6/  Estimated cost without equipment renewal for proposed routine and periodic maintenance.
7/  In the first year of program output, only 75% of annual benefits were included.
8/  liscounted at 10, estimated opportunity cost of capital In Gambia.
9/  Incorporates separate analysis of three-year periodic maintenance program (1980/81-1982/83) on the selected 192 km of gravel roads;  the equipment is expected
also to be used for regravelling of additional roads to be identified later;  since the economic justification is based on 192 km only, a salvage value of 50h
of equipment of about 1.03 million Dalasis was included in the benefits after the three-year program;  economic life of the works was assumed at seven years.
10/ First year:  1980/81;  last year:  1985/86;  benefits from incremental reductions in voc, additional to reductions originating from routine maintenance;  first
year 63 km will be regravelled; second year 126 km, and remainder in the third year.

other than cockle shell (internal, processed substitutes and
imported aggregates);
(iv)  submit a comprehensive, detailed report describing the results
of the exploration program including location of all the bor-
ings on a 1:5,000 scale map and the boring logs;
(v)  submit a report on the possibility of substituting other pro-
cessed local materials or imported aggregates for the cockle
shells;
(vi)  analyze the cost of aggregates from different sources, compare
the physical characteristics of these aggregates (Los Angeles,
etc.), and estimate the life of the roads when they are con-
structed to the same standard but with different aggregates;
and
(vii)  recommend a program and financial plan to the Government for
providing aggregates for paved road construction and for their
maintenance.
