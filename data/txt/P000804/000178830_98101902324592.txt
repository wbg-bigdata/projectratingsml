INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT AND AN EEC SPECIAL ACTION CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
credits to the Republic of The Gambia in an amount equivalent to US$6.7
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Highway Maintenance Project.
One credit of US$5.0 million would be made from IDA resources. A second
credit of about US$1.7 million equivalent would be made from the EEC Special
Action Account, administered by the Association in accordance with the terms
of the agreement of May 2, 1978 between the Association and the European
Economic Community.
PART I: THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of The Gambia" (907-GM) dated
December 12, 1975 has been circulated to the Executive Directors. Its con-
clusions are reflected and updated in the following analysis. Country data
sheets appear as Annex I.
3.        The Gambia is a narrow enclave of 11,300 km  inside Senegal along
both sides of The Gambia River. Its population of 540,000 is growing at an
annual rate of 2.8 percent. Owing to urban migration, the capital area is
growing at 4.2 percent per year. The population is predominantly illiterate
(90 percent). Past economic growth has been quite respectable in the long
term, real GNP per capita having risen at almost 4 percent p.a. between
1960-75. However, following the record year 1975, per capita output declined
owing in large part to a leveling off and subsequent decline in the production
of groundnuts due to falling world market prices and a recurrence of the
Sahelian drought in 1977. GNP per capita in 1976 was US$180 and is estimated
to have gone down somewhat in 1977. In addition to poor rainfall the drop
in the value of the Dalasi, which is pegged to the British pound, from 56 US
cents in 1975 to about 45 cents in 1976 and 1977 (though recovering to 50
cents in 1978), also lowered GNP expressed in US dollars during this period,
while a deterioration in the terms of trade reduced real income even further.
1/   These are standard IDA terms except that currencies would be repaid in
the amounts disbursed.
2/   The text of this section is substantially unchanged from that of the
President's Report for the Gambia Education Project approved by the
Board in April 1978.



-2-
4.        The economy consists mostly of traditional smallholder rural activ-
ities: agriculture, livestock and fisheries account for 70% of the country's
total GDP and employ about 90% of the active population. Agriculture is
mostly rainfed, characterized by a short production period limited to the
six-month rainy season, and dominated by groundnuts, which are almost the only
cash crop of The Gambia. Groundnuts are the main source of foreign exchange
and constitute the basis for the country's only major industrial activity,
groundnut oil milling. Millet, sorghum, and more recently rice are the major
food crops, and cattle raising is an important economic activity. Income per
capita of the urban population, estimated at US$470, is 3.6 times higher than
that of the rural population (US$130).
5.        The Gambian economy is influenced by some major structural weak-
nesses: (a) low productivity of the rural sector; (b) wide seasonal fluc-
tuations in output and employment (there is full employment at the height
of the agricultural season but this is followed by six months of sharply
reduced activity in most economic sectors, including trade, transport, and
industry, all linked to groundnuts); and (c) extreme vulnerability to varia-
tions in groundnut prices and production levels (the latter essentially a
function of rainfall).
Recent Developments
6.        The Government has undertaken both to increase productivity of the
rural sector and to diversify agriculture in order to reduce its dependence
on groundnuts. It has developed irrigated rice along the Gambia River, cotton
in the east and vegetables around the urban areas. For instance the IDA-
financed Irrigated Rice Project is estimated to have increased rice production
of 1,500 families by 5,000 tons p.a. (about 12 percent of national consumption
requirements of rice). To provide a sound basis for its agricultural develop-
ment strategy, in 1972 the Government requested the U.K. to conduct a nation-
wide land resource survey which was completed in February 1975. This led to
the ongoing IDA-financed Rural Development Project, which covers about
half the farms in the country and concentrates on improvement of rainfed
cultivation of millet, sorghum and groundnuts. Other rice and foodcrop
development programs are under preparation.
7.        The Government has also actively promoted the establishment of
hotels, mostly with private financing, by ensuring provision of infrastructure
facilities, participating in the equity of some of these enterprises, and
granting tax holidays and other incentives. These activities have had a bene-
ficial impact on the balance of payments and have resulted in the creation
of about 2,000 jobs (about 10 percent of employment in the modern sector).
Although this employment is seasonal, it occurs during periods of low agricul-
tural employment. To mobilize savings and channel credit to local entre-
preneurs, the Government established in 1972 The Gambia Commercial and
Development Bank (GCDB). As a first attempt to spur small industries, it
created the Indigenous Business Advisory service in 1975.



- 3 -
8.        Economic performance, however, continues to be dominated by the
groundnut sector. In 1975 high prices and good yields raised output, exports
and incomes markedly after the Sahel drought. In 1976 export prices fell
by 15 percent and groundnut production leveled off while import prices rose
considerably. This resulted in a substantial deficit in the current account
of the balance of payments, notwithstanding low import growth in real terms.
In 1977 low rainfall caused a decline in groundnut output, but export prices
were favorable. Imports again rose slowly in real terms, but their cost was
pushed up both by higher world prices and the decline in the value of the
Dalasi, resulting in another sizeable current account deficit. Throughout
this period of low growth and rising import costs the Government nevertheless
managed to maintain a satisfactory overall balance of payments position, as
capital inflows financed most of the current account deficits so that foreign
exchange reserves, though declining, could be kept above 4 months of imports.
With respect to public finance, current expenditures were held below current
budget revenues, and modest budgetary savings were available for public
investment.
Development Prospects and Constraints
9.        During 1975-1985 GDP is projected to grow by only 2.5 percent p.a.,
with very low growth in the first five years of the period, and growth of
about 4.0 percent p.a. between 1980-85. The main factors behind this outlook
are the expected slow growth of groundnut output, which will be depressed by
unfavorable long term price trends, but more rapid growth of food crops,
services, and small-scale enterprises in the early 1980s. The long-term
decline in groundnut prices together with increases in the cost of imports
implies a sizable deterioration in The Gambia's terms of trade and a loss of
real purchasing power.
10.       The Government is implementing its Fourth Development Plan, which
covers the 1976-80 period. This Plan gives greater emphasis to the productive
sectors, agriculture and industry, than the preceding four-year program (40
percent of total investment compared with 17 percent). It also includes urban
and transport infrastructure projects and stresses the development of skilled
manpower. The Plan provides for gross public investment of about US$130 million
(1978 prices). This corresponds to annual expenditures of about 11 percent of
GDP, a sharp increase over the past when total public investment averaged only
5-6 percent of GDP.
11.       Lack of skilled manpower is one of the major bottlenecks hindering
economic development and is slowing down preparation and execution of develop-
ment projects. The Plan includes a major human resources development program
which aims at creating in the shortest possible time a stock of trained
manpower at all levels. IDA's Infrastructure and Tourism Project, the ongoing
Rural Development Project, and the recently approved Education Project all
have substantial training components.



-4-
Financial Prospects and Foreign Aid
12.       The financing needed to implement the Development Plan is expected
to come from a combination of foreign aid, drawing down of existing reserves,
and public savings generated during the Plan period. In recent years the
Government has managed to generate small budgetary surpluses as a result of
its efforts to improve tax collection and restrain the growth of recurrent
expenditures. Assuming that groundnut prices decline as forecast, the Gambia
Produce Marketing Board will be unable to generate significant surpluses over
the Plan period. Public savings, which reached a high of US$17 million after
debt service in 1974 are expected to be much lower over the Five-Year Plan
period. Development expenditure will also be less than planned, as the
Government decided to postpone projects for which financing in the current
year had not been fully secured. With the help of the IMF, the Government
is studying fiscal reform in order to improve revenues. Finally, the Revenue
Fund, financed with earlier budgetary surpluses and Marketing Board contribu-
tions, is not yet depleted.
13.       Foreign aid increased sharply over the past three years:  from US$7
million in 1976 to US$15 million in 1977. Disbursements in 1978 are forecast
to be US$19 million. Donors from OPEC countries have increased their commit-
ment from US$0.3 million in 1975 to US$22.7 million in 1978. IDA disburse-
ments represented 7 percent of disbursements in 1976, 6 percent in 1977 and
did not exceed 8 percent in 1978.
14.       Our projections show that Government should be able to finance up
to about 20 percent of its present Development Plan. However, these projec-
tions are particularly sensitive to the groundnut situation. A single
bad crop, a slower rate of growth in groundnut output, a drop in groundnut
prices beyond forecasts or a combination of these factors could seriously
affect the realization of these savings objectives. The Government is
therefore justified in seeking external financing on concessionary terms as
well as some foreign financing of local costs in appropriate cases. With a
continuation of present policies we expect The Gambia to be successful in
mobilizing the necessary finance on appropriate terms; accordingly debt
service is not likely to impose an unduly heavy burden on budgetary receipts
or on the balance of payments. Because of the increasing diversification
of foreign aid donors, the exposure of IDA is expected to decline from 31
percent of total outstanding debt in 1976 to 20 percent in 1985.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE GAMBIA
15.       To date the Bank Group has financed six operations in The Gambia
totalling US$22.4 million of which US$8.2 million have been disbursed as of
February 28, 1978. One credit of US$2.1 million in FY70 (187-GM) helped
rehabilitate the port of Banjul, essential for a country so vitally dependent
on foreign trade; due to a sharp increase in construction costs following
project appraisal, a US$2.4 million supplementary credit was added in FY74.



The second operation (FY73) involved a US$1.3 million credit (333-GM) for the
irrigation of 3,000 ha under rice cultivation and for the preparation of a
follow-up project. A third project, for which a US$4.0 million credit (602-
GM) was made during FY76, focuses on the development of the tourism sector in
which The Gambia has some comparative advantage; it moreover aims at improving
public utilities in both Banjul and suburban areas. Also during FY76 IDA
approved a credit of US$4.1 million (644-GM) for a Rural Development Project,
co-financed by ODM and BADEA. The project is aimed at improving agricultural
extension services, transport and marketing infrastructure, and provides
training and agricultural credit for farmers. Two projects were approved in
FY78. A US$5.5 million Education Credit (792-GM) is helping improve second-
ary education, strengthen educational planning and administration, expand the
training of skilled workers, and upgrade middle level managers. Finally, IDA
approved a US$3 million credit (814-GM) for a Rural and Urban Enterprise
Project to stimulate further development in agriculture, agro-industries,
small-scale enterprises and housing construction. Project implementation in
The Gambia has been generally satisfactory. Notes on the execution of ongoing
projects are presented in Annex II.
16.       Because agriculture will remain The Gambia's main economic activity
for a long time, providing not only most of the country's basic foodstuffs but
almost all of its foreign exchange, Bank Group strategy will continue to focus
mainly on assisting the rural sector. At the same time it will emphasize the
provision of essential infrastructure to support agricultural growth and to
help develop other sectors in an effort to increase the country's sources of
foreign exchange. A Second Rural Development Project is being prepared
which would continue much of the activity begun in the first operation, in
particular in the area of crop diversification to reduce The Gambia's heavy
dependence on groundnuts. A basic needs mission visited The Gambia recently
to help prepare a possible basic needs strategy for use in the next Develop-
ment Plan. The mission identified the amenities that are most lacking
(primarily good health and nutrition, including health and nutrition educa-
tion) and the target groups that are most needy (small children and pregnant
and lactating mothers in rural areas). A component dealing with these
problems could be part of the Second Rural Development Project. Also under
consideration is a Second Port Project to help meet the demands of expanding
import and export traffic, the latter predominantly agricultural.
17.       The Highway Maintenance Project proposed in this report would
support the Government's emphasis in the present Plan on improving inland
transport infrastructure, so essential to rural development. Since present
road maintenance efforts are inadequate to keep the existing network in good
condition, the project would constitute an initial phase of a longer range
maintenance program.



PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
18.       The Gambia's transport system consists of about 3,100 km of roads,
the Gambia River, a deep water port at Banjul, a small river port at Kaur and
an international airport at Banjul. The system is sufficiently well developed
to connect the main areas of economic activity and to facilitate the movement
of exports and imports through the port of Banjul. The Gambia River is navig-
able by ocean freighters of up to 3,000 dead-weight tons (dwt) as far as the
inland groundnut port of Kaur (230 km upstream). The road network, whose main
arteries parallel the river on both banks, consists of about 300 km of paved
and 800 km of laterite (gravel) roads classified as primary and secondary,
plus about 2,000 km of tracks. The Trans-Gambian Highway crosses the river
by ferry at Farafenni, some 200 kms from Banjul and provides the principal
north-south crossing of the country for both domestic and Senegalese traffic.
Nine other ferry crossings serve as important links, traversing the Gambia
River or its tributaries. There is no railway or domestic air transport in
The Gambia.
19.       Transport demand derives primarily from:  (i) the seasonal movement
of groundnuts from field to depot, to the processing plants, and then to the
ports for export; (ii) the movement of imported general merchandise, fertil-
izers, and rice from the port of Banjul upcountry; (iii) Senegalese traffic
crossing The Gambia to southern Senegal; and (iv) passenger flows, primarily
between Banjul and villages upcountry, almost all of which are by road. About
75 percent of downcountry commodity flows travel by river, while 80 percent of
upcountry movements are made by road.
Sector Objectives
20.       The Government's objectives for the transport sector are presented
in the FY1976-80 Development Plan. Its strategy puts emphasis on improving
(i) the primary road network; (ii) principal access roads to river banks; and
(iii) river crossing facilities and river transport. Total investments in
the transport sector under the plan would amount to about D130 million (US$65
million in 1978 prices) or 51 percent of all public investments. The Govern-
ment realizes that all the foreign assistance needed to implement this program
may not be available during the plan period and therefore some of the projects
may have to be executed during the next plan.
Transport Planning and Coordination
21.       The Government has several organizations directly or indirectly
involved in planning, operation, and regulation of the transport sector. Most
decisions are made on the basis of informal contacts between key officials, a
system which takes advantage of the country's small size and appears to work
reasonably well. The Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development
(MEPID) prepared the current FY1976-80 Development Plan and is responsible for
overall investment planning, but the President's office and cabinet play a
major decision-making role. In the planning of investments MEPID receives



proposals from the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Works and
Communications (MWC) for construction and maintenance of roads, airports, and
ferry docks; from the Gambia Port Authority (GPA) for port and ferry opera-
tions; and from the Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB) for river and road
transport. There is no separate Ministry of Transport, as MWC fulfills this
function. The Government commissioned Wilbur Smith and Associates to carry
out a National Transport Study (NTS) which was completed in draft in 1978 with
Kuwait Fund financing. Though the investment program proposed for the sector
appears to exceed the country's absorptive capacity and includes large projects
without sufficient economic justification, this study represented an important
step for the Government toward more systematic planning of transport invest-
ments.
Road Transport
22.       Road and river are the dominant transport modes.  The road network
is adequate in size but falls short in quality, particularly in view of the
substantial portion that can only be used in dry weather. The general lay-
out of the primary system is simple with south-bank and north-bank highways
providing the backbone of the country's road network. The Government's
immediate objectives in the subsector are to: (i) provide reliable, all-
weather roads to agricultural areas in the east and in the north; (ii) gradu-
ally pave the south-bank road from Yoroberi Kunda to Basse; and (iii) improve
the north-bank road by periodic regravelling.
23.       In 1976, the total number of motor vehicles was estimated at about
5,600 concentrated in the capital area. Passenger vehicles, including motor-
cycles and taxis, constitute about 80% of the total estimated fleet. The
remainder is made up of trucks and buses. Traffic volumes on the road
network are relatively high, due to the country's population density and
to its shape, which concentrates flows on the two east-west axes. Traffic
reaches 8,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on the main road between Banjul and the
airport. Traffic on the south-bank roads decreases from 600 vpd west of the
Trans-Gambia Highway, excluding the Banjul area, to 200 vpd in the east. The
north-bank roads carry between 200 vpd in the west to 100 vpd near Georgetown
to the east. The Trans-Gambia Highway and ferry carry around 350 vpd, while
the road north from Barra (across the river from Banjul) to Senegal carries
around 500-700 vpd. The National Transport Study estimates that in 1977,
roads accounted for 60% of total goods movements and 98% of all passenger
movements. Based on an analysis of transport demand development (internal
production, exports, imports), an overall traffic growth rate of about 5%
p.a. is forecast for the primary road network.
Road Administration
24.       Within MWC, the Public Works Department is responsible for the ad-
ministration of about 1,100 km of primary and secondary roads. PWD has three
branches: Engineering, Mechanical and Building. The Engineering Branch has
the technical responsibility for planning, design, construction and mainte-
nance of the road network. The Mechanical Branch manages, operates and
maintains the Government's vehicle and equipment fleet, while the Building



- 8 -
Branch is essentially involved in construction and architectural design of
buildings. At the regional level, PWD is represented by three field divisions
(Northern, Western, and Eastern--see Map) which are supervised by division
engineers. The Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL) is responsible
for the maintenance of all other public roads or tracks in the country (about
2,000 km) through its five administrative divisions. These roads usually carry
low traffic volumes and the extent of the network is ill-defined.
Road Maintenance
25.       Routine maintenance of primary and secondary roads is executed by
PWD's three field divisions. Current maintenance practices need improvement.
The mobility and productivity of PWD gangs is hampered by a lack of trans-
portation vehicles, and the foremen are insufficiently trained in maintenance
techniques, as evidenced by their use of inadequate materials for patching.
In the past the output of the gangs could not be evaluated in quantitative
terms because of limited accounting practices.
26.       Periodic maintenance of paved roads has been carried out by a PWD
specialized unit. Because its equipment is old, the unit is not adequately
handling the country's expanding paved road network. A backlog has been
developing that would be reduced by increased patching activities under the
proposed project until an intensified program of periodic paved road main-
tenance could be initiated under a possible follow-up project.
27.       Until recently, periodic maintenance of laterite roads in the
primary network (about 600 kms) was contracted to petty contractors/truckers
who were neither equipped nor had the technical know-how to execute these
works properly. This resulted in heavy material losses, deterioration of
the road network, and a backlog of periodic maintenance. Moreover, petty
contractors are primarily involved in transporting groundnuts which they must
do at a time that coincides with the busiest road maintenance activities;
consequently, maintenance works have been delayed. On the basis of past
experience, the Government decided in 1978 to use these truckers for periodic
maintenance of only secondary and feeder roads to complement PWD force
account operations. This will provide petty contractors an opportunity
to gradually gain experience through works that correspond better to their
capacities. Our IDF Project approved in 1978 channels funds through the
Gambia Commercial and Development Bank to small entrepreneurs and should
also help those in the road sector to expand and improve their operations.
Highway Planning and Financing
28.       Until now there has been no comprehensive highway planning in
The Gambia. With the recent emphasis on improving road infrastructure, the
Government realizes the necessity of overcoming the institutional shortcom-
ings and inadequate staff in this area. The establishment in July 1978 of a
transport planning unit in MWC, which is expected to be supported by technical
assistance from the European Development Fund, is a first step toward better
planning of transport investments. The Government has agreed to maintain



the planning unit for coordinating investments in the sector and in particular
to rationalize investments in the highways subsector (Section 4.06 of draft
Development Credit Agreement (DCA)).
29.       Road construction works have been financed largely by external aid.
Capital investments in roads and bridges have been at a low level, only about
US$3.3 million during FY1968-75. The current plan (FY 1976-80), with its new
emphasis on transport infrastructure, allotted about US$45 million for high-
ways including about US$6-7 million for maintenance, or about 32% of total
planned investments in the country. It has proved difficult to muster all the
resources for such an effort, however, and after three years, it is evident
that the entire road component will not be achieved on time. The program
should be reviewed by the planning unit in MWC.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background
30.       The project was identified on the basis of a sector mission in 1976
and a 1976 UN/Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) study which concluded that
present road maintenance operations were insufficient to protect investments
in the road network. In addition, a diagnostic study for road maintenance was
prepared at the request of CILSS and financed by USAID. It was completed in
1977. In October 1977, the Government indicated its intention to execute a
program to improve road maintenance operations, and the Association granted
US$100,000 from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance a road
maintenance study to prepare a project supporting the Government's program.
The Association assisted in preparing terms of reference for the study.
Consultants were selected and issued a draft final report in June 1978. It
was agreed with PWD that due to financial and manpower constraints in The
Gambia all of the consultants' proposals could not be implemented during a
first phase program. Their report was used, however, as a basis for the more
limited program proposed following appraisal in June/July 1978. The concept
of the program was influenced by the lack of good aggregate materials for
resurfacing of paved roads. As no such materials are currently available,
periodic maintenance would mainly be carried out on laterite roads. An
aggregate exploration study is included in the proposed project, however, and
periodic maintenance of paved roads would be introduced as part of a follow-
up project.
31.       Negotiations for the proposed project took place in Washington from
February 26 to March 2, 1979. The Gambian delegation was led by Mr. M.B.
Wadda, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Works. The project is des-
cribed in detail in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 2298-GM dated March 30,
1979 which is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately.
Project Objectives
32.       The proposed project is the first phase of the Government's long-
term road maintenance effort and is intended to gradually improve the main-
tenance operations currently carried out by PWD: routine maintenance of



- 10 -
primary and secondary networks and periodic maintenance of major unpaved
roads. In a later project, a follow-up program would address the periodic
maintenance of paved roads and would expand the network under PWD's respon-
sibility. The principal objectives of the proposed project are to: (a)
prepare and assist the Government in implementing a road maintenance program
for the most-trafficked roads; (b) increase the capacity of PWD to properly
develop and maintain the primary and secondary network; and (c) train
Gambians in road maintenance operations.
Description
33.       The proposed project consists of: (a) a four-year road maintenance
program (FY 1980-83) of about 780 km of selected primary and secondary roads
and, among these, backlog maintenance on about 190 km of major laterite roads
including training of PWD staff; and (b) studies for a follow-up maintenance
program and for exploration of aggregates for paved roads surfacing. To
these ends, the proposed project would provide funds for:
(a) purchase of equipment, vehicles and spare parts;
(b) financing of materials and other operating costs
for backlog periodic maintenance;
(c) installation of a weighing bridge;
(d) technical assistance to PWD and consultancy services
for studies; and
(e) an overseas scholarship.
Road Maintenance Program
34.       The routine maintenance component would be carried out on about
300 km of paved roads with daily traffic of 300-8,000 vpd and about 480 km of
unpaved roads with daily traffic of 60-230 vpd. It would be performed by the
following units:
(a) 16 manual gangs to cut grass, clear ditches and culverts,
restore shoulders and repair road signalization, bridges
and culverts along all paved and unpaved roads;
(b) 1 mechanical unit to carry out grading on laterite roads; and
(c) 1 patching unit to fill potholes and do spot surfacing on
paved roads.
35.       The backlog periodic maintenance of laterite roads (190 km) would
be carried out by a mechanized unit which would open the way to and work
laterite quarries, and transport and compact the materials onto the road sur-
face. Estimated annual output of the unit is 60-65 km per year. The selected
roads are planned to be regravelled between October 1980 and October 1983.
Following this initial program, the mechanized unit would continue on other
roads to be selected by PWD.



- 11 -
Road Equipment
36.       The proposed project would provide equipment, vehicles and spare
parts to help carry out the maintenance program. In addition, at negotia-
tions the Government confirmed its agreement to assign some of its own
equipment and vehicles to the project as well as operators and drivers
(Section 3.04 of draft DCA). The consultants' assessment, however, was that
most of this equipment would wear out either before or during the program's
execution. Therefore, only eight trucks from PWD were selected to complement
the vehicle fleet provided under this project and they would be assigned to
the routine maintenance units. Spare parts would be procured for the new
equipment and for the trucks provided by the Government creating a small
stock to assure adequate repair.
37.       Due to the small scope of the project there would be little flexi-
bility with respect to borrowing or substituting equipment from other project
units in the event of equipment breakdown within a given one. To accelerate
the transportation of heavy equipment to PWD's Central Workshop for repair, the
project would provide a 20-ton low-bed tractor-trailer. The Central Workshop,
which provides service to all government departments, would only handle major
repairs. A mobile workshop financed by the project would perform repair work
of a routine nature. Another provision for the event of equipment breakdown
would be rental of replacement equipment from contractors. Physical contin-
gencies are included in the proposed project for this possibility.
Weighing Bridge
38.       Vehicles are frequently overloaded in The Gambia and weight regula-
tions need improvement. The Government has prepared draft new vehicle load
legislation and has agreed to take the Association's comments into account
in the final text and to harmonize the new legislation with that of Senegal.
It has also agreed to introduce the law by December 31, 1979 and to prepare
an enforcement program (Section 4.03 of draft DCA). To help enforce this
law, the project would provide a weighing bridge to be installed on the
southern trunk road (Banjul-Brikama).
Technical Assistance and Training
39.       The project would provide a total of 12 man-years of technical
assistance for: (a) training PWD staff involved in road maintenance and
workshop operations, (b) planning and monitoring these operations, and (c)
preparing a follow-up road maintenance program. The technical assistance
would help the following branches and units of PWD: (i) the Engineering
Branch (a team leader/highway engineer for 4 years); (ii) the Mechanical
Branch (a master mechanic for 2 years); (iii) the Field Divisions (an account-
ing specialist for 2 years); and (iv) the routine and periodic maintenance
units (a road foreman for 2 years). The proposed project would also set up
and manage a mobile workshop and provide the services of a senior mechanic
for 2 years. At the end of the four-year program, Gambians are expected to
manage all field operations. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
the Government will nominate Gambian counterparts to the above technical
assistance (Section 3.02 (b) of draft DCA).



- 12 -
40.       The Mechanical Engineering Branch of PWD critically lacks engineering
staff. To help fill this gap, the project would provide a 4-year scholarship
for a Gambian student in mechanical engineering for studies abroad. The
Government presented the curriculum vitae of an acceptable candidate during
negotiations.
Follow-up Road Maintenance Study
41.       A preinvestment study for a follow-up road maintenance program
complementing the proposed project would be executed by consultants (11
man-months including 3 of those of the team leader, para. 39). It would
address the periodic maintenance needs of paved roads and would define an
expanded road network to be maintained by PWD.
Aggregate Exploration Study
42.       In view of the lack of good road paving aggregates in the country,
the planned construction program for paved roads and their appropriate mainte-
nance is facing serious difficulties. Because the surface deposits of cockle
shells are being exhausted, a geotechnical exploration of underground deposits
of the least costly aggregate for The Gambia is of high priority. The pro-
posed project therefore provides consultant services to carry out such work.
If results of the underground exploration are negative, the consultants would
recommend feasible alternatives, either domestically processed substitutes or
imported aggregates.
Implementation
43.       PWD would be responsible for executing the proposed project by
force account. The Department would be assisted by consultants in planning,
scheduling, and supervising the maintenance works, improving the workshop
operations, and training the staff. Consultants would also assist with
procurement. Moreover, since the feasibility study did not provide an
adequately workable program, they would help prepare by March 1, 1980 a
detailed program to execute maintenance works on the 780 kms of roads in-
cluded in the project for submission to IDA for comments (Section 3.03 of
draft DCA). They would also assist in writing a project completion report
(Section 3.06 (c) of draft DCA). The project would take four years to
complete, from October 1979 to October 1983. The first year, 1979/80, would
be a preparatory year for delivery of equipment and spare parts, repair of
equipment, preparation of the above program, and training of staff; the
actual field work would start in October 1980 and last three years. Tech-
nical assistance would be provided between October 1979 and September 1983.
The aggregate exploration study would be carried out in 1979/80 and the
follow-up road maintenance study in 1981/82.
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The total cost of the proposed project, net of taxes, is estimated
at US$6.7 million of which US$6.0 million is foreign costs (90 percent) and
US$0.7 million (10 percent) is local costs. The Government will exempt the



- 13 -
proposed project from taxes and duties. Cost estimates are based on early
1979 prices and include price contingencies for foreign cost components of
10 percent per year. These contingencies were calculated as a weighted
average of price increases for the various elements of the project's operat-
ing costs. Price contingencies for local cost components were estimated at
10 percent per year based on the Government's projections. A small amount
has been allocated for physical contingencies to cover, if necessary, an
additional man-year of technical assistance, equipment rental in case of
breakdown, and extra road maintenance equipment or vehicles. Technical
assistance is estimated at US$7,900/man-month which includes reimbursable
expenses such as housing, internal and external travel, and telecommunica-
tions. The proposed project is expected to be jointly financed by IDA (US$5.0
million) and the EEC (US$1.7 million from the Special Action Account). As
indicated in paragraph 14, a high proportion of external financing including
local costs is justified by the country's poverty and public savings prospects.
The financing plan proposed for the Highway Maintenance Project is dictated by
the need to find an appropriate instrument through which to channel the EEC
Special Action Account allocation to The Gambia considering the facts that
(i) this allocation is expected to be additional and quickly disbursed, and
(ii) the proposed project is likely to be the last Bank Group operation in The
Gambia during the FY78-80 period.
45.       The Government's annual expenditures for road maintenance (mostly
routine) have increased in the last four years from US$0.8 million to US$1.2
million. During negotiations assurances were obtained that a gradual increase
in the highway maintenance budget from US$1.2 to US$1.4 million for routine
maintenance would take place during project execution and that the operating
costs of the periodic maintenance units to be financed under the project
will be added to the budget from 1984. Annual maintenance appropriations
would therefore have to grow to US$2.1 million in 1984. In spite of this
increase, the budget would cover only the needs of the project's selected 780
kms of primary and secondary roads, the most important to Gambia's economic
development. The follow-up road maintenance study included under the project
would therefore determine the feasibility of expanded road maintenance oper-
ations and the level of appropriations needed. To further assure smooth
project execution and adequate provision of budgetary resources, agreement was
reached with Government at negotiations that (a) allocations of funds for road
maintenance including equipment renewal be presented as a separate category in
the general budget (Section 4.04 of draft DCA), (b) a cost and performance
accounting system for road maintenance operations be set up (Section 4.05 of
DCA), and (c) operating costs be audited by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA (Section 4.02(b) of draft DCA). The Government also agreed to provide in
the budget the full operating costs of a periodic maintenance brigade after
project completion (Section 4.04 of draft DCA).
Procurement
46.       Part of the equipment for periodic road maintenance, the weighing
bridge and the low bed trailer with an initial stock of spare parts amounting
to US$600,000 to be financed by the Association will be purchased after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.



- 14 -
Spare parts for the vehicles assigned to the project by the Government and
hand tools for routine and periodic road maintenance amounting to US$150,000
will be procured through shopping acceptable to the Association. Spare parts,
fuel, diesel oil, lubricants and other materials (cement, asphalt, steel) for
executing the periodic maintenance of about 190 km of laterite roads for
a total of US$950,000 may be procured under the Government's existing proce-
dures. Equipment for routine maintenance and part of the equipment for
periodic road maintenance with their initial stock of spare parts financed
by EEC in the amount of US$1.7 million will be procured following EEC Guide-
lines. Procurement procedures have been agreed upon with the Government.
Disbursements
47.       The proposed IDA Credit of US$5.0 million would be disbursed
against 100 percent of total expenditures for purchase of part of periodic
maintenance equipment, as well as spare parts and the weighing bridge;
operating costs of backlog periodic maintenance of laterite roads; technical
assistance and the scholarship for a Gambian student; the follow-up road
maintenance study and the aggregate study; and reimbursement of the PPF. EEC
funds will be disbursed against 100 percent of total expenditures for routine
maintenance equipment and part of periodic maintenance equipment, as well as
a stock of spare parts. Disbursements will be fully documented, except for
operating costs for periodic maintenance of 190 km laterite roads, where
disbursements will be made against a certified statement of expenditures
for which the documentation will be retained by the Ministrv of Works and
Communications for scrutiny by the Association's missions. These operating
costs will be reflected in separate accounts which will be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
Benefits and Risks
48.       Development of a reliable transport network within The Gambia and
reduction of transport costs are of prime importance to the country's economic
development. Because roads handle about 60 percent of The Gambia's freight
transport and almost all passenger transport, the maintenance and improvement
of the road network is a basic prerequisite for future economic growth. The
investments in road maintenance proposed in this project are justified by
savings in vehicle operating costs alone. However, the program is also
expected to defer costly road reconstruction and to produce an increase
in marketed agricultural production. The combined routine and periodic
maintenance pr-ogram is expected to yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of
about 67 percent. The routine maintenance program (780 km) is estimated to
have an ERR of 88 percent. The ERR for periodic maintenance (190 km) is
estimated at 16 percent. Even if the routine road maintenance program were
reduced to 650 km, it would still yield an ERR of 49 percent. With respect
to the regravelling operation, a 30 percent reduction in the annual regravel-
ling output (45 km/year) would lower the economic return to a still accept-
able 11 percent.
49.       The major beneficiaries of the improved condition of the road
network would be farmers living near the project's roads and passengers using
them. The benefits would derive from vehicle operating cost savings to



- 15 -
truck owners and operators who, because of competition in the road transport
industry, would pass these savings on. Private car and taxi owners would
also benefit from reduced vehicle operating costs.
50.       There are no major risks anticipated in the course of project
execution. Deterioration of The Gambia's economic situation, however, could
limit road maintenance funds. Moreover, possible increases in capital costs
and lower than expected results from the on-the-job training program in
PWD could have repercussions on the efficient use of equipment and on road
maintenance productivity. The project would be closely monitored through
progress reports, audits, and the technical assistance to PWD's field divi-
sions to limit the possibility of these and other risks impeding its suc-
cessful implementation.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of The
Gambia and the Association, the draft EEC Special Action Credit Agreement
between the Republic of The Gambia and the Association as Administrator of
the EEC Special Action Account established with funds contributed by the
member states of the EEC, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
52.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement and the draft Special
Action Credit Agreement of special interest are listed in paragraphs 28-45
and in Section III of Annex III. A Condition of Effectiveness of the pro-
posed IDA Credit would be the Government's fulfillment of all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the EEC Special Action Credit Agreement.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed draft Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and that the pro-
posed EEC Special Action Credit would comply with the criteria established by
the Agreement between the Association, the EEC and its member states dated
May 2, 1978.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credits.

B.   Projects In Execution*
Cr. No. 602   Infrastructure and Tourism Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of
January 12, 1976; Effective Date: December 16, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981.
The project provides basic infrastructure for tourism development,
expansion of public utilities, and technical asssistance to The Gambia
Utilities Corporation (GUC). The physical components of the project are on
the whole being implemented satifactorily, the only exception being delays
in implementing the electricity component. The management and worsening
financial performance of the GUC continue to give cause for concern.
Cr. No. 644    Rural Development Project:  US$4.1 Million Credit of July
19, 1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976; Closing Date:
September 30, 1981.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The building construc-
tion program is complete and evaluation of performance of the first cropping
year is being undertaken. Response by farmers to input availability has been
satisfactory. A problem of continued Government financing for the Livestock
Marketing Board has become apparent which the Government is taking appro-
priate steps to alleviate. Preparation of the Phase II Rural Development
Project is on schedule with appraisal tentatively scheduled for Fall 1979.
Cr. No. 792-GM Gambia Education Project: US$5.5 Million Credit of May 26,
1978; Effectiveness Date: October 26, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The project became effective in October 1978, about two months after
the target date. The Project Unit has been established and is being staffed.
Progress in architectural designs is behind schedule because of the delay in
effectiveness. Recruitment of technical assistance personnel for education
and health planning has begun and proposals for training secondary teachers
of science and practical subjects are being finalized. With the staffing of
the Project Unit nearing completion, it is expected that the pace of imple-
mentation will improve.
*    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 814-GM Rural and Urban Enterprises Project: US$3 Million Credit of
May 26, 1978; Effectiveness Date: September 29, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Since the project became effective on September 29, 1978, progress
in implementation has been satisfactory except for some moderate technical
problems with construction of GCDB's office buildings. GCDB the local
financial intermediary under the project has so far submitted 18 small-scale
industrial and agricultural loans for approval by IDA. Recruitment of con-
sultants to undertake studies of GCDB's accounting system and housing finance
as well as technical advisors for GCDB is underway.
