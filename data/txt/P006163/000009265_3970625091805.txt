MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BOLIVIA
FOR THE POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Bolivia
for SDR 5.3 million (US$6.8 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit will be on standard IDA terms and help to rehabilitate
the Bolivian power system. The proceeds of the credit will be relent to
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDE) by the Government of Bolivia
at an interest rate of 8.51 for a ternm of 20 years including 4 years of
grace. The exchange risk to the US dollar will be borne by ENDE.
2.       Sectoral Background.   The power sector in Bolivia faces serious
difficulties arising from sector policy weaknesses and from the
deterioration of the Bolivian economy between 1981-1986. As part of its
recovery program, the Government recognizes that in order to minimize the
constraints imposed by a weak power sector, a sound financial position will
have to be restored, the investments needed for the power expansion program
will have to follow a least-cost sequence and sector organization will have
to be improved. Agreement to tackle the most urgent financial issues
(ENDE's rate increases and capitalization of debt by enactment of Decree
21,527) was reached in the context of the Reconstruction Import Credit
(RIC) approved by IDA in FY1986 and satisfactory actions on these issues
were taken prior to negotiations on the proposed credit. Other important
policy issues - sector expansion master plan, regulation and organization
of the sector - are addressed in the proposed project.
3.       ENDE Is responsible for generation and transmission while regional
companies are responsible for distribution, except in the cities of La Paz
and Oruro, where the Bolivian Power Company (COBEE-BPC), a private foreign
owned company, operates its own generation and distribution facilities.
COBEE-BPC's concession will expire in 1990 and the responsibility for
electricity supply in these areas after that date has not yet been defined,
resulting in lack of investments in the distribution system of La Paz. The
Government has agreed to keep the Association informed about the progress
and outcome of its negotiations with COBEE-BPC about responsibility for the
concession after 1990.
4.       Power sector regulation was deeply affected in 1985, when it was
established that ENDE and the distribution companies should negotiate
wholesale rates and the latter should negotiate their retail tariffs with
the consumers represented by the city councils.  These agreements have been
very difficult to reach. The Government has now agreed that it will
restore sector regulation based on sound utility principles and that
tariffs will be set by Direccion Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) of the
Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons.
5.       Power sector planning is currently not based on a least cost long
range expansion program. Under the proposed project, ENDE will prepare a
Power Expansion Master Plan, satisfactory to IDA, taking into consideration
the conclusions of an on-going energy strategy study executed by the Bank



and financed by UNDP. Based on a satisfactory expansion program, on the
results of the energy exercise, and on a revaluation of assets study that
ENDE will carry out, a plan of action will be presented to IDA to implement
new tariff structures based on sound utility principles and to improve the
level of electricity rates of all power companies.
6.       Project Objectives.   The objectives of the proposed project are:
(i) to rehabilitate ElDE's power system by overhauling defective generation
units, carrying out delayed maintenance, eliminating transmission
bottlenecks, and increasing ENDE's operational efficiency; and (ii) to
improve sector regulation, planning and institutional framework.
7.       Project Description.  The project will have the following major
components:
(a) Acquisition of spare parts and equipment for the 1987-1989
maintenance program of ENDE's facilities, mainly the overhaul of
its generating units;
(b) Construction of Alalay (Cochabamba-25 MVA) and Urbana Sur (Santa
Cruz-25 MVA) new substations and modifications in Potosi and
Telemayo substations changing voltage from 69 kV to 115 kV;
(c)  Construction of 8.5 km subtransmission line 69 kV Huaracachi -
Substation Sur to close the subtransmission loop of Santa Cruz;
(d) Preparation of a Power Expansion Master Plan defining the least
cost expansion program for the power sector up to year 2010;
(e)  Technical assistance involving: (i) engineering consultants to
help ENDE in the execution of the project; and (ii) management
consultants to prepare a methodology for revaluation of ENDE's
assets, and to develop an information system for accounting,
financial management, inventories, construction and maintenance.
8.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$8.74
million equivalent, including taxes and duties of US$1.11 million. Foreign
exchange costs are estimated at US$6.80 million. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank group operations in Bolivia are given in
Schedule C and D respectively. The staff appraisal report, No. 6636-BO
dated Nay 7, 1987, has been circulated separately.
9.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The most urgent needs for
rehabilitation of the sector were funded through the RIC. The proposed
credit completes the rehabilitation phase and initiates required policy
adjustment and institutional reforms in the sector. IDA's continued
involvement is expected to serve as a catalyst for the participation of
other donors.
10.      Agreed Actions:  The Government and ENDE have agreed on the
following actions: (i) to implement Decree No. 21,527, in accordance with
its terms, increasing ENDE's rates by 1.5Z per month (in US dollar terms);
(ii) to re-establish DINE's responsibility for setting tariffs in



accordance with the National Electricity Code; (iii) to submit to IDA, by
October 1988 a plan of action to improve the structure and level of
electricity rates of all power companies; (iv) to submit to IDA by
September 1988 the final version of the Power Expansion Master Plan; (v) to
inform the Association, on a quarterly basis, on the progress of
negotiations with COBEE-BPC and before December 1988 to furnish to the
Association a plan of action with respect to the provisions of future
electricity supply in La Paz and Oruro; (vi) to make ENDE responsible for
sector planning, and for construction and operation of all transmission
facilities and generation plants over 5 MW transfering to distribution
companies the operation of small generation units; (vii) to submit to the
Association a satisfactory proposal for the distribution of ENDE's shares
previously owned by CBD; (viii) to sign a subsidiary loan agreement
satisfactory to the Association.
12.      Justification.  The project will allow ENDE to make better use of
installed generation capacity by increasing the availability of existing
units and by removing bottlenecks in the transmission system thereby making
the system more efficient and responsive to demand changes. The rate of
return is estimated to be around 13.52.
13.      Risks.  No special implementation risks are involved as ENDE has
implemented similar projects in the past without major problems. The risks
involved in the proposed institutional reform have been minimized by
extensive consultation and detailed active planning.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit will
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
