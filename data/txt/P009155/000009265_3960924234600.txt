NAFTAGAS PIPELINE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
Naftagas Pipeline Project, loan 916-YU, was signed on June 25,
1973. Out of the loan amount, US$59.4 million, steps have been taken to
cancel US$1,116,000 during the first half of 1986. To cover extraordinary
cost increases and to ensure the gas supply needed for the Sarajevo Air
Pollution Project, an additional $11.0 million loan for the project, the
second tranche of Loan 1264-YU, was signed on June 8S 1976, and was fully dis-
bursed in June 1982, except for US$97,1700 which was cancelled.
This Project Completion Report (PCR), prepared by the Energy Depart-
ment, is ba&sd on documents in the Bank's files, the findings of a Bank
mission which visited Yugoslavia in Septeaber/October 1985 and documents and
data furnished by the Bcrrowers. Naftagas-Gas Unit (NGU) submitted a
completion report giving its views on the project implementation, which have
been taken into account.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following atandard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government and the Borrower. Comments received from Naftagas-Gas and
Energogas have been reproduced as Attachments A and B to the report.

The project cost was estimated at US$130.4 million, of which US$59.4 in
foreign exchange.
2.       By 1974/5, the cost of steel had increased to about US$1,000 per ton
from about US$350 per ton at the time of appraisal and it became clear that
NGU's financial resources would be insufficient to carry out the project as
appraised. The Bank, therefore, agreed to amend the Loan Agreement in June
1976, substantially reducing the project scope by excluding the southern part
of the pipeline. A supplementary Bank Loan (1264-2-YU) of US$11.0 million was
made available to NGU and additional financing from local sources was obtained
to ensure the fund.ng of the reduced project.
3.       Subsequently, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution and 1976 Law on
Associated Labour led to a regional split up of NGU, with the former NCU
affiliate, Butangas (now &aergogas) being established as a separate legal
entity for gas operations in Serbia. After a reevaluation of the project in
1980, and a reappraisal of its financial aspects, the Bank agreed to a second
amendment and the Loan was apportioned between NGU and the new borrower
Butangas.
4.       The above amendments to the project, necessitated by external factors
that could not have been foreseen et -.ae project appraisal, delayed the
project execution by about four and a 'elf y ars. The project was further
delayed mainly by the complicapted local tpproval process for procurement,
especially the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The
final project cost was US$199.1 million dollars, which is about 52% over the
originally appraised cost for a substantially larger project but about 8%
below the 1980 reappraisal estimates.
5.       Despite cost increases, delayed implementation and other problems en-
countered during project execution, the main project objectives were met or
excieded.  The BorroNer increased gas supplies in Vojvolina and Serbia from
about 700 million NM is 1974 to about 2,800 million NM in 1985 (in addition
to about 525 million NM  for Sarajevo) and is expected to supply 4,400 million
NM3 in 1990 (in addition to 850 million NM3 for Sarajevo). The financial
performance of the Borrowers improved under the project and the economic
internal rate of return of the project, as executed, is now estimated at 29%
(in 1985 real terms), which compares favourably with the 23% estimated in 1973
for the original project.



YUGOSLAVIA
NAFTAGAS PIPELINE PROJilCT - LOANS 916-YU AND 1264-2-YU
COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01     Due to rapid increase in energy demand before the first oil crisis
and high cost of liquid fuels, the Federal Government decided to provide
natural gas as a lower cost alternative source of energy for a wide range of
consumers. The Naftagas pipeline project provided the necessary infra-
structure to realize Government's plans for increased use of domestic and
imported natural gas. In addition to providing badly needed foreign exchange
for the project, the Bank's involvement was justified by its assistance to
Government and NGU in formulating an integral energy sector approach to the
natural gas development and by the institution building of NGU provided under
the project.
1.02     Since appraisal in 1972/73, the Naftagas pipeline project was subject
to substantial changes in project scope, borrowing institutions, and
financing. A summary description of main project events is given below.
1.03     The project was presented to the Bank's Board on June 19, 1973 and
the loan was made effective in March 1974. Due to accelerated worldwide in-
flatinn, in the aftermath of the first oil crisis, the cost of steel increased
from about US$350 per ton at the time of appraisal to about US$1,000 per ton
in 1974/75. The borrower, Naftagas-Cas Unit (NGU), was unable to secure addi-
'ional foreign financing to cover the revised higher project cost, and pro-
curement was stopped. To enable the project to go ahead, the Bank agreed in
June 1976 to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
-  The Southern part of the pipeline (Paracin to Nis) was excluded from
the project to be considered under future investment programs;
-  A supplementary Bank loan (1264-2-YU) of US$11.0 million, under the
Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project approved on May 25, 1976, was
made available for tinancing part of zhe project (Batajnica to
Zvornik pipeline); and
- Additional financing was obtained from Beogradska Banka, the
provinces of Serbia, Vojvodina, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and commercial
sources for the local costs of the scaled down project.
The above revisions delayed the start of the project by about two and a half
years and the closing date of the Loan 916-YU was extended from June 1977 to
December 1979. However, slower than projected procurement and construction
delays, especially for the Serbian part of the pipeline, made another exten-
sion of the closing date (to June 1981) necessary.
1.04     The Yugoslav Constitution of 1974 and new Law on Associated Labour of
1976 institutionalized a system of workers' self-management and also started a
movement towards decentralization and more regional autonomy. Against this
background, a former NGU affiliate, Butangas with operations in Serbia, became



- 2 -
an independent Work Organization qf Associated Labor (WOAL) within the
conglomerate Naftagas Kombinat. 1   The Government of Serbia, therefore,
proposed that the Serbian part of the project be implemented and operated by
Butangas. After Bank reappraisal of the financial aspects of the project, the
following second amendment to the project was agreed in January 1981 between
the Government, Borrowers and the Bank:
-  Butangas took over all NGU's gas operations in Serbia, Macedonia,
Montenegro and Kosoro and assumed responsibility for that part of the
project (i.e. the Batajnica to Paracin pipeline) together with
corresponding obligations towards the Bank;
-  Butangas was made a joint borrower with NGU under the Bank loan 916-
YU (similar to the Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project loan
1264-2-YU, under which NGU and the Sarajevo Gas Enterprise (SGE) were
joint borrowers); and
-  The total amount of Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million, was apportioned
providing US$37.0 million for NGU and US$22.4 million for Butangas.
The above changes were primarily organizational and did not alter the
technical, institutional and economic objectives of the project. However,
this reorganization and amendments to the loan documents caused further delays
of about two years in the completion of the Serbian part of the pipeline, and
the closing date of Loan 916-YU was extended, this time to June 1983.
1.05     However, NGU/Butangas had stopped processing project procurement
waiting for the conclusion of the second amendment.  The validity of bids for
the SCADA equipment expired and NGU/Butangas hesitaLed to retender as dis-
bursement for this part of the project could not be completed by 1983. After
some deliberation, the Bank finally extended the closing date of the project
to June 1985, but limited disbursement to the outstanding SCADA system
contracts only.
1.06     In June 1984 Butangas and its Basic Organization of Associated Labour
(BOAL), Butangas-Promet, Titograd, merged and assumed the name 'Energogas', a
work organization without BOALs. The Loan Agreement was amended accordingly
in October, 1985. Apart from some simplification in accounting and admini-
strative procedures, this change of name did not materially affect the
project.
17  Naftagas Kombinat is the second largest Composite Organization of
Associated Labor (COAL) in Yugoslavia. A COAL consists of a number of
WOALs and a WOAL consists of a number of Basic Organizations of Labour
(BOAL).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     Due to the rapid increase in demand for tn-  .- Arido the growing trend
to change from the use of solid fuels to impotted pettroie.'m proAuctst the
Federal Government recommended the development of indigenous hydrocarhon
fuels, particularly natural gas. Natural gas in the northeastern patt of
Vojvodina had been only partly developed for lack of resources to expand atid
improve gas treatment, transmission and distribution facilities. Studies
showed that natural gas could economically meet a larger share of energy
demand in eastern Yugoslavia provided a gas transmission and distribution
system was constructed to handle locally produced gas and gas imported from
USSR under arrangements then being negotiated in the early 1970s.
2,02     Natural gns utilization in Vojvodina and Serbia was conceived as a
substitute for imported liquid fuels which, apart from being more expensive
than gas, also incurred high inland transport costs. Gas, as a cleaner fuel,
could b. used as feedstock in the chemical industry as well as for commercial
and domestic consumers, replacing the higher cost liquid fuels.  The long to
plan of the Federal Covernment was to provide natural gas as a lower cost
alternative source of energy for a wide range of consumers.  Other important
government considerations included air pollution control and improvement in
industrial product quality.
Project Preparation
2.03     The gas development plan (paras. 2.07 and 2.08) was identified in
1971 and the Bank preappraised the project in July, 1972, in response to the
Government's request for Bank fiancing of the proposed de.alopment of the gas
transmission and distribution system. The project was appraised in November,
1972 with the assistance of two consultants followed by a post appraisal
mission in January 1973. The loan agreement was signed on June 25, 1973 and
the loan was declared effective on March 21, 1974.
2.04     The central issues of the project were:  adequacy of domestic and
foreign gas supplies and market demand for natural gas, required amounts and
sources of financing, institutional arrangements, and use of consultants. To
ensure adequate gas supplies, domestic exploration activities were reviewed
and domestic gas reserves were evaluated during the project preparation and,
in line with the Bank's recommendations, NUU signed in May 1973 a long-term
agreement with the Naftagas Productiog Unit for supply of domestic gas and,
subsequently, an agreement with USSR _' for gas supplies during 1977-92. The
gas quantities in these supply contracts assumed a quadrupling of gas con-
The USSR contract was covered by a non-disclosure agreement and the Bank
did not have an opportunity to review this sales contract, but wag
informed by NCU that it provided for a total of up to 35,000 MMNm'
in 1977-92, at a competitive price linked to the oil price and that 501 of
this gas would be paid for with Yugoslav goods under barter arrangements
The original contract bas now been amnded to cover additional gas-
supplies beyond 1992.



-4-
sumption during the project period.  The projected gas consumption was based
on a market survey of the potential gas demand in Vojvodina and Serbia carried
out by the Borrower, assited by consultanta and supported by the Bank. Demand
projections proved to be correct, even if the actual gas supply lagged fore-
casts due to delays in project execution.
2.05     The financial package for the project was a major hurdle.  After
negotiations between the concerned parties, financing/grant agreements were
signed in 1972 between NGU dnd the Republic of Serbia, the Province of
Vojvodina and the Beogradska Banka. During nr3otiations, the originally pro-
posed Bank Loan of US$52 million was increasel to US$59.4 million to ensure
full financing of the project. An administration and financing agreement,
setting out the rigi,ts and obligations regarding project financing and
execution, was signed in June, 1973 between the Bank, NGU and Beogradaka
Banka.
2.06     To ensure NGU's independant legal status, e.g. for concluding gas
supply contracts, the signing of a self management agreement between NCU and
Naftagas Kombinat according to Yugoslav law was made a condition of effective-
ness. Furthermore, NCU agreed to employ consultants to strengthen its
accounting, audit, and management systems and US$0.5 million of the Loan
amount was set aside for training of the external ^uditor's staff. As
engineering consultants were needed before Loan effectiveness, the Bank agreed
to finance such consultants retroactively.
Prolect's Role in Long-term Plan
2.07     The Federal Government feared that the rapid increase in Yugoslavia's
energy consumption during the 1960s and early 19709 would lead to excessive
reliance on imported crude oil and recommended in its development plan that
greater attention be given to the development of indigenous hydrocarbon fuels,
particularly of natural gas. Studies sponsored by the Governments of Serbia
and Vojvodina and Petrolunion reiterated that while total primary energy de-
mand in Serbia and Vojvodina was expected to increase two and one-half times
between 1970 and 1985, the demand for hydrocarbons would increase by about
five times. The deficit would have to be met primarily by imported crude oil
and refined oil products unless new local natural gas resources were developed
and/or natural gas was imported.
2.08     Surveys in 1971/72 of the energy market in Serbia and Vojvodina
showed that by 1985, natural gas could economically meet 18% of the primary
energy demand in eastern Yugoslavia compared to about 6% in 1970, provided
that a gas transmission and distribution system was constrticted by 1976.
Based upon these studies, Naftagas, which at that time was the only enterprise
dealing with oil and gas production as well as gas transmission and distri-
bution in Serbia and Vojvodina, prepared a long-term plan for the development
of hydrocarbons in eastern Yugoslavia, including the exploitation of the
existing natural gas reserves. The Naftagas pipeline project provided the
necessary infrastructure to realise these plans for increased use of n#tural
gas.



Project Description
2.09     The project, as conceived, provided for the procurement and con-
struction of:
(i)    A main pipeline from Horgos on the Hungarian border and fokrin
in Vojvodina through Belgrade and Paracin to Nis, about 200 km
south of Belgrade. (The Paracin to Nis pipeline was later
excluded from the project, see para 3.01);
(ii)    Several branch lines, including one from Batajnica, just north
of Belgrade, to Loznica on the border between Serbia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina;
(iii)    Field compressors and supply pipelines from gas fields to the
main pipeline;
(iv)    Distribution pipelines to consumers;
(v)    Two gas treatment plants and LPC recovery;
(vi)    Distribution rings;
(vii)    Automated central dispatch station with SCADA systems; and
(viii)    Technical assistance for the Borrower and the Social Accounting
Service (SAS/SDK - the Government's auditing branch).
2.10     The project was designed to expand the Borroier's natural gas trans-
mission and distribution capacity from 700 million NM per year to about 2,500
million NM  per year. The system was intended to handle forecast peak loads
and to  armit further expansion with t e addition of line compressors to reach
a maxin ^ capacity of 4,750 million NM per year. As a core project in the
long-term plan of Naftagas, the project for which the Bank assistance had been
requested consisted of the construction of gas treatment, transmission and
distribution facilities. With the eventual addition of line compressors in
1980 and 1985, these facilities were expected to serve the demand of 145 major
industrial consumers in Serbia and Vojvodina in 1992.
Project Covenants and Amendments
2.11     The Loan Agreement dated June 25, 1973 provided for the following
main covenants:
Section 3.02: a subsidiary Loan Agreement between NGU and SAS;
Section 3.03: NCU to employ engineering and accounting consultants;
Section 3.09S  NCU to hire consultants to carry out a tariff study fqr
natural gas;
Section 3.11t  NCU to submit by October 31, 1974, evidence of gas supply
ag5eements with US.S.Ra. and Hungary for up to 35 billion
NM during the period of 1977 through 1992;



-6-
Section 3.12: NGU to employ consultants for review of the Production
Unit's exploration, drilling and production activities and
program;
The above covenants were generally complied with. The Bank agreed in 1981,
however, to delete by amendement Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement, as SAS
had been able to finance its training arrangements from other sources. For
comments on the compliance with Section 3.03, see paras. 6.08 and 6.09, and
for the financial covenants, see para 5.09.
2.12     The first amendment to the Loan Agreement, dated June 8, 1976,
included the following main additions to ensure adequate financing of the
project:
-   Beogradska Bank to increase its loan amount to ensure the
completion of the project; and
-   the independent Production Unit of Naftagas to increase its equity
contribution;
2.13     The second amending agreement dated January 22, 1981, included the
following main changes to reflect the split up of the original Borrower into
two Borrowers:
-   Butangas to carry out the Serbian part of the project and to assume
the corresponding obligations towards the Bank;
-   NGU to transfer to Butangas certain project assets pertaining to the
Serbian part of the pipeline, amounting to US$6.3 million equivalent;
and
-   Butangas to assume the same obligations as NCU did under the original
Loan Agreement, inter alia: execution of the project, management and
operation, financial covenants and others.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Revisions to the Project
3.01     In 197415, following the energy crisis, it became clear that the pro-
ject could not be executed as planned due to the unforeseen sharp rise in
steel prices from about US$ 350 per ton to about US$ 1,000 per ton, which
occurred between appraisal in early 1973 and receipt of bids in 1974/5. The
Government re-examined its priorities and decided that gas should be used on a
priority basis as feedstock for the chemical industry (particularly fertilizer
plants in Vojvodina) and as domestic fuel in Sarajevo to help combat the
severe air pollution problems. The Government reviewed the gas development
program in 1975 and proposed to divide the originally appraised project into
the following three phases:
Phase I:
The main gas transmission pipeline from Horgos and Mokrin through
Batajnica (north of Belgrade) to Paracin, including gas treatment and
distribution facilities;



-7-
Phase II1
The gas transmission pipeline from Batajnica to Zvornik (on the
border to Bosnia-Herzegovina) and a compressor station to meet the
needs of consumers along the pipeline and in the city of Sarajevol
Phase III:
The gas transmission pipeline from Paracin to Nis, compressor
stations and distribution facilities.
3.02     The Governmerst proposed and the Bank agreed (June 8, 1976) to finance
phase I under the existing loan (Loan 916-YU) and phase II under the Sarajevo
Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU). Phase III would be constructed
at a later stage, subject to the availability of funds and additional gas
supplies. Construction of this phase has not yet been initiated. A map is
attached indicating the final stretch of project pipelines.
Project Implementation
3.03     Procurement and construction took place for Phase I mostly from 1974
to 1977 and for Phase It from 1977-1979. By the end of 1979 the first section
of the gas transmission pipeline from Horgos and Mokrin '-" HtRjnica and the
pipeline from Batajnica to Zvornik were completed and in operation.
3.04     During 1979, as a consequence of the 1974 constitutional changes and
subsequent new Law on Associated Labour, economic enterprises were de-
centralized and responsibilities were regionalized. The Federal Republic and
Provincial authorities decided to entrust the construction of the Batajnica-
Paracin pipeline to a Serbian based enterprise, Butangas. In view of the
explanations given by a Yugoslav delegation visiting Washington in February
1980, the Bank agreed to amend the loan agreement, after reappraising the new
entity (Butangas) to ascertain its ability to carry out the remaining work
under the project. the second amending agreement was concluded on January 22,
1981.
3.05     Phase 1 of the project was, therefore, divided into the following two
partes
-    Part "A", to be carried out by NGU and designed to expand the natural
gas transmission and distribution facilities to transport an
additional 29Q0 million NMI of gas per year in eastern Yugoslavia, of
which 1700 NMJ per year to Serbia and 320 million NMJ per year to
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the remainder within Vojvodina (this is an in-
crease as compared with the original scope, para 2.10); and
-    Part "B", to be carried out by Butangas and consisting of gas
transmission and distribution facilities to supply 1700 million N
of gas in Serbia to 29 industrial consumers in 13 cities located
along the pipeline.
3.06     The reorganization of the Borrower/s, reappraisal and negotiati6ns
with the Bank further delayed project execution, especially in Serbia, and the
closing date was again revised (to June 1983). However, the Borrowers had



stopped the processing of project procurement until the negotiations with the
Bank of the second amendment were concluded. The validity of bids for the
SCADA system expired and this equipment had to be retendered, which caused
more delays. The closing date was, therefore, further extended to June 30,
1985, but this time to cover remaining payments under the contracts for the
SCADA system only.
Project Cost
3.07     Estimated and actual costs for the project are as follows:
Local             Fore gn            Total
Project Phase        Ap,pr 4L-u         Actual Pr,[         Appr.  Actual

1/  The 1980 reappraisal of the project in which Phase I was divided into
parts A and B (paras 3.01 and 3.05).  The original cost estimate of 1973
(local US$71.0 million and foreign US$59.4 million) is not comparable with
actual costs, due to the changes in project scope.
3.08     Mainly due to the threefold increase in the price of steel, the
actual cost of the project exceeded tha original cost estimate of 1973 by over
50%, despite the reduction in project scope. Compared with the revised cost
estimate of 1980, however, there was a cost underrun of about 8Z. The foreign
costs of the project turned out as estimated in 1980 and the cost underruns
occurred in the local costs. However, the lower than expected US$ equivalent
of local costs was due to the sharp devaluation of the Din - from 17 Din/US$
in 1974 to 42 Din/US$ in 1981 and 280 Din/US$ in 1985S. Most of the local
costs were for salaries and wages, which increased at a much lower rate than
the Din devaluation. Therefore, although local costs expressed in Din are
higher than appraised, the equivalent in US$ is lower.
3.09     The project underwent a series of changes which delayed its
completion far beyond appraisal estimate. The main reasons are susmarized
below:
(a)  the sharp cost increases in 1974/5, especially for steel line pipe,
made it necessary to reduce the project scope to keep the project
cost within available financial resources. This delayed project
start up by about two and a half years;
(b)  early in the project, local contractors were not adequately equipped
in terms of working crew numbers; this problem was solved late, in
the project;



-9
(c) labour laws and regulations were not sufficiently flexible to cope
with the need for longer working hours, shift work and labour
movements from one province to another;
td) procurement of foreign goods was delayed by a complicated local
approval process and retendering (para 3.06), which delayed project
completion by about two years;
(e) customer conversion to natural gas was in some instances delayed due
to lack of financing; and
(f)  the reorganization of Yugoslav enterprises, including NGU, after the
introduction of the 1974 constitution and 1976 laws on associated
labour delayed the project execution, especially its Serbian part,. by
about two years.
Performance of Consultants
3.10     The project components requiring technical assistance and consultants
covered the following activities s
(i)    Main gas transmission and distribution;
(,1)    Gas treating and LPG recovery;
(iLL)    Telecommunication 8cada system;
(iv)    Project management including construction supervision, lnspectlon and
commissioning; carried out by a local firm..
The consultants' performance was on the whole satiofactory apart from pressure
design and a few unqualified foreign personnel assigned to supervision of
field work. A detailed study was made of the pressure rating design and a
lower pressure rating was opted for. The recommendation made - and the
eventual decision - on this matter was less than adequate, since it restricted
the potential for increasing pipeline capacity (see also para. 7.07).
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The Natural Gas Market
4.01     Consumption of natural gas in Yugoslavia increased at an average
annual rate of about 18% between 1975-80, mainly because of increaoed
availability of natural gas and encouragement from Government out of concern
for the balance of payments (50% of Soviet gas imports are paid for with
Yugoslav goods). Low prices for domestic gas in Croatia and Vojvodina also-
stimulated demand. Due to supply constraints, the average anwal consumptton
increase moderated to about 12Z as from 1981.



- 10 -
4.02     Gas consumption in Vojvodina (NGU) increased from about 780 MMm3 in
1975 to about 1,150 MMm3 in 1980, an average annual increase of 8.1%, and in
1985 to about 2,200 MMm3, an average annual increase in 1980-85 of nearly
14%.  In Serbia (Butangas;Energogas), gas consumption increased from nothing
in 1980 to about 620 MMm3 in 1985 and is expected to go on increasing at a
high rate during the coming five years. In Bosnia Herzegovina, SGE consumed
about 525 MMm3 in 1985. Gas consumption for main consumer categories in
Vojvodina and Serbia in 1985 is given below (1982 figures for Yugoslavia as a
whole are given for comparison):

4.03     Despite strong demand, sales of natural gas in Serbia and Vojvodina
was constrained by the delays in completion of the pipelines financed under
the project. Gas demand was strong in Serbia, where only higher priced
imported natural gas is distributed, and the lower price of domestic gas sold
in Vojvodina appears to have Increased demand only slightly. NGU expects to
increase gas sales to 2,900 MMm3 in 1990, an annual increase of only 5.5% in
1985-90, and Energogas to 1,500 MMm3, an annual increase of over 19%. NGU's
conservative projections of gas sales reflect concerns about domestic and
foreign gas supplies and the limited capacity of existing pipelines rather
than lack of demand.  SGE consumption is expected to reach about 850 MMOm in
1990.
Safety of Supply
4.04     During peak winter consumption, some consumers, especially in Serbia,
have occasionally experienced low gas pressures, mainly due to Russian gas
being delivered at a below normal pressure. For safety reasons the
Vojvodina/Serbia gas transmission system should provide for connection to the
national gas grid, giving a back-up system for critical gas consumers to meet
emnergency situations. However, at the design of the Vojvodina/Servia gas
system, no alternative gas sources (e.g. recently contracted Algerian gas)
were available.
Project's Impact
4.05     The major items of the NGU part of the project were completed in
1979-80. This is reflected in the jump in the average annual increase in
natural gas consumption in Vojvodina (from 8% before 1980 to 14% after 1980)
(see para. 4.02.) No natural gas was distributed in Serbia before the pipe-



- 11 -
line system, financed under the project, was completed. The project thus made
a substantial contribution to industrial development by supplying natural gas
to consumers in Vojvodina and Serbia which equalled or surpassed original ex-
pectations (para 2.10). It has also had a beneficial impact on the quality of
certain manufactured products, air pollution and rail and road congestion (see
paras. 7.02-7.03).
V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Background
5.01     At the time of appraisal in 1973, the financial projections for NCU
were based on the assumption that the project construction would be completed
by mid-1976. As explained in para 3.03, the NGU part of the pipeline was
actually commissioned in 1979 to supply Vojvodina and Sarajevo, and the
Butangas/Energogas part for Serbia in 1982. The delay in project execution,
change in project scope and reorganization of the Borrower/s, makes it diffi-
cult to compare the original financial projections with the outcome in a
meaningful way. Local inflation and substantial devaluations of the Din
against major currencies (para 3.08) during the long project period further
distort comparisons. NGU's financial statements for FY75-84 are therefore
compared with the 1973 SAR estimates upto 1979 and Re-Appraisal estimates as
from 1980 (Annexes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.). Butangas/Energogas' financial state-
ments for FY80-84. together with the corresponding 1980 Re-Appraisal esti-
mates, are given in Annexes 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
5.02     The volumes of gas sold as forecast in the 1973 SAR and 1980 Re-
Appraisal and actual volumes, are summarized in Table V (1) below:

price would be Din. 0.41 per Nm  in real terms as from 1974 and that the
avgrage cost for imported gas would be 0.29 per NmJ in real terms and 0.27 per
Nm  per for domestically produced gas.  The table below indicates the struc-
ture of prices of natural gas in 1974, at the 1980 Re-Appraisal, and in 1985.

Customers are billed for the actual cost of gas sold to them, whether imported
or produced domestically, plus a fee for transportation and operation of the
distribution system. As a result, capital and vperating expenditures are
recovered and the transportation fee provides a margin for profits.
Operating Results
5.04     NGU's and Energogas' flnancial statements and corresponding appraisal
estimates are given in Annex 3. However, as indicated in previous paragraphs,
it is diffiesilt to compare actual financial performance with 1973 SAR and 1980
Re-Appraisal projections because of changes In project scope, high inflation,
and frequent devaluations of the Dinar during the project period. Some key
financial ratios, however, are given in the table below:

Therefore, financial rate of return estivates for 19R6 ap  S^h  ---



- 13 -
The above rate of return is calculated on the average value of net fixed assets in
operation (opening value plus closing value divided by two), which is different from
the covenanted rate of return concept (see para. 5.09). In Annex 3, rates of
returns have been calculated also on the covenanted basis (gross fixed assets at end
of each month plus opening value divided by 13).
5.05     The differences between appraised and actual ratios are mainly due to
the following factors:
-    The Dinar equivalent for imported natural gas costs increased
more than expected because of high domestic inflation and an
even faster rate of devaluation of the Dinar against major
currencies;
-    the delay in project execution led to lower than projected gas
sales during the project period; and,
-    substantial revaluation adjustments of fixed assets and exchange
losses were booked by NGU/Energogas in accordance with Yugoslav
regulations. This was not foreseen at the appraisal.
5.06     NCU consistently produced a better rate of return on average fixed
assets in operation than estimated in 1973.   This was partly due to transit
charges on gas destined for Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina. Furthermore, a
standard charge equal to two percent of the value of transited gas was charged
to cover transport losses. Actual gas losses did not exceed 0.5 percent.
Snergogas has also shown satisfactory financial results, even if not as good
as projected. Financial ratios are expected to improve and reach projected
levels by 1990, when gas sales would be near the design capacity of the pipe-
line. At the end of FY84, the financial position of both companies was
acceptable with a debt/equity ratio of 57/42 for NGU and 56/44 for Knergogas
(appraisal 46/54) and a current ratio of 1.2 for NCU and of 1.0 for Knergogas.
Financial Covenants
5.07     The Bank agreed with NCU in 1973 and with Energogas in 1980 on
financial objectives to ensure adequate cash generation for the project and
the financial viability of the companies. Covenants were designed to enable
the Borrowers to meet their operating costs, maintain an adequate working
capital, and finance a reasonable part of their expansion program. The main
financial covenants in the Loan Agreement were:
(i)    audited financial statements would be furnishAed to the Bank not
later than six months after the close of each fiscal year;
(ii)    the Borrower would furnish its investment program to the Bank,
for review, at intervals of not less than one year;
(iii)    the Borrower would not incur any long-term debt if future debt
service coverage was going to be less than 1.5 times; and
(iv)    the Borrower would maintain an annual rate of return of at least
- lOZ on the Borrower's average gross value of fixed assetsrin



- 14 -
operation - this average calculated by adding the value at the
end of each month to the opening value and dividing by 13.
5.08     Apart from difficulties during-the early years of the project in
presenting NCU's accounts and audit reports in a form acceptable to the Bank
and the occasional late submission of audited financial statements, both NGU
and Energogas largely complied with the financial covenants. Some comments on
NGU's accounting and audit are given below:
a)   Up to FY79,  NGU was unable to provide the Bank with audited
statements. Unaudited stat2ments according to Yugoslav
accounting laws, and reclassified statements in line with
generally accepted accounting principles, however, were
furnished to the Bank. The main reason for NGU's inability to
supply the Bank with audited statements for FYs74-79 was lack of
trained staff, both for accounting and audit. This deficiency
was largely rectified under the project (see paras. 6.06 to
6.09);
b)   Most financial statements were sent to the Bank by NGU and
Energogas within 6 to 12 months after the end of the fiscal
year. Some statements, however, reached the Bank with more than
a year's delay; and
c)   Up to FY83, SDK, NGU's external auditors, wfre unable to express
an audit opinion on NGU's balance sheet. For FY84, a qualified
opinion was given by SDK on both income ztRtement and balance
sheet.
5.09     In retrospect, it appears that a simpler definition of "average fixed
assets in operation" for rate of return calculations than the one specified in
the Loan Agreement (see paras 5.07) would have been better. As revaluation of
fixed assets in operation and transfer of work in progress to assets in
operation is done only once a year according to Yugoslav accounting regu-
lations, an average based on monthly values understates the rate base.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01     In 1973, the original Borrower, NGU, was a work organization (see
para. 1.04) operating under a self management agreement with Nhaftagas
Kombinat. NCU consisted of three work units (gas treatment, gas pipelines,
and LPG distribution in Serbia) nnd a common services tunit. Operations
covered Serbia and Vojvodina and headquarters were located in Nov Sad,
Vojvodina. In early lS79, one of NCU's work units, Butangas (originally
responsible for LPG distribution), was established as a separate legal entity
for transportation and distribution of both natural gas and LPG in Serbia,
with headquarters in Belgrade. The legal documents for the Bank loan were
amended in January 1981, apportioning to Butangas part of the loan used for
installations in Serbia.
6.02     In June 1984, the work organization Butangas, Belgrade, and the basic
organization of Labour (BOAL) Butangas Promet, Titograd, were merged into one



4~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~+ ,.  -   *** * ..".*  .  -
- 15 -
work organization, Energogas, without BOALs. Apart from some simplification
of administrative and accounting procedures, this was rather a change of name
than a reorganizationt as Energogas took over all Assets, liabilities and
other rights and obligntions from BustAngas and ltutangns lPromet,
6.03     Thie mn:iisgemttt of MAJ was larp,ely compcetent at tile !tnrt of the
project. Butangas/lsiicrgogas, htowever, had to develop a completely new
organization and management from its start in 1979. This was done by taking
over some managers and staff from NCU and by assistance from Naftagas-
Kombinat, e.g. with legal advice, contractingt and procurement. The manage-
ment of both NGU and Energogas is now ftilly competent to operate their
respective gas transmission and distribution systems. The operation of gas
transmission and distribution facilities will improve further once the SCADA
systems are fully operational. Organograms indicating NCU and Energogas'
current structures, are given in Annex 3.5.
Staff Development
6.04     NGU had Adequate expericncc in gas transmission and distribution
before the start of the project, as domestic gas development started in
1963. Ongoing works taken over by Butangas/Energogas were completed with NCU
assistance. A number of experienced NGU staff, who were seconded to
Butangas/Energogas, stayed after the completion of the Serbian part of the
pi'oject and in many cases were given supervisory positions. In this way, new
staff in Butangas/Energogas benefited from the experience of stafi already
*. knowledgeable in gas distribution systems.
*      6.05     The technical and engineering training for the operation and main-
tenance of new materials and equipment provided under the project has mainly
been provided by equipment suppliers as prescribed in their contracts with NGU
and Butangas/Energogas. On-the-job training and visits to equipment manu-
facturers abroad took place with the assistance of consultants and foreign
suppliers.  Three technical staff were trained for 6 months at the compressors
manufacturer in the U.S. during the fabrication of the compressors followed by
two supervisory staff members for two weeks during the acceptance tests.
Similar training of NCU staff toc% place at the SCADA system supplier in Rome.,
Italy, where 7 qualified staff members were trained for 10 weeks in the
operation and maintenance of the hardware units. For the telecommunication
system, three persons were trained in Denmark for two weeks. Energogas
training was mainly limited to the equipment suppliers of metering and control
stations. SCADA system training was mainly performed in Belgrade by the local
supplier, Iscra, and in llolland by Gas Unie.
6.06     Accounting and adminintrntive systemn werc reviewed by Econionic
Butreau, Bclgrnle, an.l NCU staff were trained by SAS in cooperAtion with
aincounting constaltatits (Cooper And L.ybrands).  Purthermore, SDK asninted NCU
and Butangan/Energogas in preparing their commercial financial statements for
reporting to the Bank. These arrangements provided the necessary transfer of
know-how to the financial and administrative staff of both gas compani,  and
resulted in a noticeably improved financial reporting towards the end of the
project period.                                                       -
6.07     NCU is currently further consolidating its management information and
accounting systema through the introduction of a central computer and



- 16 -
terminals in its eleven BOALs. This computerized system is expected to
simplify and reduce delays in reporting and in consolidation of financial
information submitted by each BOAL and to provide the necessary basis for an
adequate cost accounting. The implementation of the system will start in
1986. Energogas will use part of the SCADA system's computer facilities also
for administrative purposes.
Management Consultants and Covenants
6.08     Under the 1973 Loan Agreement, NGU was required to employ consultants
to help improve its accounting, management information, and internal audit
systems and also provide SAS staff with necessary training. US$500,000, to
cover an estimated 200 man-months of consultancy, was included in the ?roject
cost for this purpose and terms of reference were agreed on between the Bank
and NGU.
6.09     These consultants were never appointed and, at the request of NGU,
Section 3.03 of the Guarantee Agreement, requiring training of SAS staff, was
deleted in connection %ith the amendments to the project as of January 1981.
In 1982, NCU requested the Bank to relieve it from the covenanted obligation
(Loan Agreement Section 3.03(b)) to employ consultants, since other arrange-
ments (see para. 6.06) had been made to meet the objectives stated in the TOR
of 1973. The Bank, after a thorough review of the situation in 1983,
considered that NGU had substantially complied with the covenant and did not
forcefully insist on full compliance.
VII. Economic Performance
Project Achievements
7.01     At the end of 1985, NGU had a total of 195 gas customers, of which
113 were connected under the project in 1979-85 - an increase of nearly 150%
due to the project. Energogas had a total of 49 gas customers, all connected
since 1980 under the project, and this exceeds expectations (Para. 3.05). In
Vojvodina, about 10% of new customers converted to gas from fuel oil, 40% from
coal and the remaining 50% were new companies which designed their plants for
gas at the outset. In Serbia, about 5% of new customers converted to gas from
LPG, 5% from coal and 90% from fuel oil. A substantial number of new
companies to be set up in Serbia will also design their plants for gas.
7.02     The project has thus contributed substantially to new industrial
development by providing advantages in cost, quality of production (i.e. in
the glass, refractories and ceramic industry), and security and ease of energy
supply.   This is of special importance under current Yugoslav policies,
which, out of balance of payments considerations (501 of Russian gas is paid
for under barter arrangements), aim at limiting the creation of new companies
using fuel oil and LPG. Furthermore, companies that plan to start using coal
are required to assist in the financing of expanded Yugoslav coal production,
which, in addition to high costs of transport and investments needed to comply
with strict Yugoslav air pollution standards, makes the use of coal expensive.
7.03     The Naftagas Pipeline Project made the Sarajevo Air Pollution Control
Project possible. According to the Completion Report dated April 19; 1984, on
the Sarajevo project, the substitution of natural gas for other fuels in



- 17 -
Sarajevo reduced the emission of S02 by about 501 between 1973 and 1982 with a
measurable decrease in cardio respiratory diseases and mortality rates. No
efforts have been made to quantify beneficial effects of this kind attribut-
able to the Naftagas Pipeline Project in Vojvodina and Serbia but, judging
from the Sarajevo experience, the impact should have been substantial,
especially in the larger cities.
Economic Rate of Return
7.04     The basis for the economic evaluation of the project is given in
Annex 4. Following basically the same methodology as in the 1980 Reappraisal,
the calculations result in the following economic internal rates of return
(BIRO) for the projects
Total Pro3ect              NGU/VOQ9DINA        Bneroogaa/(Serbia)

1/  Based on a larger proJect and, therefore, not strictly comparable with the
other EIRs.
7.05     The difference between the EIRRs as estimated in the 1980 SAR and the
1985 PCR is mainly due to the following partly conflicting factors:
-   Gas replaced less fuel oil and LPG and more coal than estimated
in 1980 with a slight positive impact on the UIRR, due to the
substantial production and transportation costs of coal;
-   The project benefits from increased gas sales were substantially
delayed as compared with appraisal schedules, with a negative
impact on the EIRR;
-   The costs of gas and of replaced fuels changed since 1980, with a
negative impact on the EIRRS and
-   The current EIRR calculations were made in 1985 real terms and
include estimated customer conversion costs. It is unclear how
these matters were dealt with in the 1980 SAR.
However, the current EIRR estimate of 291 in 1985 real terms for the project
as a whole is satisfactory.
7.06     The higher EIRR (42%) for the Energogas part of the project is mainly
due to: the shorter construction period for Energogas (about 5 years) as
compared with NGU (13 years); Energogas' gas sales starting only two years
after first project expenditures being made (NGU seven years); and Energogas
gas sales are projected to increase at a faster rate than those of NGU up to
1990. Furthermore# NGU incurred capital expenditures on the serbian part of
the pipeline before the creation of Butangas/Bnergoges in 1979, which has been
considered in the EIRR calculation but still may have distorted these calcu-
lations in favour of Snergogas.  Even so, the EIRE for the NGU part of the
project (27Z) is quite satisfactory.



- 18 -
Least Cost Solution
7.07     The pipeline should have been designed for a higher pressure rating
to permit expansion of capacity in an economic way (para 3.10) to meet growth
in gas demand. In retrospect, it appears that, over the life of the pipeline,
a higher design pressure would have been a lower cost solution than the actual
50 bar design. This was not so obvious at the 1973 appraisal, at which time
designs were based on the maximum pressure at the injection point near
Horgos. Furthermore, NGU's limited financial resources at the time may have
influenced its decision towards a less expensive near term solution, which
provided an adequate capacity for the first 5-10 years of pipeline
operation. However, due to more gas being consumed in Hungary, gas from USSR
will be supplied to Yugoslavia at only 35 bars as from 1986. Additional in-
vestments in compression will therefore have to be made to avoid a reduction
in pipeline capacity.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
8.01     Considering the complexity of the project and the comparatively long
lead times for design, engineering and procurement needed in Yugoslavia, the
overall scheduling of project execution in the. 1973 SAR appears in retrospect
to have been overly optimistic. In 1973, however, the Bank had limited pro-
ject experience in the Yugoslav energy sector. Furthermore, the Government's
urgent appeal to start the project in face of rapid increase in the volume of
imported crude oil, increasing energy prices and shortage of foreign exchange,
led to an ambitious time schedule. The original project scope was appropriate
and the viability, as well as its justification, is confirmed by the fact that
demand for natural gas in Vojvodina and Serbia has been consistently strong
throughout the project period, as the Bank accurately foresaw at the time of
appraisal.
8.02     On the whole, the Bank's attitude was flexible and this contributed
to the successful completion of the project despite problems caused by
external factors, i.e. extraordinary price increases and reorganization of
Yugoslav enterprises after the new constitution of 1974.
Supervision
8.03     The supervision of the project was adequate wit. supervision missions
scheduled twice a year during its early stages and once a year in its later
stages. A closer supervision of financial and institutional project aspects
early in the project, however, could have contributed to more efficient imple-
mentation of necessary institutional changes in NGU (paras 5.08, 6.06 and
6.07). The number of major project issues at the time may have detracted
attention from the institutional aspects,
Working Relationship
8.04     In spite of the major problems encountered during project execution
(delays, cost increases, refinancing and split of the borrower, etcc) the Bank
maintained good relations with NCU and Butangas/Energogas and the supportive
actions taken by the Bank to overcome difficulties were appreciated. At the



- 19 -
end of the project period, the Bank's working relationship with NGU/Energogas
was excellent.
Project Outcome
8.05     The Bank's persistent encouragement of the Borrowers and flexible
treatment of major adjustments caused by factors outside the pro-ject and the
commitment of the Borrowers to complete the Project, led to a successful (even
if delayed) completion. Even though the substantial part of conversion to
natural gas was delayed for a few years in Vojvodina and for several years in
Serbia, due to difficulties in project execution, the basic infrastructure for
utilization of domestic and imported natural gas for the rest of the century
has been established. NGU and Energogas are currently looking for new sources
of gas and plan to increase the capacity of the pipeline system through com-
pression and looping to satisfy the strong demAnd for natural gas in Vojvodina
and Serbia.
IX.   Conclusions
9.01     The Bank's persistence and flexibility contributed in this case to
the successful completion of a problem affected, but otherwise economically
sound, project. It is unlikely that a different posture would have produced
better results.
9.02     Some lessons to be learned from this project are summarized below:
-   construction programs and disbursement projections for projects
in Yugoslavia should take into account lengthy local approval
procedures and the preference given to local contractors (out of
foreign exchange considerations), which often leads to longer
project execution than indicated by international standards
(para. 3.09);
-   the pipeline design pressure should be carefully studied under
future gas projects to ensure long term economic solution. In
NCU's case, additional investments in compressor stations will
now have to be made anyhow to avoid a reduction in system
capacity, as natural gas imported from USSR will be supplied,
starting from 1986, at 35 Bars pressure instead of 45 Bars (para.
7.07);
-   The security of gas supply to critical gas consumers and possible
safeguards to meet emergency situations should be considered at
the design of gas projects (para. 4.04);
-   the definition of "average fixed assets in operation" for rate of
return calculations should take into consideration local
accounting procedures (para. 5.09); and
-   closer supervision of financial and institutional project aspects
early in the project may contribute to more efficient implemen-
tation of necessary institutional changes (para 8.03).

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
The economic analysis is based on the following assumptions:
(a) Natural gas replaces:
NGU     Enermogas
Fuel Oil     30X          75Z
Coal         55Z          101
LPG          151          15%
The energy consumption patterns are different in Voividina and
Serbia, which is reflected in above table.
(b) Calorific values and value er-ivalents are:
Net. Cal Value      Cal. Value Eq.
Natural Gas Nm3        7,727                1.00
Fuel Oil kg            8,075                0.95
Coal     kg            2,760                2.80
LPG      kg            9,900                0.82
(c)  The economic cost of natural gas is equivalent to the current
price paid for imporied Russian gas during the third quarter of
1985: US$145 per Mm . The economic cost (border prices as of August
FY85) of other fuels are: fuel oil US$135 per ton; coal US$40 per
ton; and LPG US$250 per ton. Domestic transport costs have been
added at rates indicated by NGU/Energogas: LPG and fuel oil 8.5c/ton
km and coal lOc/ton km. For LPG, handling, storage and bottling
expenses have also been added. Resulting costs per ton for fuels
delivered to consumers are: fuel oil US$180; coal US$92; and
LPG US$375. For simplicity, the same average transport distance
(520 km) has been used both for NGU and Energogas and the same
economic costs have been applied to all years during the expected
life (up to 1997) of project assets.
(d) Incremental project investment and operating expenditures have
been estimated based on available accounting and other records. Non
cash costs and transfer payments, i.e. depreciation, interest, taxes
and duties, have been eliminated. Past expenditures were converted
to US$ according to the average exchange rate for the year the
expenditure was incurred and projections were made in US$. Expendi-
tures for customer conversion have been estimated based on a sample
of 22 larger consumers that converted to gas up to 1984. The average
conversion cost for those large consumers was US$850,000, which for
the IRR calculations has been reduced to US$400,000 by eliminating
taxes and duties etc and by taking into account remaining economic
life of replaced assets.

-31-                         Page 2 of 3
(e) The US$ value of annual incremental project costs and benefits
up to 1985 have been adjusted to reflect 1985 years values, according
to the price deflators used in World Bank work. As from 1986, incre-
mental costs and benefits are assumed to be maintained constant in
1985 real terms. The volume of incremental gas sold, however, is
expected to continue growing until 1990, according to NGU/Energogas
projections.
(f) NGU's charge4 to SGE for gas transited through Zvornic are
assumed to reflect the economic value of this service. (These
charges add only about O.5% to the IRR).
2.       The economic savings per Mm3 in fuels due to conversion to gas, were
estimated based on the assumptions in l(s), (b) and (c) above:
NGUS        ((.30 x .95 x 180k + (.55 x 2.8 x .92) + (.15 x .82 x 375) - 145]
- US$ 94.1 per Mm
ENERGOGAS: [(.75 x .95 X 1801 + (.10 x 2.8 x .92) + (.15 x .82 x 315) - 145]
US$ 55.2 per Mm

ATTN:  MR. YUKINORI NATANABE, DIRECTOR
OPERATIONS EVALUATION DEPARTMENT
RE:      PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT ON YUGOSLAVIA-NAPTAGAS PIPELINE PROJECT
(LOAN 916-YU)
FURTHER TO ABOVE PCR, WE SUGGEST MAKING THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS:
SECTION 3.09:                                   EGY DEPT. NOTE
(B)      WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING TEXT:         PARA. 3.09 (B) OF PCR REVISED.
"LOCAL CONTRACTORS WERE NOT
SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED EARLY IN THE
PROJECT IN TERMS OF WORKING CREW
NUMBER; LATER, HOWEVER, THIS NUMBER
PROVED TO BE SUFFICIENT."
(E)      SUGGEST DELETING THIS COMMENT ALL      PARA. 3.09 (E) OF PCR DELETED.
TOGETHeR SINCE WE FEEL IT DOES NOT
CORRESPOND TO FACTS.
SECTION 3.10:
SUGGEST ADDING THE FOLLOWING COMMENT: PARA. 3.10 OF PCR REVISED.
"IN COOPERATION WITH CONSULTANT IN
CHARGE (MR. RISTORCELLI), A DETAILED
STUDY WAS MADE OF THE PRESSURE RATING
DESIGN INCLUSIVE OF DISCOUNT CAL-
CULATIONS, WHEREUPON A LOWER PRESSURE
RATING WAS OPTED FOR. OBVIOUSLY, CON-
SULTANT'S INSTRUCTIONS WERE INADEQUATE,
SINCE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ENHANCING THE
PIPELINE CAPACITY ARE REMARKABLY
RESTRICTED.
SECTION 5.06
SUGGEST DELETING THE SECOND SENTENCE PARA 5.06 OF PCR REVISED AND
BEGINNING WITH: "THIS WAS PARTLY DUE ALL REFERENCE TO TRANSIT LOSSES
ETC" ALL TOGETHER. CHARGES AND LEVEL DELETED.
OF ACTUAL TRANSPORT LOSSES DELETED.
OUR SUGGESTION IS BASED ON THE FACT
THAT GAS SALES IN SERBIA WERE PROJECTED
IN THE 1973 ESTIMATE SO THAT IT IS NOT
NECESSARY TO POINT OUT SEPARATELY THAT
A BETTER RATE OF RETURN WAS DUE TO
TRANSIT CHARGES ON GAS FOR SERBIA AND



-37-                        Attachment X
ratxe z 0? 3
BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA, AS ALSO OTHER
FACTORS PLACED A ROLE IN THIS
CONNECTION.
THE TEXT INCLUDES A WRONG STATEMENT THAT
GAS LOSSES DO NOT EXCEED 0.5 PERCENT.
HAVING REVIEWED RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION
WE HAVE FOUND OUT THESE RANGE UP TO
1*7 PERCENT WHICH PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE
INCORPORATED IN YOUR COMPLETION REPORT.
BELOW STATED IS MORE DETAILED
EXPLANATION FOR THIS CORRECTION: DATA
GIVEN FOR TRANSPORT LOSSES WAS
ERRONEOUSLY CALCULATED BECAUSE NNB WAS
NOT REDUCED TO THE SAME UNITS OF MEASURE-
MENT AND BECAUSE THE QUANTITY WAS TAKEN
FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ONLY:
1. IMPORTED GAS WAS MEASURED AT 20 DEG. C
AT THE SOVIET/HUNGARIAN AND HUNGARIAN/
YUGOSLAV BORDER, WHILE (ACCORDING TO
THEN PREVAILING REGULATIONS IN
YUGOSLAVIA) IT WAS DELIVERED TO
CUSTOMERS AT 0 DEG. C IN 1984 AND
15 DEC. C IN 1985.
2. LOCAL NATURAL GAS WAS TAKEN OVER FROM
GAS FIELDS MEASURED IN SM3 AND
DELIVERED IN NM3.
3. TRANSPORT LOSSES IN TRANSIT (THROUGH
VOJVODINA) WERE NOT STATED.
4. DISTRIBUTION SERVICE TOOK THESE
DIFFERENCES INTO ACCOUNT WHEN
RECEIVING AND DELIVERING GAS, WHILE
TRANSPORTATICN SERVICE MAINTAINED
RECORDS ONLY VOLUMETRICALLY. BECAUSE
OF THIS DIFFERENT APPROACH OF TWO
ORGANIZATIONS, DATA GIVEN ARE NOT
ACCURATE.

YOU ARE KINDLY ASKED TO ACCEPT ABOVE
REASONS AND INCORPORATE INTO THE
DEFINITIVE REPORT THE FOLLOWING CORRECT
DATA BASED ON TUE SAME UNITS OF MEASURE-
MENT AND QUANTITIES FOR THE WHOLE
(IN BILLION)
1984 (NM3)    1985 (NNB)
