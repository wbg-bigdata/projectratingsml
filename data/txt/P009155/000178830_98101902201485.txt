1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to "NAFTAGAS" NAFTNA INDUSTRIJA-NOVI SAD-ZAJEDICA RADNIK JEDINICA
TRANSPORTA, PRERADE, PRIMENE I PRIKETA GASA-PRAVNO LICE-NOVI SAD, with
the guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the
equivalent of US$59.4 million to help finance a pipeline project. The
loan would.have a tezn of 20 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Yugoslavia in October/November 1972,
and a basic report on the economy of Yugoslavia is under preparation. A
report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Yugoslavia"
(R12-lha) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 7, 1972.
Basic data on the economy of Yugoslavia are given in Annex I.
3.        Yugoslavia has had rapid growth and rising living standards during
the last decade, with total GDP at constant prices having increased at about
5-1/2 percent per year and per capita GDP at over 4 percent per year. Econ-
omic growth has proceeded in an environment of major institutional and organi-
zational changes, characterized by the decentralizing of economic management,
the creation of a market economy, and the opening up of the economy to inter-
national trade, with the objective of increasing economic efficiency and
improving the allocation of resources.
4.        The population growth rate has averaged 1.0 percent per year in
the last ten years, that in the less-developed Republics being 1.6 percent
and in the developed Republics 0.7 percent. There is little open unenploy-
ment. There is, however, some evidence of growing regional and occupational
imbalances in labor demand and supply. This results from the low mobility
between labor surplus less-developed regions and labor-scarce developed
regions, and a discrepancy between the skills needed in a fast-changing
economy and those supplied by the present education system.
5.        Economic growth in the less-developed Republics and Provinces has
been at about the same rate as that of the more developed, but their per
capita income has increased more slowly because of faster population growth.
Consequently, regional inequalities have widened. Yugoslavia has kad an active



- 2 -
regional development policy for more than two decades.  The policy aims
at reducing region.i inequality by achieving a growth rate above the
national average in the less-developed Republics and Provinces, financed
by a transfer of resources mainly through the Funcd for the Accelerated
Development of Underdeveloped Regions. In addition, Federal budgetary
grants are provided to the less-developed regions for current expendi-
ture for social purposes such as health and education.
Recent Developments
6.        Economic development since 1968 has been characterized by a
"elatively rapid increase in exports and production (averaging 12 and 7
percent per year, respectively, during 1969-1972),, the emergence of serious
inflationary pressures and substantial balance of payments deficits
(averaging $220 million during 1968-71).
7.        To counter the rising inflationary pressures and improve the
external payments position, the Government since 1L970 has adopted measures
aimed at restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditures,
strengthening price controls and developing an incomes policy. In addition,
it has adopted a policy of frequent exchange rate adjustment in order to neu-
tralize the effect of inflationary pressure on the balance of payments. After
a period of unchanged rates, following a major devaluation in 1965, the dinar
was dievalued by 16.6 percent in January 1571. In the course of the inter-
national currency realignment in December 1971, Yugoslavia devalued again
by 18.8 percent against gold and by 11.8 percent against the dollar. Fol-
lowing the more recent devaluation of the dollar, Yugoslavia adjusted the
gold parity of the dinar to maintain its parity with the dollar.
8.        Largely as a result of the policy measures undertaken, export
growth picked up, import growth declined, and the investment boom slowed
down. In 1972, exports of goods increased by 20 percent and imports by
about 5 percent and the trade deficit was $1.1 billion dollars as compared
to $1.4 billion in 1971. lWorkers' remittances increased by 25 percent to
$780 million in 1972. Consequently, the current account showed a surplus
of about $190 million as compared to a deficit of about $320 million in 1971.
Foreign exchange reserves, which were equivalent to about one months' imports
in 1970 and 1971, have increased, and at the end of 1972 were equivalent to
nearly three months' imports. There has been sone slowdown in the rate of
price inflation. The cost of living index increased by about 11 percent during
the year, as compared to 17 pernent during 1971.
Prospects
9.        Real GDP is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 1973 (about the
same rate as in 1971) reflecting Government policies to control the expansion
of investment and consumption. The reduction of excess aggregate demand
together with the recent devaluations and continlued economic growth in its
main trading partners is expected to lead to export grwth of about 12 per-
cent. Reduction of tariffs in mid-1972 and a major import liberalization



-3-
program effective since January 1973 are likely to encourage import
growth of about 12 percent in 1973. Even with this anticipated increase
in import growth the balance of payments is expected to show a surplus.
Inflationary pressures are to be reduced by a continuation of price con-
trols and restrictive demand management.
10.       The 1971-1975 Social Plan, adopted in June 1972, aims at an
overall growth rate of 7.5 percent per year with gross investments growing
at the same rate as production, and private consumption and government
expenditure somewhat slower--7 percent and 6.5 percent per year, respectively.
Exports are projected to grow at about 11-13 percent per year and imports at
about 9-11 percent. Agricultural production is expected to grow at an
average rate of 3.2 percent per year as compared with 2.2 percent annually
during 1965-70. The acceleration of the agricultural growth is expected to come
mainly from an increase in the growth of output in the private sector farns from
about 1 percent per year in 1965-70 to about 2.8 percent per year during
1971-75. The Plan stresses the importance of achieving domestic stabiliza-
tion, improving resource allocation and increasing productive efficiency in
attaining these targets. It also stresses that an increase in the production
of electric power and the expansion of the transmission system are preconditions
for attaining the plan targets. Domestic savings rates are expected to be
maintained at present levels--around 22-24 percent of GDP, and would finance
about 80 percent of gross investment. The bulk of the projected external
resource gap would be met largely by rising wo xic&irii zeitt ances.
11.       The prospects for continued economic growth in the medium term are
good. The endowment of natural and human resources, together with the prag-
matic and dynamic approach to the solution of economic difficulties, the
readiness to consider and undertake necessary institutional changes, and the
strong commitment to an open, market7&riented economy, gives ground for a
favorable assessment of future prospects.
External Assistance
12.       Gross capital inflows have more than doubled in the last five.years
reaching US$860 million in 1971, and an estimated US$930 million in 1972.
Most of these funds are medium-term commercial credits, reflecting the
limited assistance coming from governments, and the liberalization of foreign
trade and borrowing regulations following the 1965 Economic Refom. The
inflow of suppliers' and financial credits has come largely from the United
States, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. IBRD loans have
been the main source of long-term capital since 1968. Yugoslavia has, so far,
not been able to place public bond issues on the world's capital markets.
However, three private placements (medium-term) of US$115 million have been
made in 1972 in the U.S., and other possibilities for raising long-term funds
are being explored. In October 1972, an agreement was reached with the USSR
for credits of 540 million clearing account dollars for investment financing
in the energy, ferrous and non-ferrous metal, cement and shipbuilding industries.



- 4 -
13.       The Government has tried to encourage private foreign investment
through special legislation in 1967, and by October 1972, 68 joint venture
agreements had been signed between local and foreign enterprises, involving
the investment of about US$100 million. The conditions for foreign partners
in joint ventures with Yugoslav enterprises have recently been further improved
in an effort to encourage a more rapid flow of foreign investment.
External Debt Management
14.      The pattern of capital inflow since the mid-1960's led to a
deterioration in the maturity structure of external debt. The Government,
aware of the dangers in the unregulated growth of external debt, has embarked
on an active debt management policy. Since mid-1971 all foreign credits
have to be registered with the National Bank to ensure that contracted
credits remain within the ceilings detenrined by the Federal Government and
the National Bank, and that the terms of borrowing are appropriate to the
transaction and to the general economic situation. In connection with the Stand-
by Agreement with the IMF in July 1971, the Government decided to limlt out-
standing short-tezm credits to 1970 levels, and medium- and long-term loans
incu:cred or guaranteed by the banks to US$900 million, and has kept borrowing
within these limits. In April 1972, a new system for regulating extermal
borrowing was adopted which operates by inmluencing the cost of external
borrowing through varying dinar deposit requirements. Moreover, the National
Bank has been given authority to veto any credit arrangement.   The Government
has also embarked on a stabilization program that includes rescheduling or
refinancing existing debts and containing longer term credits.  The United
States agreed to reschedule US$58.5 million of debt payments falling due in
1971 and 1972, and Italy, Germany, France, Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands
agreed to extend finarcial credits totalling US$277 million during 1972-1975
(Germany $142 millionp Italy $75 million, Japan $30 million, France $20 million,
Belgium $5 million, Netherlands $5 million). The Goverament hopes to secure
another $50 million from Western European countries during 1973-75.
15.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding and
disbursed on December 31, 1971, was US$1,413 million.   In addition, there
was US$1,351 million non-guaranteed externmal debt outstanding on that date.
Total debt service payments in 1972 are estimated to be about US$792 million,
mostly in convertible currencies. The service of total external debt in
1972 represented 18 percent of foreign earnings. Excluding debts and
earnings in non-convertible currenciesy the ratio becomes 24 percent. Debt
service is expected to remain at about present le'vels during the next five
years. Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the new
measures for improved external debt management, Yugoslavia is credit-
worthy for substantial Bank lending.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
16.       The Bank has made 22 loans to Yugoslavia, totalling about US$691
million. The proposed loan would be the first loan for a pipeline project
in Yugoslavia, and the ninth loan for the transportation sector. Bank
lending has been concentrated in infrastructure projects such as transpor-
tation (five highway loans totalling US$150 million and three railway loans
totalling US$155 million), power (three loans totalling US$135 million),
telecommunications (Us$40 million) and a multipurpose water project (US$45
million). Loans also have been made for industry (four loans totalling
US$47 million), for tourism (two loans totalling US$30 million) and for
an agricultural industries project (US$31 million). IFC has made six
investments for total commitments of about US$53 million in Yugoslavia.
Its most recent investment (LM33 million) in the Belisce/Bell joint venture
for manufacturing pulp and paper, was approved by the Executive Directors
in January 1973.
17.       Execution of projects under most loans has experienced some
delays, particularly the Railway Modernization Program of FY65 (Loan 395-YU),
the Belgrade-Bar Railway Project of FY68 (Loan 531-YU) and the Babin Kuk
Tourism Project of FY71 (Loan 782-YU). Annex II contains a suzmary state-
ment of Bank loans and IFC investments as at April 30, 1973 and notes on
the execution of on-going projects with particular reference to those
which are encountering delays in disbursement.
18.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are (a) to
accelerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b)
to promote structural reforms in major sectors of the economy through
improved coordination, the strengthening of institutions and technical
assistance; (c) to help provide Yugoslavia with external capital at
long term and thus help redress the excessively short-term character of
Yugoslavia's external borrowings; and (d) to help alleviate Yugoslaviats
shortage of foreign exchange by financing foreign exchange earning projects.
These objectives are basically the same as those which guided lending in
previous years, but efforts to give special support to the less-developed
regions are being strengthened, and a continuing high level of technical
assistance will be provided in appropriate cases.
19.       In furtherance of these objectives, loans for further support
for railway modernization, a tourism project in Jaz (Montenegro), expansion
of the port facilities of Bar, river regulation, urban pollution control,
roads and highways, and a water and sewerage project (tourism infrastruc-
ture) in Dubrovnik are envisaged during the next two years. Also planned
for this period are an industrial line of credit, and two or three specific
industrial projects of particular importance to the country. IFC is cur-
rently investigating several new investment opportunities.



20.       In addition to significant help -with the preparation of
projects for Barik financing, the Bank'sa recent technical assistance to
Yugoslavia has included revievs of the power, tourism and transportation
sectors. Other current activities include assistance to a project
appraisal training institution, the training of some of its teachers, a
study of the Yugoslav capital market., and help in establishing a training
program for auditors in Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Service which
audits several Bank-financed projects.
21.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia averaged close to US$100 million
annually in the last three years. Although this represents only a rela-
+-ively small proportion of the country's needs for external finance, it
is equivalent to about two-thirds of the long-taeni official capital inflow
in convertible currencies. Assuming that Bank lending were to continue
at about the same level in the next few years, the outstanding debt to the
Bank would rise from 10 percent of Yugoslavia' s total extemal debt in
1971 to 15 percent by 1978. Service on Bank loam; as a propq.rtion of
total debt service would increase froz 4 per:cnt to 5 percent.
PART III - ME ll1Y S2X2TR
&Iergy Recre#aments in Yugoslavia
22.       During the last decade, the sustained growth of the yugoa1av
economr has been reflected in rapidly increasing demand for energy which,
during the second half of the decade, grew at an average annual rate of
5.2 percent from 14.5 million ton petroleum equi:valent (top) to 18.7
million tep. With the expected continuation of the dynamic growth of the
industry and service sectors, this growth would further accelerate to an
annual rate of 11 percent during 1971-1975, and to stabilize at about 6
percent during 1975-85.
23.       Traditionally, Yugoslavia has relied upon domesti: resources of
coal and oil to meet its energy requirements.. However, the growth of
energy demand during the last decade has been accompani:ed by structural
changes in sources, with the demand for refinaed oil producta and natural
gas growing at a faster rate than that for other fuels. During 1965-70,
the shar of coal in the total demand dropped from 72 percent. to 51 percent,
while that of hydrocarbons (petroleum products and natural gas) increased
from 22 percent to l2 percent; the share of electric power also slightly
increased from 6 percent to 7 percent. This trend is expected to continue
in future and by 1985 hydrocarbons are expected to supply 60 percent of the
energy demand as compared with 40 percent in 1970. 'The reason] for the
change is twofold:  (a) locally produced coal is generally of poor quality,
making it uneconomical to transport it over long distances; and (b) the
Yugoslav policy to refine crude oil locally rather than to import refined
products and the rapid increase in demand for lighter oil distillates due
to the expansion of road transport have led to production of large quanti-
ties of fuel oil, thereby facilitating the displacement of coal by oil
products.



24.       Given the limited domestic resources of oil, Yugoslavia must
rely increasingly on imports to meet the demand, and the share of imports
in crude oil consumption is expected to increase from 40 percent to 75
percent in 1980. At the same time, in order to minimize oil import and
thus its burden on the balance of payments, the current Social Develop-
ment Plan (1971-1975) gives a high priority to the rational development
of domestically available energy resources. Yugoslavia has an estimated
recoverable reserve of natural gas of 42 billion mi3, but production of
gas is less than 1.0 billion m3 per year due to lack of adequate trans-
mission and distribution facilities. Efficiency and cleanliness of
gas as industrial and residential fuel and relatively easy access to
supply from USSR through East European trank lines have given natural
gas an increasingly competitive position as an alternative to fuel oil.
Sector Organization
25.       The energy sector consists of a large number of independent,
self-managed enterprises engaged in their own programs of development
and supply of various forms of energy, and, until recently, there has
been little effective coordination among these enterprises to ensure
integrated planned development of national energy resources. The rapid
growth of, and the structural changes in energy demand, inadequate
pricing policies for various fuels, and the inadequacies in the institu-
tional arrangements have strained the sector's ability to meet the demand
effectively. In the winter of 1970/71 acute local shortages of electric
power and petroleum products developed, leading to importation of 125,000
tons of refined oil products in a crash program to avoid further energy
shortages. This made the Federal and Republic Governments as well as
energy enterprises keenly aware of the need for a coordinated approach
to energy supply and demand. During the last two years, governmental
measures were taken to improve the pricing of liquid fuelss internal
prices were realigned with the rising prices of imported crude oil and
refined oil products so as to enable the enterprises to earn a reasonable
level of return and to finance a reasonable portion of their future invest-
ments. The Governments and sector enterprises are moving towards a closer
coordination in planning expansion programs of energy production, trans-
mission and distribution facilities. This is exemplified in the proposed
project as well as in the recent agreement by eleven power enterprises to
coordinate their future development under the aegis of a Bank financed
project (Loan 836 of June 23, 1972) for an integrated transmission system.
Energy Demand and Supply in Serbia and VoJvodina
26.       Although the economies of Serbia proper (excluding the Autonomous
Provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo) and Vojvodina were traditionally
agricultural., the growth of industry and services in the last decade has
been faster than the growth of agriculture, and has resulted in a major
structural transfomation. This has been reflected in a rapid increase in
energy demand in these regions, accompanied, as elsewhere in Yugoslavia, by
the trend of replacement of coal by petroleum products and natural gas. The



- 8 -
energy demand in these regions is expected to grow at 10 percent annually
over the period 1970-85, with electricity and hydrocarbons accounting
for about 90 percent of the demand by 1985. The structural imbalance
between t'ne current energy supply (primarily based on coal) and the
expected demand (increasingly dependent on imported oil) has generated
increasing concern over the long term development of economical supplies
of energy. In 1969, the Government of Serbia, in cooperation with the
energy enterprises, undertook a study to formulate a long term energy
supply strategy (including fuel pricing policy and coordination within
the sector) to meet the projected demand during :1970-85.
27.       This study concluded, inter alia, that natural gas (locally
produced and imported) could economically replace heavy fuel oil for
industrial use, and in particular, if the necessary treatment, trans-
mission and distribution facilities were built by 1975-76, n,atural gas
could provide 18 percent of net energy supply in 1985. The analysis and
conclusions of the study are sound.  On the basis of this study, the
Goverriaent of Serbia has prepared a long term energy devel,opment plan
(1970-85), which has provided the framework for the current five-year
investment programs (1971-75) of energy enterprises.  The total invest-
ment of the sector for the five-year period is estimated at $1,117 million,
with 72, 18 and 10 percent of the amount for the development of electric
power, petroleum and natural gas, respectively.
28.       Vojvodina and Serbia proper together possess about 30 percent
of the proven Yugoslav reserves of oil and natural gas, which are believed
to represent about half of the potential reserves in these regions.   Since
1965, natural gas has been used in Vojvodina primarily through the existing
pipeline system of Naftagas (the sole enterprise in Serbia proper and
Vojvodina dealing in oil and gas exploration, production, refining and
marketing), to supply industrial customers, including a fertilizer plant
at Pancevo. The present gas system is linrited:  it was ca,pable of supplying
less than 700 million m3 in 1971.  This repreents an exploitation rate of
30 percent of potential production, which is considered too low.   In view
of the important advantages of natural gas over alternative fuels, gas
would be an attractive source of energy for industrial users.   This was
confirmed by a market survey conducted in 1971-72 by the Gas Unit of Naftagas.
Furthermore, potential users expressed a willingness to participate in
financing the necessary gas transmission and distribution facilities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project was identified durLng an industrial identi-
fication mission in April 1971 and was prepared by Naftagas following
discussions with Naftagas in the Bank in October 1971. A mission visited



- 9 -
Yugoslavia in June and July 1972 to review the feasibility study and
to assist the enterprise in project preparation. The project was
appraised in November and December 1972 but financial and economic
information necessary for the completion of appraisal was delayed; it
was reviewed by a follow-up mission in January 1973. Negotiations
were held during April/May 1973 in Washington, D. C. The Yugoslav
delegation was led by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary
for Finance, and included representatives of the Federal Government,
the Governments of the Republic of Serbia and the ALtonomons Province
of Vojvodina, Beogradaka Banka, Naftagas (sponsor), the Production Unit
of Naftagas (sponsor), and the Gas Transmission, Treatment, Application
and Distribution Unit of Naftagas (the Gas Unit, borrower).
The Borrower
30.       Naftagas Petroleum Industry (Naftagas) was established in 1949
as a state-owned enterprise for the exploration and production of petroleum.
Today it is an autonomous, self-managed, socially-owned enterprise, dealing
in all aspects of the oil and gas industry, from exploration to distribution
of finished products. It is one of the three largest oil and gas enterprises
in Yugoslavia, operating primarily in Serbia (including Vojvodina and Kosovo).
Its organization follows the general Yugoslav concept of decentralized
economic decision-making (autonomy of the enterprise)4,andd4wrkers' self-
management of social property. The policy-making body is a Workers' Council
which is elected by the personnel of the enterprise, and which appoints
the general manager as the chief executive officer.
31.       Naftagas comprises several "Associations of work units" (Units);
the main units are (a) research and production (Production Unit), (b) gas
transmission, treatment, application and distribution including LPG (the
Gas Unit), (c) three refineries, (d) an engineering and construction unit,
and (e) a commercial unit.  There is also a common services unit.   Each of
these units has legal personality with its own Workers' Council and
Manager, and is financially and managerially independent. Their policies
and plans, however, are coordinated and consolidated into a five-year plan
by Naftagas with the approval of its Workers' Council.
32.       The relations among Naftagas and its various units are presently
regulated by the statute of Naftagas, but are now being redefined by a Self-
Management Agreement to be signed among Naftagas and these units, which
will replace the existing statute. The Gas Unit is presently protected
against liabilities of other units and will also be protected against
liabilities of Naftagas as soon as the Self-Management Agreement with
specific provisions limiting such liabilities of the Gas Unit will have
been registered with the competant court. The effectiveness and registra-
tion of this Agreement with the appropriate count would be a condition of
effectiveness.



- 10 -
33.       Tne Gas Unit has legal personality and consists of three sections
("mark units"' with separate management and operational responsibility) for
(i) the gas treatment plant at Elemir, (ii) the gas transmission and distri-
bution piDeline, and (iii) liquified petroleum gas distribution (LPG).
There is also a common services unit. The Gas Unit's management is compe-
tent and energetic and its staff is in general sat-lsfactory. Since the
project represents a substantial expansion of the present scale of its
operations, the Gas Unit plans to increase its staff and is recruiting
additional personnel. It also plans to train its personnel to meet the
additional workload under the project. The Gas Unit also needs to establish
an effective cost accounting system and to improve management and information
systems, and the project would provide for consultants' services to design
and assist in implementation of such systems. At the request of Naftagas,
the Bank has agreed that these consulting services would extend to the whole
enterprise.
Project Description
34.       The proposed project is in line wrth the Social Development Plans
(1971-75) for the energy sector of the Republic of Serbia and the Autonomous
Province of Vojvodina, and the Governments of both regions have given high
priority and substantial financial comTitments to the project.    The
project comprises facilities necessary to expand the gas transmission and
distribution capacity of the Gas Unit from the present 700 million to about
2,500 million Mm3 per anmnur by 1977. It would form the backbone of a natural
gas pipeline system in Eastern Yugoslavia, linking gas supply from north-
eastern Vojvodina, supplemented in 1977 by import from Hungary, to about
145 industrial consumers in Vojvodina and Serbia.
35.       The project includes:
(a) installation of field gas compressors (with a total capacity of
5,000 hp);
(b) construction of about 1,250 km of pipelines of various sizes
(supply pipelines from fields to transmission systems, trans-
mission pipelines from the Hungarian-Yugoslav border to Nis via
Belgrade, and high pressure distribution pipelines);
(c) construction of a gas treatment plant (with a capacity of 3 mil-
lion Nm3 per day of wet gas) and a fractionation plant (with a
capacity of 160,000 tons of condensate per annum);
(d) construction of distribution rings, comprising control and
metering stations, and low pressure distribution rings;

The project is designed to cater for peak loada, and slightly higher demand
growth than forecast, and would permit further expansion of the system with
a minimum of additional main transmission liness with the addition of
compressors along the tranamissiQn line, the total future capacity of the
system would be 4,75O million Nm) in 1985.   The construction program is
expected to start in the second half of 1973 and end in the first half of
1976.   A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III,
The Appraisal Report entitled "A4ppraisal of Naftagas Gas Transmisaion and
Distribution System" dated May 25, 1973 is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors.
Project Implementation and Management
36.       Although the Gas Unit itself has done the preliminary engineering
studies, it will-be assisted by consultants and suppliers for the final design of
the project. The intensive construction schedule, which envisages 36 months
for completion of jipHIUne constructio-_ w.1ll requir- coordina ion in
planning and implementing the project which would be beyond the present
capability of the Gas Unit.   It agreed therefore to ezpla9y a conWulting firm
to assist its project implenttion p         and has  naa     Bi&ed a contract with
a ftim accdptahle to the Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
In view of the importance of these consultant services to the pro-
ject planning and i   eiplmentation, it is recommended thait the propoeed loan
finance retroactively that part of these services incurred prior to signing
of the loan  (eastimated at $150,000).  The Gas Unit has also agreed that it would
synchronize the timing of conversion of its customers, facilities to the use of gas
with the pipeline construction.    The existing gas transmission and distribution
facilities will be integrated in the expanded system, and operation and main-
tenance of this system are not expected to pose problems to the Gas Unit. The
long-term lease agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between the Gas Unit and
the Production Unit, under which the latter would operate the compressors
procured under the project, iias been signed and the effectiveness of this
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Supply of Gas
37.       Gas required by the system during the economic life of the project
(75.5 billion NmJ, in the period 1973-1992) is expected to be supplied from
three sourcess 47.5 percent from proven recoverable reserves in Vojvodina,
46 .percent from gas to be iported from Hangary and 6.5 percent from d6mie;stic 
reserves to be found in the region (or import, or beth).   The domestic gas will be
supplied by the Production Unit of Naftagas, and the Gas Unit and the Production
Unit have already signed a supply contract, satisfactory to the Bank, covering
20 years. The ratification of this agreement by these units would be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the loan.   About 50 percent of the proposed supply
price (Din. 0.270/m3) is intended to cover the costs of future exploration
to be undertaken by the Production Unit, which has agreed to have its prod-
uction practices and exploration program reviewed by consultants hired by
the Gas Unit to ensure the econoaic feaslihility oTTNiFiher exploration.  The
Bank would be kept informed of the results of these reviews.
38.       Gas from Hungary will be imported under a swap arrangement with
the USSR:  the Gas Unit would purchase gas from the USSR to be delivered to
Soviet-Hungarian border for the use of Hungary, which in turn would supply
the Gas Unit with an equivalent volume of gas from its field near the Yugoslav



- 12 -
border. Agreement has been reached between the Governments for the
importation into Yugoslavia for the project of up to 35 billion Nm3 of
natural gas during the period 1977 through 1992.   Actual supply contracts
are expected to be concluded by October 31, 1974 and the Bank would have the
right to suspend, cancel and pre-mature the loan, if these contracts are not signed
by the said date.   Tne construction shoedkle is such tha=ItTh an iihlike1y event
that importation of the gas did not materialize, the portion of the pipeline
system (Belgrad-Nis) which would rely on the imported gas supply could be
differed.   The other portion of the system, which will be supplied adequately
by domestic gas, would be indpendently viable from both financial and economic
points of view.
39.       The Mokrin field, which straddles the Yugoslav-Romanian border, is
expected to supply 24 percent of gas to the system. Romania, however, has
been exploiting its side at a faster rate than Yugoslavia, and it is estimated
that a substantial quantity of gas has migrated from the Yugoslav to the
Romanian side. Naftagas is taking measures to prevent further migration of
gas, and in addition Yugoslavia has recently reached an agreement with Romania,
satisfactory to the Bank, on joint exploitation to ensure optimal joint
utilization of the reserves of the Mokrin field.
Project cost
40.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$130.4 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$59.4 million, (46 percent of the total
cost).   The cost estimate was prepared by the Gas Unit and is generally
based on the current construction costs (assuming that local contractors
will form joint ventures with foreign contractors), costs of imported pipes
and treatment pzants, and ex-factory prices of pipes manufactured in Yugoslavia.
The physical contingency allowance of 3 percent is considered ample. The
price contingency of 11.2 percent assumes a 6 percent annual price increase
for foreign exchange costs and annual price increase for local costs of 10,
8, 6 and 6 percent in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976, respectively.
Financing
41.       The proposed Bank loan of US$59.4 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of the project, and the foreign exchange cost of an
audit training program estimated at uS$0.4 million (see below para. 46). The
local cost of the project, totalling US$71.0 million, equivalent would be
financed by: (a,) equity funds provided through the Joint Venture Agreement
between the Gas Unit, the Production Unit and Naftagas (21 percent), (b)
equity funds from the Governments of Serbia and Vojvodina channeled through
Naftagas (37 percent) and (c) a loan from Beogradska Banka, representing a
local banking consortium (42 percent). The Joint Venture Agreement is
satisfactory to the Bank and the effectiveness of this agreement is a condition
of effectiveness of the loan. The Governments of Serbia and Vojvodina already
have legislative authorization to make their funds available to Naftagas but
additional agreements specifying how these funds would be channeled through
Naftagas to the Ga7~ Unit are necessary.  Signing and ratification of such



agreements satisfactory to the Bank would be conditions of effectiveness
of the loan.   The proposed terms and conditions (including a repayment
period of ten years plus a grace period equal to the construction period,
and interest at 8 percent per annum) of the loan agreement between the Gas
Unit and Beogradska Banka are acceptable to the Bank, and the execution of
this agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan. In view
of the multiplicity of financing sources, an Administration and Financing
Agreement would be signed between the Bank, Beogradska Banka, Naftagas and
the Production Unit to define their several responsibilities in project
financing and execution.
Financial Position
42.       Prior to 1972, the Gas Unit did not accumlate any substantial
funds for investment, but the project would lead to a substantial expansion
of its operations, and its future financial position would depend primarily
on the financial results of the new operations. From late in 1974, when the
project begins partial operation, the financial position would improve rapid-
ly through additional revenues, and its cash flow would also be improved by
increased depreciation. Coverage for interest and total debt services would
be satisfactory, with the interest service ratio rising from 1.8 in 1977 to
3.8 in 1982, and the total debt service ratio from 1.9 to 2.6.    The financial
rate of return on gross fixed assets would be satisfactory, averaging about 13
percent during 1977 to 1982. The debt/equity ratio after the completion of
the project would also be satisfactory, falling rapidly from a peak of 62/38
in 1976 to 43/57 in 1982.
43.       In order to ensure a satisfactory cash position, the Gas Unit has
agreed (a) to establish and maintain such tariffs as will result in a minimum
financial rate of return of 10 percent on average gross fixed assets in use,
(b) to maintain a depreciation policy acceptable to the Bank, (c) to enable
the Bank to review at intervals of no less than one year the Gas Unit's invest-
ment program, (d) not to undertake any further investment which in the Bank's
judgement would adversely affect the execution of this project or the financial
position of the Gas Unit and (e) not to incur any long-term debts if thereby
total debt service coverage would be less than 1.5 times.
44.       Since the Gas Unit would not generate sufficient funds to pay interest
during the construction period, the proposed loan would include US$6.0 million
to finance such interest on the Bank loan. The loan agreement with Beogradska
Banka would include similar provisions to cover such interest during constructior
on its loan.
Tariffs
45.       Under a general freeze on prices initialed in October 1971, the
selling price of natural gas was placed under government control. The
Gas Unit's selling prices, barred from any increase, are about 60 per-
cent lower than those of competitive fuels. NaftagRa and the Gas Unit have



- 14 -
requested the Federal Government to allow an increase in gas prices to an
average selling price of Din. 0.41/m3, which would cover the cost of produc-
tion and provide a reasonable return.    The Federal Government has agreed in
principle to the price increase as proposed by the Gas Unit and also to allow
such tariffs as are necessary in future to achieve a minimum financial rate
of return of 10 percent (see para. 43 above).    The final decision by the
Federal Ebecutive Council, which would authorize the Borrower to increase
its average selling price to Din. 0.41/m3, is expected by June 30, 1973.
It would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.   The present tariff
structure of the Gas Unit is unsatisfactory and it is conducting a comprehensive
tariff study with consultants' assistance.    This study will be submitted to
the Bank shortly for review and would provde the lbasis for a new tariff
:tructure to be implemented before the project goes into operation.
Audit
46.       The Social Accounting Service (SAS) is an autonomous governmental
agency responsible for financial inspection of Yugoslav economic enterprises.
It audits several Bank-financed projects. The SAS and the Bank have recently
agreed upon a training program for selected SAS staff in modern auditing methods
designed to enable the SAS to achieve improved auditing standards more accept-
able to the Bank and other foreign lenders and invrestors in Yugoslavia. The
Federal Government has requested that the foreign exchange cost of the train-
ing program, estimated at US$400,000, be included in the proposed loan. The
part of the loan allocated to this training program would be on-lent by
the Gas Unit to the SAS, and the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement would
be a condition of effectiveness of the loan. The training program would
begin no later than January 15, 1974 and would be carried out with the
assistance of consultants.
Procurement
47.       All goods and equipment for the project to be financed by the
proposed loan would be procured through international competitive bidding
except: (a) those items of supply too small to attract international bidding,
which are not expected to total more than US$1.0 million; (b) procurement
and installation of the operating center building, the control/metering
station buildings and distribution ring; and (c) the installation of field
compressors.   Both of the latter works will be procured locally because they
consist of a large number of small scattered projects, requiring individual
contracts.   The two treatment plants (totalling US$11.6 million) would be
procured under turnkey contracts covering design, supply and erection. For
the purpose of bid comparison, domestic manufacturers of materials and
equipment would be accorded a margin of preference which would be 15 percent
of the cif imported price or the existing customs duty applicable to the
competing imports, whichever is lower. Yugoslavia has no regional preference
treaties.



Disbursements
48.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against:  (a) actual foreign
exchange costs of imported pipe., materials, equipment and foreign consul-
tants' services; (b) 35 percent of expenditure, representing the estimated foreign
exchange costs of (i) construction contracts for pipelines and supporting
facilities, (ii) pipes and other domestically-produced goods, and (iii) the
supply-erection contract for the Mokrin and the Elemir plants; (c) interest
during construction on the proposed loan; and (d) foreign exchange cost of the SAS
training program. Disbursements are expected to take place over three years from
mid-1973 to mid-1976. A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in
the Loan and Project Summary, which is attached as Annex III to this Report.
49.       As recommended in paragraph 36, disbursement would be made
against expenditures of up to US $150,000 incurred prior to the signing of the loan
for engineering consultantst services.
Environment
50.       Installation of the pipeline would not cause damage to the environ-
ment or interfere adversely with land cultivation and natural drainage. As
natural gas is a substantially cleaner burning fuel than the liquid fuel or
coal which it will replace, it would contribute to alleviating air pollution.
Rights of Way
51.       The Gas Unit has no legal condemnation rights but in view of the
past experience of good cooperation of local authorities and individual land-
owners, it expects no problems in obtaining access to pipeline routes. It
has also provided for US $2.2 million as part of the project cost for possible
crop damage and land easement. The Gas Unit, however, has agreed to obtain
all necessary land rights before starting any construction.
Phase II of the Gas Pipeline Program
52.       The transmission pipeline system under the project is expected to
form the basis of an extension of gas supplies to the neighboring less-
developed regions: Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovnia. At present
the construction of this phase is tentatively scheduled for 1977/78-82, at an
estimated cost of US$30 million, but the details of this operation remain to
be worked out by Naftagas and the Republic and Provincial Governments
concernecl
Justification
53.       Current projections indicate that the demand for energy in Serbia
and Vojvodina will continue to grow rapidly and will be increasingly



- 16 -
oriented towards electricity and hydrocarbons, which together will meet
90 percent of the demand in 1985. Although additional refinery capacity
will be established to meet the growing demand for light and
middle distallates (65 percent of yield by 1985), residual fuel production
(about 25 percent of yield in 1985) will not be sufficient to meet the
industrial requirements and will have to be supplemented by imports of fuel
oil or by natural gas,or by both. The proposed project is the least cost
solution, together with the existing gas supply facilities, to meet the
expected energy demand and ensure the supply of energy to about 145 industrial
customers in Serbia and Vojvodina.   The economic rate of return of the project,
taking into account the cost of conversion of consumers' plants, ranges between
16 and 40 percent depending on whether the most pessimistic or optimistic
assumptions are employed; the most probable rate is 23 percent.
54.       The project would provide other important benefits, which
are difficult to quantify and are therefore excludled from the economic analysis.
These would include:  (a) environmental benefits in minimizing air pollution,
(b) improvement in physical and chemical qualities of some industrial products
through use of gas (glass, ceramics, refractories and non-ferrous metallurgy),
and (c) employment created by (i) the construction work of the project (labor
costs of about US$25 million), and (ii) expansion of the Gas Unit and consumer
industries.

C.   PROJECTS IN E2CUTIONI/
Loan 395       Railway Modernization Program:  US$70.0 million Loan of
December 11, 1964; Closing Date: March 31, 1973.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, the Closing
Date had been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1975, due to financial, planning and technical
difficulties. After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a continuous dete-
rioration of their financial position and liquidity for a number of related
reasons. Project cost estimates increased nearly threefold between 1963 and
1971 because of inflation, devaluation of the dinar, revaluation of some
European currencies and as a consequence of additional work following more
detailed feasibility studies. Payments for railway freight services were
held back by the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway
Transport Eaterprises which, under the Yugoslav system, are expected to
operate on a commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in
their ability to respond to changed market conditions. Furthermore, the
responsibility of the Federal Government to meet railway deficits has been
transferred to the Republican Governments, which only now are in a position
to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government that the Bank
would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems. Following this
review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting team, the
Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Republic Governments and the
Railways. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very favorable
and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways' situation.
In view of this, and of the importance of solving the railways' problems to the
economy as a whole, the Bank agreed to consider making a further loan in fiscal
year 1973 or 1974 to assist completion of the 1964 modernization program, pro-
vided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clarification of
government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of action both
for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise (including
clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives), a revised
tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals for dealing
with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management. The Govern-
ments and the railways are taking measures to meet these conditions, and a Bank
appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972.    However, basic
changes in the investment and financing plans submitted recently require
substantial re-appraisal of the project. which is now under way.   Although the
final size of the proposed project is Just now being determ1ned, as Republics
clarify the availability of local resources, the Bank's financial assistance
would be concentrated on the completion of the 1964 modernization program of
main lines begun with financing under loan 395-YUJ and related works.
Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could further jeopardize the competitve position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
with Bank assistance since 1964.
1/        These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
The progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 531       Belgrade-Bar Railway:   USS50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing., ate: December 31, 1973.
A delay of over one year in civil engineering work at the Kos
Tunnel was caused by the inefficiency of the contractor responsible for the
work.   The contract has now been placed with another more efficient con-
tractor already working for the project.  Construction of the permanent
way is also behind schedule by about one year due to the time required for
the preparation and planning work. Completion of the project is now expected
by vnid-l975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns., the total project cost
is now estimated to be substantially above the original estimate.    The Bank
has asked for a revised estimate of the project costs to ascertain the funds
required to complete the project.    If additional funds should be required;
the availability of these funds would be reviewed in conjunction with the
negotiations for the proposed fourth Railway loan.    A supervision mission
is now in the field.
Loan 554       Iuceustrial Projects - 1968: US$16.0 million Loan of August 15,
19683 Closing Date:  October 31, 1973.
Seven of the nine sub-projects under the loan have been completed,
but two sub-projects have been delayed. Sub-project Nis (Electronic industries)
is behind schedlule up to two and a half year; due primarily to delays in
procurement, but is now expected to be completed shortly. Two production ex-
pansion schemes under sub-project Sevojno (Copper and Brass Mill) were revised
with Bank approval and are now expected to be completed in December 1973 with
six months' delay and about two years delay, respectively. The Closing Date
was postponed on April 11, 1973 from March 31 to October 31, 1973.   Disburse-
ment of the loan is in line ith the revised. sub-project completion schedules.
Loan 608       Third Highway: USS30.0 million Loan of June 5, 1969; Closing
Date: December 31, 1973.
Construction works under the loan have been substantially completed,
except for the construction of the Karlovac bypass and the access road in
Zagreb, which are expected to require several additional months. The Closing
Date of the Loan was accordingly postponed from December 31, 1972 to December
31, 1973. In view of increases in costs the disbursement percentage has been
reduced from the original 42 percent to 27 percent, in order to continue dis-
bursements until the completion of these works.
Loan 654       Industrial Projects-1970:     US$18.5 million Loan of January 30,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973.
All three sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after experiencing delays of up to 18 months due to slow deliveries of
local and imported goods, and are now expected to be completed before the
Closing Date. Disbursement is proceeding satisfactorily.



ANNEX II
Page 5
Loan 657       Telecommunications:   US$40.0 million Loan of February 20,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Construction work is getting underway. Although there was some
initial delay in procurement preparation and placement of orders, this is not
expected to delay the completion cf the project since the delivery of equip-
ment and materials is expected to follow the original schedule. Disbursement
is about 18 months behind the appraisal forecast.
Loan 678       Fourth Highway:  US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1973.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily. The completion of the
project, however, is likely to be delayed substantially beyond the present
Closing Date: the extent of this delay will be determined in the fall of 1973.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. The Federal Government
submitted a revised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 and
on the basis of this estimate the disbursement percentage has been revised
from 43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Disbursement is proceeding
in line with the revised projection.
Loan 751       Fifth Highway:   US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971; Closing
Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions
for effectiveness of the loan, construction work is making satisfactory pro-
gress on all sections, and all are expected to be completed before the Clos-
ing Date. A 10 percent increase on the appraisal cost estimate is expected,
and the disbursement percentage would be revised when more accurate revised
cost estimates are availahle. Disbursement under the Loan is about one year
behind the appraisal forecast.
Loan 752       Bernardin Tourism:   US$10.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Implementation of the project is about a year behind schedule
due to delays in making the loan effective and in organizing the office for
project execution. Work on progranmiing of physical facilities and architec-
tural designs is making satisfactory progress. The construction of the hotel
complex is now expected to start early in 1974, and to be completed by early
in 1976. Disbursement is proceeding satisfactorily.

Loan 777       Ibar Multipurpose Water:   US$45.0 million Loan of June 30,
1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of thae project has been delayed by about one year due
to delay in making the loan effective, and the only construction work under
way at present is the diversion tunnel for the main dam. Recently the two
largest contracts in the project (totalling US$48 million) have been awarded.
Disbursement is about one year behind the appraisal forecast, and the complet-
ion of the project is now expected to be delayed by one year to the latter
part of 1976.
Loan 782       Babin Kuk Tourism:   US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
Implementation of the project is about one and half years behind
schedule due to delays in making the loan effective and in appointing ar-
chitectural, engineering and management consultants. The construction of the
project was originally expected to start in early 1974 but there have been
delays in programming of facilities and architectual designs due to the
reluctance of Privredna Banka, Zagreb, the local bank, to disburse its loan.
This problem has been solved and design work is continuing.
The difficulty encountered in acquiring some of the land from an
auto camp located in the project area has threatened to delay further the
construction work of the project, since all planning and scheduling of con-
struction is based on the assumption of the availability of this site prior
to the end of 1973. The Borrower has agreed to solve this problem promptly.
Loan 836       Power Transmission:   US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan was declared effective on December 29, 1972. After some
delays in preparing tender documents, bidding procedures are now under way.
A supervision mission is in the field.

Procurement:           Through international competitive bidding except
for: (a) construction of the control center building,
control/metering station buildings and delivery rings;
(b) those items of supply too small to attract inter-
national bidding which are expected to total no more
than US$1.0 million; and (c) installation of field
compressors. The two treatment plants (totalling
TS$11.6 million) would be procured under turnkey con-
tracts, covering designi3 supply and erection.  Domestic
manufacturer of material.s and equipment would be the
existing rate of custox duty applicable to computing
imports or 15 percent of c,:L.f. costs, whichever is
lower.
