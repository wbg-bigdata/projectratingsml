MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE CORPORACION DE FOMENTO DE LA PRODUCCION (CORFO)
FOR THE PEHUENCHE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT AND
TO EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. (ENDESA)
FOR THE ALTO JAHUEL-POLPAICO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.       The following report and recommendation on two proposed loans, one
to Corporaci6n de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO) for US$95.0 million
equivalent and the other to Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA)
for US$21.5 million, is submitted for approval. The proposed loans will
each have terms of 17 years, including four years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate and will be guaranteed by the Republic of Chile.
From the proposed loan to CORFO, US$94.6 million will be channeled to
Empresa Electrica Pehuenche S.A. (PEHUENCHE S.A.) as equity contribution to
assist in the financing of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, and US$0.4
million will assist financing a national environmental program to be
executed by CORFO. The proposed loan to ENDESA will assist in financing
the Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project.
2.       Background.  Chile's best available source for abundant and
reasonably priced electric energy lies in the development of its excellent
hydro potential, while for other types of energy work continues in
exploitation of extensive coal and limited petroleum reserves to offset
heavy dependence on imported oil. Chile's Comision Nacional de Energia
(National Energy Commission - CNE) manages investment planning for the
country's electric power sector using a master plan, updated yearly, for
least-cost expansion of major generating capacity. To meet the growth in
energy demand--about five percent p.a.--projected for 1992-97, an
additional 500 MW hydroelectric plant was determined to be needed, and its
optimal location was a site 250 km south of Santiago. In line with the
Government's policy to reduce the role of the State in large-scale
generation and in distribution, a new entity, PEHUENCHE S.A. was set up for
construction and operation of the project. PEHUENCHE S.A.'s init!al
shareholders are the state holding company, CORFO; the national electric
company, ENDESA; and a partly privatized (though state controlled) power
company, CHILECTRA--GENERACION. In the future, after the Pehuenche Project
is operational, the state companies plan to sell gradually some or all of
their shares in PEHUENCHE S.A. to the private sector. Since many of the
large-scale power generation plants are in the South of Chile, while
industry and population are concentrated in the Center and mining in the
North of the country, strengthening of transmission links within the
interconnected system is an essential complement to expanding generation.
Thus, ENDESA -- which is responsible for transmission -- will carry out the
Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project, to reinforce its lines in and
around Santiago, to carry Pehuenche's added power to demand centers.



-2-
3.       Obiectives of the Prolects.  The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Power
Plant will meet the growing demand for electricity, and the Alto Jahuel -
Polpaico Transmission Project will provide expanded transmission capacity
for the power generated in new power plants in the South, including the
Pehuenche Project, to the load centers in Santiago and the North. The
training components of each project will permit ENDESA and PEHUENCHE S.A.
to train their professional staff in areas related to new high voltage
transmission technologies and daily system operations. The power sector
studies to be executed by CORFO and coordinated by CNE will cover
environmental and resettlement matters related to the execution of power
projects, reduction of illicit use of electricity and design of small
hydroelectric projects.
4.       Description of the Projects.
(a) The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project. to be executed over a
seven-year period, includes: (i) the construction of the 500 MW Pehuenche
Hydroelectric Power Plant; (ii) a training program for the professional
staff of PEHUENCHE S.A.; and (iii) the execution of a national
environmental program. In addition, the Government has undertaken to
execute studies and implement recommendations on protection of the
environment, design of medium size hydroelectric projects and reduction of
illicit use of electricity.
(b) The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project, also to be
executed over a seven-year period, includes: (i) the construction of 80 km
of transmission lines and four substations; and (ii) a training program for
the professional staff of ENDESA.
5.       Cost and Financing.
(a) The total cost of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Prolect is
estimated at US$799.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$483.2 million (60%). The foreign cost will be financed with an
Inter-American Development Bank loan of US$319.3 million approved in .
December 1986, and the proposed Bank loan for US$95.0 million. The studies
referred to in para. 4 (a) above will be funded from the Public Sector
Management Project, Loan 2504-CH (US$0.3 million); for the balance,
PEHUENCHE S.A. will seek suppliers credits for US$68.8 million to cover
electromechanical equipment; several countries and suppliers have already
shown interest in providing financing. Local costs will be covered with
local resources (US$315.9 million) as follows: equity contributions from
PEHUENCHE S.A. shareholders (CORFO, ENDESA and CHILECTRA GENERACION,
US$212 5 million), funds from a local placement of.a bond issue (US$103.0
million) and local contributions to the national environmental program and
studies (US$0.4 million).
(b) The estimated cost of the Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission
Project is US$38.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$25.3 million (65%), to be partly financed with the proposed Bank loan
(US$21.5 million); the balance of foreign cost (essentially interest during
construction) and the loeal costs will be financed by ENDESA with its own
resources (US$17.2 million).



A breakdown of costs and the financing plan for both projects is shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedules for both projects are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
showing the location of the projects is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 6687-CH dated May 15, 1987 will be distributed separately.
6.       Rationale f"r Bank Involvement. The two projects form an integral
part of Chile's power sector strategy, overall public investment program
and decentralization/privatization efforts, all of which are supported by
the Bank's lending strategy for the country. Bank involvement in the
projects will help in: (i) ensuring that the institutional framework for
project implementation is sound; (ii) financing the foreign currency needed
for the capital intensive power projects; (iii) increasing the share of
goods and services acquired through Ir'B which should allow a reduction in
the investment costs of the sector; (iv) maintaining an electricity pricing
system based on marginal costs and improving it by implementing the
corresponding regulations; (v) strengthening the sector's policies and
procedures on environmental and resettlement matters related to the
construction and operation of power projects, and (vi) supporting the
participation of private investors in sector activities through incentives
for co-generation and construction of new small hydro projects.
7.       Actions Agreed.
The Government gave assurances that the present system of electricity
pricing based on marginal cost principles will be maintained; any changes
in legislation which materially and adversely affect such pricing system
will constitute an event of suspension for both loans. During
negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
7.1      With the Government:
(a) to provide CORFO, PEHUENCHE S.A., and ENDESA, as appropriate, the
resources necessary to cover any possible shortfall in the equity
contributions or other funding required for the adequate and
timely execution of the projects;
(b) to assist in the preparation of the institutional studies to be
executed by CORFO; by March 31, 1989, to exchange views with the
Bank on the results of such studies; and to put into etfect their
recommendations; and
(c) not later than December 31, 1988, to update the regulations in
areas related to concessions and operations of electricity
services.



-4-
7.2      With CORFOs
(a)  During project execution:
(i)  to maintain under its ownership at least 70% of the voting
shares of stock of PEHUENCHE S.A.;
(ii) not to sell its shares of PEHUENCHE S.A. financed by the
loan proceeds without the Bank's consent; and
(iii) to implement the plan of action agreed with the Bank to
address environmental issues at a national and regional
level; and
(b)  after project completion, not to sell its shares of PEHUENCHE S.A.
financed by loan proceeds unless satisfactory evidence has been
given to the Bank that CORF09s obligations as Borrower have not
been diminished in any way.
7.3      With PEHUENCHE S.A.:
(a)  During project execution:
(i) to implement the plan of action agreed with the Bank to
address the environmental issues related to the Pehuenche
Project;
(ii) to advise the Bank, in writing, at least one year before
completion of the Pehuenche Project, on the proposed program
and method of inspection for the Melado Dam; and
(iii) to furnish to the Bank, by November 30 of each year a
financing plan for carrying out the Pehuenche Project during
the follow2.ng year and to implement such plan;
(b)  after project completion, to seek the Bank's concurrence before
incurring any new debt if its debt service coverage ratio is lower
than 1.1; and
(c)  during the term of the loan, to maintain a debt/equity ratio not
greater than 67133.
7.4      With ENDESA:
(a)  to maintain a debt/equity ratio not greater than 60/40; and
(b)  to seek the Bank's concurrence before incurring any new debt if
its debt service coverage ratio is lower than 1.3.
8.       Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed projects are
expected from the increased renewable electric energy that the projects
will make available, to support development programs in the country,



- 5 -
related to housing, urban development, industry and mining. The projects
will increase available energy by 2,675 GWh, equivalent to about 17S of the
electric energy required in the country in 1993 (expected first year of
full operation of the hydroelectric project) and assure its transmission to
demand centers.   The rate of return on Chile's Power Sector Investment
Program for 1986-1995 is estimated at 11.2 percent.
9.       Risks. Despite the extensive underground work involved in the
Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, physical risks are expected to be less
than average in this type of work, as detailed engineering studies,
including extensive geological exploration have been completed, and similar
projects have been successfully implemented in the past in Chile. No
resettlement problem exists since the area is uninhabited. The only
environmental risk relates to the possible impact on the Tricahue parrot,
an endangered bird species. However, the project provides support for a
national environmental program, which will ensure the survival of
endangered species. The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Project does not represent
special risks or present environmental or social problems.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
