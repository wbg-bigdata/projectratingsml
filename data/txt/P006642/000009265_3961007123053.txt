MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Chile
Pehuenche Hydroelectric Proiect (Loan 2832-CH)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Chile - Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project
(Loan 2832-CH), prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. The Borrower contributed
Part 11 of the PCR.
The project objectives were to cover the increasing power demand in Santiago and Central
Chile, to provide sufficient knowledge in the operation of hydroplants, to protect two species of birds
endangered by the project, to increase public awareness of environmental issues, and to fill information
gaps about the power sector.
The objectives were successfully met by building a 500 MW hydroelectric plant and its
transmission system, training the staff of Empresa Electrica Pehuenche S. A., Pehuenche, owner of the
hydroelectric plant, implementing an environmental program, and carrying out power sector studies.
The plant was commissioned in September 1991, 17 months ahead of the original schedule, but
the power sector studies and the implementation of an expanded environmental program were completed
in April 1994. The project cost was US$395 million. The 51% cost savings -esulted from highly
competitive bidding for the supply of the civil works and electromechanical equipment, and reduced
price escalation and interest during construction due to the short construction time. The Bank loan of
US$95.0 million was reduced to US$40.6 million and fully disbursed by the original closing date.
Pehuenche was established for the sole purpose of constructing and operating the Pehuenche
hydroelectric plant. Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO) -- the Government
development agency -- with 70% of the shares, was to remain as the main shareholder until the plant
had operated successfully for a few years. However, the Government accelerated the privatization while
Pehuenche was under construction. The privatization of Pehuenche does not seem to have had any
influence on the project.
The outcome of the project is rated as highly satisfactory while its institutional development
impact was modest. Since Pehuenche is fully committed to the project, has met all loan covenants, and
is enjoying a healthy financial position, the project sustainability is rated as likely.
The PCR provides a satisfactory and concise account on the project implementation and results.
The project may be audited together with the Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission Project (Loan 2833-
CH) to extract lessons on the privatization process and its consequences for the future operation of the
sector.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
PEHUENCHE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
LOAN 2832-CH
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Pehuenche
Hydroelectric Project in Chile, for which Loan 2832-CH in the amount of
US$95.0 million was approved on June 9, 1987. The loan was reduced in
various steps by US$54.4 million to US$40.6 million of which US$40.4
million has been disbursed. The loan will be closed as scheduled on June 30,
1994, and the balance (at present estimated to be US$0.09 million) will be
canceled.
This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Country Department IV
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). It was sent to the Borrower,
Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO), and the Executing
Agency, Empresa Electrica Pehuenche S.A. (Pehuenche). Their comments
have been incorporated into the PCR as Part II.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
the Loan and Project Agreements as amended, progress, project conclusion
and annual reports by the Borrower and the Executing Agency, audit reports
by the external auditors, supervision reports by the Bank, correspondence
between the Bank, the Borrower and the Executing Agency, and internal
Bank documents.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
PEHUENCHE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
LOAN 2832-CH
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives and Description
1.    The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project was an integral part of the
Bank's strategy for Chile at the time of appraisal and approval whose
objectives were (a) increasing the efficiency in the delivery of public services
and (b) strengthening the implementation of a financial policy based on long
run marginal cost of system expansion at least cost. As in the previous six
power projects, this project aimed at providing low cost and reliable
electrical energy for the production of goods and services as well as final
consumption with minimum negative impact on the environment. For that
purpose, the project comprised: (a) the construction of a 500 MW
hydropower station and the corresponding transmission system to the Central
Interconnected System (SIC); (b) training for Pehuenche staff; (c) a national
environment program; and (d) Power sector studies.
Project Implementation
2.    The loan was approved on June 9, 1987, signed on December 16,
1987, and declared effective on February 3, 1988. Initiation of the project
had already begun at appraisal. It proceeded swiftly. The first generating
unit of the main component, the hydropower station, became operational in
May 1991, and the second in September 1991, an average of 17 months
ahead of schedule. The direct environmental components of the hydropower
station were implemented in parallel with the civil works. Training for
Pehuenche staff was advanced due to the speedy implementation. A second
phase was added to the original national environment program executed by
October 1992, and will end in April 1994. The last component, the power
sector studies, took 16 months longer than estimated, and the last study was
completed in October 1989.
3.    Actual project net cost at current prices amounted to US$347 million
as compared to US$651 million in the SAR, a decrease of 47%. It was
caused mainly by a low in the business cycle of the construction industry at
the time of bidding, renegotiation with the consultant for a lower fee, the
shorter execution time, and a very conservative cost estimate. Financing
lower costs than planned obviously did not present a problem. While
amounts from all sources were reduced, the overall ratio between debt (72%)



- iii -
and equity (28%) financing was changed in favor of more debt. The Bank
loan was reduced from US$95.0 million to US$40.6 million, and the mode of
transfer of funds for US$25.0 million changed from capital contribution to
onlending.
Project Results
4.    Average peak demand growth in the five year period 1987-92 for the
SIC reached 6.7%, well above the forecast of 4.3% in the SAR, due to a
more rapid development of the economy. In combination with the positive
outlook for the Chilean economy, the increase in generation capacity
provided by the Pehuenche hydroelectric power station was therefore
justified.
5.    Project implementation coincided with the restructuring of the Chilean
power sector and its subsequent privatization. CORFO, a state development
bank, originally owned 61% of the shares of Pehuenche, and planned to sell
it to the private sector after operating it for a couple of years. The legal
documents were worded to permit the later change of ownership. However,
during project execution CORFO decided to advance the privatization
process, and in 1989 put up the shares for sale, advised by the Chilean
investment bank Banco Industrial y de Comercio Exterior (BICE). Despite
an extensive promotion campaign abroad, only local investors bid for the
company, with Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA) presenting
the highest offer. It became the new majority owner in 1990. The Loan and
Project Agreements were amended to reflect the new legal set-up.
Project Sustainability
6.    Given Pehuenche's excellent record during construction, the benefits
of the installations are expected to be sustained throughout their service life.
Experience with operation thus far has been above average, with only minor
repairs required during the warranty period.
Lessons Learned
7.    On balance, the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project should be judged
highly successful based on its technical, financial, and institutional results.
8.    The project confirms the importance of advanced preparation and
good management in implementation. The macroeconomic and sector
environment supported the execution of the project, as the economy was
developing rapidly, tariff policy was already sound at appraisal, and the
restructuring and privatization, which occurred simultaneously with project
execution, provided the executing agency with a strong financial backing.
Failures in the process of privatization - as is the case in Chile with regard
to the structure of the power sector - will be almost impossible to correct
after the transfer of ownership. Covenants have to be worded sufficiently



- iv -
detailed, otherwise monitoring of compliance is not feasible. As sector and
macroeconomic conditions change, conditionality and other project
ramifications of Bank loans have to be kept under constant review and
adjusted if need arises.

PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name:     Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project
Loan Number:      2832-CH
Loan Amount:      US$40.6 million (reduced from original amount
of US$95.0 million)
RVP Unit:         Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
Country:          Chile
Sector :          Energy
Sub-Sector:       Power
2.    Background
2.1   The Energy Sector.  The country's hydro potential of which only
about 20% have been developed so far is its most economic and abundant
energy resource, followed by coal and petroleum. Chile's primary energy
demand (326,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day) and overall energy
intensity (0.79 kgoe/US$GDP) are low compared to other countries in the
region, especially considering the importance of energy intensive consumers
like mines and smelters for the economy. In the 12 years, between 1979 and
1990, when Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 3.7% p.a.,
primary energy demand increased only slightly higher at 3.9% p.a.
However, in the same period, power consumption grew at 4.8% p.a.,
resulting in an elasticity of power-demand-to-GDP of 1.3. Thus, energy
intensity in the economy expanded by only 0.2% p.a., whereas for power
intensity the growth rate was 1.1% p.a.
2.2   Power Sector Objectives. The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, as
with the previous power projects, was aimed at promoting social and
economic development by providing low cost and reliable electrical energy
for the production of goods and services as well as final consumption, with
minimum negative impact on the environment.
2.3   Pbwer Sector Strategy. The project was an integral part of the
Bank's strategy for Chile to increase efficiency in the delivery of public
services and to strengthen the implementation of a financial policy based on
the long-run marginal cost of system expansion at least cost.



- 2 -
2.4   Bank Sector Lending. At the time of project approval, the Bank had
financed six power projects in Chile between 1948 and 1976 for a loan total
of US$144 million, mostly for power generation.
2.5   Pbwer Demand and Supply. Due to the rapidly expanding economy,
with a GDP growth rate averaging 7. 1 % in the last 5 years, power demand
grew by 6.6% p. a. Currently peak demand is forecast to increase by 5.7%
p. a., in accordance with a 5 % growth rate of the economy. To satisfy these
additional power requirements, efficiency gains on the supply and demand
side should be implemented first, as long as their cost are below those of
system expansion, and because of their additional environmental benefits.
Any remaining gap has to be covered by added capacity. While the
production, transmission, and distribution systems have reached a high
degree of efficiency, a considerable potential for additional efficiency gains
remains on the end-user side. However, even if all remaining savings
potential is realized, additional capacity will be necessary. As the
hydropower plants close to the population centers have already been
constructed, capacity additions have to be built by exploiting the potential
farther south in the country. This in turn requires increased investment in
transmission lines and substations to transport the electricity to the centers of
consumption. The incremental demand also creates a need for reenforcing
the existing transmission systems within and around the centers of
consumption, and for expanding the distribution systems.
2.6   Power Sector Organization. In the early eighties, the Government
of Chile (GoCh) started the modernization of the power sector by devising a
new tariff based on long run marginal cost. Two regulators, the National
Energy Commission (CNE), and the Superintendency for Power and Fuel
(SEC) were created. While they initially performed well, their more recent
achievements are perceived as rather limited. The tariff system has generally
worked satisfactorily, but some alterations are being prepared to facilitate
sales by cogenerators and make the system more transparent. One
disadvantage is its lack of incentives for end-user energy conservation. The
Guarantee Agreement for the Pehuenche loan included a provision to regulate
the existing electricity law in areas of concessions and electric services.
However, as the scope and content of these regulations were not specified,
adequate control of compliance was not feasible.
2.7   As a next step, the structure of the sector was changed. In the SIC,
where about 95% of total electricity is consumed, the two biggest companies
ENDESA and Empresa Chilena de Electricidad S.A. (CHILECTRA), which
as vertically integrated entities performed the functions of generation,
transmission, and distribution, were limited to generation and transmission.
ENDESA's shareholdings in distribution companies were terminated, and two
distribution companies for Santiago (Distribuidora Chilectra Metropolitana
S.A., CHILMETRO) and the Fifth Region (Distribuidora Chilectra Quinta
Region S.A., CHILQUINTA) formed. To make the package more interesting
for later sale, no separate transmission company was established, despite the



recognized disadvantages for market structure. Also, by not depositing the
water rights for future projects in an entity different from ENDESA, its
dominance in expansion programs for hydropower was safeguarded. In the
second most important part, the Great Northern Interconnected System
(SING), the separation of the functions of generation and transmission is
underway, and is already completed for distribution.
2.8    After the restructuring in the SIC was completed, the GoCh started
with the privatization of the state-owned companies. CORFO, a state owned
development bank which acted as the holding company for the government in
the power sector, was entrusted with the sale. Four big companies were
successfully sold to the public, consisting of local and foreign financial
institutions, local private companies inside and outside the sector, and private
investors some of them company employees. Only Colbun, a 490 MW
hydroproject, still remains publicly owned. In the SING, public ownership
of generation and transmission still prevails, but its majority is being
reduced. By not separating generation from transmission and permitting
cross holdings, the privatization of the power sector failed to create a market
structure composed of a great number of economically and financially
independent producers and distributors.
2.9   Once privatized, the entities undertook their own restructuring by
establishing new companies to perform certain functions that were previously
done inside, by outsourcing other functions, by strengthening the financing
department, and by reducing staffing in other parts of the company. They
also started to look outside to acquire ownership of companies already in the
sector or recently created to implement new projects.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Project Objectives. The objective of the physical components of the
project was to cover the increasing power demand by the load centers in
Santiago and central Chile. The training component aimed at providing
sufficient knowledge for Pehuenche's staff in operation of hydroplants. The
national environment program's objective was to protect two endangered
species and increase public awareness of environmental issues. The power
sector studies were targeted at filling some information gaps in the design,
execution and operation of power systems.
3.2   Project Description. The project included four components:
(a)   Construction of the Pehuenche hydroelectric power plant:
(i) Small diversion dam at the Maule River;
(ii) 90 m high earth dam at the Melado River for daily
storage with useful volume of 6.5 million m3;
(iii) Two tunnels with a total length of 13.3 km;
(iv) Underground powerhouse with two 250 MW turbines
and two 13.8/230 kV transformers with 290 MVA
capacity each;



(v) Annual average generation of 2,765 GWh; and
(vi) 220kV double circuit transmission line of 25 km length
between substation Pehuenche and the substation Ancoa
for the SIC at Colbun.
(b)   A training program for around 31 of Pehuenche's professionals
for a total of 116 staff-months, in the following fields:
(i)  Overall control and administration of construction; and
(ii) Operation of hydroplants.
(c)   A national environment program consisting of:
(i)  Two programs to protect two endangered species;
(ii) Post-graduate studies in environmental fields for four
professionals; and
(iii) Seminars to increase public awareness of environmental
matters related to the above.
(d)   Power sector studies regarding three special areas of interest:
(i)  Protection of the environment and resettlement issues
related to the execution of power projects;
(ii) Handbook for basic design for small and medium size
hydroelectric projects; and
(iii) Reduction of illicit use of electricity.
4.    Project Design
4.1   Conceptual Framework. Although the economy started to grow
more rapidly in the mid 1980s, the timing of the project was still based on
the past modest growth rates experienced by the economy. When after
project approval Pehuenche became convinced that the acceleration of the
growth rate of the national economy was sustainable, it decided to speed up
the execution of the project.
4.2   Project Preparation. Feasibility studies and engineering designs for
the power plant were available. Project implementation had already started
at anpraisal. Training requirements to be provided by paid courses abroad
an(' fhrough the hydropower department of ENDESA in Chile were
restiictively defined. Little preparation was needed for the environment and
power sector studies components as only terms of reference had to be
drafted.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   Changes in Project Scope. The hydropower station was executed
almost exactly as designed. The entire analysis of the appraisal was based on
a useful storage volume of 33.0 million m3. The apparent increase in useful
storage volume of the reservoir from 6.5 million m3 to 33.0 million m3 is due
to a mistake in the SAR and not a change in design. The 5% increase of
annual generation under average hydrological conditions to 2,905 GWh has
been achieved through widening the design diameter of the adduction tunnel
by 6.6%. The length of the transmission line was reduced by 10% to 22 km



- 5 -
due to a more direct alignment. The amount of training was increased but
part of it was provided by suppliers within their contracts instead of being
paid separately. The two subcomponents for protection of an endangered
tree and parrot within the national environment program were extended to
increase the chances of succeeding. The scope of the power sector studies
was implemented as planned.
5.2   Project Implementation Schedule and Procurement.  At appraisal
(November 1986), implementation of the physical components of the
hydropower station was already underway since June 1986, and estimated to
take six and a half years for completion (December 1992). Actually, due to
tight project management, proper incentives for suppliers and contractors in
case of early commissioning, and favorable weather conditions, Pehuenche
managed to have the first generation unit producing energy in May 1991 and
the second in September 1991, an average of 17 months ahead of schedule.
The only activity that took longer than planned was the installation of the
remote control system which was commissioned in December 1992 instead of
March 1992. However, this did not prevent the plant from being well
operated, albeit on a manual basis. The three lots (two for civil works - the
intake Maule and the tunnel Maule - and one for goods -
telecommunications and remote control equipment) financed by the IBRD
loan were procured through ICB. As planned from the beginning, the
engineering services were provided by ENDESA, first by its own engineering
department and later by its affiliate Empresa de Ingenieria INGENDESA
S.A. (INGENDESA), and were therefore not eligible for Bank financing.
Due to the more rapid advance in implementation, training at Pehuenche also
had to be completed earlier, in March 1991 instead of March 1992.
5.3   No resettlement issues were involved in the implementation of the
project, as the area was unpopulated. The environmental impact was also
limited, as the reservoir area is small (400 ha), and the climate
mediterranean. Pehuenche went to great lengths to mitigate the negative
impact of the project on the endangered parrot (Chilean Conure, Cyanaliseus
Patagonus Byroni) whose three breeding sites on the river banks of the
Melado were permanently inundated after filling. Pehuenche hired
Corporacion Nacional Forestal (CONAF) to execute an artificial breeding
program outside the area. It was successful in bringing up young parrots. It
officially ended on January 31, 1994. However, its medium-term impact is
not clear as it was not possible to establish if the birds once in freedom were
capable of surviving on their own. Overall, the number of parrots in the
area declined markedly during construction, but started to recover once the
disturbances caused by the civil works abated. Pehuenche also contracted
CONAF to do research into the growing conditions of an endangered pine,
the Belloto del Sur (Beilschmiedia Berteroana), and to plant these trees in the
area. From the 27,000 seedlings that CONAF brought up, some 3,000 as
compared to the initially programmed 10,000 pine saplings were planted in
the project area. To monitor the quality of the water in the reservoir,



- 6 -
Pehuenche has entered into a contractual agreement with the University of
Talca whose first report is expected to be finalized soon.
5.4   The original national environment program - whose original duration
of only 18 months had been greatly underestimated in the SAR - was
completed by October 1992. A second phase was added which will end in
April 1994. The last component, the power sector studies, took 16 months
longer than estimated, and the last study was completed in October 1989.
Further details on the power sector studies are contained in the PCR dated
March 3, 1992 for the Public Sector Management Project (Loan 2504-CH)
which was used to partially finance them.
5.5   Project Cost. At appraisal, the total project was estimated to cost
US$799.3 million, of which US$454.2 or 57% in foreign exchange. 99.75%
of the investment cost corresponded to the hydroelectric power station
(US$1035/kW in constant 12/1986 prices), while 0.04% had been allocated
to the training component, 0.12% to the national environment program, and
0.09% to the power sector studies. The actual investment cost for the scope
of the total project at current prices including financial cost amounted to
US$395.0 million (-51%) of which US$281.7 million or 71% in foreign
exchange. The final cost in constant 12/1986 prices for the hydroelectric
power station alone was only US$577/kW (-44%). This impressive cost
reduction was caused mainly by: (a) intense competition in the international
construction sector due to recession that lowered costs of civil works by an
average of 43% compared to the estimates; (b) a renegotiation with the
consultant ENDESA that resulted in reduced compensation; (c) the shorter
construction time which required less price escalation (-62%) and financial
expenses (-65%). Further, the SAR cost estimate for the power plant was
rather conservative. The separately computed cost for the component
"training" were in-line with the estimates, while CORFO spent 23% less for
the "national environment program," and the "power sector studies" cost
25% more.
5.6   Project Financing. Actual financing of the hydropower plant turned
out quite different from the assumptions in the SAR. Originally, 38% of the
investment cost were supposed to be financed by equity and 62% by debt.
Of the borrowing, 52 percentage points were to be provided by multilateral
banks (US$319 million from the IDB and US$95 million from the IBRD), 13
percentage points from a local bond issue, and 8 percentage points from
supplier credits. After loan approval by the Bank's Board, an untied loan
from the Japanese Eximbank - part of a bilateral financial cooperation
agreement between the Republic of Chile and Japan - was signed, which
made the planned supplier credits and local bond issue unnecessary. When it
became clear that the capital investment costs and financing requirements
would be about US$404 million less than estimated, the shareholders reduced
their planned equity contributions, and Pehuenche requested all lenders to
reduce their loan amounts. In the end, equity contributions financed 28%,
multilateral bank loans contributed 49% (US$164 million from the IDB and



- 7 -
US$40 million from the IBRD), and the Japanese Eximbank loan 23 % of the
financial resources needed. Within the shareholders, as a consequence of the
privatization (para. 6.4), the composition between CORFO, ENDESA and
CHILGENER also changed, with ENDESA becoming the main shareholder.
Financing of the training component was done entirely with Pehuenche's own
funds. The following table compares the forecast and actual financing:

5.7   The financing of the national environment program executed by
CORFO was shared between the Bank and CORFO at the 2:1 ratio as agreed
in the loan agreement from the beginning. 60% of the power sector studies
were financed by the Bank, 40% by the Borrower, again in-line with the
original loan agreement.
5.8   US$94.6 million of loan 2832-CH had been allocated for the
hydropower station and Pehuenche's training program, to be transferred from
CORFO to Pehuenche as equity contributions, while US$0.4 million
remained with CORFO to finance part of the national environment program.
Loan disbursements started rapidly. When CORFO decided to sell its shares
of Pehuenche, it also had no more interest in making equity contributions.
As a consequence, it stopped requesting disbursements from the loan of
which US$15.6 million had been disbursed at the time. After protracted
negotiations complicated by change of government, CORFO and Pehuenche,
with the Bank's prior consent, agreed to use part of the balance of the loan as
a subloan of US$25.0 million. An amendment to the Loan Agreement was
signed on October 8, 1991. At the same time, together with previous
cancellations, the loan amount of the IBRD loan was reduced to US$41.0
million. Since then, it has been reduced further to US$40.6 million of which



- 8 -
US$40.4 million has been disbursed. The balance at the loan closing on June
30, 1994 (at present estimated to be US$0.09 million) will be canceled.
Allocation of loan proceeds was slightly altered in favor of goods to adjust
for contractual arrangements.
6.    Project Results
6.1   Project Objectives. The original project of a 500 MW hydroelectric
power station was implemented in concept and detail as planned at appraisal.
By coming on line earlier than programmed and at significantly lower cost, it
fulfilled its purpose as part of the least cost expansion program for the SIC.
Therefore, not only was the original objective in terms of added capacity
achieved, but it was done ahead of time and more cost effective. The SIC
was therefore earlier able to meet increased demand at more favorable
generation costs. The sooner than originally anticipated commissioning was
even more beneficial given the four-year draught that affected the country at
the time, and the delay in bringing another hydroplant (Alfalfal, 140 MW) on
stream. The measures to protect the endangered parrot so far have shown
inconclusive results, but might still improve. The remaining environmental
objectives attached to the hydropower station were achieved.
6.2   The objectives of the national environment program although vaguely
defined and much more modest than its name implied were accomplished.
Both of CORFO's subprograms for the protection of the parrot, and the
research and planting of "Belloto del Sur" trees were not only executed
during the time period provided in the SAR but extended to increase the
chances for improved results. The subprogram for scholarships abroad in
environmental studies concluded with all four students obtaining master
degrees. Also, three seminars were held to increase the public's awareness
of environmental matters in general and of the endangered parrot in
particular, and to facilitate the dissemination of the experiences gained during
the artificial breeding period.
6.3   Nhuenche's Institutional Performance.  In 1986, E.E. Pehuenche
S.A. was established with the sole purpose of constructing and operating the
Pehuenche hydroelectric power project. With 70% of the shares, CORFO
was the main shareholder, followed by ENDESA (20%) and CHILGENER
(10%). Pehuenche managed to attract qualified staff from other power
companies and the private sector. It has remained a lean company with little
overhead which from the beginning distinguished itself by placing equal
emphasis both on the engineering aspects of the project and on its financial
development.
6.4   Initially, the GoCh planned to privatize Pehuenche after the plant had
been successfully operated for a couple of years. Adequate provisions were
included in the legal agreements. However, once the then GoCh realized that
it had to relinquish power earlier than planned, it decided to sell Pehuenche
while the plant was still under construction. CORFO hired the Chilean



-9 -
investment bank BICE, which is affiliated with the Rothschild group in
London, as advisor for the sale. Although it led an extensive promotion
campaign abroad, only Chilean companies actually bid. ENDESA which by
then was already privately owned presented the highest offer and on January
18, 1990 became the new majority owner; at year-end 1992, its participation
reached 92.5%. In addition, the employees represented by Inversiones
Tricahue S.A. could also buy shares and exercised that right to the extent
that at December 31, 1992 they owned 4.3% of the capital. The balance is
owned by foreign investment funds and local pension funds. The Bank,
which had given its prior consent to the sale during construction, CORFO,
and Pehuenche amended the legal agreements on January 2, 1990 to reflect
the new set-up.
6.5   Privatization did not change to a great extent the way Pehuenche
works. To begin with, management remained the same. ENDESA allowed
Pehuenche a high degree of autonomy, managing it mainly by results. For
Pehuenche it meant enjoying the backing of a financially strong institution.
From a company with the purpose of building and operating a single power
project, Pehuenche has since evolved into building a second hydroelectric
power station, the run-of-the-river 85 MW Currillinque plant upstream from
Pehuenche in the same river basin. It is nearing completion. At present,
further expansion plans include Loma Alta, a third small hydrostation of 38
MW capacity between Pehuenche and Currillinque, and eventually some
combined cycle gas power stations once the natural gas from Argentina
becomes available.
6.6   Pehuenche's Financial Performance. When comparing the financial
forecast in the SAR with their actual value it is important to note that after
1991 these numbers refer to two somehow different organizations, since the
basic assumption of the SAR was that Pehuenche would remain a one project
company, yet i. is already executing a second one. Because Pehuenche is
more than 50% owned by ENDESA, Pehuenche's financial statements are
also fully consolidated with the parent company. ENDESA's finances are
commented in the PCR on the Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission Project,
Loan 2833-CH, dated December 17, 1993.
6.7   During the two years of 1991 and 1992, while the Pehuenche
hydroelectric plant was already operating, average rates remained well below
those forecast because the earlier commissioning of Pehuenche with its low
operating costs prompted a reduction in the rates as they are based on
marginal cost. As the system moves towards a higher capacity utilization in
the coming years, these rates will increase. Although sales started earlier,
sales revenues for the same reason also were depressed. Operating ratios
(1992:51%) are 25% higher than forecast. As capital investment cost for the
project had been much lower than forecast, the lower rates did not affect the
rate of return calculations as negatively as one might expect. Actually, the
average financial rate of return on assets in operation for the two years 1991
and 1992 reached 6.9% p.a., whereas the return on equity at 17 % p.a.



- 10 -
amounted to more than twice that value, demonstrating a successful
management of financial resources and assets. In the same period, 27% of
the total capital investment program of US$45 million was financed with own
resources. 114% of the debt service of 1993 was covered by the gross
internal funding of 1992, thereby staying above the financial covenant of the
Project Agreement requiring 110%. Pehuenche also stayed within the debt-
equity-ratio of 67/33 as stipulated by the Project Agreement.
6.8   Economic Reassessment. At appraisal, Bank staff and Chilean power
authorities expected the project to contribute to the economic growth of the
area (mostly to industrial growth) and to the improvement of the population's
standard of living. To reach these objectives and to provide for expected
load growth, the Project was designed as part of a least-cost
generation/transmission program.
6.9   During the period up to 1990, the actual level of peak demand in the
SIC (2,326 MW) remained very close to the forecast. In 1991, because of a
drought, it was below SAR estimates, only to exceed them by circa 8% at
2,778 MW in 1992. Overall, growth of peak demand averaged 6.7% p.a.
compared to 4.3% p.a. anticipated in the SAR. Development of energy
generation was similar to peak demand (11,866 GWh in 1987, 16,302 GWh
in 1992 or 6.6% p.a.). The increase in generation capacity by the project
therefore seems justified.
6.10 The current forecast for peak demand of 4,316 MW in 2000 is based
on a 5.7% growth rate, in ac^ordance with a 5% growth rate of the
economy. In view of the strong growth of the Chilean economy in the last
three years (which was inconceivable in the mid-1980s at the time of
appraisal), the current forecast appears rather conservative. Only if
considerable efficiency increases in production and end-use are realized
and/or economic growth rates are substantially reduced, will peak demand
expand at this rate.
6.11  The project was part of the least cost expansion program for the
power sector. Therefore, an isolated economic evaluation of the project was
not made, as it was not meaningful to allocate benefits to the various
components of the whole program. Instead, the internal rate of return for the
overall 1986-95 investment program for the SIC was calculated at 11.2%,
based on data provided by CNE, which in turn drew on information made
available from the state-owned power companies. Since privatization, CNE
no longer obtains this type of data. It is therefore not possible to recalculate
the actual rate of return of the investment program. This would not only
require data on past performance of the many companies involved in the SIC,
but also knowledge of their future plans, which as private companies they
have little interest in providing. However, the information given in previous
paragraphs on demand development, investment cost, and time of
commissioning, demonstrates that actual developments exceeded those of the
appraisal forecast. It thus seems safe to assume that the cost effectiveness



- 11 -
was actually better than estimated in the SAR, and possibly the internal rate
of return as well.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1    Benefits of the installations are expected to be sustained throughout
their service life given Pehuenche's excellent technical record. Experience
with the equipment has been above average. The only problems detected
were two cases of minor damage to the turbine blades in June 1991 and April
1992 which were repaired by the supplier as they occurred within the
warranty period. The loss of revenue was covered by Pehuenche's
insurance. Further, the dam has already withstood a 1000-year-flood.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1    Only 63 staff-days were spent in the field for project preparation and
appraisal, and 31 staff-days for supervision. This low level of staff input
represents the economies of scale made possible through the managing of two
power projects that advanced basically at the same speed (the other being the
Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project), the advanced level of project
preparation, the rapid pace of implementation of the project, and the
competence of the executing agency. In retrospect, staff was too
conservative in assessing the investment cost of the project. Financial
covenants were also not tailored sufficiently to Pehuenche's future character
as a private company. A dividend cap related to actual cash generation
should have been covenanted. The continuation of the support of the
Republic of Chile for the project in the case of privatization should have been
stipulated in the Guarantee Agreement. The covenant on regulation to the
electricity law was too vaguely worded to allow adequate control of
compliance. During implementation, Bank staff showed flexibility when the
GoCh decided to privatize Pehuenche during construction rather than after a
couple of years of operation as initially planned. Supervision was adequate
with no delays in project execution attributable to slow response by the Bank.
9.    Borrower and Executive Agency Performance
9.1   The performance of Pehuenche in managing the project was highly
satisfactory, and was given high marks by Bank staff. Pehuenche is a lean
company with competence in planning, executing and operating hydroelectric
power plants, as reflected in its active participation in the preparation of the
project, its attention to detail during supervision, the exacting standards it set
for its contractors, and its periodic reports on project implementation.
Pehuenche's transformation from a publicly to a privately owned corporation
primarily affected its relationship with the public sector, but has in no way
caused a lowering of technical standards. CORFO provided the required
support for the transfer of funds and executed the National Environment
Program satisfactorily.



- 12 -
10.   Bank-Borrower and Executive Agency Relationship
10.1  The relationship between Pehuenche and the Bank was a close one
characterized by considerable continuity in the staff and managers working
on the project both in Chile and in the Bank (with the exception of changes
brought about by the Bank's reorganization in 1987). Perhaps the only area
in which the Bank could not exercise a positive influence on the course of
events was the restructuring of the power sector prior to privatization, as
well as the modalities of the sale of the public power companies in general
and Pehuenche in particular. Given the small amount of the National
Environment Program, contacts with CORFO were more limited.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1  Pehuenche preferred to use first ENDESAs engineering department,
than after privatization its affiliate INGENDESA as consultants instead of
hiring outside consultants through Bank-approved procedures. Overall, the
in-house consultants performed well. Engineering costs as a percentage of
project costs (14%) were relatively high.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  Project documentation and data included the SAR, the legal
documents, the progress and final reports by the Borrower and executing
agency, supervision reports by the Bank, correspondence, financial
statements, annual and audit reports. The SAR and legal documents were
adequately prepared and generally comprehensive and did provide a useful
framework of reference during project implementation. Semi-annual progress
reports were prepared regularly informing on project implementation, and the
financial situation of the executing agency. Audit reports were
comprehensive and generally submitted on time; all reports were unqualified.
The final project report was helpful in preparing this report. Bank records
were well kept, and information retrieval was easy.

PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S AND
EXECUTIVE AGENCY'S PERSPECTIVE
From the Borrower's Perspective (Translation)
In accordance with the request in your letter of January 21, 1994 I
wish to inform you that in our character as debtor to the World Bank, we
make the following comments related to the partial financing of the
Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project.
The participation of CORFO was and is as debtor to the Bank,
having to fulfill administrative procedures of periodic project
information, as requested by the Bank; in addition, the
requirements for information and documentation for
reimbursement requests were complied with, and information
on the status of these funds in the Special Account at the
Central Bank was provided with the support of the Contraloria
General de la Republica.
Regarding the financial aspects of the loan for the financing of
this project, we consider the interest rate applied high; as an
example, we indicate that at present the rate to be paid is
7.25% p.a., whereas LIBOR stands at 4.125% p.a.
In general, we consider the relationship for this credit between
CORFO and the Bank as normal for this type of credit
operations.
On the other hand, it would be convenient that in future
projects which the Bank finances, special programs such as the
environmental ones be incorporated directly into the project
and not charged to CORFO as intermediary.
From the Executive Agency's Perspective (Translation)
We wish to confirm that the statistical information and on Project
execution, the annual financial statements representing the 1987-1992 period,
and the financial projections of Empresa E1lctrica Pehuenche S.A., have
been prepared according to the World Bank's methodology for analysis, and
they correspond to the available information at the time of its preparation and
the best estimates the Company could make on that basis and in the context
of the stated methodology.



- 14 -
Furthermore, the information and analysis contained in Part I of this
Project Completion Report, have been prepared by the World Bank based on
background and information provided by Pehuenche S.A.
During the development of the Pehuenche project and the process of
negotiations, validation and disbursement of the World Bank credit, the Bank
staff made important contributions at each stage of the Project.
Communication of the company with the different Bank representatives was
direct and expeditious, thus facilitating each one of the needed steps.
The relationship with the World Bank, both from a technical as well
as administrative point of view, has been a pleasant experience for Empresa
El6ctrica Pehuenche S.A.
