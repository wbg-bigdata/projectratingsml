Guarantort        The Government of Chile
BenaficIaries:    Empress Eleetrica Pehuenche S.A. (PEHUENCHE S.A.),
CORFO and ENDESA
IESYatst  Loan to CORFO    US$95.0 million equivalent
Loan to ENDESA US$21.5 million equivalent
Repayment in 17 years, including four years of grace,
at standard variable interest rate.
3el.d4t1 TLgnmet CORPO will transfer part of its loan (US$94.6 million)
as equity contributions to PEHUENCHE S.A., with no
finaneing charges and will use US$0.4 million to fiasne
the foreign cost of a national environmental program.
ENDESA's loan will be used by ENDESA. Foreign exchang
risk would be borne by the Borrowers.
DescrIptLon of the Prolectss  (a) The Pebuenche Hydroelectric Pro et, to
be executed over a seven-year period, would Includes (i) the construction
of the 500 MW Pehuenche Hydroelectric Power Plant; (1i) a training program
for the professional staff of PEHUENCHE S.A.; (iII) the execution of a
national environmental program. In addition, the Government will undertake
to executo studies and lmplement recommundations on protection of the
environment, design of medium size hydroelectric projects and reduction of
lllicit use of electricity; (b) The Alto Jahuel-Polnaico Transmission
khggtp, also to be executed over a seven-year period, would include: (i)
the construction of 80 in of transmission lines and four substations; and
(ii) a training program for the professional staff of ENDESA.
jgflgt s The proposed projects would allow meeting the power sector
demand growth after 1992. The Installation of additional hydroelectric
power Is fundamental to support the development programs of the country,
i.e. industry, mining, housing, urban development; any delays or
postponemnt of tho projects would cause serious economic cost to Chile.
Risks and Environments Despite the extensive underground work Involved in
the Pebuencke Hydroolectric Project, physical risks are expected to be less
than average In this type of work, as detailed engineering studies,
including extensive geological exploration have been completed, and similar
projects have been successfully Implemented in the past in Chile. No
resettlemeat problem exists since the area ia uninhabited. The only
environmental risk relates to the possible impact on the Trieshue parrot,
an endangered bird species. However, the project provides support for a
national environmental program, which will ensure the survival of
endangered species. The Alto Jabuel-Polpaico Project does not represent
special risks or present environmental or social problems.

2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. T   ENERGY 8ECTOR
Enerav Resources
2.01      Chile has substantial energy resources: according to CNE, proven
coal reserves are estimated at 620 million tons (4.3 million Teal) with a
thooretical life span of over 600 years in relation to the production level
of 1985 (one million tons). Proven reserves of oil are estimated at only
13 million cubic meters (0.1 million Tcal), aLd natural gas reservas at 80
trillion cubic meters (0.7 million Tcal), most of them locatod in the
southern region of the country; they would satisfy the country's needs for
oil during only throe years and for natural gss during 50 years.
2.02      The feasible hydro potential of the country is estimated at
18,000 KW and 103 TUh, of which at the end of 1985 only 2,262 MW had been
developed, with an average energy of 11 TWh. As of today, the sector
companies have prefeasibility, feasibility and design studies for hydro
projects with a capacity of 9,400 MW and an average energy of 55.5 TWh.
Eneray Demand and Supply
2.03      In 1985 gross internal energy consumption in Chile was 94,964
Teal (equivalent to 9.5 million TOE) or 0.78 TOE per capital . Local
production supplied 742 of the demand, as shown in the following sumarised

Policies and Obiectives
2.04      The official Energy Program in Chile has established clear goals
for the energy sector, within the general country policiest (i) application
of market prices or marginal cost principles, to4 ensure an adequate
allocation of resources; (Ii) when economically feasible, meet energy
demand with indigenous resources; and (iiI) promote efficient use of
energy. Important achievements have been reached in the past, the most
relevant being a reduction of per capita energy consumption of 12X In the
last five years (0.89 TOE In 1980 as compared to 0.78 in 1985), and a
reduction of energy Imports of about 402 in the same period.
2.05      As a policy for all sectors, including energy, the Government has
Initiated a program to: (i) deconcentrate and decentralize the major stat.
companies in order to set clear areas of accountability and provide an
increasing degree of competition; and (ii) to transfer gradually the
ownership of state companies to the private sector leaving tho Government
with a subsidiary role, I. e. to participate only where and when the
private sector does not fulfill country objectives. In the energy sector,
the Government acts ins (a) identifying and evaluating energy resources and
energy needs of the country; (b) regulating energy prices, when necessary;
and (c) establishing coherent and comprehensive information system to
ensure market transparency and efficiont use of energy resources. At the
present time, there are no major unsolved issues related to the energy
sector; iowever, on the basis of a Bank energy sector review mission which
visited Chile in March 1987, the Bank is collaborating with the Government
in an in-depth analysis of the sector and identifying possible issues and
propose actions, if needed, to resolve them.
Institutional Structure
2.06      To Lmplemnt Its energy policees and objectives, the Chiloan
Gaovernent has established a coherent legal framework and organization. An
Important unit is the Comisi6n Nacional de Energia (CNE), created in 1978
as a decentralized autonomous agency which has the basic responsibilities
of preparing and coordinating sector policies, plans and regulations, and
providing advice to the Government on energy matters. CNE reports to the
President of Chile. A representative of the Presidont of the Republic,
with the rank of minister, acts as the President of CNE and presides the
Executive Board; this includes the Ministers of Defense, Economy, Finance,
Mines, Planning, and Chief of Presidential Staff. An Executive Secrotary is
in charge of the administrative and technical functions and is assisLed by
a small but well qualified staff. CNE engages the services of independent,
qualified consultants for most of the major sector studies. See Annex 2.2
for more details.
2.07      The National Planning Office (ODEPLAN) coordinates the actions of
state entities and enterprises within the Netional Development Program. In
this role, it handles a system of Basic Statistics for Investment (SEBI)
which includes the Government approved projects in all of their stages. The
Ministry of Economy approves electric tariffs on the basis of
recommendations of CNE and, through the Superintendency of Electricity and
Fuels, monitors the compliance with sector regulations and procedures



- .50
regarding lnstallations and services, and handles customr complaints on
matters related with service and tariffs.
2.08      An important role In the energy sector Is played by the state
controlled companies, some of which are incorporated (electricity and coal)
while others are considered as state companies (e.g. ENAP, the National
Petroleum Company). The sharea of the incorporated companies are held by
Corporaci6n de Fomento de la Produccl4n (CORFO), the Governments holding
company which controls the National Coal Enterprise (ENACAR) (99.92) and
the following electric utilitiest Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A.
(IUDESA) (98.22), COLBUN S.A. (98.22), CHILECTRA-GENERACION (59.02),
CIILECTRA-HETROPOLITANA (33.02), CHILECTRA-V REGION (35.01), and P3HENCH3
S.A. (about 70.01).
Investment in the Energy Sector
2.09      The 1986-1988 Energy Program includes investments of about US$2.0
billion with the following prioritiess (a) development of electricity
production, basically with hydro resources (412 of total investment); (b)
nr ease in total oil and natural gas production (542); and (c) Increase In
coal production alming at the substitution of fuel oil In thermal power
=enoration. Out of the total investment, 612 would be pub'Ic and 391
privatt; 881 of the private investment would concentrate in oil and natural
g"a.
B. TIE PoMeR SECTOR
Leal FrSme work and Regulat ions
2.10      The General Law of Electricity Ser ices (Decree Law No. 1, 1982)
seto up the basic principles that regulate the sector, particularly
regarding concessions and rights, operations and supply, consumoe
contributions to stock capital, and tariffs. CNE (para. 2.06) is the
regulatory agency for the electric power sector.
OrEanilation
2.11      Under the Government policies (para. 2.05), as applied to the
power sector, Chile now has four major state owned generation compeniess
NUDESA, CHILECTRA-GENERACION, COLBUN S.A. and PEHUENCHE S.A., all
subsidiaries of CORPO (pars. 2.08). Electricity distribution is done by
state and privately owned companies which purchase bulk energy from the
generation companies.
2.12      The Economic Dispatch Center for the Central Interconnected
System (CDEC-SIC), created in May 1985, is formed by representatives of the
most mportant electric generation companies. Its msain responsibility is
the coordination of the system with the purposes of: (i) preserving
reliability, (ii) ensuring least-cost operation, and (iii) establishing
access to the transmission system, independently of ownership, and setting
up the corresponding charges. In this role, the CDEC-SIC perform the
following tasksa (a) determines the dispatch of energy and the operation of
the system, on a daily basis and for the medium and long-term; (b)
calculates the marginal costs of the operation; (c) determines and prices



the transfers of energy among the gonerating companies; and (d) coordinates
the major preventive maintenance of the generating units.
2.13      ENDESA is by far the largest public electric utility in Chile.
At the end of 1985, its Installed capacity of 2,466 MW represented about
802 of the public utilities total. It owns several subsidiaries and it is
in the process of implementing the Government's policy of privatisation: in
1986, the distribution companies of Coquimbo (EMEC), Melipilla (EMEL) and
Atacama (EMBLAT) and a small generation company (PILMAIQUEN) were sold to
private investors; another small generation company (PULLINQUE) is for sale
in 1987. Private and institutional investors in the power sector include,
among others, several construction companies, the Administrators of Pension
Funds (AFP), insurance companies, and the employees of the power companies.
ENDESA will be left only with the distribution companies of Antofagasta and
Tarapaei (EDELNOR), Magallanes (EDELMAG) and Aysen (EDELAYSEN) which at
present are not attractive to potential buyers because of high costs of
operation resulting from their remote geographical location.
2.14      CHILECTRA-GENERACION is the generation company which resulted
from the breaking down of CHILECTRA, a private company through the late
sixties. Two other spin offs of this company are CHILECTRA-METROPOLITANA
and CHILECTRA-V REGION, the distribution companies serving the Santiago and
Vina-Valparaiso Metropolitan areaes, respectively. COLBUN S.A. was created
in 1986 to operate the Colbiin-Machicura Hydroelectric Plants, built by
ENDESA and in operation since March 1985. PEHUENCHE S.A. was also created
in 1986 for the implementation of the Pehuenche Project. Several smaller
distribution companies and self-generation companies constitute the rest of
the Chilean electric power sector.
2.15      Besides the physical development of power projects, the Chilean
electric sector has developed a sophisticated engineering capability which
has allowed an efficient operation of the electric system and the smooth
and adequate implementation of power projects. However, the following
areas still need improvement and the enacting of regulationst (i)
guidelines and legislation on the environmental and resettlement aspects of
electric power projects; (ii) systems and procedures for the design of
small and medium size hydroelectric projects; (iii) reduction of illicit
use of electricity; and (iv) updating regulations on zhe concession and
operation of electricity services. CORFO agreed to carry out studies, as
part of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, to take care of the first
three items above, the recommendations of which will be enacted by the
Government after due consultation with the Bank. In addition, the
Government agreed to let CNE update the legislation pertaining to the
concession and operation of electricity services (para. 3.08).
The Electric Power Market
2.16      In 1985, the total installed capacity in the country was 3,967
MW, of which 572 were hydroplants. That capacity included 873 MW of
captive capacity, mainly thermal (902) installed mostly by mining
companies. Annex 2.3 presents details of the installed capacity, gross
goneration and consumption distribution for the Central Interconnected
System (SIC) (para. 2.18) and the following table presents an overview of
chile's historical (1980 and 1985) and future (1990) public power sector:

2.17      In 1985, total gross generation in the country, including self-
producers, was 14,036 GWh, equivalent to 1,163 kWh per capita2 .  Of this
total, 842 was produced in the SIC (para. 2.18). Of the total salos of the
public sector, 562 was consumed by the industrial and mining sectors, 222
by the residential sector, 9.31 by commereo, 9.4Z by public institutions
and public lighting, and the remaining 3.3X by transport and other sectors.
Chile has one of the highest rates of access to electricity service in
Latin America (861); urban population access is 962 and rural 352. Energy
losses are 17.32 with respect to net generation, considerod high, and are
partly due to the high transmission losses (6.52) typical of a longitudinal
system, determined by the geographical shape of the country (the length of
the SIC is close to 2,000 kms). Illicit use of electricity is estimated to
be about 4.12 ; an study to be carried out under the proposed project
(para. 3.08) will address this problem.
2.18       For electricity supply purposes, the country has been divided
into seven electricity zones. Norte Grande is the first zone; the SIC
includes the second through the sixth zones; and the isolated systems in
the South constitute the seventh zone. The SIC provides service to the
central region of the country (432 of the total country area). It includes
932 of the population which consume 841 of total electricity and generates
952 of the Chilean GDP. It also includes most of the country's installed
capacity (2,946 MW or 742 of total).
Power Sector Planning
2.19      CNE is in charge of preparing and updating the power generation
expansion program bs"ed on least-cost principles; the latest updating was
done in July 1986 when the construction of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric
Project was confirmed for operation in late 1992. CNE uses a dynamic

programming model which is adequate; among other factors, it takes into
account the peculiarities of the Chilean hydrology and water storage
systems, and determines the cost of the demand not met. Fuel costs are
considered at international price levels. As a result of CNE's studioes,
the generation companies are committed to construct the projects assilgned
to them, usually for a horison of no more than eight years; ary present
programming of projects beyond this period, and the selection of
responsible compapies for their execution and operation, are prollminary
onlyl final decisions are taken at the proper time, based on the updated
results of the expansion program.
2.20      In the 1975-1985 period, gross energy generation in the SIC
Increased at an average of 5.6Z p.a. Current demand projections prepared
by CNE, based on sectora' methods and aggregate models, forecast an overall
growth of 5.01 for the period 1985-1995. This projection (high scenario)
assumes that the ratio of investment to GDP will grow progressively from
the 1985 level of 14.41 to 222 In 1990 and thereafter. A more conservative
approach (low scenario) assumes that the historical average of 182 would be
reached by 1988 and would be maintained thereafter; the resulting rate of
growth for energy generation Is 4.62. Under both assumptions and for other
conditions analysed by CNE, the need of the operation of the Pehuenche
Project by the end of 1992 is confirmed (Annex 2.3).
Power Sector Investment Proaram
2.21      On the basis of the updated power generation expansion program
prepared by CN%, each public sector power company prepares investment
programs which, in addition to the generating plants assigned to them,
include optimized investments for the expansion of their transmission and
distribution system. A consolidated financial projection report for the
electric public sector, prepared by CNE in July 1986, shows that a total
investment of US$2,391 million (in constant January 1987 prices) will be
required by the Government-controlled sector in the 1987-1995 period.
Approximately, 731 would be invested In generation, 181 in transmission and
92 in distribution (see Annex 2.4.1). During this period, a total of 1,236
MW would be added to the system and sales would increase by 6,200 GWh. The
investment program is feasible to finance: 29% would be internally
generated funds, 142 equity contributions from local sources and 572
borrowings. The investment program is apparently unbalanced, as the
distribution component is low; the apparent imbalance is explained and due
to s (i) the high level of access to electricity already existing In the
country (para. 2 17), (ii) the high percentage of energy sales to large
consumers, and (iii) above figures do not Include investments to be made by
privately-owned distribution companies.
2.22      The investment program of PEHUENCHE S.A., Beneficiary of one of
the proposed loans, covers the period of construction of the Pehuenche
Hydro Plant, i.e. 1986-1992, with a total of US$664 million (in constant
January 1987 prices), which does not include US$36 million invested by
ENDESA in the project before PEHUENCHE S.A. took over. For the present
time, no investment in other projects is foreseen for PEHUENCHE S.A. after
1992 (see Annex 2.4.3).  The investment program of ENDESA, the Beneficiary
of the other loan, amounts to US$1,056 million for the period 1987-1995 (in
constant January 1987 prices) of which 75% would be Invested In generation
and 251 in transmission (Annex 2.4.2). The funding of this investment



9 -
ptogram would be as follows: 402 with internally generated funds, t7 with
equity contribistions and 53% with borrowings. The Investment program of
both Beneficiaries are reasonable and viable.
2.23     The Government has no direct control over the investment of
private power companies (most of them electric distribution companies);
however, the power sector legislatioti has built-in safeguards to protect
the customer against poor service due to inadequate investments: (1) since
no tariff increases are poemitted when energy losses increase the
distribution companies are compelled to renew and expand their distribution
facilities to keep lceas low; and (ii) within its area of concession, a
distribution company must provide service to any customer who requests it
under strict conditions established by law.
Electricity Prigina
2.24      The Governmont policy on electricity pricing is In line with the
overall country policy of letting market forces establish prices of goods
and services. Price of electricity supply to major consumers is set
through bargaining between consumers and suppliers who must compete for
that portion of the market. In the case of distribution tariffs, where a
natural monopoly oxists, tariffs are regulated and set on the basis of
marginal cost principles by the Ministry of Economyt on the basis of
recvumendations made by CNE. Energy tariff is the short-run marginal cost
of energy and capacity tariff is the marginal cost of now generating
required to cover peak demand, calculated on the basis of a least-cost
inevstment program. At the end of 1986, the average retail tariff was
USc4.50 per kWh. One relevant characteristic of the present legislation is
that consumers are allowed to choose freely the alternative tariffs
provided by law, within their corresponding voltage rango, and not by class
of consumer (Annex 2.5).
2.25     The above tariff scheme has been established under the General Law
of Electricity Services (Decree Law No. 1 of September 13, 1982, as amended
(para. 2.10) which constitutes the basic legal framework that regulates the
Chilean power sector and its finances . The corresponding electricity
pricing system Is sound and has been promoted by the Bank as a surrogate of
market forces for an adequate allocation of resources. The maintenance of
such a iricing system, on which the economic and fieancial evaluation of
the proposed project has been based, is of the utmost importance for
achieving the objectives of the project. Processing of both loans has been
carried out under the assumption that the present system of electricity
pricing based on marginal cost principles will be maintained. Therefore,
changes in legislation which materially and adversely affect such pricing
system will constitute an event of suspension.
Sector Finances
2.26     After a low performance in the second half of the 1970's, sector
finances have steadily Improved, especially after the new electricity
pricing policy was Implemented in the early 1980's (para. 2.24).   The rate
of return of ENDESA, which until 1985 had about 801 of sector assets, has
evolved as follows:

should attract the envisioned equity contributions from potential investors
to allow sector expansion without an excessive reliace on borrowings as a
source of financing. When assignig exclusive responsibility or
participation in the construction of new generation or transmission
projects, in addition to technical aspects, CNE considers the available
funds of each existing power company, and the possible interest of private
investors. See Annex 2.6 for more details on sector finances.
Bank Participation
2.30      The Bank has provided financial assistance to the Chilean power
sector siceC 1948 and has been instrumental in facilitating its growth and
development through six loans totalling US$143.3 million. Notwithstanding
the partial cancellation of Loan No. 1351-CH In 1981 because of non-
compliance with a financial covenant by the beneficiary, ENDESA, the
corresponding PCR concludes that the proceeds of the loan which were
disbursed were usefully invested and fiancial performance of ENDESA
improved substantially (Report No. Sec (85-316 of March 21, 1985).

Iank and Countrt Goals and Sector Lendina Stratenv
2.31      Within the frawork of Its general energy policy, the Government
has established the following specific objectives for the power sector:
(a) to promote an efficient use of electricity through realistic
pricing policies, energy conservation, and improvement in sector
operationsa
(b) to deconcentrate and decentralize ENDESA, the major state-owned
electric utility, with the creation of new companies for projects
greater then 300 NW; and
(c) to divest the Government's ownership In electric utilities in an
orderly process, starting with regional distribution companies,
small generating companies and major distribution companies, and
completing the process with mjor generation companies.
2.32      The Bank's role in the sector is to support the general economic
and energy policies of the Government, and the specific objectives set for
tho power sector bys
(a) ensuring a sound institutional framework for project investment;
(b) assisting the country in obtaining added foreign currency for
financing, on adequate term., the power sector investment program,
through the Bank's own lending instruments or acting as a catalyst
for other sources of financing;
(c) increasing the share of goods and services acquired through ICB so
as to make the best possible use of scarce foreign currency
resources;
(d) belping CNN in Its efforts of maintaining an electricity pricing
system based on marginal costs and Implementing the corresponding
regulations;
(e) strengthening the sector's norms and procedures on environmental
and resettlement matters as related to construction and operation
of power projects; and
(f) promoting the participation of private Investors in sector
activities, not only through the sale of shares of existing
companies but also through incentives for co-generation and
construction of new small hydro projects.
3. THE PROJECTS
Oritain and Preiaration
3.01      The first menuton of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project dates
back to 1961, then known as the MNule-Melado Project, when the first pre-
feasibility study was made by ENDISA. Subsequently, feasibility studies
were carried out, and In 1985 CNI, considering that the project ws" part of



- 12 -
the least-cost program, authorized its execution; between 1981 and 1986
EUDESA executed detailed engineering and in 1985 constructed part of the
infrastructuro required for the project (i.e. access roads, bridges and a
camp), investing an estimated total of US$36 million until Janwary 1986.
The design of the project was done by ENDESA's engineering department, with
the assistance of foreign consultants (Harza Engineering and Kaiser
Engineering, both of the USA). In April 1986, based on CNE's
recommendation, the Government decided that the newly created PEHUENCHE
S.A. would be in charge of the construction and operation of the project.
3.02      In May 1986, the Chilean Government expressed interest in
securing Bank financing for the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, to be
constructed by PEHUENCHE S.A. and associated transmlssion system (Alto
Jahuel - Polpalco), to be constructed by ENDESA, within a financing scheme
which lnludes a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and
suppliers credits. A preparation mission was sent to Chile in August 1986,
after which the Minister of Finance confirmed the Government's request for
financin. A pre-appraisal mission wss carried out in November 1986, and
the appraisal mission In January-February 1987.
Letal Arranaements
3.03      As the Chilean constitution prohibits lending operations between
the Government and its public enterprises or agencies, or between the
latter, the proposed Bank operation cantot be made as one loan to the
Governrent for relending to the Beneficiaries. Because of this constraint
and linits on indebtedness for PEHUENCHE S.A. the proposed operation
involves two loans: one for CORFO, the Government holding company, who will
transfer as equity contributions to PEHUENCHE S.A. most of the proeoeds and
the other for ENDESA. The legal documents covering this operation include
two Guarantee Agroements with the Government, Loan Agreements with each of
the Borrowers (CORPO and ENDESA), and a Project Agreement with PEHUENCHE
S8A*.
Borrowers and Beneficiaries
3.04      CORFO is the Government holding and development bank, created in
1939 to promoto productive activities in the country by making equity
investments in its own companies and giving loans and guarantees to private
enterprises. It is an autonomous agency related to the Government through
the Mntistry of Economy. Because of previous governments" policies, it has
participated In just about all economic sectors but under the present
Government's policy of privatisation, it has started an ambitious
divestiture program. It has a controlling share in the major electricity
generation companies, including PEHUENCHE S.A. (para. 2.08). (See Annex
3.1 for more details on the institutional aspocts of CORPO.)  Under the
proposed operation, CORFO would participate as the Government's
intatrmdiary agency to channel Bank resources to PEHUENCHE S.A. and as the
Government agency in charge of the national environmental program.
3.05      PEHUCHE S.A. wa created in April 1986 to construct and operate
the Pebuenche Sydroolectric Plant. Its present shareholders aru CORFO
(701), ENDESA (202) and CHILECTRA-GENERACION (101). The company should be
succossful in achieving its objectives as Its management is competent, its
professional staff are experienced (many came from other sector companies



- 13 -
or private enterprises), and ft has an adequate number of well qualiffed
employees (total of 45), an adequate organization structure and streamlined
management systems (see Annex 3.2 for more details).
3.06      ENDESA, also a subsidiary of CORF0, was created in 1944 with the
purpose of preparing a National Power Plan and Implementing It in the areas
Where other companies would not fulfill the plan's objectives. ENDESA has
boen quite successful in its activities and is, by far, the largest public
utility in the country (para. 2.13). The high level of access to service
aehieved in Chile (para. 2.17) has been, by and large, due to the work done
by ENDESA. Until 1975, ENDESA had its own construction force, but since
tbon has contracted out the construction of its projects. It has a well
developed engineering capability and provides consulting services to other
utilities in Chile and other countries (see Annex 3.3 for more details).
The new policy of deconcentration and decentralization of the Government
ha meant that ENDESA's growth, and its share in the sector, will be
substantially reduced (para. 2.13).
Obiectives of the Prolects
3.07      The construction of the Pehuenche Power Plant would expand
Chiles ptower generation facilities to meet the growing demand of
electricity: the project would provide 172 of the generation requirements
in 1993, the first year of full operation. The construction of the Alto
Jahuel - Polpaico transmission facilities would expand the capacity to
transmit the power generated in new power plants In the South, including
the Pehuenche Project, to the load centers in Santiago and the North; under
present legislation, transmission facilities can be utilized by any
goneration company, Independently of ownership. The training components of
both projects would permit the Beneficiaries, ENDESA and PEHUENCHE S.A., to
train their professional staff in areas related to new high voltago
transmission technologies and daily system operations. The power sector
studies and environmental protection programs, to be executed by CORPO
under the coordination of CNE, would complement areas at present not fully
covered by existing legislation and practices.
Description of the Projects
3.08      The projects to be financed with the two loans include the
following components:
- The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Prolect (CORFO Loan):
(a) The Pehuencho Hydroelectric Power Plant: Construction of a 500 MW
hydroelectric power plant, with an annual average generation of
2,765 GWh. The project is located about 250 km south of Santiago,
and will use the waters of the Maule River and its tributary, the
Melado River. The main works include a small diversion dam at the
Maule River, a daily storage earth dam at the Melado River,   90 m
high, with a useful volume of 6.5 million cubic meters, two
tunnels with a total length of 13.3 km, an underground power house
with two 250 MW turbine generating units and a 25 km, 220 kV
double circuit transmission llne to connect the project to the SIC
at Colbiin.



- 14 -
(b)  Training Component for PEHUENCHE S.A.s Training of about 11
professionals (with a total of 36 staff-months), through short
courses, training stages and visits to projects under construction
similar to Pehuenche, in fields related to construction, contract
administration, technical operation of power plants, power pooling
and economic dispatching, and finance and administration. The
power plant and transmission line operators will be trained by
ENDESA under a contract with PEHUENCHE S.A. (Annex 3.4.5).
(c) Execution of the following studies by CORPO's subsidiaries with
CNE coordination: (a) protection of the onvironment and
resettlement issues related to the execution of power projects;
(b) preparation of a handbook for the execution of basic design of
small and medium size hydroelectric projects (1.0 to 50.0 MW); and
(c) reduction of illicit use of electricity. In addition, CNE
will complete the issuance of regulations related to the General
Law of Electricity Servicies in the areas of systems operation and
concessions of electric services.
(d) Execution of a national environmental program by CORPO's
subsidiaries, designed for the protection of endangered species
and training of four professionals in environmental and ecological
areas.
3 Alto Jahuel-PolDaico Transmission Proiect (ENDESA Loan):
(a) The Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission System: Construction of
the Polpaico - Rodeo Transmission Line, 63 km long, single
eircuit, 500 kV (initially to be operated at 220 kV), and the
Redeo - Alto Jahuel 220 kV line, 17 km long; construction of a new
220 kV switching station with seven bays at Polpaico, and
enlargement of the following 220 kV substationss San Isidro (150
IVA), Alto Jahuel (two extra bays) and Colbun (two bays).
(b) Training Component for ENDESAt Training of about 50 professionals
(135 staff-months) at foreign and local universities and power
companies in the following fields: (a) design, operation and
maintenance of extra-high voltage transmission systems; (b) design
and operation of encapsulated (SF6) type substations; (c)
environmental impact of extra-high voltage transmission systems;
(d) applications of direct current transmission systems; (e) the
use of new computer technologies for the design and control of
high-voltage transmission systems, including the purchase of
microcomputers; and (f) international finance management (Annex
3.4.5).
Estimated Cost
3.09     The estimated current cost of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project,
including financial charges3 is US$799.3 million, of which approximately
3/ Interest During Construction (IDC) on the loans directly granted to
the Beneficiary PEHUENCHE S.A. The interest on the Bank loan to CORPO
is not included because the funds will be transferred to PEHUENCHE S.A.
as equity contribution, not subject to financial charges.



- 15 -
602 is direct and Indirect foreign cost, and that of the Alto Jahuel-
Polpaico Transmission Project# Including financial charges4 is US$38.7
million.   Costs include US$29.0 million of identifiable tax   and duties
for the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project and US$1.6 million for the Alto
Jahuel-Polpaieo Transmission Project, both to be financed with local
resources (Annex 3.4.1).  Project cost estimates are based on detailed
engineering design prepared in 1985 and 1986 and updated to reflect January
1987 price levels. In view of the advanced design and the detailed
geological studies and surveys carried out for the two projects, an overall
physical contingency of only 9.32 Is included In agreement with the
Beneficiaries and IDB, the main financier of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric
Projoet, price contingencies were added to both local and foreign costs,
expressed In US dollars, at the following ratos: 1986, 14.12J 1987, 7.61;
1988, 6.32; 1989, 5.0%2 1990, 3.82; 1991, 5.02; and 1992, 3.5%. For the
Pehuenche Hydroelectric Plant, the cost of consultants for execution of
detailed engineering and construction supervision has been determined on
the basis of a contract already signed betwoen PEHUENCHE S.A. and ENDESA
(par&. 3.19) and reaches 10.42 of total project cost.

3.11    For the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, local resources includes
(i) capital contributions by other generation companies (ENDESA US$82.8
million, CHILECTRA-GENERACION US$50.0 thousand), (Ui) capital contributions

equlty contribution to PEHUSUCHE S.A. (US$94.6 million). Recent exporSnce
in the financing of power projects in Chile and the intorest already shown
by various countries, lead to conclude that suppllers credits would be
readily accessible to PEHUENCHE S .A..
3.12     The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmiosion Project will be financed
witht (4) ENDESA's own funds (US$17.2 million) and (ii) the proposed IBRD
loan to ENDESA (US$21.5 million).
- 0=' Finaces
3.13     CORFO's finances are very sensitive to the policies of the Chilean
Government as it acts as its financial agent in most productive sectors.
As such, ln the past, its results have been quite erratic from years of
positivo results (1980, 1981, 1982 and 1984) to years of significant losses
(1983, 1985 and 1986) caused by Governmont decisions such as the conclusion
of the preferential exchange rate (1985) and the divestlture program
(1986). The situation of CORFPOs flow of funds often diverges from the
results of the income statement. For example, in 1986, the implementation
of the divestiture program resulted in a significant Increase in cash
assets, from US$34 million at the beginning of the year to US$196 million
at the end of the year. The divestiture program is expected to result in a
decrease of the company's net worth. However, if the Government decids to
transfer to CORFO companies which are not yet under its control, basically
railways, metropolitan transport system and petroleum, lts net worth could
increase. Although the flianclal projections of CORFO (Annex 3.5) sbow
that the implemetation of present divestiture policies will result in
lo0sse untLl 1988, the company would have an excellent flow of funds wibch
would allow it to meet all of its obligations and even make stock
repagments to the Governmeant Should these policles change, the results
could be quite different. Any cash surpluses will most likely be absorbed
by the Govervnmt as any cash deficits will have to be covered by the
Gosvernment.
3.14     Under the financing plan of the proposed project (para. 3.11),
COMFO is supposed to make equity contributions to PEIUENCHE S.A. of
US$224.3 million of which US$94.6 million would come from the proposed
operation and US$129.7 million from its own resources. Within the general
Government policy of divestiture of state-owned enterprises, in the future
CORMO might decide to sell some of its shares in PEHUENCHE S.A. which could
have originated from the proposed loan funding. Since the Bank supports
the Government's policy of privatization and as the proposed loan would
have achieved Its objective of financing a portion of the foreign currency
of the Pehuenche Hydro Project, after completion of the project, the Bank
will not object to the possible sale of shares of CORFO in PEHUENCHE S.A.,
albeit financed with the proposed loan proceeds, as long as CORFO's
obligations as Borrower of the loan and PEHUENCHE S.A.'s obligations as
Boeeficiary are not diminished in any way. During negotiations, CORPO and
PSHDENCHE S.A. agreed to this condition; CORFO also agreed that during the
construetion period of the project, it shall maintain the ownership of at
least 702 of the stock of PEHUENCHE S.A. and not to sell the shares
financed by loan proceeds without the Bank's consent.



- 17 -
- Local Bond Issue
3.15     A portion of the local funding (US$103.0 million) included in the
financing plan of tho project (pars. 3.11) Is expocted to originate from a
bond issue in the local capital market   These resources are expected to
come frow the AFPs which, under legislation recently enactod, have a great
degree of liquidity and restricted investment possibilities. The Pehuenche
Hydroelectric Project ts one of them and it should be attractive for the
APPs, but there still exists uncertainty on how they will respond as the
system is new (Annex 3.6.4).
- PUCHI S.A.'s Finances
3.16     Until 1992 when the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project is expected to
be commissioned, the finances of PEHUINCHE S.A. will be those related to
the funding of the project sa it does not have any plants in operation.
During the construction period, the debtlequity ratio is expected to
increase and reach a maximum of 56144 in 1991. After the plant starts
operation, this ratio is expected to decrease as the amortization of many
of the loans become due. Under the conditions established in the
electricity pricing system, PEHUENCHE S.A. io expected to earn a rate of
return between 8 and IIZ on average net fixed assets in operation. These
conditions and those assumed for project financing are expected to allow an
Internal fund generation sufficient to pay dividends and debt servie-, and
allow the accumulation of some cash surpluses (Annex 3.6).
- UENDSA's Finances
3.17     In the past, ENDESA's finances have reflected sector finanees as
its assets constituted about 853 of sector ssets. However, under the new
Government policies of decentralisation and deconcentration, the weight of
ENDESA in the sector has been substantially reduced (para. 2.13). Its rate
of return has been stoadily Improving between 1981 (3.62) and 1985 (8.22)
but It was expected to fall in 1986 (5.62) basically because, under the new
sector structure, it has become a major buyer of electricity (mainly from
COLBUN S.A.). In 1985, lses than 31 of its revenues were used to pay
electricity purchased uhile In 1986 this was expected to roach almost 252.
However, during the noet ton years, ENDESA's rate of return is expected to
recover steadily until 1995 (11.31), based on the present electricity
pricing scheme (para. 2.24). Since under the new sector policies the
investments under ENDESA will be minimal, the company is expected to
accumulate substantial fund surpluses which may be used by its controlling
shareholder (CORPO) to make equity withdrawals. If these do not occur, its
debtlequity ratio will also show an improving trend until 1995 when it
would recch 29/71. Its internal funding is expected to be sufficient to
pay income taxes, dividends and debt service and make a substantWal
contribution to the investment program (431) (Annex 3 7).
- Financial Covenants
3.18     Since the proposed operation is based on the assumption that the
electricity pricing system based on marginal costs will be preserved (para.
2.25), it haa not been deemed necessary to include a covenant related to
the rate of return of the Beneficiaries. However, in order to safoguard



- 18 -
the financial soundness of both institutions, particularly before the
possibility that the funding sources do not materialise as planned, during
negotiations agreement was reached on the following conditions:
(a) With the Governments to provide CORFO, PEHUENCHE S.A., and ENDESA,
as appropriate, the resources necessary to cover any possible
shortfall in the equity contributions or other funding required
for the adequate and timely execution of the projects.
(b) With PEHFENCHE S.A.t (i) during project execution, to furnish to
the Bank, by November 30 of each year a financing plan for
carrying out the Pehuenche Project during the following year and
to implement such plan; (ii) after project completion, to seek the
Bank's concurrence before incurring any new debt if its debt
service coverage ratio Is lower than 1.1; and (III) during the
term of the loan, to maintain a dobt/equity ratio not greater than
67133.
(c) With ENDESA: (i) to maintain a debt/equity ratio not greater than
60/40; and (_1) to seek the Bank's concurrence before incurring
any new debt if its debt service coverage ratio is lower than 1.3.
For the above purpose, debt-service coverage ratio will be considered as
the ratio between the internal fund generation and the debt service. The
internal fuil generation would Include the funds generated through the
normal operations of the Beneficiary as defined in its income statement
plus (less) the charges (credits) which do not mean cash disbursements and
the sale of assets, less the net payments of income tax, dividends and
equity withdrawals.
Imlementation
3.19      Execution of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Power Plant started in
January 1986, with the construction of auxiliary works; bidding of some
civil works started in mid-1986. Testing of the power plant is programed
for the end of 1992, and full comacecial operation would begin in January
1993 (Annex 3.4.3), or after seven years of construction, which is
reasonable considering the advanced status of the project and the long and
successful experience of ths Chileans in similar projects. The final
engineering design, factory inspection, supervision of construction and
training of plant operators will be done by ENDESA, who will act as
consultant to PEHWENCHE S.A., under a contract signed in November 1986, in
terms acceptable to the Bank. An independent Board of Consultants, formed
by internationally known experts in hydro plant design, geology,
foundations and seismology, has reviewed the design of the power plant
sinee the early stages (1981); PEHUENCHE S.A. will continue with the
services of the Board throughout the construction period. Construction of
the civil engineering works (diversion dam, tunnels, storage dam and
underground powerhouse) and erection of electromechanical equipment will be
carried out by contractors.



- 19 -
3.20      The terzs of referen¢e of the power sector studies, prepared by
CNN were reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable; CORFO will be the
executing agency and a Coordirating Committee to be formed with
representatives from CNE, CORFO and the Ministry of Economy will supervise
the execution of the studies. Professional staff from the main power
companies (ENDESA, CHILECTRA-GENERACION, COLBUN S.A., PEHUENCHE S.A. and
CHILECTRA-MEIROPOLITANA) will constitute three techanical groups, to
execute, with the assistance of consultants, the power sector studies. In
addition, CNE will issue, not later than December 31, 1988, updated
regulations to the General Law of Electricity Services agreed with the Bank
(para. 3.08). The national environmental protection program will be
executed by CORPO through the Corporaci6n Nacional Forestal (National
Forestry Corporation - CONAl).
3.21      Engineering services and construction supervision of the Alto
Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project will be carried out by ENDESA's
engineering department; contractors will be in charge of all construetion
activities   ENDESA has already defined the route of the lines and the
location of the new substation, will complete bid documents In 1987, will
start construction in 1988 and will place the new installations in service
in 1991 and 1992 (Annex 3.4.3).
Procurement
3.22      The number and nature of the contracts to be financed with funds
from the proposed loan have been agreed with the Beneficiaries, and would
include: (i) three contracts for the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, for
the construction of a small diversion dam, a 7 km long tunnel and the
supply of control and telemetering equipment; and (ii) four contracts for
the Alto Jabuel-Polpaico Transmission Project, for the supply of equipment
and materials and erection works. Procurement would be carried out under
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for a small ENDESA contract
costing less than US$200,000 which would be procured under international
shopping. Procurement documents for contracts over US$200,000 equivalent
which represent about 992 of the total loan, will be subject to prior
review by the Bank. Other contracts related with the power plant and
financed by IDB and suppliers credits will be procured under procedures
which would assure economy and efficiency. Contracts financed with local
funds and related with auxiliary works (i.e. access roads, construction of
camps, electric supply to works, etc.) will be contracted under LCB. The
services of consultants for the execution of the power sector studies will
be contracted with firms selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.23     The following table summarizes procurement arrangements for the
project, shown in detail in Annex 3.4.3s

Disbursments
3.24       Proceds of the proposed loan to CORPO would be disbursed as
follows: 2) up to US$94.6 million at the fully documented request of the
Beneficiary PEHUENCHE S.A., under the authorization of the Borrower CORFO,
to finance 1002 of the costs, excluding import duties and taxes, of the
following contractst (i) CP-l.1, diversion dam at the Maule River; (ii) CP-
2.1(A), the Maule tunnel; (iii) CP-8.2, supply and erection of
telecommunication and tolemetering equipment; and (iv) 1002 of the foreign
cost of PEHUENCHE t.A.'s training component; and 2) at the fully documented
request of the Borrower, CORFO, to finance 1002 of foreign expenditures and
302 of local expenditures of the national environmental program. Proceeds
of the loan to ENDESA would be disbursed at their fully documented request
to finances (a) 75Z of the cost of contracts STAP-1, 2, 3 and 4, which is
the estimated foreign component of the project, and (b) 1002 of the foreign
cost of ENDISA's training component.



- 21 -
3.25     In addition, under provisions of Loan No. 2504-CH, the Bank would
disburse against 100Z of the cost of consultants for the execution of the
power sector studies.
3.26     Both proposed loans would be disbursed over a period of seven
years, in accordance with the Bank's standard disbursement profile; final
loan disbursements would be made by June 1994, or 18 months after estimated
project compltion, to allow for liquidation of contracts and settlemont of
possible claims. It is, however, possible that if no claims are presented,
or If they are settled quickly, the disbursement period could be reducod to
five and a half or six years. Because preliminary works related vith the
eavironmental progrm must begin before any construction occurs at the
Pehuanche Power Plant site, it was agreed to include retroactive financing
of up to US$100,000 to CORP0, after February 1, 1987. In order to
facilitate disbursements, at the request of the Borrowers, Special Accounts
will be established In amounts of approximately US$7.0 million for
PEHUENCHI S.A. and US$2.0 million for ENDESA, equal to about four months of
estimated peak disbursments.

3.27     As required by Chilean law, PEHUENCHE S.A. and ENDESA have to
publish their financial statements audited by a firm of independent
auditors Included in the Register of Auditors kept by the Superintendency
of Securities and Insurance.  In 1986, the firms of Peat, Marvick, Mitchell
& Co. and Coopers & Lybrand were selected respectively, as their
independent auditors. CORFO's external auditors are, also by law, the
General Comptroller of the Republic. During project execution, both
PEBUENCHE S.A. and ENDESA, as project executing agencies, would present in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank duly audited
financial statements, project accounts and statements of expenditures
related to the project. In addition, the special account to be opened at
the Central Bank would also be audited, in accordance with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, by the General Comptroller of the
Republic. CORFO's annual external audit report would also be provided by
the General Comptroller.
nvironment and Rosettlement
3.28     Bank staff analysed the environmental impact of the Pehuenche
Hydroelectric Project which is relatively minor as the reservoir aroa is
small (400 ha), tho climate temperate, the project area unpopulatod and the
river already impounded downstream from the project site.  The main impact
is the inundation of two and possible damage to a third of the last twelve
breeding sites left in Chile for the Chilean Conure parrot, (cvanoliseus
pataaonus bvrogi) an endangered species that lives and breeds only in
Chile; the Government has accorded the highest protection for the remaining
birds estimated at only 2800. The environrental impact of the transmission
system to be constructed by INDESA would be minimal, as the route of the
Alto Jahuel-Polpaico line follows the mainly unpopulated end arid western
areas of the Santiago valley; land owners will be adequately compensated
for the right-of-way for the transmission line.
3.29     The plans and cost allocation for the Pehuenche Hydroelectric
Power Plant prepared by PEHUENCHE 8A., guarantoe the execution of



- 22 -
env'romental protection measures.  A total amount of US$1.1 million
(current costs) has been assigned to carry out studies and execute works
related with the project's parrot conservation program, protection of the
endangered plant species that might be found In the area and salvage of
ar:heological objects If required. Specifically, for the protection of the
Tricahue parrot, PEHUENCHE S.A. will undertake a c& tive breeding program
for the birds of two breeding sites to be inundated by the reservoir, and
fence in and protect a third site during the construction period of the
project. Following completion of construction, the birds would be re-
Introduced to the area. The legal documents include specific agreements
and schedules to be observed by PEHUENCHE S.A. on environmental matters.
3.30     In addition, and at the recommendation of the Bank, CORFO has
agreed to carry out a national environmental program, partly financed with
the proposed loan, which will include specific measures for the protection
of species now in danger of extinction (e.g. seeding and re-foresting land
with an ondangered tree species, Belloto del Sur), provide training to four
Chiloan professionals in environmental and ecological matters, provide
national training and dissemination of environmental findings, and assist
in the supervision of the environmental work related to the project and the
environment In general.
Dam Safety and Insgection
3.31     The Board of Consultants to be engaged by PEHUENCHE S.A. (para.
3.19) will make periodic visits to the project site to ascertain that the
detailed design and construction methods for the Molado Dam are adequate,
and will recommend an Inspection program to assure its safety. The Project
Agreement with PEHUENCHE S.A. includes a covenant requiring the Beneficiary
to advise the Bank in writing, at least one year before the completion of
the project, on the proposed program and method of inspection for the
Melado Dam.
Performance Indicators
3.32     The Bank and the Beneficiaries have agreed on a set of performance
indicators (Annex 3.9) which represent reasonable achievement goals to
monitor their performance during the execution period of the projects.
Pro3ect Risks
3.33     Physical risks during execution of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric
Project are expected to be minimal, due to the advanced stage and quality
of the engineering design; geological conditions are well known through
studies and surveys which included 10,000 mts of test borings, excavation
of 3,600 mts of galeries, etc. ENDESA's transmission system does not
present special risks either. As is usual in Chile, all works have been
designed considering seismic risks.
Economic JustificaLtion
3.34     The proposed addition of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Power Plant
and expansion of the national transmission system are part of Chile's
least-cost expansion program for the power sector. As it Is not practical
to allocate benefits to each component included in the proposed projects,
an economic evaluation for each project was not done. Instead, the



- 23 -
Internal rate of return (IRR) of the overall 1986-1995 investment program
for the powr sector Integrated in the SIC was computed, as the discount
rate *qullaUig the present values of the stream of costs and benefits
associated with it. The cost stream, expressed in 1986 constant prices,
include the overall capital investmeat program and the associated
Incremental operation and maintenance costsa as a proxy for benefits, the
revenues derived from Incremental energy sales were applied, at retail
tariffs. The eo¢nomic evaluation ts conservative since use of an
opportunity cost for energy saved (using shadow prices for foreign
exchange) would Improve the rate of return; no attempt was mAde to reflect
indirect benefits to society and to the economy of the country, sueb as
those de-ived from availability of energy to new housing developments and
new Industries, since ctnoumer surplus (measured as the willingness to pay)
would well exceed exist ing tariffs. On these assumptions, the internal
rate of return for the program is 11.22 (Annex 3.8). Sensitivity analyses
show the rate of return to be very sensitive to changes in electricity
tariffs and sales (IRR is 9.62 if benefits are 102 lower), to capital cost
Increases (IRR is 1O.02 if costs are 102 higher), and moderately sensitive
to changes in operation and maintenance costs (IRR equal to 10.9Z if costs
are 102 higher).
3.35     The above results confirm that the projects are justified and show
the adequacy of the Chilean tariff system, which allows rates of return on
capital close to its opportunity cost (10 to 112); lower tariffs and
consequent lower rates of return would discourage private investors, and
higher tariffs may result in costs unfair to consumers.
ProjOct F$le
3.36     Annex 3.10 lists the documents consulted for processing the
present operation.
4. AGREEMENTS RUACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
The Government gave assurances that the present system of electricity
pricing based on marginal cost principles will be maintained; any changes
In legislation which materially and adversely affect such pricing system
will constitute an event of suspension for both loans (para. 2.25). During
negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
4.01     With the Governments
(a)  to provide CORPO, PEHUENCHE S.A., and ENDESA, as appropriate, the
resources necessary to cover any possible shortfall in the equity
contributions or other funding required for the adequate and
timely execution of the projects (para. 3.18);
(b) to assist in the preparation of the institutional studies to be
executed by CORFO; by March 31, 1989, to exchange views with the
Bank on the results of such studies; and to put into effect their
recommendations (para. 2.15); and
(e) not later than December 31, 1988, to update the regulations In
areas related to concessions and operations of electricity

1.       The National Energy Commission (CNE) was created by Decree Law No.
2224 of May 25, 1978. CNE is a public entity, functionally decentralized
which reports to the Pxasident of the Republic. It is the regulating
agency for all energy related activities which comprise studies,
exploration, exploitation, generation, transmission, transportation,
storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other activities
associated with electricity, coal, gas, petroleum and its derivatives, and
nuclear, geothermal, solar and other types of energy.
Functions
2.       Within the national development plan, CNE proposes to the
President of the Republic, for his approval, the plans, polici's and norms
for the energy sector; monitors their compliance; studies and prepares the
energy demand and supply projections; engages the services required to
carry out its functions; analyses from the technical point of view the
structure and levels of prices of energy goods and services; reports its
conclusions and recommendations to the Ministry of Economy which is the
only entity authorized to set said prices; provides advice to Government
entities who grant energy related concessions, operation contracts,
licences and authorizations; and monitors the performance of Government
owned energy sector entities.
Orgtanization
3.       CNE has an Executive Board which is presided by a representative
of the President of the Republic, with the rank of minister, and also
comprises the Ministers of Defense, Economy, Finance, Mines, Planning and
Chief of Presidential Staff. The Executive Board approves CNE's annual
plan of action and budget; delegates some of its functions to the Executive
Secretary or to other CNE staff; approves the internal organization of CNE;
and performs other functions which may be required for the normal
functioning of CNE.
4.       The Executive Secretary is in charge of the administration of CNE,
has the legal representation of the entity, is assisted by a small but well
qualified staff, and engages the services of independent consultants to
carry out most of the major sector studies.

gHstorical Data
1.       In the period 1975-1985, consumption (or sales) in the public
sector at the Central Interconnected System (SIC), excluding plant use and
losses, grew at an annual average rate of 5.22 (Annex 2.3.1). The share of
residential consumers on the overall consumption decreased gradually, while
the participation of commercial, industrial and mining customers increased,
as shown in the foliowing tables

2.       In the same period 1975-1985, gross energy generation for public
service in the SIC grew at 5.62 per year, and the installed capacity
increased 63X in the decade, as shown in detail in Annex 2.3.1. For 1985,
maximum demand was 1,850 NW, and the overall load factor was 652.
3.       The SIC has a total of 9,743 circuit-kilometers of transmission
lines rated 500 kW, 220 kV, 154 kV, 110 kV and 66 kV, of which 902 belong
to ENDESA and 102 to CHILECTRA-GENEACION. Total substation capacity is
8,874 MVA, of which 732 are owned by ENDESA, and 272 by CHILECTRA.
P_emnd Forecast
4.       CNE prepared in 1986 dmand forecasts based on sectoral methods
and compared them with a forec"st based on a single, aggregate model, which
ssumes that all variables, with the exception of the GDP will evolve In
the future following past trends. For the sectoral studies, CNE prepared
separate forecasts for the residential, commercial and public sectors, for

ANNX 2,3
Page 2 of 3
light industry, heavy Industry and mining, using econometric relations,
with the exception of heavy industry and mining for which the expansion
plans of oech enterprise vere discussed.
S.       For planning purposes, energy demand forecasts are based on two
scenarios for the future development of the economy (high and low). Both
scenarios consider the same parameters, with the exception of tbe global
investment index (the relation between the global geographic Investment and
the GDP)s in the high scenario, it is assumed that this index will grow
progressively from present levels (14.41 in 1985) to 222 in 1990 and
therefter (as compared to the historical average value of 18i). In the
low scenario, the global geographic index would reach the historical
average (18S) by 1988 and would be maintained thereafter. The resulting
GDP by sectors for both scanarios are as follows

Generation Expansion Plan
7.       CNE Is in charge of preparing and updating the power generation
expansion program based on least-cost principles; CNN uses a dynamic
programming model, considered adequate. For the latest updating of the
plan, prepared in July 1986 at the request of IDB, to support the request
for financing of the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project, CNI used the
following main parameters: (a) discount rate: 132; (b) price of petroleum$
US$17.0 per barrel up to 1990 and US$23.0 thereafter; (c) price of coal

(marginal production cost of national coal, border prices)t US$47.5/ton;
and (d) cost of rationings up to US$0.35 per kWh. The recommended sequence
for addition of new generation, tested by CNE with a sensitivity analysis
for variations of above parameters, confirms the need of the Pehuenche

8.       The energy and capacity balance for the SIC are shown In Annoxes
2.3*3 and 2.3.4; they include historical values up to 1985, and projocted
values for 1986-1995 based on the high growth scenarios the output of the
hydroelectric power plants is assumed to be the average genration for an
average hydrological year. The SIC will be fed by power generated at
plants owned by INDESA, COLBUN S.A., CHIIBCTRA-GENIRACION and PEHUENCHE
S.A.; new additions to the system Include the Alfalfal (160 MW)
Hydroelectric Project in 1990 (CHILECTRA-GENERACION), the Canutillar (144
HW) Hydroproject in 1991 (ENDESA) and Pehuenche (500 MW) at the end of
1992. The energy and capacity balances show the predominance of hydro
generation In the SIC, and that the system will have adequate reserves to
cover the forecast demands.

POWER SECTOR
Electricity Pra ica1
1.      Regulated electricity prices for distribution companies are
established In two stages: at the generation-transmission level (node
priaes) and at the distribution level (aggregate value of distribution).
The sum of both is the maximum price paid by the final consumer. The nod.
pcic.o are the price of bulk electricity sold by the generation companies
to tho distribution companies. They are reviewed in April and Octobor of
each year through Indexation formulae including cost components such as
fuels eqtipment and water reservoir level. These formulae operate
automatically every time there is a variation of at least 102 in the
"pacity or ergy price.
2.       The aggregate values of distribution have three basic cost
components: (a) administration, billing and other consumer-related costs;
(b) costs of investment, operstion, and maintenancel and (c) losses
associated with nergy distribution. The aggregate values are calculated
for aodel distribution companles, with optimum size and operational
efficiencyt in concession areas classified according to their consume
density (high, medium and low). This system intends to promote efflciency
as electricity tariffs are not set on the basis of actual costs and It is
In the benefit of the distribution companies to reach the highest levol of
efficiency possible. The aggregate values of distribution are
automatically adjusted through formulae which consider the variations of
costs such as prices of materials and equipment, and labor. Distribution
companies are authorized to adjust prices every time the node prices or the
aggregate values change.
3.       On the above basis, CNE establishes whether the group of
distribution companies will obtain an adequate economic rate of return
(before incoe tax) which should not differ more than four points from 101.
CNN calculates such economic rate of return for the aggregat of the
distribution copanioes on the basis of new replacement values for the
distribution installations and under the assumption of constant revenues
and costs during thirty years.

4.       Major consumers (installed capacity greater than 2,000 kW) may
freely negotiate electricity prices with any generation companyt within a
range of the nod prices. This policy Intends to: (i) promote competition
among the generation companies; (i1) provide incontives to major consumers
to seek the most economical alternatives for electricity generation
including self-generation and cogeneration; (ii) make optfimal use of
transmission systems; and (iv) make the best use of the technical and
entrepreneurial capacity that the major consumers usually have, to
establish an Independent system of monitoring electricity prices.
S.       Annexes 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 present details of typical tariffs applied
by a generation company (ENDESA) and by a distribution company (EDELNOR)
respectively.

Sector Finances
Back-round
1.       In July 1986, CNE published a set of financial projections for the
1986-1995 period as requested by IDB under the preparation of a proposed
loan for the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project. It w88 the first time that a
set of sector financial projections had been prepared and it was
particularly Important as, starting in 1986, the weight of ENDESA In the
sector ws" substantially reduced with the creation of two new generating
utilitiest COLSUN S.A. and PEHUENCHE S.A. whose projects, one In operation
and the other under construction, respectively, were previously under
ENDESA. There is no similar consolidation of sector historical financial
infonmation, but ENDESA's finances were a good sample of those of the
sector as its &ssets constituted, until 1985, 852 of sector asets. See
Annex 3.7 for a description of ENDESA's finances, historical and projceted.
Income Statement (Annex 2.6. 1)
2.       The enforcing of present legislation for electricity pricing based
on marginal costs is expected to result In a rate of return whvch will
flu,tuate between a minimum of 6.31 in 1987 and a maxima of 8.92 In 1995.
The sector operating margin Is expected to Increase steadily from 40.01 in
1987 to 46.8Z in 1995, which is typical of a system with the share of hydro
goneration which Chile will have during this period (74Z). The major
component of the operating expenses Is the depreciation charge which
oscAillates around 202 of total revenues and, again, reflects the
characteristics of a mostly hydro generation system.
Plow of Funds (Annex 2.6.2)
3.       The sector is expected to generate sufficient resources to pay
Income tax, dividends and debt service, and make a contribution of 281 to
the Investment program which together with equity contribution of 141 would
leave a balance of 581 of borrowings, a reasonable funding mix. :
Balance Sheets (Annex 2.6.3)
4.       The above conditions are expected to create, and maintain, cash
surpluses during the projection period, included as Financial Investments
which fluctuate betwesn 5Z and 81 of total assets. The debt/equlty ratio
which starts at a good level of 40160 In 1987 -is expected to improve
steadily until It reaches 30/70 in 1995, showing the financial soundness of
the present financial schema established for the sector, especially the
electricity pricing system based on marginal costs.
t| These percentages have been calculated Including additional costs for
the Pohuenche Project (see para. 2.28).

ALTO JAHUEL-POLPAICO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
CORFO's Institutional Aspects
Background
I.       CORPO was created on April 29, 1939 during the Government of Pedro
Aguirre Corda with the main purpose of promoting an accelerated Industrial
development In the country. In thi respect, CORFO initially established
subsidiaries in electricity, steel, oil and mdning. Later on, it
etablished companies in agriculture, forestry, tourism, telecommunications
and other sectors. Its Impact has been, in balance, positive for country
development. Because of its success, the CORFO model was reproduced by
several other Latin American countries.
Obiectives and policies
2.       Low 6334, which created CORFO established that its objective would
bes "To formulate a General Development Plan seeking to improve the living
conditions of the population through the utilization of the natural
resources of the country and lowering production costs, and improving the
country's balance of trade, keeping an adequate balance In developing the
mining, agricultural, Industrial and trade activities, and aimivg to meet
the needs of all regions in the country". To carry out this objective, in
the past CORFO participated in just about all economic sectors in the
eountry, but at present it is implementing the Government's policy of
privatisation which is expected to reduce significantly Its weight In
Chile's oconomic activities. Another policy being implemented by CORFO as
a provious stage In the process of privatization is that of deconcentration
and decentralisation of major companies, by breaking up existing companies
and by creating new companies. In the case of the electricity sector,
EDJESA created now regional companies, some of which have already been sold
to tbe private sector, and two major hydro projocts initiated by ENDESA
(Colbii and Pehuenche) resulted in the creation of two new companies.
Functions
3.       CORFO manages its own subsidiary companios, gives loans and
guarantees to other companies, and carries research and development
activities which are the basis for the implementation of new projects,
dir"etly or through the private sector. The privatisation effort is called
"mormali:stion" in the sense that It is "normal" for the private sector to
carry out most of the economic activities In the country and that the
Government, especially through CORFO, plays a subsidiary role, i.e. to
participate only in those activities which are strategic for country
development and in those In which the private sector Is not interested.

Ortanization
4.       CORFO has an organizational structure which is consistent with the
above objectives and policies, and enables it to carry out its functions
adequately. Its Administrative Council is in charge of supervising the
correct implementation of the development objectives assigned by the
Government to CORPO. It comprises the Ministers of Economy, Finance, and
Planning, a representative of the President of the Republic and the
company's Executive Vice-President. The Minister of Economy is the
President of the Council and the Executive Vice-President is the chief
executive officer of the company. The General Counsel acts for the Vice-
President when absent and performs the duties of general legal adviser and
supervisor of the Legal Department. The General Manager reports to the
Vice-Prasident, has four staff units (Public Relations, Internal Auditor,
Security and Advisor), six in-line managers (Enterprises, Promotion,
Development, Normalization, Financial and Administrative) and also
supervises the New York Office, the regional offices and the Information
Center (Annex 3.1.1 presents CORFO's organization chart).
5,       In spite of the great efforts made by the present Government to
reducO the size of CORFO and streamline its procedures, CORFO'8 management
still has to carry out multiple responsibilities, resulting from the
inertia of its previous policies, which constitute a heavy load of
bureaucratic functions. The in-line managers are a group of capable and
experienced professionals which perform their functions adequately. The
existing management information system provides useful and timely data for
decision making. The Advisory Unit, under the General Manager, is in
charge of the information system and also of organizational and procedural
matters of the company.
Staffing and Trainign
6.       Witbin the present Government's policies, the number of employees
at CORPO has been reduced from 4,603 in 1973 to 557 in 1986. CORFO hap
adequate policies for recruiting and training its staff. Through a
comprehensive training program, 217 employees participated in training
activities in 1986.
Aecountint and Auditing
7.       CORFO issues financial statements every quarter as an aggregate of
the results of its subsidiary companies and including as assets the cost of
Its shares in those companies, not their actual market value. As such,
they do not constitute a consolidation of assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary companies. The Accounting Department, under the Financial
Manager, has four units: Control, Investments, Current Accounts and
Foreign Currency. CORPO has an Internal Audit unit which reports to the
General Manager. It works within the holding company, basically



- 47 -
ANNEX3.1I
Pago 3 of 3
supervising the Internal control systemst and performs auditing of
subsidiary companies only on an exception basis, for specific matters, at
the request of their boards of directors. In accordance with Chilean
legislation, the externl auditor of CORFO Is the General Comptroller's
Office which works independently but in close coordination with the
Internal Audit unit whose reports are often the basis for Its monitoring
functions.
ludtat and Plannina
8.       The budgetary system of CORFO is part of the Government's
budgetary system and, as such, Is basically a cash budget which is prepared
yearly for Government approval and is monitored quarterly through the
management information sys,.em of the company, which includes a parallel
monitoring system for the objectives established under the current year
budget. Five year cash flow projections are prepared upon request of
lnternational banking organizations but not on a routine basis. For the
proposed operation a ten year projection was prepared. However, the s8stt
doos not include a projection of the financial statements of the comp.ny
The lank mission prepared such statements (see Annx 3.5) on the bssis of
the cash flow projection. Their uportan¢e, for an ontity like CORFO, lies
basically in the setting up of objectives expressed in finacial ratios
which reflect present policies.

Backaround and OwnorshIP
1        On April 22, 1986 the open stock company Empresa Electrica
Pehuenche S.A. was created, with domicile In the city of Talca, 260 km
south of Santiago, with an indefinite period of duration and with an
initial subscribed capital of CH$100 million, divided into 100 million
registered shares without face value. The shareholders weres (a) CORFO, 70
million shares; (b) ENDESA, 20 million shares; and (c) CHILECTRA-
GENERACION S.A., 10 million shares. At the beginning of October of 1986,
an increase in the company's capital to CH$836,970,000 wao approved.
Ortaniaation
2.       The company's Board of Directors consists of seven members elected
by the Ordinary Meeting of Shareholders and need not necessarily be
shareholders. The directors' term of office is three years and they may be
reelected indefinitely. The Board of PEHU%NCHE S.A. is made up of
Individuals with experience in running public enterprises.
3.       The organisation structure of PEHUENCHE S.A. consists of the
Genral Manager who reports to the Board and has four advisory units:
General, Counsel, Secretary General, Internal Audit and Public Relations.
The Department of Finance and Administration and the Technical Department
are under the Office of the General Manager (Annex 3.2.1). The executive
personnel are exporienced professionals who have served in management
positions in electricity subsector entities. The General Manager is
reponiblo for the management, planning coordination and control of the
administration of the company.
Financial administration
4.       The Department of Pinance and Administration has two divisions.
The Admiistrative unit is responsible for directing accounting activitles,
compliance with tax and reserve requirements, the management of general
services and relations with the Superintendency of Securities and
Insurance. The Finance unit is responsible for the administration of own
funds and crodits from banks and suppliers. For these purposes it has a
3I Sourco IDB's project report (No. PR-1526-A of November 11, 1986) for
the Pehaencae Hydroelectric and Associated Tranmisssion Project.

Account1int ssvtem
5.       Since the company has only recently started its activities, the
accounting system ln use is a simple one (manual), which is sufficient to
cover the basic information and control needs. The present system will be
replaced by a eomputerized one that comprises general accounting, budget
control, romunerations and suppliers. This system will be fully
operational in 1987.
Zndependent audit
6.       PEHUECHE S.A. is required by law to publish Its blance sheets
audited by a firm of independent auditors included In the Register of
Auditors kept by the Superintendency of Socurities and Insurance. Peat
Marwick Mitehell & Co. has been contracted to perform the Independent audit
for 1986. During the project execution period, PSHUSCHEI S.A. will engage
the services of independent auditors acceptable to the Bank who will
certify their financial statements.

ENDESA's Institutional Aspects
Backaround and Ownershio
1.       MNDESA was created by Ministry of Finance Decree No. 97 of January
3, 1944 which authorized its existenace and approved its by-laws. The main
purpose of its creation was to prepare a National Power Plan and to
Implement it in the areas where other companies would not fulfill the
Plan's objectives in the areas of generation, transmission and distribution
of eloctricity. ENDESA was Incorporated by Minestry of Finance Decree. No.
1226 of February 23, 1945. The Government holding company, CORFO, owns
over 982 of ENDESA's outstanding share capital, the remaining 22 being
privately owned. ENDESA and its subsidiaries, with net fixed assets of
approximately US$1.7 billion, is presently one of Chile's two biggest
corporations, together with CODELCO (the copper mining corporation).
ENDESA's Role in the Power Sector
2.      MNDESA lo, by far, the largest electric utility in the countrys in
1985 it had an installed generating capacity of 2,466 MW which represented
80 of the country's total non-captive generating capacity. The high level
of access to service achieved in Chile (86Z) has been, by and large, due to
the work done by ENDESA. It operates the Central Interconnected System
(SIC) and, by delegation, manages the Central Dispatch Center (CDEC) (para.
2.12 of main report). ENDESA is the largest electric utility in Chile and
the principal bulk supplier of power to the Central Zone of the country
where most of the population lives (932).  It owns three distribution
companies in the isolated systems of the southern and northern regions.
Under the present Government's policy of privatization and deconcentration
and decentralization, ENDESA's growth, and its share in the sector, will be
substantially reduced as it implements its divestiture program by selling
regional companies and new generation companies are created for any major
hydroelectric project (greater than 300 MW).
*Relationshpd with the Government
3.       The Government is not directly involved in the daily management of
ENDESA and this high degree of autonomy has been maintained throughout its
existence. ENDESA's operations are subject to the country's Law of
Corporations (Ley de Sociedades Anonimas) as well as to specific
legislation such as -the General Law of Electricity Services, and comercial
and labor codes governing Chile's corporations. ENDESA requires the
approval by the Ministry of Finance to undertak any major financing. In
the past, the Government has given financial support to ENDESA through



- 53 -
Pago 2 of 3
equity and other contributions and loans. The policy of the prsent
Governrent ts to encourage the company's financial autonomy and *ince the
early 1980. its financial situation has constantly Improved and It Is
expected to continue so in the future (Annex 3.7).
OrFAnization
4.       ENDUSA's organizational structure (Annex 3.3.1) has as its top
hierarchical unit a Board of Directors composed of seven members elected at
the General Shareholders Meeting. They are responsible for formulating the
goneral policies of tho company regarding organization, operations,
financing and project development. The Board nominates the General Manager
of the company who, in turn, proposes to the Board the names of candidates
for managers in the areas of Finance and Administration, Personnel,
Operations, and Projects, and Legal Counsel. Besides these units,
Planngin, Auditing and Public Relations also report directly to the General
Manager.
5.       UNDESA is a woll run company, its managers are capable
professionals with great experience, and its performance, which has been
good in the past, should be expected to continue so In the future, during
iMplementation of the Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Project.  Its mangemsnt
policies, which were modified in the past, are again being adapted to the
new realities that UDESA faces as a result of the Government's policy of
reducing its hegemony in the sector (para. 2). Until 1975, KUDESA had Its
own construction force which at that time constituted about 602 of total
staff. Since then, such policy ha. been reversed and now all its
construction works are carried out by independent contractors. ENUDA has
developed an excellent engineering capability, which (in view of the
present reduction of its Investment progrsm resulting from the above
Government policy) is excessive for its own needs but is being adequately
utilized as it provides consultant services to other Chilean utilities
(like PIHUENCCE S.A.) and foreign utilities.
Stsff ma and Trainins
6.       As a result of the above changes in policy, E SA ha  reduced its
number of personnel from 8,504 employees in December 1973 to 3,810 In
December 1986, equivalent to the number It had in 1955. Such reduction has
been positive as it has resulted in a leaner and more agile intitution.
Becaue of the genral conditions established by the Governmet (pars. 2),
durig the next tan yers MDESA plan to have a slow growth In the nmber
of personnel as it expects to reach only 4,070 in 1995. ZNDMSA has a
comprhensive and well oriented training program, adequate for its present
needs. Annex 3.4.5 details the training program to be included a part of
the Alto Jahual-Polpaico Project to be partially financed with the loan to
MEDISA. The following tsble gives a sumuary of the training ctivities at
ZNDES  (without subsidiary companies) during the last four years

7.        NDS& Issues monthly financial statemonts within thirty days and
annually audited financial statements within four months   It has a system
of accounts baod on those required by Chilean law for corporations. Most
of ENDESA's accounting systms are computerized and its internal control
system Is efficient as no major observations on the part of the external
auditors have been presented. The Internal suditing unit carries the
normal functions of monitoring the financial and accounting transactions of
the company, with particular emphasis on its internal control system, and
also carries managerial audits In teecnical areas such as operations and
construction.  Both units, accounting and auditing, maintain a close
working relationship with the oxternal auditor, the firm of Coopers and
Lybrand, one of the major independent auditing firms. As a Borrower,
ENDESA will engago the services of Independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and their report would be submitted to the Bank within five months
after the closing of each year.
Budt&ina and Plannina
8.       As a Government owned entity ENDESA follows the general principles
of fiscal budgeting established by the Chilean Government which is
basically a cash budget, but it also has a corporate budget which follows
the accounting principles of the company. Both budgets are included under
a control system which Is used as a monitoring mechanism for management
decision. ENDESA has developed adequate financial planning systems, for
the sbort and long-term, which are computerized and allow the preparation
of financial projections, coherent with the physical expansion planning
system of the company.

CORFO's Finances
Income Statement (Annex 3.5.1)
1.       CORPO's finances are very sensitive to the policets of the Chilean
Government. As such, In the past, its results have boen quite erratic as
It passed from years of positive results (1980, 1981, 1982 and 1984) to
years of significant losses (1983, 1985 and 1986) caused basically by
Government decisions such as the conclus ion of the preferential exchange
rate (1985) and the divestiture program (1986).
2.       The losses of the company are expected to continue until 1988,
bai"cally because of the divestiture program which is plann*d to end in
1989. After this period, the company ti expectod to have a positive trend
of Increasing profits.  Incoe from shareholdings is the itm which has the
greatet weight in the results of CORPO. Its licome from financial
optrations has a steady pattern whose weight as a component of CORFO's
income is expected to decrease (from 372 in 1980 to 142 in 1995).
S.       From January 1 to October 31, 1986, CORFO had sold shares of its
oompanIe with a book value of about Ch$ 73.3 trillion at a price of Ch$
30.7 trillion (i.e. a 422 ratio). In the financial projections of CORPO,
It has been assumed that tho sale of shares would be made at 50% of book
value, a conservative figure if one considers that in the 1986 sales, the
wi"ght of the steel company shares was significants book value of Ch$ 49.7
trillion sold at Ch$13.8 trillion (i.e. a 282 ratio) and no other case like
this s expected In the future.
4.       On the exponse side, an item which has been erratic in the past
and which may continue in the future is the allowanco for bad dobts. On
June 30, 1986 tho portion in arrears of CORFO's portfolio was 41S.
Important steps are boing taken to reduce it to 301 (target agroed upon
with IDB). Two other expense itemo which could affect the results of CORFO
are the adjustments of previous years results and the monetary correction,
which have been assumed as neutral in the projections.
Flow of unds (Annex 3.5.2)
5.       Sinc CORFO Is basically a holding companyt many of the lncome and
ewpeose transactions that affect its results are paper entries Which do
not have a parallel impact on the flow of funds of the company. Thus
enterprises profits or losses shown in the pest do not reprsent not
dividend receipts but accounting entries showlng the lncrease or decrease
in the not worth of those enterprises. Similarly, the divestiture program



- 63 -
XJN 3.5S
Page 2 of 2
which rosults in not 100ses, gonerates a significant inflow of funds for
the company. In 1986t during implementation of this program, a
significant Increase In cash asets occurred, from US$34 million at the
beginning to US$196 million at the end of the year.
6.       Financial projections of CORFO show that, under present policies,
the company Is expected to have an excellent flow of funds which would
allow it to meet all its obligations, make substantial stock repayments to
the Governrent and even aaccumulate significant cash surplusos. However,
should the Government pollees change, the results could be quite
different. It is reasonable to ssume that CORF0, as a Goverrment
Intermediary agency for development will pas to the Treasury any cash
surpluses it might have, and that It would receive from the Treasury any
cah deficits It might haves, resulting from the implmontation of
GoverAment policies. CORFO's dtependency on Government poliies is so
significant that only the Government can ensure the compliance of CORPO
with its commitsents including those with P      CHUEB S.A. (see Annex 3.6).
Balance Sheet (Aniox 3.5.3)
7.       The stock investments of CORPO constituto, by far, the largest
ssets the company has. From 1980 to 1985 they were between 75S and 802 of
total assets. With the divestiture program, their weight is expected to
diminish but to be always greator than 601. In absoluto terms, they would
also decreose (in constant 1985 prices) from US$2.6 billion in i985 to
US$1.7 billion 1995. Nowever, this item, as most of the other items in
CORFO's financial statements, is susceptible to Government policies. Thus
it is possible that It might increase If the Governmnt decides to transfer
to dOIFO other companies such as railways, metropolitan transport, and
petroleum.
8.       The indebtedness of CORFO has beon relatively low (debt/equity
ratio of 6194 in 1980 and 15/85 in 1986) and, In spite of the losses
resulting from te divestiture program, it is epocted to decresse until it
reaches zero In 1995. Once again, as in other Items, Govorment policies
will affect CORFO's Indebtedness as the Government may use CORFO to obtain
new borrowings. Such degree of indebtedness would, of course, be
negatively affected If CORPO's stockholdings are valued at the stock
exchango price. However, as of December 31, 1986 the debt/equity ratio,
under these conditions, wa still lows 20/80.

PEHUENCHE 8.A.'s Finances
1.       Until 1992, when the Pehuence Hydroelectric Project Is expected
to be commissioned, the finances of PEHUENCH S.A. will be those relatod to
the funding of the project, as It will not have any plants in operation.
The funding plan for the project is the following (in thousands of current
Us$) s
Debt       Equty        Total     _%
Local Resourcs
CORPO's Capital Contributions                129,600       129,600   16.2
ENDESA's Capital Contributions                82,800        82,000   10.4
CHILGEN's Capital Contribution                    50           50    0.0

Total FaCiMU 491.100                              307.150  7922250   100.0
2                                    61.5       38.5         100.0
2.       PEHUENCUE S.A. should not expect major difficulties In receiving
the capital contributions included in the financing for the Pehuenche
Hydroelectric Project as present Government policies should enable CORPO
and ENDESA to generate resources from its operations in *mounts more than
sufficient to materialize said contributions (Annexes 3.5 and 3.7).
However, asice such generation of resources is contingent upon the
continuous enforcing of present government policies, the Government as
Guarantor has committed itself to provide any possible shortfall In said
resources.
3.       A portion of the local funding (US$103.0 million) included In the
financing plan of the project is expected to originato from a bond issue in
the local capital market. These resources would come basically from the
Administrators of Pension Funds (AFP) which, under legislation recently
enacted, have a great degree of liquidity and restricted inestment
possibilities. The Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project is one of them and it



- 68 -
AM=t 3. 6
Page 2 of 2
should be attractive for the AlPs, but as the system Is new, there still
exists uncertainty on how they will respond. The probability of this bond
issue to materialise Is high (Annex 3.6.5); however, If it does not,
PERUUCHM S.A. should seek other sources of financing under conditions
similar to those of tho bond Issue and, if this is not possible elther,
CORPO and the Government should provide the shortfall in such funds under
conditions and from sources acceptable to the Bank.
4.       No difficulties are  xpected In obtaining the suppliers' credits
included in the finanial plan as initial soundings show that several
mnufacturers would be interested in participating In such scheme which Is
comeoa practico in the case of Chilean electric utilitis.
5.      As the Pbhuseche Plant is expocted to start operations during the
last quarter of 1992, the company would show not operating results only
since then (Annex 3.6.1). From 1993 to 1995 its rate of return would be
between 81 and 112 assuming that present tariff policies, based on marginal
costs, will continue to be utilized in the sector. Return on equity wuld
be botween 71 and 121, witbout taking into consideration the profits
resulting from monetary correction (Annex 3.6.4).
6.       Because of the lack of funds gonerated from operations, the
company  s eoxpected to have a debt service coverago ratio greator than 1.0
only after 1992, even though amortisation payments for most borrowings are
expected to become due during that period. Since no new investments are
expected, some cash surpluses would accumulate then showing the soundness
of the financial plan (Annex 3.6.2).
7.      The proposed funding plan has an adequate provision for working
capital and would result In a debt/equity ratio which increases stoadily
during the construction period until it reaches a maximum of 56144 in 1991.
When operation starts, in 1992, such trend would be reversed as the share
of debt becomes smaller every year.

PEHUENCHE S.A.'s Local Bond Issue 4
Characterdstics
1.      PSHUENCHE S.A. estimates that it can place on the financul market
adjustable bearer bonds for a total of US$103 million. The issuance of
such bonds would consist of an tnitial pla¢oment of three equal soeris of
securities, in the amount of US$8 million In 1987, with 9-, 11- and 13-year
termn a second placement of three series in 1988, for US$12 million, with
8-, 10- and 12-year terml a third placement in 1989, in the amount of
US$20 million, of three equal series with 8-, 10- and 12-year terms; two
placments in 1990 and 1991 of US$26 million, each in three series with 8-,
10- and 12-yer terms; and a final issue in three series for 8-, 10- and
12-year term, In the amount of US$11 million in 1992. The bond isue
would be ths bullet type, i.e. they are paid off in one single natallamnt
at the end of the term for each series and would earn 61 annual interest
payable every six months. The brokerage expenditures and othor markettig
outlays would account for 1% of the amounts invested. The securities would
be issued in Chilean pesos and would be readjusted In accordance with
fluctuation in tho devolopment unit for purposes of determining the
aounts accruable by way of interost and redemption. The bonds would
contain a conversion condition to be determined before each lssuance. That
condition would enable the bearer of the bonds to convert them Into
PEHUENCHE S.A. shares.
2.      PEHUENCHE S.A. would contract a financial consulting firm to
evaluate, among other, the following aspectst (i) determination of the
characteristics pertaining to the bond and conversion conditionss (it)
steps to follow, in accordanco with legislation in effect, as regards
approval by the Board of Diroctors, Special Shareholders Meeting and
registry of issuance in the Superintendency of Securities and Insurance;
(iii) preparation of the prospectus; and (iv) contracting of guarantees and
registered deed of the issuance.
Backaround 
3.       In July 1986, the State Railway put up for sale an adjustablo
bonds iscue for one million development units, with a total eight-yoar tern
and a 1.52 anual interest rate. These socurities were sold at par value
with an annual savrage yield of 5.51. They are guaranteod by the State and
wote therefore classified as boing eligible by the Classification
4/ Except for some dinor changes, this annex excerpts tho most vrlevant
portions of Chapter VI, Justification, of IDB's project report (No. PR-

Ivestment Cosission of the Pension Fund Administrators (APP). Also, In
the course of 1984, CBLMSO issued adjustable bonds for a total of
620,000 developmet units, equivalent to approximately US$10 million. Of
this total, the AFPs now have invested a little lses than 502. The Issue
was is three sories, with nine-year torms and an annual Interest rate of
6.82 calculatod on the capital readjusted for fluctuation in the
development unit. The bonds are scheduled to be paid in four biannual
installments, In the eighth and ninth month.
4.       The success of the issues referred to in the foregoing paragraph
depends essentially on the existence of a potentiAl market that Is prepared
to invet in long-term securities that ensure an appropriate return on
capital ivested and that enjoy sufficient guarantees to be considered low-
risk. Life insuruace companies and Pension Fund Administrators (AFPP) are
on this market. The life insurance companios receive 3.5 of paysents from
AlP contributors. However, the largest market is in the APP pension funds,
which receivo 102 of the payments from the APP contrLbutors. It should be
noted that each APP can invest, in bonds, up to 302 of the Investment Fund
end, In share,8 up to 52 of the total shares of the corporation it which
tbh invetment is made. The following table shows the percentage trend of

upon, 2) the characteristics of the instrumont, 3) the solvency of the
Issuer ad 4) liquidity of the market. In accordance with those

ENDESA's Finances
Incom  Statement (Annex 3.7.1)
1.       ENDESA's rate of return has been steadily Improving between 1981
(3.62) and 1985 (8.2%) basically because of the enforcing of the tariff
principles establisbed under the General Law of Electricity Services (see
Annex 2.5). ENDESA's rate of return, however, Was expected to drop In 1986
(to 5.62) basically because under the new sector structure, ENDE5A bas
become a major buyer of electricity (mainly from COLBUN 8.A. which
Initiated operations in 1986). Until 1985 no more than 32 of operating
revenues were used to pay electricity purchased while In 1986 ths was
expectod to reach almost 252. In the fiAnanial projections, the lncrease
is expected to continue until it reaches a max1mum of 412 in 1994. Mainly
because of this factor, ENDESA's operating margin which reached a maxium
of 431 in 1984 ts expected to decrease constantly until it reaches 28% in
1994. However, if the marqinsl cost principles for the setting of
electricity tariffs continue to be enforced, MNDESA's rate of return is
expected to grow until 1995 when it would reach 11.32.
Flow of Fupds (Annex 3.7.2)
2.       In 1981 and 1982, ENDESA's internal funding (after payment of
income tax and dividend*) was not sufficient to cover its debt setvice.
However, since 1983 such internal funding has been grester than tho debt
service paymnts and resulted in a positive self-financing ratio. This
condition is expected to continue in the future when ENDESA's physical
investment in new projects will be m4nimal. As a result, the company is
expected to accumulate substantial fund surpluses which would ensure a
great degree of liquidity. It can be expected thAt the Governmont, through
CORPO, will withdraw such surpluses as stock repayments, to be used for
other Government or CORFO projects, Including those in tho electtlcity
sector like Pehuenche. During the 1987-1995 period the internal funding of
ENDESA is expected to be sufficient to pay income tases, dividends and debt
service and make a substantial contribution (432) to the investmoet
program.
Balance Sheet (Annex 3.7.3)
3.       As a result of the above conditions, the debt/equity ratio of
ENDESA which ws8 25175 in 1980 deteriorated until it reached 71129 In 1985,
basically because of the heavy reliance on borrowings to finance its
tnvestment program. In 1986, bowever, as a result of the spin off of
COLBUN S.A., a trasrfer of liabilities and a conversion of debt into equity
by CORPO (about US$500 million) reversed that trend which ts expected to be
positive until It reaches 29/71 in 1995.
