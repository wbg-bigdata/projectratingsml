1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       In the early 2000s, the Government of Turkey launched an ambitious economic reform
program to create the basis for stable economic growth and set the stage for the country’s entry
into the EU. In the rural sector, this included a reform program that would, inter alia, increase
Turkey’s agricultural competitiveness, protect its natural resources, build capacity towards
meeting EU standards and ensure improved livelihoods for the poor. In addition to introducing
structural reforms to improve the agricultural support system, the Government emphasized the
need for promoting sustainable natural resource management in rural areas and integrating
environmental concerns in rural land management. The country’s environmental strategy,
articulated through the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) specifically called for
improving agricultural practices and reducing soil and water pollution from agricultural sources
which were leading to widespread natural resource degradation and significantly affecting the
quality of forestry land, carrying capacity of rangeland and fertility of agricultural land.

2.       Under the Bank-supported, “Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project?
(EAWRP)1, the Government had successfully introduced a more holistic and participatory
approach to natural resource management on a watershed basis to “restore sustainable range,
forest and farming activities in three provinces2 in the upper Euphrates watershed, reducing soil
degradation, erosion and sedimentation in reservoirs as well as increasingly productiveness and
incomes in this impoverished region of Turkey?. The project was the first of its kind in Turkey
whereby it piloted a multi-sectoral, community-driven approach to natural resource rehabilitation
at the micro-catchment level, pioneered collaborative work between rural development agencies
and demonstrated linkages between sustainable natural resource management and improved rural
livelihoods.

3.       While the EAWRP yielded overall positive outcomes in sustainable natural resource
management in target micro-catchments, the Government of Turkey indicated its interest for a
follow on operation to test further innovative approaches in rural land management and natural
resource rehabilitation. It was particularly keen to mainstream environmental considerations in
agriculture and pilot agricultural pollution control measures, including the reduction of nutrient
loads to soil and water bodies from agricultural sources within a watershed management
framework. These efforts would not only assist with addressing natural resource degradation
issues in the country, but also initiate critical work towards compliance with the EU
environmental acquis and relevant directives, such as the Nitrates Directive which is an integral
part of the Water Framework Directive. In this context, Turkey, as a signatory to the Convention
on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution, also had an international obligation to
reduce nutrient pollution to the Black Sea. Excessive use of chemical inputs in agriculture
(pesticides and inorganic fertilizers) was identified as the main source of nutrient pollution in
Turkey’s rivers draining into the Black Sea and thereby significant contributors to the growing
problem of eutrophication in the Sea (Black Sea Region Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis –
1996).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.      The project’s overall development objective was to support sustainable natural resource
management practices in 28 micro-catchments in Anatolia and Turkey’s Black Sea Region and
thereby raise incomes of communities affected by resource degradation.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The key global environment objective was to introduce farming practices which would
reduce the discharge of agricultural nutrients into surface and ground water in watersheds
draining into the Black Sea in four provinces.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

9.       The main beneficiaries identified in the PAD included the following:
        Farmers and rural households living in degraded micro-watersheds
        Communities living downstream of degraded areas
        Non-farming households in watersheds emptying into the Black Sea riparian countries
        Commercial beef-fattening and dairy producers in peri-urban areas of the Black Sea
         region
        Agro-processors and commercial farmers
        Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) and Ministry of Environment and
         Forestry (MEF)

10.     The primary target group was the rural population of about two million residing in the 28
selected MCs. With the exception of MCs in the lower watersheds in the four Black Sea
Provinces, MCs included in the project were primarily located in rural mountainous areas. Many
of the 400 or so villages in the project area were classified as “forest villages?3 with limited
access to good agricultural and range land. Most households in the region relied on crop and
livestock production as their main source of income, with forest villagers supplementing their
income with forestry-based work at the project’s inception. Household incomes in the project area
were significantly below the average rural household income in Turkey and many households
remained largely in the subsistence economy.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

11.      The project consisted of the following components, none of which were revised during
project implementation:

12.      Component 1: Rehabilitation of Degraded Natural Resources (US$23.5 million).
This component provided support for the planning and implementation of a menu of activities to
be implemented by village communities under the direction of the MEF and MARA, in
partnership with communities. The component’s primary objective was to protect degraded areas
from further degradation, erosion and pollution. Rehabilitation interventions were focused around
four sub-components as outlined below and implemented in 28 micro-catchments in six provinces
(Tokat, Sivas, Kayseri, Corum, Samsun and Amasya provinces). The activities included a
specific program for piloting actions on reducing nutrient discharge to the water bodies that were
implemented in the lower parts of watersheds of four participating Black Sea provinces using
GEF funds (Samsun, Tokat, Corum and Amasya). The main sub-components were as follows:

(i) Rehabilitation of forest land including soil conservation by afforestation, protection and
improvement of poor & degraded soils, gallery plantation, rehabilitation of oak coppices and of
degraded high forests, participatory replanting and inventory of non-wood forest products.
(ii) Rangeland Rehabilitation, including improved management of forest rangelands and
rehabilitation activities on rangeland outside the forest land.

(iii) Rehabilitation of Agricultural Land, including: fallow reduction, appropriate use of marginal
agricultural land, wild tree grafting, river bank protection, and construction and production on
agricultural terraces.
(iv) Environmentally friendly agricultural practices, including demonstrations of improved crop
production practices, organic farming and Integrated Pest Management and nutrient reduction
activities implemented.

13.     With regard to the environment-friendly practices, implementation of selected activities
to reduce nutrient discharge into water bodies in the lower watersheds of participating Black Sea
provinces were financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, by Government and by
beneficiaries.

14.      Component 2: Income Raising Activities (US$17.57 million). Under this component
target communities were offered a menu of activities designed to raise household incomes in
return for participation in conservation activities supported under Component 1. Income
generating activities were designed to provide participating communities with the incentives to
undertake conservation efforts even if they incurred short- or medium-term costs (e.g. short-term
closure of range lands, closure of forest land) or if benefits could only be reaped in the long run
(afforestation). The menu offered varied in accordance with agro-ecological and socio-economic
conditions in each village, as well as with farmers’ resources and needs. The main income
generating activities included small-scale irrigation including creation of small irrigated
perimeters and farm ponds; investments in livestock improvement, greenhouses and small-scale
freshwater fisheries implemented; and farm and crop enterprise diversification (including rain-fed
and irrigated horticulture, irrigated forage crops, vegetable production, planting trees on field
boundaries, agricultural processing and beekeeping).

15.       Component 3: Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Capacity towards meeting EU
Standards (US$0.28 million). This component provided support for implementing the following
three sub-components:
(i) Support for the Application of the EU Nitrates Directive through the monitoring of nitrate
levels at selected sites in the four Black Sea provinces, as first step in implementing the nitrates
directive.
(ii) Development and Promotion of a Code of Good Agricultural Practices based on on-farm
trials, demonstrations and training. The preparation and application of this code is a mandatory
part of the nitrates directive program.
(iii) Institutional Support for Organic Farming: The project provided technical assistance to
strengthen the institutional capacity in support of producing and marketing organically produced
farm products.

16.      Component 4: Awareness Raising, Capacity Building and Replication Strategy
(US$1.06 million): This component included the following sub-components:
(i) Public Awareness in Micro-catchment Development: This was designed to raise awareness
amongst target beneficiaries and other stakeholders about the program approach and terms of
participation in Micro-catchment development. The goal was to increase transparency in program
implementation and empower beneficiaries to demand program services.
(ii) Public Awareness, Capacity Building and Replication Strategy: With regard to the four Black
Sea provinces, the component provided capacity building and public awareness activities at the
local, national and regional level, for the training of beneficiaries and participating institutions as
well as for the future replication of similar activities in Turkey and other Black Sea riparian
countries.


                                                   4
17.      Component 5: Project Management and Support Services (US$2.5 million): This
component had the following sub-components:
(i) Project Administration: This sub-component supported the technical assistance, financial
services, logistical and operational requirements necessary to ensure the appropriate and efficient
administration o f project activities and resources by central and provincial project management
units.
(ii) Support Services: This sub-component funded extension, technical assistance and some study
tours for project managers, technical project staff and farmers.
(iii) Monitoring & Evaluation System: The project provided for the upgrading of the existing
Monitoring and Evaluation system.
(iv) Fund for applied research and technology dissemination: This sub-component would finance
short-term, small scale applied research on soil, water, crop, natural resource management,
agricultural pollution, livestock and forestry focusing on MC environment.

18.     The GEF Grant specifically financed: (a) promotion of environmentally friendly
agricultural practices under Component 1: Rehabilitation of Degraded Natural Resources; (b)
Component 3: Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Capacity toward Meeting EU Standards; (c)
Public Awareness and Replication Activities under Component 4; and (d) relevant Project
Management and Support Services.

1.8 Revised Components
19. Not applicable

1.9 Other significant changes

20.      Cancellation of Loan Proceeds. In August 2004, the Bank's Board of Executive Directors
approved a 50 basis points waiver of the front-end fee for all IBRD loans (other than Special
Structural Adjustment Loans) presented to the Board between July 1, 2004 through June 30,
2005, with retroactive effect to all loans presented to the Board on or after March 1, 2004. As a
result of this waiver, the front-end fee for the AWRP loan was reduced from US$0.20 million to
US$0.10 million. Accordingly, a amount of US$0.1 million of the loan was canceled in
November 2004.

21.     Additionally, an amount of US$4.20 million of the IBRD loan was canceled in November
2005. These funds had been allocated for the provision of small-scale irrigation services by the
General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS). However, a few months after project
implementation got underway, GDRS was abolished and its responsibilities were transferred to
the Special Provincial Administrations (SPAs). While Treasury made funds available to the
SPAs to undertake rural developmental activities in the provinces, these funds were “generic? and
could not be earmarked for specific activities. The SPAs utilized their budget funds for activities
that were accorded a higher priority by the government (such as rural roads and drinking water
supplies) with limited allocations for small-scale irrigation works. Moreover, the legal
framework prevented Treasury from on-lending funding from foreign-financed projects to SPAs
that could have then mandated the use of project funds for small-scale irrigation services that had
been agreed at project appraisal. The Bank team as well as implementing agencies sought to get
these funds re-allocated to other project activities; however, Treasury formally requested a
cancelation of this portion of the IBRD loan in November 2005.

22.     Amendment of Loan Agreement. In 2009, the Loan Agreement was amended to include
solar hot water heating system as an eligible investment under MC plans. Given the low demand

                                                 5
for greenhouses and fisheries development, especially in the upland catchments where conditions
did not support such activities, these two activities were dropped from the menu of investments
and replaced with a technical innovation in domestic energy use, namely, solar water heating
systems.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.      The project drew on the successes and lessons learned under the Eastern Anatolia
Watershed Rehabilitation Project (EAWRP) as well as agricultural pollution control projects
funded under the Black Sea-Danube Strategic Partnership Program for Nutrient Reduction in
other countries such as Romania, Poland and Moldova. Project design was grounded in
community participation whereby communities jointly identified principal resource management
issues and selected priority interventions that were most appropriate for their specific MC
conditions. A noteworthy feature of project design was that the MC plans were to be developed
on a rolling basis. Such sequencing provided an opportunity to assess performance of previous
plans, gauge “what works? and “what doesn’t?, and feed this knowledge into the next round of
MC plans. Also, a flexible approach was adopted to revise MC plans as necessary to respond to
changing circumstances and evolving needs of communities.

24.      The project design included new and innovative approaches to address natural resource
rehabilitation and management on a watershed basis. Agricultural pollution control and animal
waste management for nutrient reduction to soil and water bodies in the MCs of the Black Sea
provinces had not been tested by the Government before. Inclusion of this activity, funded by the
GEF, would not only improve soil and water resources in the project area but also help to initiate
critical work towards meeting obligations under the EU Nitrates and Water Framework Directives.

25.      AWRP carried over the institutional arrangements under EAWRP for project
implementation and built on the strong inter-agency collaboration pioneered under EAWRP. In
all, two ministries (MEF and MARA) and seven directorates were directly involved in project
implementation. These challenging implementation arrangements were justified as project
activities were cross-sectoral, covering a broad spectrum of interventions related to agriculture,
livestock, forestry, and environment. Responsibilities of each ministry/directorate were clearly
spelled out so that there was no ambiguity with “who does what? during implementation.
Additionally, for each micro-catchment, a Micro-catchment Implementation Team (MCIT) was
established with relevant staff from all seven provincial directorates to assist communities
develop MC plans. Establishing an MCIT was a useful institutional arrangement as communities
had limited knowledge and skills for collective action on natural resource rehabilitation,
environmentally friendly agricultural practices and animal waste management.

26.      The project’s Quality at Entry was satisfactory. All implementation arrangements were
in place with the Project Management Group, Operations Unit, Project Management Units,
Provincial Project Management Teams and Micro-catchment Implementation Teams established
and fully staffed as necessary. The Project Coordinator was also appointed. In addition, the
Government had developed a detailed Project Implementation Plan (PIP) that was appraised as
realistic and of satisfactory quality by the Bank team. The engineering design documents as well
as procurement documents for the first years’ activities were complete and ready for start of
project implementation. Reporting formats for M&E were agreed upon and finalized. The
MCITs had begun working with potential beneficiaries to develop MC plans. In fact, five MC


                                                 6
plans were developed during project preparation so that when the project became effective,
implementation of the plans could be launched immediately.

2.2 Implementation

27.     Overall, project implementation was smooth. This was primarily due to: (i) continuous
support and commitment from national and local counterparts for project activities; (ii) emphasis
on a participatory process for implementation of all key activities; (iii) built-in flexibility to
respond to changing needs; (iv) compliance with Bank’s safeguard and fiduciary requirements;
(v) timely availability of GEF, Government and local funds; and (vi) full cooperation among all
implementing agencies. By project closing, 100% of the GEF grant funds and 98% of the IBRD
loan proceeds were disbursed.

28.      The five MC plans prepared during project preparation were launched as soon as the loan
and grant became effective. All through project implementation, the MC plans were phased in in
a timely manner and implemented on schedule. The MCITs worked effectively with the
communities to tailor MC plans to the priorities and available resources of the communities.
Regular meetings were held among all key institutional stakeholders to address project issues
jointly and in a timely manner.

29.      The project was responsive to changing needs and circumstances which ensured smooth
implementation. Given the low demand for greenhouses and fisheries development, especially in
the upland catchments where conditions for such activities were relatively poor, the menu of
investments for MC plans in these areas was revised. This was a positive aspect of project
design: it allowed for rapid adjustments to respond to specific conditions. These two activities
were dropped from the menu and resources freed up to finance those that the communities
expressed a greater demand for, namely, solar water heating systems. Also, an increase in the
price of cattle and sheep over the second half of the life of the project was straining the MC plan
funding envelope and the provision of solar water heating system was a viable option to include
in the menu of investments for the remaining MC plans. The solar water heating system was
especially welcomed given the significant benefits accruing from its adoption: economic (low
cost), social (labor and time saving, especially for women with regard to fuel wood collection and
heating water for cooking and cleaning) and environmental (forest wood protection, clean
renewable energy source). The Loan Agreement was accordingly amended to include solar hot
water heating system as a menu of investment under MC plans.

30.     When it became evident that the allocation for the implementation of the sub-component
Fund for applied research and technology dissemination whereby the project would finance
demonstrations and trials of conservation tillage activities in the project areas was not sufficient
to contract CIMMYT and/or ICARDA as was originally planned, MARA stepped in to undertake
these specific activities and the funds for these activities were re-allocated to purchase equipment
to support the promotion of good agricultural practices. Such sound and timely adjustments
contributed to efficient project implementation.

31.     No project restructuring was necessary although about one-fifth of the loan was canceled.
Cancelation of the small-scale irrigation sub-activity did not affect the PDO and/or the key
outcome indicators, or threaten the accrual of potential benefits to the target MC communities.
Given that GDRS was abolished within the first year of project implementation, only the first
round of MC plans were impacted. Some communities had selected investments that might have
benefited from the provision of small-scale irrigation services. However, the project’s built-in


                                                 7
flexibility allowed these communities to modify their MC plans and adjust their stream of
benefits in keeping with the project’s objective.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     During preparation, it was agreed that at the time of development of each MC plan,
baseline information for that MC would be gathered, and targets would be established to measure
successful implementation/achievements of the MC plan. However, while extensive data and
background information was collected during the preparation of the MC plans, there were delays
with compiling, aggregating and analyzing it in a way that would establish a sound baseline for
the MC plan and subsequently allow evaluation of outcomes of selected investments. There were
also some delays in collecting baseline data with regard to soil and water quality monitoring.

33.      The Bank team sensitized the implementing agencies to the importance and urgency of
establishing a quality baseline during its supervision missions and followed up closely with the
Government. The team correctly rated M&E as moderately satisfactory or moderately
unsatisfactory to reflect these inadequacies in the M&E system. The PMU subsequently hired a
consultant to develop a computer program for consolidating all project monitoring information
and aggregating the data in a meaningful way which would allow for measurable, systematic
reporting on project achievements. In 2008, critical points to measure water and soil quality in
the Black Sea provinces were also established. Such delays have compromised the actual
measurement of achievements in some instances.

34.      Activity and process monitoring was detailed and thorough throughout the life. The
implementing agencies diligently tracked outputs achieved under each project component. It was
agreed that an assessment of project outcomes would be undertaken over the last three months of
project implementation and the findings shared with the Bank team by September 15, 2012.
Although the Bank team is still awaiting these findings from the Government, there is sufficient
data and anecdotal evidence available to make an informed assessment of overall project
outcomes (See Section 3.2).

35.      It is also important to note that the flexibility provided to communities to revise their MC
plans to respond to changing/unforeseen circumstances meant that baselines and targets were
fluid. The aim was not to have the project be a target-driven operation but one that responded to
communities’ priority needs in the areas of natural resource rehabilitation and income generation.
Overall, MC plans performed well due in part to the rolling basis of MC plan development. The
lessons learned from preceding plans were fed into the preparation and implementation of
subsequent plans which improved the quality of the MC plans and increased the likelihood of
their success.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     The safeguards triggered under the project included: Environmental Assessment (O.P.
4.01), Forestry (O.P. 4.36), Pest Management (O.P. 4.09) and Safety of Dams (O.P. 4.37).

37.      No major safeguard issues arose during project implementation. The project was
classified as an Environmental Category B (Partial Assessment) project because although it
generally supported environmentally sustainable development, some activities, such as manure
platform construction, could have some direct environmental impacts, albeit of insignificant scale
and easily mitigated. The norms for mitigating and monitoring such impacts were defined in the
project appraisal document (PAD) which referred to an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

                                                  8
that was based on a Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) disclosed in 2003. The dam
safety and pest management safeguards were not monitored because no applicable activities were
undertaken during implementation. Since the small-scale irrigation works were eventually
dropped, the dam safety safeguard was no longer applicable. Also no dam higher than 15 meters
was constructed under the project which would have triggered the safeguard. Similarly, the pest
management safeguard was not applied as participatory processes leading to MC plans did not
identify any activities that would use the controlled chemicals identified in the EMP. The
Environmental Assessment and Forestry safeguards remained relevant because of the
afforestation, rangeland improvement, and manure management initiatives. Compliance with
provisions of both safeguards was satisfactory throughout project implementation.

38.      Financial Management. Regular Bank team financial management reviews confirmed a
satisfactory financial management system during the life of the Project. Satisfactory internal
controls and procedures ensured reliable accounting records and safeguarded project resources
and assets. Financial Management Reports (FMRs) for each quarter were submitted to the Bank
on a timely basis in agreed content and format. Audit reports contained unqualified opinions and
no significant accountability of internal control issues were identified. As some transactions were
executed in 2012, the final project audit report is due on June 30, 2013. Counterpart financing
was satisfactory during the life of the project.

39.     Procurement. At appraisal, procurement risk was rated high. With increased
decentralization of responsibilities for procurement management, lack of strong technical
backstopping and quality control in the PMU to provide assistance to decentralized units, and
frequent staff changes, overall procurement capacity remained relatively weak. This required the
provision of continuous training (and re-training) in Bank’s procurement rules and guidelines.
The procurement staff in the Country Office provided much needed training and support
throughout the life of the project and was instrumental in preventing any major procurement
delays during implementation.

40.      Disbursement. In the early stages of project implementation, the requirement that project
disbursements required approval by the Central Accountancy Unit caused delays in contractual
payments. Part of the reason was that provincial staff was not wholly familiar with procedures
required, so errors were made that needed to be rectified, resulting in lengthy and extensive
correspondence. The PMU consequently held procurement and financial management training
for project staff while at the same time developed streamlined procedures for approving payments
and disbursements. Overall, disbursements were smooth and there were no significant lags.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     Transitional Arrangements: The development and implementation of MC plans was
designed to provide MC communities with full ownership of project investments. No transitional
arrangements were necessary under the project as assets procured by the project were used by the
local beneficiaries from the date of acquisition during the implementation period. The
communities were fully responsible for operation and maintenance of investments provided for
by the project (in fact they had to agree to do so as a condition of the project proceeding at a
particular site).

42.     Next Phase. There were some discussions during project implementation to scale up
AWRP to other watersheds of Turkey. However, given that there were several discrete and
disparate watershed management projects ongoing in the country, the Government decided to first
develop a consolidated approach and strategy for watershed management at the national level to

                                                 9
facilitate more effective targeting of investments. To this end, it is currently developing a
National Water Basin Management Strategy with Bank assistance. The exercise is expected to
include the development of a methodology for integrating the cumulative impact assessment of
water usage installations in river basins in the current legislation, effective monitoring and
evaluation tools, and more effective targeting of investments using social, environmental, and
economic criteria. The positive achievements under AWRP are contributing to informing the
strategy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.      The project’s objectives, design and implementation continue to be highly relevant to
Turkey’s current development priorities. The Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013), indicates,
inter alia, the need for protecting the environment and ensuring development in rural areas in line
with EU processes. A strategic objective of the National Rural Development Strategy (2007-
2013) is Protection and Improvement of the Rural Environment. Two priorities under this
objective include: (i) Improvement of Environment-friendly Agricultural Practices, towards
which the Government aims to undertake measures for, inter alia, developing integrated
agricultural basin programs, expanding organic agriculture and good agricultural practices,
implementing and diversifying environmentally friendly production methods, monitoring
environmental pollution arising from agricultural activities, developing agricultural land and
pastures; and (ii) Protecting Forest Ecosystems and Sustainable Utilization of Forest Resources
towards which the aim is to undertake measures for, among others, accelerating forest cadastre
works, alleviating the pressure of animal husbandry on the forests, protecting biodiversity of
ecosystems and sustainable utilization of biological resources, forestation and soil preservation
works.

44.      Currently, Turkey’s natural resources face increasing pressures from growth in energy
use, industry, transport, tourism, and agriculture which are resulting in water stress, soil erosion
and pollution. Land degradation, for example, has become increasingly severe, with more than 59
percent of Turkey’s land area suffering from severe erosion, and forest cover now at 26 percent,
down from 70 percent originally. While the AWRP initiated critical work in select areas to
promote sustainable natural resource management and reduce land degradation, much work
remains to be done. Measures to address these challenges continue to remain a priority as
reflected in the national development plans and strategies as well as in the current Country
Partnership Strategy (FY12-15) through which the country has sought Bank assistance to address
some of these challenges. The CPS has been designed to “contribute to Turkey’s goal of fast,
sustainable and inclusive growth that respects the environment? and towards this, builds on three
main strategic objectives and pillars: (i) enhanced competitiveness and employment; (ii)
improved equity and public services; and (iii) deepened sustainable development. One of the
projected outcomes of pillar (iii) is strengthened environmental management and adaptation to
climate change. In this context, the Government of Turkey is working to promote sustainable and
equitable resource management and environmental protection in an integrated manner. This
effort also includes the completion of the National Basin Management Strategy that would inform
future investments in watershed management.

45.      The project’s objective of reducing the discharge of agricultural nutrients also remains a
global environment priority. Reducing nutrient pollution in the Black Sea continues to be a
priority in the region. As a member of the Black Sea Commission, Turkey is obligated to
implement the principles of the Strategic Action Plan for the Environmental Protection and

                                                 10
Rehabilitation of the Black Sea which call for “sustainable management of the natural resources
and biodiversity of the Black Sea? and includes the polluter pays principle. The International
Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) and the Black Sea Commission
have developed guidelines for achieving good environmental status in the coastal waters of the
Black Sea, in line with EU legislation. Turkey will need to implement these guidelines. Also, as
a signatory to the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea from Pollution, the Government
has an obligation to meet its international commitments with regard to improving the
environmental status of the waters of the Black Sea.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

46.      The project development and global environmental objectives of the project were fully
achieved. All expected outputs were achieved and all key performance indicators met end-of-
project targets, with several exceeding end-of-project targets (See Data Sheet and Annex 2).

47.      Overall, project outcomes are assessed as positive. AWRP successfully tested the
efficacy of community-level, demand-driven, participatory approaches to natural resource
rehabilitation and management within the framework of watershed rehabilitation and resulted in
providing a replicable model for sustainable watershed management in Turkey.

48.      The participatory process of MC plan development and implementation fostered
cooperation among villagers and brought them together to organize themselves around common
goals. It empowered communities to make their voices heard and promoted collective decision
making for community-level issues. These processes have instilled a sense of self confidence in
the villagers and increased their sense of communal responsibility.

49.     Conservation activities under components 1 and 2 (rehabilitation of forestry land,
rangeland and agricultural land) have increased vegetative cover, improved soil fertility and
helped to combat soil erosion in the project area. Improvements in agricultural productivity are
evident with increases in crop yields, which in some cases have nearly doubled, as in the case of
sainfoin, where yields increased by 182%. It is expected that forest land rehabilitation will, over
time, produce wood and other forest products which would be critical for communities who
depend on the forests for their livelihood. Similarly, with increases in rangeland cover and
improved quality of grazing land, livestock farmers are benefiting from higher milk yields and
improved quality of dairy and livestock products which not only have economic implications but
social/health as well. By increasing vegetative cover and combating soil erosion, there is
anecdotal evidence that the project had an impact on sedimentation of small dams close to the
treatment area and of reduced village flooding during high rainfall events. Also, it can be
reasonably supposed that the increases in vegetative cover are contributing to increased carbon
sequestration in the target areas.

50.      While poverty alleviation was not an explicit objective of the project, it contributed to
raising incomes in some of the poorest regions of the country. Implementation of natural
resource rehabilitation and farm diversification measures, such as beekeeping, helped in job
creation, generating employment as well as raising household incomes of targeted beneficiaries.
If interventions related to rehabilitation and protection of forestry land, rangeland and agricultural
land as designed under the project, as well as farm-diversification activities are continued by
project beneficiaries (and adopted by those in non-project areas), there is a strong likelihood of
gradual and continual improvements in land productivity and increases in rural household
incomes in the project area (and beyond).


                                                  11
51.      The project increased knowledge and promoted critical behavioral changes among
communities with regard to natural resource protection. Public awareness programs on the causes,
effects and mitigation measures for natural resource rehabilitation were undertaken in all 28
project MCs. Additionally, several training and demonstration programs were held for
stakeholders on, inter alia, environmentally friendly agricultural practices, sustainable manure
management, organic farming and farm diversification activities. One instance of such
behavioral change is evident in MCs of the Black Sea provinces where promotion of manure
management activities has led to significant behavioral modifications with regard to manure
disposal. In several villages, farmers voluntarily formed associations to collect, store and manage
their stock of manure. Most livestock farmers in the project area no longer store manure close to
their homes or backyard wells. Storage structures are now mostly enclosed to ward off odors and
flies.

52.      The increased uptake of manure management activities has resulted in positive
environmental, financial, environmental and social outcomes. Water and soil quality monitoring
indicates that there is a reduction in nutrients in soil as well as surface and ground water in the
target areas. Among participating farmers, purchase of fertilizers has reduced as they are now
using composted manure. This translates to substantial financial savings for the farmer. Also, the
fertilizers purchased were usually chemical in nature that increased nitrate pollution and degraded
soil and water quality. The appropriate application of manure is not only helping to protect the
quality of soil and water in the project area, it has boosted organic farming which is economically
more lucrative than conventional farming. With Turkey’s proximity to the European market,
organic farming is expected to increase among farmers. Another positive outcome of sustainable
nutrient management has been the immediate impacts on local sanitation. Reduced nutrient loads
to ground waters have also resulted in health benefits by contributing to the improved quality of
drinking water.

53.      The project has had an excellent demonstration/spill-over effect. During project
implementation, communities, both within and outside the project area, participated in the
training and demonstration programs, and visited MCs where project results were visible to learn
first-hand the economic and ecological benefits of activities accruing to the beneficiaries. This
had the positive result of generating interest and support for project investments and underscores
the high potential for project replication. In fact, AWRP is already serving as a replicable model
for sustainable watershed management in Turkey and has helped mobilize funding for watershed
management involving intensive targeting of selected micro-catchments. For instance, one can
discern little difference in approach between the AWRP and IFAD-funded Murat River
Watershed Rehabilitation Project and JICA-supported Coruh Watershed Rehabilitation Project
both of which aim to promote sustainable natural resource management and improved livelihoods
within a watershed rehabilitation framework, using community-based participatory approaches.

54.      A positive outcome of the international training programs (study tours to Poland,
Germany, Romania, Moldova, etc.) for nutrient management activities was the introduction of
technical innovations in the areas of livestock waste management in Turkey. Liquid manure
injection equipment, though relatively common elsewhere, was the first of its kind in Turkey after
it was fabricated locally, based on designs identified during visits to other countries as part of the
project-supported study tours. In this context, Turkey also hosted the “Integrated Nutrient
Pollution Management Workshop?, one in a series of workshops organized by countries receiving
GEF support under the Danube-Black Sea Strategic Partnership Program. The workshop provided
an excellent forum of the exchange of ideas and experiences with agricultural pollution control,
and nutrient management practices in particular, that served to enhance the knowledge and skills
of participating project team members. It also hosted the workshop on: Integrated Participatory

                                                 12
Watershed Rehab Techniques in Degraded Lands, where participants included representatives
from a wide range of countries from around the globe. These events have served to enhance
Turkey’s visibility on the international stage as a serious partner with regard to protecting the
natural resources of the planet.

55.     An outcome not anticipated at the time of project preparation was the technical
innovation in domestic energy use, namely, solar hot water heating systems. This investment in
renewable energy not only contributed to the achievement of the project objective of natural
resource protection and conservation, but also provided a low cost energy alternative to target
project beneficiaries. Estimates suggested that households in upper catchments used as much as
20m3 of firewood per year; solar hot water heating systems reduced consumption by as much as
one-third. Since solar water heaters are low-cost, it helped increase participation rates in the
overall program and broadened the environmental impacts of switching from fuel wood to solar
water heaters. The social benefits were also considerable. By reducing time required to collect
firewood for water heating, household labor time was freed up for other activities and in this
context, women benefited considerably. Additionally, animal waste was also used as a source of
clean renewable energy in one project province. The project supported the construction of two
small-scale biogas digesters in Corum. These were used as demonstration sites for farmers and
mayors from other MCs with a view to spurring interest for replication.

56.      The project thus achieved its overall objectives and yielded positive results. It was a pilot
operation that mainstreamed environmental considerations in forestry, rangeland and agricultural
land management and demonstrated the value of integrated, synergistic work across rural sectors.
With replication of project activities (such as increases in vegetative cover and improved soil
quality), the potential for continued and additional positive outcomes, such as increased
agricultural productivity and more profitable sustainable agriculture, improved incomes, lowered
flood risks, reduced vulnerability to droughts, reduced sedimentation to local lakes close to
treatment areas and further downstream, and fewer landslides, is expected to grow. It must be
noted, however, that reducing nutrient loads to the Black Sea is a long-term undertaking and a
coordinated, multi-country effort. The project contributed to this objective by reducing nutrient
loads in local soil and water bodies at the micro-catchment level, which only when replicated on a
much larger scale will result in any significant reductions of nitrogen and phosphorous from
Turkey’s waters to the Black Sea.

3.3 Efficiency

57.      The original Turkey AWRP cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was largely driven by the costs
and benefits of the first two project components dealing with: (a) rehabilitation of degraded
natural resources; and (b) income generating activities. The first component accounted for the
major part of project costs while the second, but much smaller component contributed the bulk of
the project benefits. Comparison of AWRP with other watershed rehabilitation experiences in
Turkey suggest that an indicative and partial re-computation of the project efficiency parameters
(ERR, NPV and B/C ratios) could be based on the key project component (degraded natural
resource rehabilitation). This course of action was adopted by updating some of the base data
found in existing analyses coupled with data borrowed from other projects to reconstitute the
flood control benefits which were initially underestimated. In addition to this adjustment, the
opportunity cost of capital was lowered to 6% from 12%.

58.    The re-computed ERR - based on rather conservative assumptions - was around 14%,
with NPV of US$15.5 million and B/C ratio of 4.3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

59.     Overall project outcome is rated satisfactory as the project successfully achieved its
objectives and yielded positive outcomes. It contributed to restoring degraded lands in the project
areas where little interventions, if any, had been undertaken to protect the region’s natural
resource base, successfully initiated nutrient management activities that would ultimately
contribute to reducing nutrient loads to the Black Sea, and helped increase incomes of
participating communities in the project areas that were characterized by a high incidence of
poverty.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.      While poverty alleviation was not an explicit objective of the project, it contributed to
raising incomes in some of the poorest regions of the country. Implementation of natural
resource rehabilitation and farm diversification measures helped to generate employment as well
as raise household incomes of targeted beneficiaries. If such project interventions are continued
by project beneficiaries (and adopted by those in non-project areas), there is a strong likelihood of
gradual and continual improvements in land productivity and increases in rural household
incomes in the project area (and beyond).

61.      The PAD stated that during the process of developing MC plans, both during
identification of problems and solutions, particular efforts will be made to encourage women’s
participation so as to assure that gender issues are mainstreamed into MC planning and
implementation. Although specific monitoring of gender involvement and impacts was not
undertaken during project implementation, empirical evidence shows that that women
involvement in MC planning and implementation was low. However, the introduction of the
solar water heating system in the menu of interventions for MC plans was of much benefit to
women. It reduced time and labor for fuel wood collection as well as heating water for household
chores and freed up time for other activities.

62.      On the whole, the project was of high significance in terms of social capital building.
The project served as an inclusive tool bringing villages and communities together to organize
themselves around common goals and mange their resources more sustainably. It promoted
collective decision-making at the community level. The participatory approach fostered self-
confidence and a sense of empowerment among beneficiaries and provided them an
opportunity to make their voices heard.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.     The project provided a valuable framework to bring together staff from different
ministries and agencies to work together on natural resource rehabilitation and management
issues. While such joint work was initiated under EAWRP, AWRP reinforced and strengthened
inter-ministerial and inter-directorate cooperation for more effective service delivery to
communities, especially in some of the poorest regions of Turkey.

64.     The decentralized implementation arrangements also helped ministry staff at the
provincial level gain experience in communicating and collaborating with farmers, and this marks


                                                 14
an important shift in the relationship between government and the rural population both in the
project MCs and more widely. There is a good likelihood that the enhanced institutional
coordination and collaboration, and improved central and local institutional capacity, has
increased the possibility of continued partnerships between MEF and MARA for similar
operations.

65.     The project also built technical and managerial capacity of institutional staff through
improving and upgrading existing levels of knowledge and skills in key aspects of natural
resource management and environmentally friendly agricultural practices. By participating in in-
country formal and informal training sessions as well as international study tours and workshops,
key implementing agency staff increased their competencies and know-how in critical areas of
environment, agriculture and rural development.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Low

68.     The assessment of risk to development and global environment outcomes is rated low.
By demonstrating the efficacy and value of project activities, and building awareness and
capacity at both at the national and local levels, there is a high likelihood of ongoing support for
project outcomes beyond the life of the project. The rationale for this is summarized below:

(i)   There is continuous commitment to appropriate economic, financial and sector policies on
      the part of the Government as evidenced in its development strategies, including the
      Agricultural Strategy, National Environment Action Plan and the Country Partnership
      Strategy.
(ii) The MC planning and implementation process has educated beneficiaries to the importance
      of protecting the natural resource base and the need for collaborative work across sectors to
      harness effective and sustainable benefits. It has empowered beneficiaries to identify and
      implement their priorities at the community level and this increased capacity and awareness
      is likely to engender continued interest and commitment for project outcomes. Beneficiary
      surveys have indicated that communities are indeed eager to continue with the kinds of
      interventions supported under the project.
(iii) The low-cost technologies promoted under the project will encourage continuation and
      replication of project activities.
(iv) The enhanced institutional capacity and coordination mechanisms among ministries and
      directorates at the national and provincial level is likely to remain as the government
      recognizes the merits of a multi-sectoral approach to reducing natural resource degradation
      and the need to work across sectors for sustainable solutions. In 2011, through an
      institutional reorganization, the government has already moved to promote better linkages
      among ministries and directorates in this area.
(v) EU membership mandates compliance with the EU Nitrates Directive as well as the
      implementation of agri-environment measures (EU payments can be received by farmers
      only if they keep their land “in good agricultural condition?) so the likelihood of the

                                                 15
      government and beneficiaries continuing with the promotion and implementation of
      environmentally friendly agricultural practices, including activities for nutrient reduction
      and management, is high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

69.      Bank’s performance during preparation was satisfactory. The team built on the good
 work already performed under EAWRP and reflected the lessons learned in project design. It
 went a step further by linking agricultural pollution control activities to natural resource
 management which was innovative approach sought by the government and welcomed by local
 beneficiaries. There was good cooperation with the counterparts at the national and local level
 which resulted in smooth preparation at every stage. Regular stakeholder consultations ensured
 that there were full agreements on project design, scope and activities. Most importantly, the
 team ensured that communities in the targeted micro-catchments were actively involved in
 identifying the menu of interventions for the MC plans which was critical for project success.

70.      Five MC plans were developed during preparation to ensure that the project hit the
 ground running as soon as it became effective. All implementation arrangements were in place
 at project start.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

71.      The Bank team closely supervised project implementation. Supervision missions were
conducted on average twice a year, which allowed for fairly regular face-to-face interaction on
project issues. Supervision reporting was thorough and progress towards achievement of the key
performance indicators was regularly updated to reflect project status. Next steps and follow up
action were agreed upon in detail with counterparts. These were included in the mission Aide
Memoires and Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and closely tracked.

72.      Throughout the duration of the project, the team maintained a regular and constructive
dialogue with the PIU, central and local government agencies, as well as the MC communities.
Its pro-active approach in managing and resolving issues that arose during implementation helped
to keep project activities on schedule.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

73.      Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The team worked closely with central
and local government counterparts as well as target communities all through preparation and
supervision of the project. Its pragmatic and flexible approach contributed to a well-designed
project as well as successful project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 16
74.      Government performance was satisfactory. As a sign of its commitment from the start,
the government largely prepared the project. Relevant staff from MEF and MARA, both at the
central and local level, worked closely and cooperatively throughout the project’s duration,
ensuring continual and effective coordination to execute their specific responsibilities. The
provincial governments worked closely with the communities to ensure that their voices were
adequately represented in the MC planning and implementation process, and that the investments
selected were in the best interest of the communities and consistent with project objectives.
Government staff participated in several training programs and study tours to enhance knowledge
and capacity for natural resource rehabilitation and nutrient management. The government
actively promoted awareness of potential project benefits not only in the project MCs but also at
the national level to foster increased adoption and replication of project activities. Timely
counterpart financing throughout the project’s life contributed to satisfactory disbursement
performance. In the event of any issues/challenges that arose during implementation (such as
dissolution of GDRS), the Government consulted closely with the Bank team in seeking the most
optimal resolution that would not jeopardize project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
75.      The performance of the Project Management Group, Project Management Unit and
Operations Unit is rated satisfactory. With two ministries and seven agencies involved with
project implementation, the PMG and PMU worked effectively in coordinating their work.
Regular meetings were organized to address project issues jointly and in a timely manner. The
Operations Unit undertook its day-to-day management of project activities efficiently, ensuring
that there were no significant delays or lags with procurement and disbursement. Weaknesses in
the capacity of procurement staff were addressed through regular training provided by the Bank
Country Office staff. However, in the area of M&E, there were delays with establishment of a
sound baseline for some project interventions, such as water and soil quality monitoring. Detailed
annual progress reports were made available to the Bank in a timely manner. The Micro-
catchment Implementation Teams performed satisfactorily, working closely with the local
beneficiaries advising them on the development of the MC plans and the menu of activities
applicable to each MC’s needs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

76.     Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory as throughout the life of the project,
MEF and MARA staff, at the central and provincial level, worked together, diligently and
effectively, to ensure project success. Activities were well coordinated and any issues that may
have arisen during implementation were addressed promptly. It is worthy to note that despite the
challenges of marrying activities related to forestry, rangeland, agricultural pollution control and
rural employment within framework of watershed management, and the involvement of several
implementing agencies, the Government made every effort to ensure that project implementation
proceeded smoothly.

6. Lessons Learned

77.     The major lessons drawn from the implementation of this operation can be summarized
as follows:
78.     Participatory design is key to promoting ownership. By actively involving target
communities in the identification of problems and their solutions, and vesting them with the
responsibility for implementing the agreed investments, the project fostered ownership on the part

                                                 17
of the local beneficiaries from the very start. It demonstrated that when communities are given the
opportunity to be at the center of the decision-making process, they feel a greater sense of
responsibility to make things work and succeed. This higher level of engagement and pro-
activeness also contributed to improved knowledge and capacity which in turn promoted
sustainability and replicability of project interventions. While detailed project preparation was
largely undertaken by the agencies of the two implementing ministries they too recognized that a
top-down, command-and-control approach would jeopardize community participation and
consequently the achievement of project objectives and gave local beneficiaries a high degree of
autonomy in the selection of investments during development and implementation of MC plans.

79.      A flexible approach allows timely adaptations to changing needs and circumstances.
One reason that the project performed well was the built-in flexibility to allow for rapid
adaptations to changing needs and circumstances. Since all risks could not be foreseen at the
time of project preparation, it was considered important to build in a measure of flexibility to
allow stakeholders adapt project interventions quickly and cost-effectively. Such flexibility
prevented implementation delays, lags in disbursements, and sustained stakeholder support. This
was well borne out by the project when the beneficiaries were able to introduce a completely new
technology, namely, low-cost solar water heating system, in lieu of livestock support due to rising
cattle prices. Also, project activities related to agriculture (crop production, orchards, etc.) are
generally seasonal in nature and can be impacted by vagaries of nature. It is important that
projects provide mechanisms to enable beneficiaries reorient activities quickly and efficiently to
respond to unforeseen circumstances.

80.      Establishing a direct link between natural resource rehabilitation and tangible
economic and social benefits is critical for increased uptake of natural resource management
activities. The project demonstrated that activities related to rehabilitation of degraded natural
resources in rural areas have a higher uptake when tied to income generating activities. This is
especially true in areas of high poverty where “protecting the environment? per se is not a
priority. However, when beneficiaries benefit economically from engaging in environmental
rehabilitation and conservation activities, there is heightened interest and support for natural
resource protection.

81.     Dissemination of information through public awareness programs is crucial for the
widespread adoption of new practices and technologies. At the time of project preparation, there
was, at best, a limited understanding of the benefits of animal waste management and natural
resource rehabilitation in the target MCs. Through an aggressive public awareness program using
multiple channels of communication, the project disseminated critical information on the causes
and impacts of natural resource degradation and the associated economic, social and health
benefits of adopting mitigation technologies/practices that were promoted under the project. It
actively addressed a knowledge void that was critical in the achievement of project objectives.
By informing and educating local stakeholders, the project generated much interest in, and
support for, natural resource and nutrient management activities both within the project area and
beyond. Thus, information dissemination is key to adoption and replication of technologies
unfamiliar to target stakeholders.

*Although US$0.28 million was allocated for Component 2 under the IBRD loan, the project achieved the
agreed outputs with only the GEF allocation. A re-allocation of resources under the GEF grant increased
the allocation under this component by approximately US$0.40 million.

                              Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      Micro-Catchment (MC) Plans. All 28 MC plans were successfully developed and
implemented. Several training sessions, such as “World Bank Procurement Methods,
Micro-catchment Selection Criteria, Monitoring and Evaluation System? and “World
Bank Purchasing Methods and Principals and Micro-catchment Plan Techniques? were
provided to inform the communities in the project MCs about the process of MC planning
and monitoring. The training programs were offered in all six provinces. A public
awareness program was also successfully implemented to raise awareness among target
beneficiaries and other stakeholders about the project approach and terms of participation
in the MC development.

Component 1: Rehabilitation of Degraded Natural resources:

2.       Increased Vegetative Cover: The project aimed at increasing vegetation cover in the
project villages by 20% at the mid-term and 50% percent by year 7, over the baseline. The aim
was to increase overall productivity of about 34,000 ha of degraded forestland, range land, and
agricultural land. Through soil conservation afforestation, vegetation improvement, fallow
reduction, rehabilitation participatory planting, gallery plantation, and in-forest rangeland
rehabilitation works, about 58,000 ha of degraded lands were rehabilitated with increased
vegetative cover. Vegetative cover thus increased by about 75% which exceeded the target set at
appraisal.

3.       Improved Soil Fertility: The project aimed at increasing soil fertility on sloping lands as
measured by the organic matter (humus) content in project MCs from the baseline by 10% by the
midterm and by 20% at project closure. Increased productivity of three crops was used a proxy to
measure improvements in soil fertility. The selected crops at baseline were sainfoin with yields
of 275 kg/da, chickpea 90 with kg/da, and alfalfa with 1080 kg/da. The project set itself
objectives to reach productivity enhancements for sainfoin (by 44%), chickpeas (by 27%), and
alfalfa (by 25%). End of project results showed that an overall productivity increase of 182 %
was achieved with sainfoin, 89% with chickpeas, and 18% with alfalfa, thereby exceeding targets
set at appraisal.

Environmentally Friendly Agricultural Practices:

4.       Reducing Nutrient Discharge in Water Bodies: The objective of this activity was to
develop and test a package of investments and practices for reducing nutrient discharge into water
bodies in the four Black Sea Provinces. Towards this, the project undertook a training and
demonstration program to demonstrate environmentally-friendly practices, such as crop rotation,
crop nutrient management, animal waste management, and use of organic matter. 65% of farmers
in the project area were targeted for such training. Appropriate packages of practices were
successfully tested in the pilot areas and 3500 persons were trained through 200 distinct training
programs. At project closure Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) implementation in the four
Black Sea provinces and 14 micro-watersheds was still ongoing. Some 90% of farmers were
reported to have adopted nutrient management practices in the four Black Sea provinces.

5.       Manure Handling: Adoption of improved manure handling and storage facilities was a
key objective for this activity. The target was to promote adoption of improved manure handling
and storage facilities among 55% - 60% of farmers in areas where such practices would be piloted.
In this connection, some 381 units of household and farm-level solid and liquid manure storage

                                                 22
facilities were established. Also ten units of central-level solid and liquid manure storage facilities
were established. The project also provided necessary technical equipment including loaders,
trailers, solid manure spreaders and mixers which was critical for efficient management of the
manure to reduce nutrient loads to soil and surface and ground water bodies. A Nutrient Manual
and Soil Analyses Manual were prepared with the assistance of the Soil Manure Research
Institute. Software with regard to application of manure in project sites was also prepared and
training provided to beneficiaries. In this connection the Institute worked with farmers to analyze
their soil samples and advise them on optimal application of agricultural inputs.

Component 2: Income Generation

6.       Increased Household (HH) Incomes: The project aimed at increasing household
incomes in participating MC communities starting from a modest baseline of average HH income
estimated at TL 4,200, where the underlying figures were derived from surveys conducted in
project MCs before project implementation started. A target was set to increase HH incomes in
the participating MC communities by 10% above baseline at midterm and by 40% at project
closure. These targets were far exceeded. It was estimated that the average HH income was raised
by 53% as revealed by the beneficiary surveys completed in project MCs.

7.      Farm Income Diversification: The project aimed at providing training and materials to
qualifying farmers to help them engage in activities to raise and/or diversify farm income. The
baseline was 2674 for the total number of farmers in the MCs of Sivas, Çorum, Kayseri and
Amasya provinces. The target was to reach at least 60 % of farmers in the designated MCs to
equip them with training in new agriculture based income regeneration /diversification activities.
Toward this, some 83% of the farmers were trained by the end of 2010, and the achievement rate
is expected to reach some 142% by the end of 2012.

Component 3: Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Capacity towards meeting EU
Standards

8.      Nitrates Directive Legislation: The project aimed at development and promotion of legal
framework consistent with the EU Nitrates Directive. The Directive aims to protect water quality
by preventing nitrates from agricultural sources polluting ground and surface waters and by
promoting the use of good farming practices. Prior to the project, there was no such legal
framework in place. Regulation numbered 25377 was published in the Official Gazette on
February 18, 2004 which seeks to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources.
While the legislation has been enacted, the Government is currently actively searching for ways
and means of enforcing this regulation effectively and developing more detailed instruments that
would facilitate its implementation. The Directive is a critical component of the EU Water
Framework Directive and the project has helped the country initiate compliance with the different
requirements of the Water Framework Directive.

9.      Development and Promotion of a Code for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP): The
project developed the Code of Good Agricultural Practices as required under the EU Nitrates
Directive. At project start, virtually no farmers were known to be using environmentally- friendly
agricultural practices. Environmentally-friendly agricultural practices have now been adopted by
30% of farmers in project micro catchments in Black Sea Provinces. Activities on GAP are
ongoing in the four Black Sea provinces, in 14 microcatchments.

10.    Institutional Support for Organic Farming: TA and training in support of organic
farming and marketing of organic products was provided as planned. No formal local training

                                                  23
was available for organic farming prior to the project. Some 54 farmers participated in the
training sessions on Organic Farming and Principles, 37 farmers in Why Organic Farming and 75
farmers in Threats Awaiting the World and Organic Farming for a total of 166.

11.      Water Quality Monitoring: One of the objectives of the project was to develop and
implement a water quality monitoring program. Prior to the project, no water quality monitoring
program was in existence. Under the project, various institutional and regulatory mechanisms
were put in place supporting water quality monitoring program, which has been mainstreamed
into Ministry operations such that monitoring could be carried on a continuous basis. Some 140
stations of 14 MCs (57 pieces of groundwater and 83 pieces of surface water) have been
established and water quality monitoring program have now been fully integrated in the
Ministry's routine duties.

12.     The project provided necessary training and equipment to strengthen capacity of
laboratories for soil and water quality monitoring. A detailed laboratory handbook was
developed to harmonize analysis procedures by all laboratories. The laboratory in Samsun is EU
accredited and the National Reference Laboratory in MEF in Ankara is well equipped with
mobile laboratory for water quality analysis. Water is analyzed for pH temperature, dissolved
oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids, nitrates, TN, TP and fecal coliform. Sampling period is
monthly for surface waters and quarterly for ground waters.

Component 4: Public Awareness, Capacity Building and Replication Strategy

13.      Public Awareness Campaigns: The project aimed at developing and implementing
public awareness campaigns (PAC) for MC development, increasing awareness of causes, effects
and mitigating measures of natural resource degradation, animal waste management and nutrient
reduction to soil and water bodies. Awareness raising activities were undertaken in all project
MCs. For nutrient management specifically, more than 27,000 persons in 14 watersheds were
contacted belonging to some 4600 households. A website for the project was established.
Brochures and posters were prepared in five different designs to reach as wide an audience as
possible. The Government commissioned a 30 minute documentary, as well as several short
television spots to disseminate information on the project and its potential benefits.

14.      Training and Seminars: A detailed training program was designed to increase
knowledge and skills of both central and provincial staff working on the project as well as target
communities on several areas related to nutrient management. These included international study
tours to several countries such as Germany, Poland, Romania, Moldova, and Georgia. Turkey
hosted the “Integrated Nutrient Pollution Management Workshop?, one in a series of workshops
organized by countries receiving GEF support under the Danube-Black Sea Strategic Partnership
Program that aimed to reduce nutrient loads to the Black Sea. About 40 international and 50
national experts participated in the workshop. The workshop provided an excellent forum of the
exchange of ideas and experiences with agricultural pollution control, and nutrient management
practices in particular, that served to enhance the knowledge and skills of participating project
team members. It also hosted the workshop on: Integrated Participatory Watershed Rehab
Techniques in Degraded Lands, where participants included representatives from a wide range of
countries including, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Moldova, Georgia, and Uzbekistan. The workshop was well received and
consequently offered twice where participating countries included Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia,
Palestine, Kosovo, Macedonia, Senegal, and Sudan.

15.      Replication Strategy for Nutrient Discharge: A comprehensive replication strategy was
put in place and targets were set for future nutrient reduction on the basis of achievements of
activities in pilot MCs. An international consultant was hired to evaluate the results of activities
in ten selected watersheds and a report was prepared to establish an applicable strategy to apply
these activities across the whole country.

                                       A. INTRODUCTION

1.      Background: The overall development objective of the Turkey Anatolia Watershed
Rehabilitation Project was to support sustainable natural resource management practices in 28
micro-catchments in Anatolia and Turkey's Black Sea Region and thereby raise incomes of
communities affected by resource degradation. The project aimed to build and expand on a
community-based approach to natural resource management. The Project design was based
largely upon the experience and insights acquired under the Eastern Anatolia Watershed
Rehabilitation Project. The project closing date was June 30, 2012.

2.      Project components are: Component 1: Rehabilitation of degraded natural resources
whose primary objective is to protect degraded areas from further degradation, erosion and
pollution. Component 2 supports Income generating activities designed to provide participating
communities with the incentives to undertake conservation efforts. Component 3 strengthens
policy and regulatory capacity towards meeting EU Standards including support for the
application of the EU Nitrates Directive, development and promotion of a code of good
agricultural practices, and institutional support for organic farming. Component 4 supports
awareness raising in micro-catchment development, capacity building and replication strategy.
Component 5 supports project management and support services, including a fund for applied
research and technology dissemination.

3.        Project Service Area: There are 25 river basins in Turkey. The three river basins
initially planned to receive project assistance consist of the basins of Yesilirmak, Kizilirmak and
Seyhan. These three basins are adjoining and form some contiguous territory slicing Turkey in
half from North to South. They cross the Anatolian peninsula from the Black Sea in the North to
the Mediterranean in the South (please see the attached map). The two basins where the project
intervened – Yesilirmak and Kizilirmak – collectively have 12.28 km3 of average annual flow
corresponding to some 6.6% of Turkey’s annual flow in its rivers. The total flow for the entire
country is 186.05 km3, which represents that portion of the precipitation that has economic value
and that can be used for water supply, irrigation, industry etc. However, these two rivers are
significant because population density around them is much higher than on other rivers
(Euphrates and Tigris for instance) which have higher flow but fewer people living on or around
them.

4.      The project covers six provinces: Kayseri, Amasya, Tokat, Corum, Samsun and Sivas.
Three provinces (Corum, Samsun, Sivas) are located in both basins (table). There are many
downstream provinces (list below) that are in the same river basins but not covered in the project.

5.       AWRP as a Replicable Model: AWRP has served as a replicable model for
implementation in other watersheds in Turkey, and has helped mobilize significant funding in
watershed management involving intensive targeting of selected micro-catchments. One can
discern little difference in approach between the AWRP and Coruh WRP, for instance,
highlighting the fact that AWRP has furnished a genuine replicable format and model. The same
applies to the case of the IFAD-funded operation in pipeline: Murat River Watershed
Rehabilitation Project. The TA and training efforts funded under the project have led to
significant capacity creation within the implementing agencies, and have increased the self-
confidence of the participating staff, allowing them to assume responsibility for further watershed
projects in Turkey.

6.     AWRP in the World: In addition to its role as a replicable model in Turkey, AWRP also
compares favorably with other projects in the World. The final draft of the Turkey National Basin
Management Strategy document lists AWRP as a good practice case that (a) combines
conservation, intensified resource use and livelihood objectives, and (b) uses participatory
approaches along with some other comparable initiatives in the world.

                           B. SUMMARY OF CBA FROM THE PAD

7.       According to the original design, economic benefits of the project fall into two main
categories: (i) benefits from a restored natural resource base and, (ii) increased household income
from intensification and diversification of farming systems. The quantification of economic
benefits from an improved natural resource base in the 28 project MCs includes a valuation of
three distinct benefits: (i) savings in erosion induced soil loss; (ii) yield increases due to improved
agricultural land and (iii) reduced flood control costs. Other benefits, such as reduced siltation in
dams, improved quality of drinking water due to reduced sedimentation content of the water;
increased soil moisture content and reduced carbon sequestration were not quantified due to lack
of data. The quantification of incremental benefits from improved farming techniques and
diversification was based on farm budgets for various project supported activities in the 28 MCs,
taking into consideration conjectural phasing of project activities.

8.       The bulk of the project costs were allocated to Component 1 (mainly degraded resource
rehabilitation), while Component 2 (mainly income generation activities), were assumed to
generate the majority of the requisite benefits to derive the CBA. Components 3 and 4 (mainly
institutional support) were not taken into account in the CBA. Benefits of capacity building are
difficult to ascertain since it is an individual's behavior after training that determines benefits -
and this is difficult to measure a priori. Hence, given its limited scope and depth, the economic
analysis found in the PAD can be characterized as partial, and mostly indicative.

9.      The ERR (18.6%) and the NPV (US$ 15.3 M) were calculated over a period of 25 years.
NPV estimates assumed an opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12 %. Sensitivity analysis
suggested that a 20 % increase in project costs combined with a 20 % reduction in project
benefits would still yield an ERR in excess of 14 % and an NPV of US$ 5.7 million (please see
table below). If the impact of project activities on erosion were not to materialize the ERR would
drop to 18.1 % and the NPV to US$ 13.7 million, highlighting the limited weight assigned to the
core issue of erosion control. Excluding the irrigation component, by contrast, would effectively
reduce the ERR to 12.3 % and the NPV to near zero, emphasizing the critical impact this
investment was purported to exert on the project’s performance in the ERR model that was used.

10.     The cost of the project activities in the baseline scenario was estimated at US$ 37.92
million (exclusive of price and physical contingencies). It was clearly acknowledged that
available resources under the project were modest and would prove insufficient for ambitious
objectives such as developing environmentally friendly farming practices in the lower part of the

                                                  28
key watersheds that discharge into the Black Sea and supporting comprehensive adaptive research
aimed at reducing agricultural pollution while maintaining or increasing yields.

                              C. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

11.     Approach and Data: This analysis is intended to meet the requirements of the ICR
section on Economic and Financial Analysis in compliance with the World Bank ICRR
Guidelines following a review the material found in the PAD, project Aide Memoires,
Implementation Status Reports and various Progress Reports issued by the implementing
agencies.

12.     Methodology: An economic analysis is being performed in this annex due to the fact that
project benefits are mostly of public nature, as opposed to a financial analysis which would be
pertinent mostly for revenue generating activities. The approach pursued is driven largely by the
quantity and quality of the available data. The analysis aims to extend and update the existing
analyses reflected in the PAD while recognizing that the initial CBA was partial. The analysis
presented herein adheres as much as possible to the approach and format outlined in the ICR
guidelines, supported by benchmark analysis of similar projects in the region, as well as making
reference to the predecessor project Turkey Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project
and other efforts whose designs were patterned after AWRP.

13.     Project's ERR and NPV: An NPV and ERR were calculated for the project during its
design. Re-estimation of the same would require a review of the underlying project costs and
benefits. The section below sheds light on this aspect.

14.      Project Costs: Beginning with the cost side of the equation, the project disbursed
approximately US$ 19.55 million to implement the IBRD funded portion where the Bank
contributed approximately US$ 15.15 million (total financing under the loan is US$19.65 which
includes the US$0.1 million front-end fee). The remaining funds (US$ 4.49 million) came from
the Government. Therefore, actual project funding from IBRD, GEF and Government was about
US$ 28.65 million: US$ 19.55 for IBRD-supported activities and US$ 9.11 million for GEF-
supported activities, which included the GEF Grant of US$7.0 million and US$2.14 million
Government contribution. There were additional in-kind contributions from the direct
beneficiaries which have not been monetized by the Government. The initial appraisal estimate
for the five project components was US$ 44.91 million including user contributions. Of the IBRD
funded portion, Component 1 - which is the focus of the analysis below - accounted for the
highest level of investment spending as well as the rate of disbursement. It disbursed US$ 14.01
million corresponding to 71% of the IBRD-funded portion of the project. Re-estimation of ERR
and NPV for Component 1 will therefore consider the actual cost of US$ 14.01 million. This is a

                                               29
conservative approach. Including all contributions from all local communities (including in-kind)
would impact the final rates of return.

15.     Project Benefits: Quantifiable project benefits in the PAD consisted of (i) savings in
erosion induced soil loss; (ii) yield increases due to improved agricultural land and (iii) reduced
flood control costs. All three benefits fall under the general heading of erosion control.

16.      Benefits Related to Soil Loss: The project aimed at saving an estimated 1.5 million tons
of soil annually which would otherwise be eroded without the project. To quantify the value of
this reduction, soil losses in tons were translated into soil losses in areas. A loss of 1.5 million
tons of sediments corresponded to an annual loss of about US$ 31,000. The productivity losses
would cumulate over time and reach US$ 310,000 per year after 10 years. Under the project,
erosion would progressively be reduced by 80 percent and it is estimated that in PY 20, annual
savings would reach TL 400,000, or US$ 300,000 per year.

17.      Benefits Related to Crop Yields: Erosion negatively affects crop yields. Due to lack of
data, in the PAD the analyst assumed that productivity would decrease by 1 percent every year
without the project as a result of continuing erosion. These losses would progressively be reduced
and yields would stabilize after 5 years as a result of erosion control activities by the project. This
conservative assumption would lead to an annual savings of about TL 380,000 (USS 280,000)
after 10 years.

18.      Flood Control. Serious damages are inflicted by floods in the three major watersheds
partly served by the project. Reduced erosion has an impact on the frequency and severity of
floods by sharply controlling the peaks of water flow both through increased infiltration and
slowing down the flow where vegetation cover is restored. Calculations showed that annual
savings associated with effective flood control in the micro-catchments would amount to about
US$ 30,000.

19.     With a renewed focus on Component 1, a plan was made to revisit these three benefit
streams. However, data proved constraining and it was difficult to assemble the diverse set of
existing data into a coherent picture. The most plausible remedy therefore involved utilizing
proxies and benchmarks for revising the AWRP efficiency measures (NPV and ERR), in
conjunction with updates of the original data.

20.      Project Benefits Not Considered: The principal project benefits which were included in
the original analysis but excluded in the re-estimation of the ERR due to lack of data consisted of
(a) fallow reduction, (b) small scale irrigation, and (c) animal husbandry activities. Fallow

                                                  30
reduction was assumed to result in increased fodder production which would lead incremental
annual benefits of TL 334,000 as of year seven. Small scale irrigation was expected to provide for
the development of about 4000 ha of new irrigated land which would allow conversion from the
current extensive production of cereals to a more intensive cultivation of higher value crops. The
animal husbandry activity was planned to involve improved practices with the production of
sheep, goats, dairy and fodder crops under the implementation responsibility of ORKÖY which
operates in villages in and around forested areas.

21.     Plausible Ranges of ERR: Looking at the design experience of the other watershed
projects in Turkey, one can note that the estimated ERR of such projects varies between 8% and
18%. This would suggest a reasonable range of acceptable projects for our purposes.

                                                                    Official

22.     However, given the fact that not all of the anticipated agricultural benefits (with
implication of short term tangible benefits) of the project could materialize, we would expect
AWRP ERR and NPV to be somewhat less than what was envisioned, because there has been an
accompanying reduction in the economic benefits.

23.     It should be noted that the absolute level of the NPV itself has little relevance. All we
need to ensure is that it should be positive. Choice of a lower OCC would naturally help lift the
NPVs while leaving ERRs unaffected. So, one does not need to worry about the NPV any more
than making sure that it has the right sign. It is discerned that the above analyses have all used
OCCs in the range of 12%. Given the global recession, one can justify a lower OCC of 6%, for
instance, and be able to make a good case for the AWRP. This is the approach being taken in this
Annex.

24.     With respect to the ERR, as pointed out above, there is reason to believe that it would be
lower than 18%. However, even under these circumstances, the project would still be deemed
acceptable in economic terms until the ERR has been lowered to a level such as 10 to 12%.

25.     Re-Estimation Procedure: As already indicated, this analysis focuses solely on
Component 1 costs and benefits. In consequence, below we present a re-estimation of the ERR
and NPV for Component 1 alone, with a view to exploring the implications of this exercise. As
mentioned above, Component 1 constitutes the core of the project in terms of environmental
interventions where there is greater scope of offering a simpler indicative and partial analysis.

26.      The cost side for Component 1 was US$ 14.01 million, which remains unaffected. As for
revised benefits, a review of the Coruh WRP (the benchmark case) showed that avoided repair
costs (flood risk mitigation), avoided soil loss and improved range management constituted the
bulk of this project's benefits (please see table attached). Since there was a scarcity of new and

                                                 31
reliable economic data from the AWRP, we resorted to economic data of the Coruh WRP, and
attempted adjustments on the flood control benefits. Meanwhile, remaining data regarding soil
loss and crop yields were revised by updating the project's own figures using external escalation
factors.

27.     The principal motive behind the re-adjustment of AWRP's flood control benefits was that
the design has grossly underestimated them. Restoring the level of these benefits back to normal
would naturally render the analysis more realistic.

28.      Comparison of the annual incremental flood control benefits for AWRP (US$ 30,000)
and Coruh WRP reveals that the latter's was in the order of US$ 950,000 (TL 1.7 million) for a
project 6 times smaller in overall catchment area, 2 times smaller in water carrying capacity
(discharge rate), two times smaller in population and 35% smaller in terms of the number of
micro-catchments served. If a very rough adjustment factor were to be proposed, AWRP's flood
control benefits would perhaps be 30 times larger. But, the actual service area of Curuh AWRP is
twice as large and the number of villages it contains is 25% greater. So, a downward adjustment
is in order too, which would lead to an approximate overall adjustment factor of 12. Thus, based
on this crude logic, the AWRP flood control benefits are expected to be in the order of TL 20
million annually, or some US$11 million annually.

29.    Despite the large magnitude of US$ 11 million in flood control benefits just computed,
we remained on the very conservative side and tried to test the annual flood control benefits for
US$ 3 million, US$ 4 million and US$ 5.5 million and explored the implications in conjunction
the ERR, NPV and sensitivity analysis as shown below.

30.      With regard to adjustments on the benefits related to soil loss and crop yields, external
escalation factors were used. The original CBA was performed in TL terms. Since project
preparation in January 2003, Turkey has experienced significant inflation while curiously the TL
kept appreciating against the US$. Looking at the TL side alone, the TL of 2012 is only 42%4 as
valuable as the TL in 2003. This means that an escalation coefficient of 2.4 should be used to
update the historical figures into current TL, and then convert them into US$ for a US$ based
analysis. As a result of this procedure, the re-estimated benefits were about 33% larger than
original levels. No adjustment was made in the actual project costs of US$ 14.01 million other
than phasing them over the years. The below tables contain information on how benefits were re-
adjusted and ERR and NPV re-estimated.

 32.      Conclusions: The project initially planned to work in three watersheds, but ended up
working in two. Meanwhile the scope of the activity was not scaled down since the project
completed rehabilitation works in 28 micro catchments, as originally planned. The partial and
indicative analysis for the base case shown above leads to the conclusion that the re-computed
ERR would be around 14%, with NPV being equal to US$ 15.53 M and B/C ratio of 4.35 under
the assumption of an OCC of 6 %. Sensitivity around flood benefits revealed that US$ 5.5 million
in flood control benefits would replicate the original ERR of 18%. It is believed that if a full
analysis were to be attempted, the recomputed overall efficiency parameters for AWRP would be
larger, since important legal reforms were made as a result of GEF interventions, as well as
significant capacity building not included in the above analysis.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Below are the comments provided by the Government on the draft ICR and the Bank team’s
response.

(1) Data Sheet
It is stated that the amount for the IBRD Loan is 20 million USD. However, after the Village
Affairs closed the amount of 4.2 million USD foreseen for the works to be executed by the Village
Affairs was cancelled and the total amount was added to the Governments budged and was given
to the Special Provincial Agencies as Participatory Contribution. In this regard, the Loan amount
should be calculated in regard with the Mid Term Evaluation and should be stated as 15.7
million USD. This matter is already mentioned in Section 1.9 in the ICR report.

The table in the Data Sheet has been revised to reflect the cancelation of US$4.30 million and the
revised loan amount of US$15.70 million. The US$4.30 million comprises US$4.20 towards
cancelation of the small-scale irrigation works under Component 2 and US$0.10 million towards
the 50% waiver of the front-end fee.

(2) Project Indicators
Some of the Project Indicators are such that they can be affected by external factors other than
project activities. For instance, “soil fertility? “income level? type of indicators can be affected
by various factors. For example, income level may rise due to the general economic progress
going on in the country. Thus project performance may be overrated because of these factors.
Project team should make sure that they exclude the impact of external variables from the change
in a specific indicator to the extent possible.

We concur with this statement. We acknowledge that several factors have contributed to
improvements in soil fertility and income levels in the project area during the life of the project
and project interventions were just one of several factors contributing to such improvements. We
also recognize that remarkable economic progress was ongoing in the country during the years of
project implementation which impacted the achievement of project outcomes. However, a more
exact and detailed calculation of each factor contributing to these achievements is complex and
beyond the scope this ICR analysis. The fact that the achievement of select outputs/outcomes
under the project cannot be solely and specifically attributed to project activities has been
referenced in the Data Sheet where the achievement of project indicators is discussed.

(3) Section 5.1 (a) Assessment of Bank Performance
Project baseline data is gathered at the project planning phase and will be used as monitoring
bases. Regarding; (The one shortcoming was the lack of some baseline data/values which
compromised more in-depth assessment or measurement of some project outcomes.) Which data
is a shortcoming is not understood properly. The statement regarding this matter should be
revised.

The misstatement has been deleted. Indeed, baselines were to be established at the time of MC
plan development during project implementation as indicated in the Monitoring and Evaluation
section of the PAD (Section C4: Project Description Summary).

(4) Annex 3: Financial and Economic Analysis
(a)     The Project cost is 15.7 million USD in regard with the cancellation of the amount of 4.2
million USD in the Mid-Term evaluation result mentioned in the Section 1.9. The total
disbursement of the Project is 19.65 million USD. The amount of 15.15 million USD is external

                                                 39
budget and the amount of 4.49 million USD is the national Budget. The total disbursement of
Loan and GEF is 28.76 million USD (19.65 million USD is spent in Loan including national
budget- 9.11 million USD is spent in GEF). Again, regarding these disbursements the user
contributions are not included. When the Project budget is evaluated in this regard, excluding
the user contribution and including the national budget a realization of 93% is achieved in the
Loan. In the beginning regarding the GEF part, while the spared budget including the
government contribution and excluding the participatory contribution was 9.2 million USD, the
disbursement was realized as approximately 9.11 million USD. The disbursement ratio is realized
as 99%. The statement regarding representing more than 50% in costs savings is not correct. The
disbursements regarding the main activities should be evaluated in regard with matters
mentioned above. Because only the Loan and Government contribution can be shown in the
tables the participatory contribution is not stated. It would be more appropriate if the evaluation
was made in regard with these matters.

The project cost and disbursement figures have been revised in the Annex to reflect the
accurate cost and disbursement figures and related statements have been amended /
deleted.

(b)      It is known that the AWRP that covered the period of 2004-2012, was revised during the
Project implementation after the abolishment of the General Directorate of Rural Services. Due
to institutional restructuring, project cost declined from 52.11 USD millions to 27 USD millions.
Therefore it is seen that project costs by components was changed and there is quite a difference
between appraisal estimate and actual/latest estimate. However, in the Result Report, the initial
project development objectives and original financing, approved by the related authorities were
kept in order to assess the achievements of target values. For a better analysis of the project
after completion, it is critical to use actual estimation.

We confirm that the cost-benefit analysis of project achievements was undertaken using the
actual/latest estimates of Project costs and not the estimates established at appraisal. These
Actual/Latest figures are indicated on page 29, paragraph 14 of Annex 3: Financial and Economic
Analysis.

(c)     In Annex 3, Economic and Financial Analysis part (pg 28-29), economic rate of return
and net present value were calculated as 18.6% and 5.3 USD millions. However, if the revision of
the Project were to be proposed, economic rate of return would perhaps change and net present
value would be lower than now.

We note and agree with the statement that if project costs/disbursements are modified, this would
be impact the economic rates of return and net present value. However, the analysis has been
undertaken on the actual/latest project cost estimates for Component 1: Rehabilitation of
Degraded Lands, the rationale for which is explained below in comment (e). Additionally, we
wish to clarify that the original economic analysis presented in the PAD underestimated the
environmental benefits, which we have recomputed to a more realistic level in the latest analysis
contained in the ICR

(d)     The given sensitivity and economic analysis has a limited scope. Instead of making a new
calculation, the same tables of these analyses in page 29, 30, 31 were taken from the initial
approved AWRP Report. Due to inadequate representation in Annex 3, re-estimation and a
detailed explanation of these calculations are needed. Economic calculation methods may be
given as an Annex.


                                                40
Only the table on page 29 has been borrowed from the PAD with full referencing to the source.
Other tables that appear on pages 30 and 31 have been developed by the ICR team, and embody
new ideas and analysis.

We acknowledge the need for additional documentation to justify the analyses. The team will
compile and share, with the Government, the complete sets of data used for the calculations
undertaken in this Annex as well as the original Excel sheets and accompanying narrative.
However, we suggest not including them as an annex to this document as they are substantially
detailed and voluminous.

(e)      In page 31, it is stated that cost-benefit analysis was solely made for Component 1:
rehabilitation of degraded natural resources due to the fact that it constitutes the core of the
project in terms of environmental interventions. Besides, a re-estimation of financial and
sensitivity analysis for Component 1 is presented in page 33. It is important that estimations
should be comparable before and after the implementation of the project and should be
compatible with the other components’ output indicators.

The rationale for focusing on Component 1 was that most economic benefits under the project
accrued through implementation of this component. Component 2 (Income Generating
Activities) was substantially reduced during project implementation with the cancelation of the
small-scale irrigation activity which would have been critical for enhancing economic benefits
under the project. In fact, the final project cost of this component was only 26.5% of the
appraisal estimate. The actual stream of benefits had to therefore adjusted and reduced
significantly during implementation vis-à-vis appraisal. Moreover, availability of limited data
precluded an in-depth analysis of economic returns under Component 2.

(f)      In page 31 and 34, Anatolia WRP, Coruh and Murat River WRP were compared in terms
of official project cost, economic rates of return, net present value, number of micro-catchments,
population, etc. It is not seemed to be rational to compare projects where some of them are
totally completed, that others are ongoing or not started yet.

The team clarifies that the comparison among the above projects was done in terms of their
design. This is due to the fact that an overall similar approach and methodology was used for
designing these projects targeted at promoting rehabilitation of watersheds of these rivers. The
analysis does not compare progress or results achieved under the three projects as indeed they are
at different stages of implementation. This has been clarified in paragraph 21 of the Annex as
well as the related table.
