                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper proposes a restructuring of the Savings and Rural
Finance Second Phase Project (Second Additional Financing) to reallocate funds between
the different disbursement categories. The specific changes are detailed in paragraph 4 of
this Restructuring Paper.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The implementation of the Project is satisfactory and most indicators are expected
to be met by the Closing Date of July 31, 2012. Disbursement forecasts show that
approximately US$48 million out of US$50 million, or 96%, should be disbursed by the
Closing Date. The strengthening of the financial institutions has been satisfactory. The
number of financial institutions having received certification is still below the objective
(112 entities certified and nine additional ones under review by CNBV and nine more
merged, compared to the overall target of 200). In terms of market share (both assets and
membership) the targets have been far exceeded (approximately 75% of market vs. target
of 60%). Despite an unstable legal and regulatory environment, the auxiliary supervision
mechanisms for institutions under the 2001 Law on Savings and Popular Credit (LACP)
are operational. The technology platform is fully operational, offering a wide range of
services, including the core banking services, operational risk analysis system, credit
scoring system, remittance payment´s services, money laundering prevention,
correspondent banking services, personal computer equipment renewal, a switch of
electronic payments for the whole sector and communications services by virtual private
network MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching). The platform has evolved into a much
broader tool which now serves a larger population than initially planned. The outreach of
the sector, targeted at 12 million members/clients, currently stands at 19.68 million.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Reallocation

3.     The reallocation does not reflect any change of strategy or scope of activities.
Rather, it is primarily due to a change in the procurement methods for several
procurement packages. For example, the “Goods? category which was initially included
to cover the purchase of IT (Information Technology) equipment, has been changed to
“Non Consulting Services? in order to lease and maintain the equipment. The other major
change is that five small eligible IT contracts which were initially meant to be financed

                                           -1-
out of Bansefi III (P123367) were instead financed out of undisbursed funds from
Bansefi II (P087152).

4.      Proceeds will be allocated as follows:

5.      The implementing agency is in full compliance with the Bank’s financial
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
reports.
