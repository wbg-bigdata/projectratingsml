1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    When project preparation started in 2003, the Mexican economy was experiencing mild
         consequences of the 2001 economic slowdown in the United States. A weak economic growth
         (1.4 percent) and a moderate inflation rate (4.5 percent) characterized the economic landscape.
         Since the 1995 Peso crisis, the financial system had been strengthened and the Mexican economy
         had been relatively stable, relying on an increasingly sound macroeconomic management.

1.1.2    Access to financial services in Mexico continued however to be limited and costly. In their effort
         to clean up the balance sheets, the commercial banks largely withdrew from retail banking, and
         private sector credit to GDP fell to around 10 percent in 2000 (from 35 percent in 1995) 1.
         Available unsecured retail credit frequently came with interest rates of 70 percent and higher,
         making it difficult to afford. There were also significant gaps in geographic coverage, with 74
         percent of the municipalities (representing 22 percent of Mexico’s population) reportedly not
         having a bank branch. These supply side bottlenecks particularly constrained rural agriculture and
         non-agriculture enterprises, which reportedly had participation rates of below 10 percent for both
         savings and credit services (below rates reported for countries with a lower per capita income like
         Peru and Colombia). The unbanked population faced high transaction cost for paying utilities and
         receiving remittances, and depended on non-regulated alternative credit providers that charged
         high rates for loans.

1.1.3    Against this background, the Government renewed its efforts to strengthen and deepen the
         financial sector, focusing on a broader range of financial intermediaries. The commercial bank
         reform had already resulted in significantly stronger banks and a vigorous consolidation phase.
         However, despite a 50 percent increase in banking assets between 1999 and 2003, deposit and
         lending activity actually declined. Most banking products were targeted to high-income clients,
         and bank branches clustered around business and high-income residential areas. A number of
         legal and regulatory reforms were initiated to improve the efficiency and transparency of
         development banks’ operations, and to re-orient them toward developing rural financial markets.

1.1.4    A number of key legal and institutional reforms were initiated prior to project approval. The Ley
         de Ahorro y Crédito Popular (LACP) was passed in April 2001 and the Banco del Ahorro
         Nacional y Servicios Financieros, S.N.C. Institución de Banca de Desarrollo (BANSEFI) was
         created. BANSEFI received an enhanced development role with respect to the Savings and Credit
         Institutions (SCI) sector, acting as the nodal bank to channel and coordinate government
         assistance for sector strengthening. The Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV),
         already the regulator for banks and capital markets, became the sole regulatory and supervisory
         authority for the SCI sector and was given the responsibility for issuing all regulations associated
         with the new legal framework for SCIs. Existing institutions had until June 2005 (later extended)
         to meet the legal requirements for authorization, which included adopting one of the two
         acceptable legal forms, purchasing private deposit insurance, having an accounting and financial
         management system that would meet CNBV standards, having regular reporting and supervision
         and demonstrating financial viability and effective governance structures.

                                                       1
1.1.5     The Government also launched a comprehensive strategy to reform and strengthen the SCI. The
          SCI sector had a comparative advantage in expanding outreach since it already had a
          considerable presence in otherwise unbanked areas of the country, and targeted low- to middle
          income clients. At appraisal, it was estimated that the sector consisted of about 600 institutions,
          but the majority of them was not formally authorized to mobilize savings, and limited
          information on their soundness and viability existed. The Government’s reform strategy was
          holistic, combining legal and regulatory reforms with a substantial public investment in order to
          create and strengthen the capacity of the SCIs and the regulatory agencies assigned with their
          supervision.

1.1.6     To facilitate the transition, BANSEFI launched, on behalf of the government, a sector
          strengthening initiative in 2002. The World Bank considered worth partnering with the
          Government on this reform endeavor through a series of projects because of the above
          determined gaps in financial access in rural areas, and the innovativeness of this holistic
          government policy initiative, which covered a range of issues relating to prudential oversight,
          auxiliary supervision, deepening outreach, legal reform, institutional reform, technical assistance
          and strengthening regulatory and supervision capacity. Moreover, it blended public sector action
          and private initiative, focusing on creating sustainable and profitable SCIs.

1.1.7      The World Bank support has emerged over the years to a series of projects. BANSEFI I,
          approved in June 2002, took a dual approach of strengthening the sector and directly supporting
          its growth in rural areas to foster financial inclusion. Through supporting the development of an
          inventory and assessment of the sector, providing a first round of training and strengthening to the
          sector’s institutions, the development of a first blueprint for the information system, and carrying
          out dissemination activities, it laid the ground for the second Bank project. The BANSEFI II
          project had a more narrow focus, providing additional funding for strengthening and
          consolidating the sector to bring it under regulation, and supporting the implementation and
          refinement of a technical platform that would – as a public good for the sector – support the
          harmonization within the sector and the development of joint products and services. Most
          recently, in December 2011, BANSEFI III was approved to provide final support for the sector’s
          strengthening, and fostering the outreach of regulated SCIs into unbanked rural areas.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1     The Project Development Objective aimed at assisting the Borrower in strengthening the SCI
          sector with entities which are compliant with the Popular Savings and Credit Law, financially
          viable, operationally effective, managerially sound, technologically upgraded and providing an
          enhanced level of outreach and access to financial services by the underserved Mexican
          population.

1.2.2     As key performance indicators, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) specified2:

          -    About 195 entities assisted under the project either certified by CNBV for operation, or
               identified for liquidations with appropriate plans;

2
  The formulation in the key performance indicators in the main text and Annex 1 slightly deviate in wording and provided targets, but
not in substance. The ICR is based on the more detailed key performance indicators provided in the Annex 3 of the PAD: arrangements
for results monitoring.

                                                                  2
         -   About 12 institutions brought under the process of liquidation;
         -   Deposit Protection Fund established for at least one Federation / Confederation;
         -   50 percent of the consolidated sector entities adopted the technology platform (about 115
             entities);
         -   At least 90 percent of the entities reported satisfactory outcomes relating to accounting and
             internal controls and meeting reporting requirements (number of entities); and
         -   Clients of the sector increased from 4 million to 9 million.

1.3     Revised PDO

1.3.1    The Project Development Objective (PDO) was not revised during project implementation.

1.3.2    The key performance indicators remained unchanged in substance, but the target indicators were
         adjusted to reflect the additional financing made available, and lessons learned about the time
         needed for transition. Furthermore, one outcome indicator was added in the second additional
         financing to measure the number of entities receiving Technical Assistance (TA) for mergers and
         liquidations.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1    The direct beneficiaries of the project were the 600 savings and credit institutions estimated to
         operate in rural and urban areas of Mexico at project appraisal. It was expected that 195 of these
         entities would receive project support for the transformation into authorized and regulated
         financial entities, and for becoming sustainable and profitable financial entities.

1.4.2    Indirect beneficiaries of the Project were the current and potential clients of the SCI sector. These
         mostly comprise households and microenterprises that were not yet served or were under-served
         by the banking sector (in particular the low-middle income population segments of rural and
         marginalized areas). The consolidation of the SCI sector and the increased confidence in its
         intermediaries was expected to increase the number of members in SCIs, and to allow the
         members access to secure savings instruments and a broader range of other financial services
         (such as lending and payment services) at lower prices than those requested by informal service
         providers.

1.5     Original Components

         The project had four components:

         -   Component 1: Strengthening sector institutions (estimated WB costs at appraisal
             US$10.8 million, including the two additional financing, actual costs US$28.18 million).
             Under this component, technical assistance was to be provided (a) to an additional number of
             eligible SCIs nationwide for assessing their financial and managerial condition and
             determining action plans for their authorization or liquidations, (b) to help selected SCIs,
             which received support under the first project, to develop strategies to deepen penetration and
             expand their financial services outreach, and improve their effectiveness and efficiency, (c) to
             support the creation and functioning of the Deposit Protection Fund at the level of
             Federations and the Confederation, (d) to BANSEFI for the management and monitoring of
             the assistance provided to SCIs by consultants, and (e) to carry out training programs for staff
             of SCIs , the CNBV, BANSEFI and the Federations.
                                                      3
           -     Component 2: Developing a technology platform (estimated WB costs of
                 US$56.2 million, actual US$111.95 million). This component aimed at providing hardware
                 and TA services to establish/ strengthen the technological capacity of BANSEFI and the
                 SCIs. This included, inter alia, the establishment of a data center and provision of virtual
                 private network services for connectivity across individual SCIs.

           -     Component 3: Monitoring and evaluation, studies and information dissemination
                 (estimated WB costs of US$6.2 million, actual costs US$8.1 million). This component
                 provided for (a) improving the size, credibility and interpretation of the annual household
                 surveys carried out by BANSEFI, and ensuring its consistency, (b) carrying out evaluations
                 of the implementation performance of the first two components of the project, including
                 dissemination of the findings, and (c) launching dissemination campaigns to instill
                 confidence about the sector to clients and disseminate the range of financial products
                 available via the new technology platform.

           -     Component 4: Project Management (estimated WB costs of US$1.4 million) to establish
                 and train a core team as required for project implementation.

1.6     Revised Components

           The components were not revised.

1.7        Other significant changes

1.7.1      During implementation, additional funds for project implementation were approved. The first
           additional financing was approved in February 2007 and provided a supplementary amount of
           US$29 million to cover technical assistance needed for (i) the transformation of the SCI sector,
           (ii) the implementation and enhancement of the technology platform and (iii) dissemination of
           new products available through the technology platform. The second additional financing for
           US$50 million approved in August 2008, increased the funding under the same components.

1.7.2      The additional funding was necessary due to:

           -   The complexity and difficulties encompassed during the transition of SCIs into the regulatory
               sphere, and modifications of the legal framework during project implementation. A closer
               assessment of individual SCIs revealed more substantial gaps in their financial and
               organizational situation, and political economy issues made implementation more
               challenging. More time and funding were thus needed for capacity building and technical
               support, and for creating the needed momentum for reform within the sector. Additional costs
               were also incurred for adjusting the TA to the evolving legal and regulatory framework.

           -   The strategy of the technical platform, which changed over time as a result of a long
               consultative process as well as implementation delays and performance weakness of a major
               IT provider. The platform eventually became a sophisticated technical platform that provides
               a core banking module for BANSEFI as well as for financial entities, and allows the
               development of an additional range of electronic banking products for the sector. The break-
               even point by which income received from transaction fees exceeded IT-related expenses
               took longer than initially planned but was reached before Project Closing.

           -   The development of new products provided through, among others, the larger technology
               platform also meant an increased need to familiarize the target population with evolving new
               services, such as remittance transfers through “L@Red de la Gente?, and to help establish the
               SCI sector as a reliable provider of financial services.

1.7.3      The relative contribution of project funds by individual stakeholders changed due to the
           additional funds. The government’s contribution increased from an initially estimated 9 percent
           of project costs to 25 percent, and the Bank’s share from 47 to 51 percent. The tracked financial
           contribution from the sector remained unchanged (declining in relative terms), but this does not
           account for the SCI’s internal costs for upgrading to the technology platform (both staff and
           capital costs), adjusting internal processes to the received technical assistance, and direct and
           indirect costs incurred for supervision.

1.7.4       The two additional financings led to an increase of non-consulting services, and to a shift in
            weights within the project components, with the share of the IT decreasing from about 86 percent
            to 76 percent and an increase in technical assistance to the sector from 8 percent to 15 percent of
            total project costs. Non-consulting services eventually accounted for 47 percent compared to 34
            percent at appraisal, and operating expenses increased from 2 percent to 5 percent. A reallocation
            of expenditure categories under the second additional finance project was undertaken in June
            2012 to allow for higher share of non-consultant services to be financed under the project, but
            these changes were more a reflection of a change of the selected procurement method than a
            change in the use of funds. Annex 1 summarizes the evolution of the various cost categories.

1.7.5       The Closing Date at the time of the second additional financing was extended to June 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1         Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

2.1.1       As described in the PAD and the ICR of the predecessor project, a substantial amount of
            background analysis was carried out in 2000/2001 to help the government determine its reform
            strategy and the scope of support needed for a successful strengthening of the sector. The
            Government was strongly committed to the reforms, having passed in 2001 a legal framework for
            the sector (the LACP), and endowing BANSEFI with the mandate to provide direct support to
            the sector. The project also incorporated lessons learned from other World Bank access to finance
            projects, in particular (i) the need to provide cost saving options to the sector to enhance its
            financial viability and facilitate the sector’s consolidation and (ii) to use a demand driven
            approach for the provision of technical assistance to financial entities.

2.1.2       The project components were fully aligned with the government’s reform strategy and ongoing
            World Bank support, which focused on those aspects of the Government program where the
            Bank had a comparative advantage and could bring value-added. Since 2001, the Bank has been
            working closely with the Government on the evolution of the SCI sector as part of a broader
            partnership in support of the Mexican financial sector (Figure 1). Using a diverse range of
            instruments 4 , the Bank has provided over a decade of policy advice, convening services,
            investments, as well as piloting of innovative rural financial services. The BANSEFI projects
            combined: (a) financial support; (b) advisory services; and (c) coordination with other donors.

4
  The Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND) includes a strategy to enhance the access to financial services, while the Programa
Nacional de Financiamento del Desarrollo (PRONAFIDE) makes reference to better access to savings services, deepening of the
financial sector, increase in competition of the sector, development of a financial culture and consumer protection and an increase
use of electronic means in rural and marginal areas.

                                                                6
                         Table 4. Stages of Support to the Financial Sector in Mexico




2.1.3   The project benefited from a strong partner in BANSEFI and on the experience from the first
        World Bank-financed BANSEFI project to focus its interventions on the strategic elements to
        strengthen the sector and increase outreach.

2.2     Implementation

2.2.1   The project was implemented by a team of highly professional and motivated staff, who often
        engaged in designing innovative technical approaches. The staff turnover was low, providing for
        continuity to the overall objectives of the Project. The PDO being fully consistent with the
        mission of BANSEFI itself, the Project benefited from very strong support from all levels of
        management.


                                                      7
2.2.2     The project was not perceived to be at risk at any stage during implementation.

2.2.3     Most of the activities financed by the Project were demand-driven, and BANSEFI had to
          constantly fine-tune the activities to a changing (i) legal/regulatory framework, (ii) political
          economy and (iii) demand for technical assistance and IT support from the sector. The technical
          assistance was based on a prior diagnostic of the needed institutional strengthening and adaptation
          to the requirements of the legal framework, but was then provided on a modular basis to fit the
          actual demand and institutional capacity of the individual entity. This flexibility, while needed,
          came with a higher cost for the technical assistance and made monitoring the quality and content
          of the individual technical assistance more challenging.

2.2.4     The government continued to show solid support to the reform process. But it was faced with
          difficult decisions when the original deadline for certification came close: either enforce the law
          and shut down access to financial services for millions of poor people, or allow for an extension
          of the deadline. It chose the latter, four times5 . Unfortunately, the extension of certification
          deadlines and changes to the regulatory and supervisory framework also removed the urgency for
          the sector to comply early on, and since the project provided technical assistance on a demand-
          basis, these changes contributed to a slower than expected overall project implementation. Also,
          the changes in the regulatory framework and certification process triggered additional technical
          assistance to assess the entities and adapt the action plans to the revised requirements. However,
          as indicated by the indicators, certification targets were eventually achieved.

2.2.5     The development of the IT platform experienced time and cost-overruns due to challenges in
          implementation (in great part due to the poor performance of a major IT supplier), but also to an
          important change in business strategy. The IT platform was expected to be ready for pilot testing
          in 2004 and fully ready by 2006. The platform was actually fully operational only in 2008. The
          second additional financing extended the support for operational expenses until 2012 to support
          the transition period needed for the implementation of the new business strategy until BANSEFI
          would be able to fully fund the IT platform on its own. Despite these implementation challenges,
          the IT platform is now being used at its maximum capacity, providing a wider than expected
          range of services and, by Project Closing Date, is profitable to the institution.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.2.6     The design of the monitoring and evaluation system was adequate. The specified key
          performance indicators were in line with the project development objective, and provided an
          adequate framework to measure progress and track performance of the individual components.
          The responsibility of monitoring the indicators and progress towards the expected outcomes was
          spread out over the respective departments within BANSEFI. As the objectives of the Project
          itself were consistent with BANSEFI’s overall mission, the institution was able to generate the
          needed data on the Project’s performance. Data on the financial performance of the overall sector
          itself, however, was difficult to obtain as the deadline for certification got postponed and no

5
 The deadline for transition to being certified was extended four times, from the initially foreseen June 2004 to now March 31,
2014. Furthermore, the legal and regulatory framework changed twice during the process. In 2007, higher thresholds for the
mandatory certification of SCI were introduced, which eliminated the need for certification of a number of smaller entities that
had already received project support for certification and were ready for transition. The thresholds were eventually revised in the
new legal framework, LRASCAP (2009), requiring again mandatory certification for a number of entities that had previously
been excluded.

                                                                8
         reliable data existed on the unsupervised entities6. Furthermore, the fact that two loans and up to
         three additional financings were on-going concurrently, and had similar performance indicators
         regarding the consolidation of the sector, made attribution challenging. Despite these challenges,
         the technical assistance team of BANSEFI was able to regularly generate/collect the indicators
         requested by the Results Framework.

2.2.7    The indicators fed into management’s strategic and implementation decisions. Indicators with
         quarterly targets were widely used by units in charge of the Project’s implementation and by the
         top management. This particularly applied to major indicators such as the number of institutions
         certified, the result of outreach efforts or the sustainability of the IT platform, while some of the
         intermediary output indicators were of more limited use.

2.3      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.3.1    Safeguard Compliance. As with the first BANSEFI (P070108) project, this operation was
         designed as technical assistance with Environmental Category C. Under the first BANSEFI
         Project, the Indigenous Peoples Safeguards Policy (OP 4.10) was triggered by outreach activities
         planned under Programa de Asistencia Técnica al Micro-financiamiento Rural (PATMIR). The
         latter targeted rural areas where indigenous people represented a large percentage of the
         population, and thus led to the preparation of an indigenous people planning framework as well
         as indigenous peoples plans for each region targeted. While PATMIR activities were not
         supported under this operation, a number of activities under Component 1 involved strengthening
         institutions in marginal areas, thus likely to include indigenous communities. Therefore, the
         World Bank’s safeguard on Indigenous People remained triggered, and the indigenous peoples
         planning framework agreed to under the first project applied. The institutions receiving support
         under Component 1 used the same indigenous people’s plans adopted for the first BANSEFI
         project.

2.3.2    The plans were implemented by the technical agents for PATMIR whose work continued for the
         duration of this operation. Activities implemented under the plans included tailored
         communication and consultation activities for clients from indigenous communities. Social
         development specialists participated in two separate supervision missions and found the
         implementation of the plans satisfactory, and in compliance with the provisions of OP 4.10.

2.3.3    Financial Management. Arrangements in terms of accounting, budgeting, flow of funds,
         internal control, external audit and financial reporting performed satisfactorily, and BANSEFI
         was able to provide reliable information required to manage and monitor project implementation,
         making extensive use of country systems.

2.3.4    Administrative staff within BANSEFI had ample experience managing Bank projects, FM
         departments were well staffed, and there was an adequate segregation of functions, including the
         financial agent department, whose responsibilities included managing the loan disbursement
         processes, and providing implementation support and oversight.




6
 The original intent was to obtain financial performance from CNBV upon certification of the sector. But as the certification
deadline was postponed, BANSEFI had to rely on less thorough information that was difficult to harmonize to monitor progress.

                                                             9
2.3.5   Project disbursement arrangements also functioned satisfactorily. Withdrawal applications were
        submitted generally on time using the reimbursement disbursement method, and contained
        accurate information.

2.3.6   External audit reports prepared throughout project life were issued with an unqualified opinion,
        delivered on time, and were considered acceptable to the Bank. Also, interim unaudited financial
        reports were normally issued on time, and were considered acceptable.

2.3.7   Procurement. Procurement activities for the implementation of the project have been sound and
        required intensive work from the implementation agency. Towards the end of the implementation
        period, communication and coordination issues emerged due to complex procurement packages
        and temporarily lowered the quality of procurement activities. These problems have since been
        addressed during the preparation and implementation of the follow-up operation. Overall,
        procurement is rated Satisfactory.

2.4     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

        As indicated in the lessons of the first Bansefi project, reforms that involve hundreds of
        heterogeneous institutions with bottom-up governance require long-term support and
        commitment. A follow-up Project (P123367) was approved on December 1, 2011, primarily to
        (i) provide a final range of technical assistance services for certification, (ii) scale up outreach
        activities (e.g., PATMIR, correspondent banking, dissemination/communication campaigns),
        (iii) replace the outdated mainframe/midrange equipment, and (iv) provide additional operational
        financing of the platform until BANSEFI takes over its financing in 2014. All activities have
        been streamlined into the operations of BANSEFI, ensuring their sustainability beyond Project
        Closing.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1   The objective of strengthening the savings and credit institutions in Mexico and of fostering
        financial inclusion of the population remains highly relevant. The government has a strong
        commitment to financial inclusion, and recently created a National Council for Financial
        Inclusion to coordinate reform efforts amongst government entities and implement a number of
        innovative reforms to foster financial inclusion. Its financial inclusion strategy places a strong
        focus on innovative delivery channels such as provided through BANSEFI’s evolving agent
        network in combination with its technological platform, and on further increasing the service
        points to provide access to financial services in all municipalities in Mexico. The SCIs, together
        with BANSEFI, have the largest branch network in the country, and play an important role for
        achieving this objective. The objectives and design of the project also continue to be well aligned
        with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The CPS for 2008-2013 had identified
        support to the financial sector as a strategic priority for the Bank in its dialogue with the
        government, and incorporates on-going support for BANSEFI to foster rural savings and finance.
        (See 2.5.1).




                                                    10
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (details on outputs in Annex 2):

3.2.1   The project has reached its development objectives: it has (i) considerably strengthened the SCIs
        and enhanced their sustainability, to the point where almost three quarters of the sector has now
        been certified and is under supervision; (ii) developed an IT platform used by over
        350 institutions and delivering a wide range of services to the beneficiaries and (iii) increased the
        outreach of the sector which, thanks to its stronger foundation, has increased from 4 to over
        19 million clients/members.

3.2.2   The project has led to a considerable strengthening of the sector and to an increased availability of
        financial services in rural and marginal areas. By the end of the project, about 74 percent of the
        assets and 72 percent of members were held in institutions that had received certification from the
        authorities, indicating that they are financially viable, operationally effective and managerially
        sound. The number, which already exceeds project target in terms of assets and members, is
        expected to further increase by the current legal deadline of March 31, 2014. The certified
        cooperatives have the second largest branch network in the country, with 1,155 branches as of
        December 2011 (~ 8 percent of total). As shown in the latest Financial Inclusion Report for
        Mexico7, they have a particularly strong presence in rural areas, where their branches account for
        over 65 percent of the demographic coverage of financial institutions.

3.2.3   As of project closing, the number of beneficiaries/clients of the sector and BANSEFI had also
        increased from 4 million in 2004 to close to 20 million8. The sector’s strengthening, combined
        with strong dissemination campaigns and the implementation of BANSEFI’s technology
        platform allowed to offer a wide range of financial services to both members and non-members
        of the sector (e.g. credit and savings, national and international remittances, micro-insurance, bill
        payments or the distribution of conditional cash transfers) and to reach out to new locations. It
        also provides a strong base for a continued increase of access to finance in otherwise unbanked
        areas of the country. BANSEFI received the prestigious 2012 United Nations Public Service
        Award for its work on financial inclusion.

Component 1: The project provided support to 417 institutions across the country. Its outcome is
rated as Satisfactory.

3.2.4   Component 1 aimed to support SCIs to become financially viable, meet the certification
        requirements of CNBV and to provide reliable financial services to the rural and marginal
        population throughout Mexico. Under the project, all of the 69 certified savings and credit
        cooperatives and most of the 43 certified Sociedades Financiera Popular (SOFIPOs) received
        technical assistance for institutional strengthening and to fulfill the requirements for certification.
        These authorized entities account for about three quarters of the sector’s size in terms of total
        assets and number of members/clients - a result that goes substantially beyond the original targets
        of 60 percent. Furthermore, another 103 project supported entities have by now been favorably
        classified by the auxiliary supervisory committee (CSA) regarding their overall suitability for
        certification, and have submitted their application for certification (as of September 2012). It is

 Including about 7 million Oportunidades beneficiaries which, through this project, also open a bank account. Even
without these 7 million beneficiaries, the project well exceeds its target of 9 million clients/members.

                                                       11
         currently expected that the total number of certified entities will reach 210 by the end of 2012,
         representing over 85 percent of the sector’s members and assets.

3.2.5    The evolution of the soundness of the sector is reflected in the below table. As can be seen, the
         data for entities classified as “A? moved from an initial 1 percent in December 2003 to 56 percent
         of June 20129 . Similar increases are evident in the B category, whereas the percentage of
         institutions classified as “C? or “D? decreases drastically.

              Table 5: CNBV Classification for Entities Either Authorized or in “Prórroga Condicionada?




3.2.6    The project also helped set up a deposit protection scheme for the sector. As foreseen in the
         LACP, support was initially provided at the federation and confederation level for the creation of
         deposit protection funds. Overall, ten funds were set up by individual federations, 3 of which
         under BANSEFI’s trusteeship. Following the passage of the Ley para Regular las Actividades de
         las Sociedades Cooperativas de Ahorro y Préstamo (LRASCAP) law, the deposit protection
         funds were merged into two, one for the cooperatives and one for the SOFIPOs. Both are under
         BANSEFI’s trusteeship.

Component 2: The IT platform has been fully implemented, and is now being used by 372 entities.
Performance under this component has been Satisfactory.

3.2.7    A modular IT platform comprising software, hardware, as well as a network and data center was
         implemented with project funds, and has been fully operational since 2008. The software
         components comprise a core banking system, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Card
         payments switch, risk management system, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) system and a few
         other applications. The IT platform is now used by 372 entities, including 84 entities10 that use
         the Core Banking platform and 287 entities that provide remittance and basic payment services
         via “L@Red de la Gente?. In addition, the platform has been customized to incorporate the
         Programa de Desarrollo Humano - Oportunidades payments to currently over 7 million
         beneficiaries. Overall, the platform has been instrumental for offering a wider range of financial
         services to over 17 million people, and in providing enhanced financial services to the otherwise

   This classification is provided by the Auxiliary Supervision Committee (CSA) and is based on a rigorous
assessment along pre-agreed standard including sustainability, governance, methodologies. An A rating is highest
and implies that the institution is certified or close to certification, while a D means that the institution is likely to be
merged or liquidated.

        unbanked population. It has also positioned the sector as providing state-of the art electronic
        payment services.

3.2.8   As indicated in the Project’s ISRs and the additional financing project papers, the IT platform
        strategy shifted considerably. The platform was initially supposed to provide basic management
        and reporting services to the sector, but eventually evolved into a more ambitious system that
        offered a wider range of financial instruments. The platform supports the operations of BANSEFI
        across all of its 494 branches and extensive card payments network, and benefits over 11 million
        BANSEFI customers. Given the large number of transactions conducted daily by BANSEFI, the
        platform is thus predominantly used by BANSEFI itself. In 2011, BANSEFI accounted for over
        97 percent of the usage of the platform. This change in strategy also affected the financing of the
        platform, with financial entities eventually contributing to a smaller share of the IT-related costs.

3.2.9   At project closing, there is now a credible plan for ongoing maintenance and financial self-
        sufficiency of the platform. The IT platform is currently working at full capacity, with the
        mainframe running at over 90 percent capacity. Funding for leasing a new mainframe for a
        14 month period has been allocated under the BANSEFI III project, after which BANSEFI has
        planned to support it on its own. A number of performance optimization measures were
        undertaken by the BANSEFI team which resulted in the average platform up-time increasing
        from 96.5 percent in 2009 to 98.07 percent in 2011.

Component 3: The project has developed extensive understanding of the market through its
survey work and has designed dissemination and training tools to modify the behavior on financial
management and savings. Outcome under this component is rated as satisfactory.

3.2.10 In its initial stages, the project supported the enhancement of household surveys and their
       methodology. The household panel surveys were conducted annually until 2007, and the results
       were used to define interventions to enhance the level of financial inclusion in marginalized areas.
       Several publications were also derived from it, and the studies mentioned in the latest financial
       inclusion report of the government. The surveys were eventually discontinued due to attrition of
       the sample and endogeneity issues. Additional studies, initially planned under this project, were
       eventually financed out of the first BANSEFI operation and reported on in its ICR.

3.2.11 With project support, BANSEFI’s Social Communication Department also implemented a
       number of outreach activities to establish “L@Red de la Gente? as a reliable brand for remittance,
       micro-insurance and other services, and to enhance the population’s overall level of financial
       education. In particular, it designed and aired since 2008 TV and Radio spots in Mexico and
       selected remittance corridors in the US, and incorporated information on the use and benefits of
       products and services of “L@Red de la Gente? into one hour long thematic TV programs.
       Furthermore, since 2009, mobile units (so-called “Caravanas?) provided more than 60,000 people
       in around 500 localities across the country with face-to-face information on available financial
       services via “L@Red de la Gente? and its participating financial entities. The Caravanas also
       carried out half-hour long training modules on financial education, reaching around
       20,000 participants. BANSEFI has also provided innovative financial education modules on its
       website (www.finanzasparatodos.org.mx), and its financial education programs are the first (and
       so far only) to be formally recognized by the Education Ministry. Finally, BANSEFI has
       promoted its financial products and financial education initiatives through its presence on social
       network such as Facebook and Twitter, allowing for a direct link with a wider and usually
       younger target population. Overall, the campaigns have been very innovative and well-targeted.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1      Due to the methodological challenge of attributing investments in TA and IT to incremental
           changes in cash flows, the efficiency and financial sustainability of the project is assessed through
           various proxy indicators as was done for similar projects in India (Strengthening India’s Rural
           Credit Cooperatives – P102768) and Russia (Microfinance Project – P095554). These indicators
           show substantial efficiency gains and incremental cash flows that justify investment costs and
           point towards financial sustainability in addition to numerous non-quantifiable economic benefits.
           Project benefits are assessed for SCIs, BANSEFI, clients and government finances11.

3.3.2      Impact on the SCIs Sector: the provided TA and IT infrastructure have contributed to
           enhancing the overall performance of the SCI sector. The resulting enhanced soundness,
           reputation and increased reliability of the sector led to an increase in the number of SCI clients
           from 2.9 million in 2003 to currently 8.6 million. Over the same period, total assets grew from
           USD19.7 million to USD90.9 million and deposits from USD15.2 million to USD70.1 million.
           Increases in assets and deposits are likely to have generated positive effects on the profits of the
           sector. In addition, the IT platform enabled 287 SCIs to offer remittance services to members and
           non-members, (through L@ Red de la Gente), generating additional cumulative gross income
           of USD3.8 million for participating SCIs between January 2007 and August 2012.

3.3.3      Impact on BANSEFI: project investments endowed BANSEFI with a technological platform
           that links all its branches and agent network together, provides IT banking services to
           372 financial institutions and distributes government transfer payments (Oportunidades) to over
           7 million beneficiaries via card based electronic payments. These electronic payments represent a
           great leap forward by providing a bank account to these 7 million beneficiaries, following the
           Government’s decision to move its transfer payments to an electronic system, decreasing overall
           transaction costs and reducing processing losses. The platform has been instrumental for
           BANSEFI in introducing correspondent banking and scaling-up its service points via non-bank
           agents and its use of electronic transfer for the delivery of government transfer programs. The
           gross margin from revenues generated by the distribution of the Oportunidades transfers alone
           (MX$ 556 million or approximately USD44.5 million in 2011) covered the total operating and
           maintenance costs of the platform (MX$ 456 million, equivalent to USD36.5 million). Platform
           costs are expected to stabilize around MX$ 310 million (approximately USD25 million) starting
           in 2014. In addition, other recently introduced ground-breaking technology-based services such
           as mobile phone banking, electronic bill payment and other correspondent banking applications
           have been tested, the infrastructure has been set and these services should gradually generate
           additional revenues to support platform costs and contribute to BANSEFI’s overall results.
           Financial projections show that BANSEFI should be able to assume the full cost of the platform
           starting in 2014.

3.3.4      Fiscal Impact: by enhancing access to financial services for households and enterprises, the
           project has contributed to increased tax revenues from financial institutions and the economic
           activities generated by their growing operations. These are likely to outweigh and exceed
           investments in TA and the IT platform on the medium term. Other efficiency gains for the
           Government have been produced by the IT platform utilization for the payment of Oportunidades


11
     For more on Efficiency, see Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

                                                        14
        transfers. Using an estimate of MX$ 75 saved per beneficiary/year, it is possible to estimate
        Government’s savings in about USD36.9 million for 2011 alone.

3.3.5   Impact on clients: clients in rural and marginalized areas have obtained increased access to
        reliable financial institutions. In addition, they have benefited from the reduced financial
        transaction costs due to BANSEFI’s IT platform. Examples of these gains are savings related to
        international remittances operated through L@Red de la Gente (estimated to range around
        MX$ 15 per transaction, or USD850,000 for 2011 alone) and savings in terms of traveling costs
        and time for recipients of Oportunidades payments. Additionally millions of people now have
        access to credit with rates of 10-20 percent per annum, much less than moneylenders or large
        microfinance institutions often charge (up to 90 percent per annum).

3.3.6   Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return. As detailed in Annex 3, this ICR calculated
        the NPV and IRR of the Project for the IT-related costs, which account for 71.1 percent of World
        Bank funding and 74 percent of total project costs. The analysis covers various conservative
        scenarios of future growth of the services and their cost for the next five years and calculates a
        substantial NPV ranging from US$59 million to US$123 million and an IRR ranging from
        18.87 percent to 24.45 percent, depending on the scenario. While a calculation of the NPV and
        IRR was not possible for the remaining 26 percent of total project costs, outcome for these
        26 percent was well above targets (outreach of financial services 118 percent above target and
        improvement of the sustainability of the sector 23 percent above target), suggesting that the
        overall efficiency of the project was substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

3.4.1   Rating: Satisfactory. The Project continues to be highly relevant for the Government’s reform
        strategy and the Bank’s overall country support. It has reached its Project Development
        Objectives by strengthening the viability and efficiency of the sector and expanding the sector’s
        outreach and financial products. This provides a strong base for a continued and sound growth of
        the sector, and has particularly benefitted clients in rural and marginalized areas. BANSEFI is
        expected to reach sustainability by 2014. As discussed above, the overall efficiency of the
        provided support has been adequate. All together, the overall outcome rating is therefore
        Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1   A number of activities supported under this operation involved strengthening institutions in areas
        of very high to medium marginality (with populations of less than 15,000), and thus had an
        indirect positive effect on financial service provision to poor households. These efforts
        complemented the financial inclusion work supported under PATMIR II. The majority of new
        clients (66 percent) added during the period of project implementation (2005 – 2012) were
        clustered in the poorest 10 States of Mexico. These states, and the marginal communities within
        them targeted by the project, also have the largest numbers of indigenous people in Mexico. The
        proportion of new clients enrolled during this period from indigenous communities (22 percent)
        was over double the percentage of this population nationwide. Women clients, who often take a
        lead in household saving, represented an important beneficiary of institutional strengthening
        efforts, and accounted for 56 percent of new clients during this period. It is therefore clear that the
                                                     15
        project has built on the continuing efforts of PATMIR by contributing to increasing the provision
        of financial services by sound financial entities to low income women from the most marginal
        municipalities (the majority of new clients), as well as people from indigenous communities who
        are over-represented as new clients in comparison to their numbers nationwide.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2   The SCI sector has been considerably strengthened as a result of the project. The sector was able
        to upgrade its financial, managerial and governance performance through the received technical
        assistance, leading to the overwhelming majority of the sector being able to obtain certification
        from the authorities. It has also grown professionally and technologically by being able to provide
        a wider range of services to its clients, from the original “savings and credit only? to remittances,
        bill paying, micro-insurance, distribution of conditional cash transfers and others. This
        transformation has been critical to the increase of membership from 4 to about 9 million members
        since the start of the project. Additional support to recently certified institutions will continue to
        be provided through the follow-up Project to solidify the achieved results.

3.5.3   With over 11 million clients, BANSEFI has also grown into a much more sophisticated and
        better performing institution. With project support, it modernized and diversified its products
        through the adoption of the IT platform and provided a broad range of support to the sector. This
        has required the hiring of top professionals to help gear BANSEFI through this change. The
        institutional change is not completely over, however. The new administration (under the Peña
        Nieto Government) will have to decide on a new medium-to-long term strategy, decide on the
        future set-up of the technology platform, further its efforts towards best practice in cost
        accounting and continue to diversify its sources of income.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: The Risk to Development Objectives is considered moderate.

4.1     There is now a significant share of the SCI sector (in terms of assets and members) that has
        received or is expected to be ready to obtain certification by March 2014. Thus, although only a
        limited number of liquidations and mergers have been carried out so far, the achieved institutional
        strengthening of the entities has reached the critical mass to sustain the reform momentum on the
        longer term.

4.2     Nevertheless, risks to sustainability of the sector’s strengthening remain:

       The Calderón administration had consistently confirmed its intent to adhere to implementing the
        deadline for certification of December 2012, and to follow through on the needed consolidation
        of the sector to wrap up the reform process. Nevertheless, there are still a relatively large number
        of smaller institutions that have not yet started the certification process or are unlikely to obtain
        certification, and the Mexican Congress voted, on December 21, 2012, to extend the deadline yet
        a fourth time to March 2014. This may lead to additional delays with the certification process, but
        at the same time will provide time for the CNBV to establish a plan for the orderly exit of
        institutions that are unable to get certified. The likelihood of this risk is therefore considered low,
        although its potential impact is high. The follow-up Bank project (P123367) will also continue to
        assist the sector throughout this process.

                                                     16
       BANSEFI itself has become an important player in the field of access to finance and is a key
        source of support to the sector. It has done so by providing services which are in demand, and
        developing a large network of branches and strategic partnerships with a wide range of public and
        private actors. It is continuously developing new products and services. It is expected that
        BANSEFI will reach sustainability by 2014. However, a few risks to development (also with a
        low likelihood but high impact) were identified:

             The conditional cash transfers program Oportunidades has become an increasingly large
              share of revenues for BANSEFI (63 percent by the end of 2011). While this ICR is
              comfortable that BANSEFI is able to provide these distribution services to the Government
              at a cost lower than the private sector would, it is not clear whether the government will
              always continue to pay a similar commission for these services. To protect its position,
              BANSEFI will therefore need to diversify its sources of income. It is currently already
              trying to do this with services such as the expansion of the correspondent banking or the
              gradual introduction of credit lines.

             The new administration may decide to change the strategy of the institution.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

1.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

1.1.1   Rating: Satisfactory. This project is part of a long-term engagement in Mexico to reform the
        sector and increase access to finance, particularly in rural and marginal areas. The project was
        designed based on the Government’s priorities, considerable research and due diligence to meet
        successfully these reform and access goals. It was also built on findings of the first project, such
        as its extensive diagnostic work, and was able to work with a strong implementing partner with
        proper fiduciary capacity. As mentioned above, the project may have underestimated some of the
        challenges in reforming and providing a common IT platform to a heterogeneous financial sector
        made up of many small institutions with bottom-up governance in hindsight, but this issue was
        eventually solved with additional financing.

(b) Quality of Supervision

1.1.2   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The supervision team was consistently responsive to requests
        from the implementation agency and was able to provide strong technical and strategic
        recommendations. It also worked in close cooperation with the client to find appropriate and
        efficient procurement solutions to often complex problems. A more regular reporting on the full
        set of indicators in the ISRs and a more formal reporting on the change in strategy for the IT
        platform would have been preferred, and an implementation rating during the early years of
        implementation, particularly for the IT platform, seem to have been overly generous (the IT
        platform was not downgraded from satisfactory, even during the major delays in 2006-2008).
        However, the team was able to respond to a constantly changing environment through its close



                                                    17
        cooperation with the Borrower and by preparing two additional financing when it became clear
        that additional support would be required.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

1.1.3   As the Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is Satisfactory and the Quality of
        Supervision is Moderately Satisfactory, the overall rating for Bank Performance is Moderately
        Satisfactory.

1.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

1.2.1   The Government commitment was strong from the start of the project and continued thereafter.
        Passage of the LACP law, as promised, showed the government’s determination to overhaul the
        SCI sector, and adequate budgetary allocations were made to the implementation agency
        throughout the project implementation period. It faced difficult political choices when it was clear
        that the sector would not be ready for certification by the original deadline and had to make
        changes to the regulatory environment in light of pressures by the sector. But overall, the
        Government was able to provide all the logistical and financial support required by the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

1.2.2   The Project team at BANSEFI provided strong leadership, ownership and direction to the Project.
        It remained consistently staffed with highly motivated and professional staff, which, apart from
        delays in the IT platform implementation, was able to deliver systematically on the annual action
        plan. The low turnaround allowed for continuity in the overall institutional strategy and
        implementation of the project and familiarity with World Bank procedures.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

1.2.3   As the sustained effort of the Implementation Agency has been instrumental in reaching the
        PDOs, and the government’s overall commitment was strong, the rating for Borrower
        Performance is considered to have been satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 Lessons learned from this project cannot be dissociated from lessons learned from the first
    project which ran in parallel:

6.1.1   A technical assistance effort focused on improving a hitherto unregulated and unsupervised rural
        financial sector has to be a medium-to-long term initiative to produce solid institutions.
        Additional time is in particular needed when the sector is composed of a range of entities with
        varying sizes, levels of development and acceptance related to accounting, reporting,
        management and monitoring, internal controls, governance and other aspects. Financial
        cooperatives furthermore usually have a strong social and political base, making reforms more

                                                    18
        difficult and complex. Thanks to its long-term engagement since 2002, the Bank has been able to
        accompany the sector through the reform process, adapt its approach to the evolution of the sector
        and its legal framework and ensure high level of sustainability and outreach.

6.1.2   Governments should allow for a longer lead time for the entities to get certified and encompassed
        under a regulatory framework. Invariably, there is an optimistic expectation that the hitherto
        unregulated entities would be able and willing to comply with the requirements of the new law
        with ease and in a relatively short period of time. The original law in Mexico expected this to
        happen in two years. Similar efforts by governments such as Romania, Paraguay or India, who
        embarked on this type of reform, however confirm that they take considerably longer and need a
        sustained effort. The resulting postponements of the deadlines for compliance invariably lead to
        the law losing credibility, or entities operating in violation of the law.

6.1.3   Because of its innovative nature and the lack of previous evidence from other countries, the exact
        time/effort that would have been required for the sector to be reformed could not be anticipated
        with precision. As mentioned above, such projects must work within a medium to long-term
        strategy, which single investment loans are typically not designed for. The experience from
        Mexico and countries such as India or Russia could suggest that in the future, such projects may
        benefit from more flexible instruments such as Adaptable Program Loans or Program-for-
        Results.

6.1.4   Where the sector consists of a large number of initially poorly performing entities, which most
        likely need to be merged or liquidated, the political ramifications emanating from liquidation
        could easily jeopardize the sector consolidation process. For a successful implementation,
        incentives for mergers and consolidation need to be set, a contingency plan developed that buffers
        the impact of the consolidation, and the government agency in charge endowed with a full legal
        mandate to carry out the consolidation. As shown, the use of internationally reputed consultants
        could impart transparency and credibility to the process.

6.1.5   The complexity of designing and implementing a technology platform that serves a
        heterogeneous industry and generates sufficient revenue to be sustainable cannot be
        underestimated. Cross-subsidies can be considered, but need to be done in a transparent manner
        in the nature of a public good with the objective of financial inclusion of some of the poorest
        sections of the population.

6.1.6   In order to reach low-income households where literacy rates are low and functional literacy is
        practically nonexistent, efforts need to be made in the area of social intermediation. Awareness
        raising and assistance at the community level are essential to improve the likelihood of successful
        access to and use of rural financial services.

6.1.7   The three Bansefi projects, which overlap over time and have similar objectives, are good
        examples of projects that would benefit from a holistic evaluation, rather than individual ones.
        Such a holistic approach would not only assess the overall strategy and the projects’
        accomplishments towards this strategy, but would also reduce the attribution problems,
        particularly related to the economic and financial analysis.

Annex 2.      Outputs by Component

Component 1: Strengthening the SCI sector

       The main objective of Component 1 of the Project was to help SCIs (Savings and Credit
Institutions) meet the legal and regulatory requirements under two laws: LACP in 2001 and
LRASCAP in 2009. It also aimed to strengthen the sector’s capacity of providing reliable financial
services to the rural and marginal population throughout Mexico. To achieve this objective, BANSEFI
implemented a series of activities mainly consisting of training and technical assistance that were
provided following specific agreement with the different entities. Tailored interventions for each
institution were designed to satisfy the specific needs highlighted by diagnostic exercises carried out
throughout the Project. The technical assistance and training was directly provided by recognized national
and international consulting firms that had been pre-selected by BANSEFI.

       The results achieved under component 1 are fully satisfactory. The project aimed to help
365 SCIs reach certification or be merged/liquidated, equivalent to around 60 percent of the sector’s
estimated 600 entities and representing the same percentage in terms of assets and membership. However,
in the meantime, the structure of the sector changed with new entities entering the markets, others closing
or merging. Furthermore, the legal requirements and thresholds for certification changed several times,
with the deadline for certification alone being postponed four times (in 2005, 2007, 2012 and now 2014)
by the authorities. These frequent changes did not provide an incentive for the institutions to actually
request certification.

                                                 Table 1




                                                    23
       Despite this constantly moving target and the changing legal environment, 112 entities
(69 Savings and Credit Cooperatives and 43 Popular Financial Companies or “SOFIPOs?) were
certified by Project Closing Date, representing 74 percent of sector assets and 72 percent of its
membership. This is well above the original target of 60 percent. An additional 112 institutions have
submitted their application either to the Supervisory Committee or the CNBV in order to meet the
deadline. Were all institutions that submitted their applications to obtain certification, up to 85 percent of
the sector’s assets and members would be served by certified institutions.

       Even among entities that have not yet reached certification or that are no longer required to
obtain it14, the performance has improved considerably. Altogether, 417 institutions were evaluated
to determine weaknesses, and received support in the form of institutional strengthening plans and/or
targeted technical assistance on a wide range of issues to strengthen their operations. The technical
assistance covered topics such as financial management, product development, asset liability
management, or governance.

      The evaluation criteria, which have been established by the Comité de Supervisión Auxiliar
in close collaboration with the CNBV, aim to get a solid overview over the financial situation of
each cooperative, the internal control mechanisms in place, as well as the adequacy of the information
systems. Indicators for the classification of the cooperatives into Category A to D include for example
indicators for risk adjusted capital, the level of non-performing loans, the quality of the internal credit
evaluation processes and accounting practices, and internal risk management systems in place. The
overall financial situation of the entities makes up 70 percent of the overall assessment, with the internal
structures covering the remaining 30 percent. The full system of evaluation and classification can be
found under www.focoop.com.mx.

       Category A comprised those entities that already meet the criteria for certification by the
CNBV, while Category B SCAPs are overall considered to be of solid standing, but need to
implement an action plan to fully meet the requirements for becoming certified. The entities
classified as C and D are not considered viable on the longer term or need substantial internal reforms to
meet certification requirements, and thus are suggested for mergers or liquidations. The table below
reflects the considerable improvements achieved during project implementation. At project appraisal,
only 1 percent of institutions were classified as “A or Certified? (the highest rating) compared with
56 percent of institutions at Project Closing. In the same way, the share of institutions classified as “C? or
“D? (lowest rating) dropped drastically from 80 percent in 2003 to just 7.3 percent in June 2012.

       It is worth mentioning that while this Project was working on strengthening the sector, an
additional technical assistance program called PATMIR (Program for Rural Microfinance
Technical Assistance), aimed at increasing the outreach of basic financial services in rural and
marginalized communities. PATMIR was run in parallel and financed by the first BANSEFI
project. The performance of this PATMIR operation was reviewed in a separate ICR (Project P070108,
ICR dated November 4, 2011). Both the project under review in this ICR and PATMIR worked hand in
hand, however. PATMIR alone increased membership in marginal rural areas by over 600,000 members.
The SCI membership itself increased from 4 million to about 8.6 million members during the same
period and the number of BANSEFI clients evolved from about 3 million in 2004 to 11.1 million at the
end of 2011. Efforts have been initiated under BANSEFI III (P123367, approved on December 1, 2011)
to continue (i) the Technical Assistance effort to entities that want to obtain certification and help
institutions that need to be either liquidated or merged to ensure an orderly process; and (ii) the PATMIR
effort through the sector’s strongest institutions and enhance outreach by at least 825,000 members.

Component 2: Developing an IT Platform

      At completion, the IT platform has been fully implemented. A modular IT platform comprising
of software, hardware, network and data center was implemented and has been fully operational since
2008. The software components comprise a core banking system, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP),
Card payments switch, risk management system, Anti Money Laundering (AML) system and a few other
miscellaneous applications.

       The platform eventually witnessed a shift in business strategy. The original IT strategy called
for the platform to be predominantly used by the sector (financial entities) with some use by BANSEFI.
The platform was scheduled to be implemented in 4 pilot entities by 2004, financed under the previous
BANSEFI project financed by the World Bank. However, implementation got delayed by around 2 years
because of a long consultative processes and additional time needed to finalize and implement the
concept. As recorded in the ISRs in the period 2006-2008, this resulted in many of the large SCIs losing
interest in using the platform and ending up developing their own systems. This led to a shift in the
strategy of the platform as highlighted in the second additional financing documents: Instead of an SCI
entity-centric system financed through usage fees paid by the sector, BANSEFI expanded its own use of
the platform dramatically and introduced a large number of additional services. The latter were available
to all interested SCI and BANSEFI’s other private and public partners such as the Diconsa community
stores. In 2011, BANSEFI accounted for over 97 percent of the usage of the platform. The platform is
now the backbone of BANSEFI’s operation and supports the operations of BANSEFI across all its 494
branches, its extensive card payments network and over 11 million customers.

      The platform continues to be marketed to the sector and is being used by 372 entities (vs. a
target of 100), including 84 sector entities that use the Core Banking platform and provides a wide
range of services to over 17 million people. In addition, the platform has been customized to offer
additional services for Oportunidades payments and development of a remittances and payment services
network – L@Red de la Gente. The platform now supports 7 million Oportunidades beneficiaries and
287 institutions under the L@Red de La Gente. However, most of these entities either are small and/or
use only specific services provided by the IT platform and hence their utilization of the platform is much
lower than that of BANSEFI.

      As of the end of 2011, BANSEFI accounted for 18 percent of debit cards used in Mexico, and,
together with L@Red de la Gente, represents 21 percent of the country’s financial sector in terms
of financial service points. Tables 5-14 below summarize the key statistics related to this. A number of
other additional services now available are described in table 15.

                                                           the Oportunidades service, the products
                                                           offered through the L@Red de la Gente and
                                                           financial services provided by the
                                                           correspondent banking agents. The core
                                                           banking module and the card payment platform
                                                           are extensively used in the provision of
                                                           Oportunidades. A regular savings account is
                                                           opened in BANSEFI and a debit card (attached
                                                           to the account) issued for all the Oportunidades
                                                           beneficiaries. These accounts are maintained in
the core banking module. The beneficiaries use their debit card at the Oportunidades disbursement
locations to authenticate themselves via biometric information pre-recorded in the integrated circuit (IC)
chip on the card. The authorization request is sent to the card payment platform and from there to the core
banking platform. About a third of the beneficiaries can also use their cards as debit cards at all ATMs
and POS terminals in Mexico. The revenues from the Oportunidades service are over MX$ 1.1 billion for
2011 alone. The L@Red de La Gente network brings together participating SCIs as an integrated service
delivery platform for remittances, micro-insurance and bill payments. A separate application has been
developed for this service. The core banking system is used to hold the settlement accounts of all the
participating entities. The communication network used for this network is the same as that used for the
other components of the platform and the participating SCIs also have the option of using other platform
services. Finally, the correspondent banking, while primarily at the pilot stage under this project and to be
scaled up during the next project, provides through Diconsa community stores or other partners such as
Pemex gas stations basic financial services such as Oportunidades disbursements, account balance
information, bill payments or cash withdrawals.

       The development of the IT platform experienced time and cost-overruns due to challenges in
implementation and the change in business strategy. The IT platform was expected to be ready for
pilot testing in 2004 and fully ready by 2006. The platform was actually fully implemented only in 2008.
During the course of the project there were two additional financing which included allocations for this
project component. The first additional financing covered the following: (i) to finance cost-overruns in the
implementation due to discovery of additional complexities in the required functionality;
(ii) implementation of additional modules; (iii) change in system architecture from three-tier to two-tier to
enable faster deployment; and, (iv) financing operational expenses for an additional two years because of
the implementation delays. The second additional financing was to extend the support for operational
expenses until 2012 to support the transition period needed for the implementation of the new business
strategy until BANSEFI was able to fully fund the IT platform on its own.

      The IT platform has evolved over the course of the project to meet the evolving business
needs. There were over 12,000 change requests handled for the software components. The Oportunidades
and Core Banking related changes accounted for roughly 15 percent each and changes to reporting
modules over 13 percent. The hardware platform shifted from predominantly mainframe centric to a
mixed Unix and Mainframe platform. This shift was necessitated by a change in the transaction profile
from one expected to be based on servicing a broad range of banking products across SCI clients to one
focused on high number of online transactions.

       The platform efficiency compares well with peers. The BANSEFI team has compared their IT
infrastructure with peers such as large commercial banks, Finrural, Nafin and Banco Azteca on aspects
such as data center space used, number of servers and mainframe capacity, and concluded that it
compares well. These figures are summarized in the below Table 17. The mainframe is currently running

at over 90 percent capacity utilization and is also no longer being supported by the vendor, hence
requiring a new upgrade, to be financed with support from the follow-up project.

      The BANSEFI team has developed an effective plan for upgrading and sustaining the IT
platform in the period 2014-18. The IT platform is currently working at full capacity and is past the end
of a typical IT replacement cycle in the banking industry. Funding for leasing a new mainframe for a
14 month period has been allocated under the BANSEFI III project, after which BANSEFI has planned
to support it on its own. The core banking platform version is of year 2003 and the current version being
offered in the market is of year 2010. A number of performance optimization measures were undertaken
by the BANSEFI team which resulted in the average platform up-time increasing from 96.5 percent in
2009 to 98.07 percent in 2011. The BANSEFI has prepared a plan for upgrading the platform using a
combination of long-term maintenance contracts with the solution vendors and an integrated data center
contract covering hardware leasing, operations support and licensing of software components. This
approach would allow for seamless upgrades to new versions and rapid addition on processing capacity
and data storage. The average annual platform related expenses in the period 2014-18 is projected to be
around USD25 million.

       It is clear that the IT platform is generating more revenues than it costs. Its sustainability and
that of BANSEFI in general, is of high priority to BANSEFI Management and the current forecasts show
promising trends. The data provided for this ICR indicate that, as of today, the overall revenues generated
by the various services provided through the platform exceed the cost of the platform itself (acquisition
and operation). As mentioned above, gross revenues generated from Oportunidades alone represented
about US$85 million in 2011 while the total BANSEFI IT costs represented about US$35 million for the
same year. Fairly conservative financial forecasts also show that, as of 2014, all costs related to the IT
Platform can be fully borne by BANSEFI.

       As discussed above, the IT platform has evolved from a platform intended to be used mainly
by the industry, to one where it is predominantly used for BANSEFI’s own operations with some
usage by the industry. This change had BANSEFI revisit the business model used for measuring and
financing the ongoing sustainability of the IT platform. Nevertheless, it needs to be acknowledged that in
addition to the benefits to BANSEFI, the platform contributes to a number of broad national goals
including financial inclusion, and greater efficiencies of Government social payments. These need to be
also included in the sustainability analysis.

      BANSEFI is also working on reviewing its accounting system to better determine the
sustainability of each product/service it offers. This is an important step towards a more strategic
business model which the Mission supports. It also increases transparency in properly identifying cross-
subsidies for management evaluation.

Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation, Studies and Information Dissemination

       With project support, the BANSEFI team implemented a number of outreach activities and
established “L@Red de la Gente? as a reliable brand for remittance, micro-insurance and other
services, and to enhance the population’s overall level of financial education. In particular, it designed and
aired since 2008 TV and Radio spots in Mexico and selected remittance corridors in the US, and
incorporated information on the use and benefits of products and services of “L@Red de la Gente? into
one hour long thematic TV programs. Furthermore, since 2009, mobile units (so-called “Caravanas?)
provided more than 60,000 people in around 500 localities across the country with face-to-face
information on available financial services via “L@Red de la Gente? and its participating financial
entities, and carried out half-hour long training modules on financial education to around 20,000
participants. BANSEFI has also provided innovative financial education modules on its website
(www.finanzasparatodos.org.mx), and its financial education programs are the first (and so far only) to be
formally recognized by the Education Ministry. Finally, BANSEFI has promoted its financial products
and its financial education initiatives through its constant presence on social network such as Facebook
and Twitter, allowing for a direct link with a wider and usually younger target population. Overall, the
campaigns have been very innovative and well-targeted.

       Rigorous evaluations of the communication campaigns have been planned for the coming
year, but the results achieved so far by the promoted products allow for their positive indirect
evaluation. As an example, despite the economic crisis in the USA after 2008, which caused an overall
reduction in the international remittances flows, the transfers channeled through “L@Red de la Gente?
increased from 604,140 in 2008 to 732,068 in 2011 (+21 percent), with the transferred amount showing
an increase of 25 percent in the same timeframe (reaching now USD286 million). The financial education
webpage of BANSEFI has now been visited by over 40,000 users from 10 different countries, with the
average time spent by each user on the webpage having increased from 3 to 6 minutes. Finally,
Microinsurance, a more difficult product to introduce into the market due to the usual lack of familiarity
of the target population with using insurance for risk management, has now been sold 3,187 times.

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis

       The financial and economic analysis of technical assistance projects is particularly challenging due
to problems of attribution, spill-over effects, and in this particular case, the fact that five loans were being
implemented concurrently and the lack of financial flows directly attributable to the investment.
However, it can be stated that the effects of the TA have contributed to enhancing the overall
performance of the SCI Sector. Increased reliability of the Sector led to an increase in the number of
clients of SCIs from 2.9 million in 2003 to 7.5 million in 2011. Over the same period, total assets grew
from USD19.7 million to USD90.9 million and deposits from USD15.2 million to USD70.1 million.
Increases in assets and deposits are likely to have generated positive effects on the profits of the Sector.
The TA Component, by enhancing access to financial services for households and enterprises, has
contributed to increased tax revenues from financial institutions and the economic activities generated by
their growing operations.

       The rest of the analysis will focus on the efficiency and sustainability of the investments made in
the IT platform (which represents over 74 percent of Bank funds) in technical, economic and financial
terms. This will be complemented by a qualitative assessment of the financial and economic impacts at
the institutional and client levels. A similar economic/financial analysis was used for comparable projects
such as Strengthening India’s Rural Credit Cooperatives (P102768) and Russia Microfinance (P095554).

      The financial analysis in the Project Appraisal Documents (PAD) and the two additional financings
focused on the information technology platform (component 2) which accounted for 71.1 percent of total
WB financing (including the first and second phase projects18). The financial analysis estimated the
incremental cash flows at the level of the SCIs as well as at the level of the IT Business Unit at
BANFSEFI, which were then aggregated at project level. At SCI level, an incremental cash flow of
USD195 million was estimated over a seven-year period (2004 - 10). At the level of the IT Business Unit,
a cumulative surplus of USD3.24 million was projected. The second additional financing estimated a
cumulative incremental cash flow of USD 500.1 million for SCIs and BANSEFI branches, and of
USD36.5 million for the IT Business Unit from 2008 through 202019.

       The change in the business model of the IT platform during project implementation has important
implications for analyzing its economic and financial costs and benefits. The approach taken in the
original PAD was consistent with a fairly straightforward business model that envisaged the SCIs to be
the main users of the platform and eventually paying the full costs of services. Hence, the IT business unit
was expected to become financially self-sufficient through user fees once the IT system was at a stable
state and adopted by approximately half of the certified sector institutions (approximately 100 SCIs).
However, the adoption of the platform followed a different path from the original strategy. By 2008, only
21 SCIs and 7 other financial institutions had adopted the BANSEFI core banking system while over
370 institutions, well-above targets, had adopted distinct modules of the platform. Although BANSEFI
became the main user of the platform, providing ancillary IT services to SCIs and microfinance
institutions, the platform was able to provide a wide range of services to the sector and to serve broad
national goals of financial inclusion, e.g., by expanding remittances and other financial services at low
costs through L@Red de la Gente and through correspondent banking. It also allowed BANSEFI to step

   USD110.19 million out of a total of USD154.1 million financed by the initial loan and the two additional
financings.

   Key assumptions underlying these predictions such as the roll out of the platform to SCIs, the number of entities
participating each year, the number and amounts of additional transactions per institution and year as well as the
gross margin per transaction are not provided in the respective annex and could not be retrieved from the project
files.

up its participation in the payment of the Oportunidades program on a large scale since 2011. This
analysis therefore looks at the revenues these IT services have generated and the considerable savings
they have yielded to the institution and to the Government.

       In view of the difficulties to quantify net financial benefits of existing operations, the analysis was
limited to incremental revenues for additional services attributed more directly to the adoption of the
technology platform and the related network functionalities: the ability of BANSEFI to expand and the
SCIs to participate in payments of government fiscal transfer programs (Oportunidades, Procampo) and
in national and international remittances.

       a) Benefits for BANSEFI

      Due to the changed use of the platform, its financial viability can no longer be assessed as an
independent unit but as an integral part of BANSEFI operations. This makes the task more complex due
to the difficulties of quantifying the platform’s specific contributions to reducing operational costs and
expanding the range and quality of products and services.

       The IT platform has enabled BANSEFI to dramatically expand fee-generating services at low costs.
While it is difficult to quantify the contribution of the platform to reduce operational costs and enhance
revenues of existing products and services, the introduction and expansion of certain new products can be
attributed more directly to it. For example, the platform has been instrumental for BANSEFI in
introducing correspondent banking and scaling-up its service points via non-bank agents and its use of
electronic transfer for the delivery of government transfer programs. In the third bimester 2012,
5.7 million payments were made through debit and prepaid cards for a total amount of MX$ 9.4 billion.
Non-bank agents now include around 7,000 Diconsa stores, 400 Telecomm/Telégrafos offices, 499 SCI
branches, 196 BANSEFI branches and 5 Pemex gas stations. To enhance the safety of handling larger
amounts of cash, BANSEFI provided some support to selected Diconsa stores and warehouses (that
support the cash handling) to install security systems.

      The platform has also allowed BANSEFI to further increase its usage of Diconsa stores for
providing its clients with deposit, withdrawal, bill payment20 and balance inquiry services. This alliance
has a considerable potential for increasing the financial inclusion in remote areas, as Diconsa is mostly
present in locations with less than 2,500 inhabitants. The use of Diconsa stores for the delivery of a
broader range of financial services was initially piloted in 18 stores, but has in the meantime been scaled
up to over 200 Diconsa stores in 19 states and 165 municipalities. BANSEFI aims to increase this number
over the next three years to 2000, thus reaching a national coverage with financial services. Furthermore,
BANSEFI is exploring options to include in its agent-network other nationwide chains such as Bimbo
(baking goods), Construrama, and ANTAD (National Association of supermarkets and conveniences).
The introduction of mobile phone banking is planned for 2013.

      The gross-margin from Oportunidades payments largely covers the operational and maintenance
costs of the platform. The transfer of the government conditional cash transfers to BANSEFI’s
technology platform has boosted BANSEFI’s operational income since 2009. According to BANSEFI’s
cost accounting system introduced in 2011, Oportunidades payments accounted for 82 percent of the
banks operating profits (operating income minus direct costs except for IT) during that year, amounting to
MX$ 556 million (approximately USD44.5 million21). The gross margin from these payments exceeds

the total operating and maintenance costs of the platform which amounted to MX$ 456 million
(equivalent to USD36.5 million) in 2011 and are expected to stabilize around MX$ 310 million
(approximately USD25 million) starting in 2014. In addition, other recently introduced technology-based
services such as mobile phone banking, electronic bill payment and other correspondent banking
applications will gradually generate additional revenues to support platform costs and contribute to
BANSEFI’s overall results.

      Financial projections show that BANSEFI will be able to bear the full costs of the platform while
maintaining a positive net result. Currently, BANSEFI’s operations do not yet sustain the full costs of the
IT platform. However, financial projections based on a conservative growth scenario show that
BANSEFI will be able to assume the entire costs of the platform from 2014 onwards maintaining its
overall positive financial result.

    b) Benefits at the SCI level

       The combined effects of technical assistance, networking and improved technological infrastructure
have contributed to enhancing the institutional and financial performance of SCIs and BANSEFI.
Although the benefits of the technical assistance provided under both BANSEFI projects are difficult to
directly attribute and quantify, they are clearly reflected in the improved financial and institutional
performance of the SCIs assisted under BANSEFI I and II. The total number of clients of the project-
assisted SCIs increased from 2.9 million to 7.5 million between 2003 and 2011. Total assets grew from
USD19.7 million to USD90.9 million, deposits from USD15.2 million to USD70.1 million, and the
number of branches increased from 946 to 2,739. The fact that the 112 certified institutions represent
72 percent of sector members and 74 percent of total sector assets suggests important gains in efficiency
due to consolidation and economies of scale.

      In addition, the technology platform enabled a total of 287 SCIs to offer international and national
remittance services through L@Red de la Gente. These services would not be available to the majority of
SCIs due to their limited transaction volumes which makes them unattractive for international remittance
service providers. The Red de la Gente network allowed negotiating lower fees with the international
remittance companies, which were passed on to SCIs and their members. Table 7 of Annex 2 shows the
evolution of international remittances provided by the network. Table 2 below shows the number of
international remittance transactions conducted by SCIs since 2007. On average, BANSEFI pays SCIs a
commission of US$1.5 per transaction disbursed, a share of the commissions received from the
international remittance service providers. Given that SCIs do not charge a fee to recipients, the

                                                    35
commission received from BANSEFI is the gross income of SCIs per transaction. As per table 2,
international remittance transactions through L@Red de la Gente generated a cumulative gross income of
USD 3.8 million for participating SCIs between January 2007 and August 2012.

      Finally, the adoption of the core banking system and other platform services helped improving
operational efficiency and enabled improved management information for strategic and operational
purposes.

       c) Benefits at the client level

    The project supported growth of the SCI sector and its financial infrastructure has helped extend the
range, quality and outreach of financial services, especially in under-banked and poor rural areas. The
improved financial and institutional performance of the majority of SCIs increases access to safe deposit
services instilling greater trust of low income customers in the financial system. Clients can further benefit
from increased access to formal credit at lower interest rates (about 10-20 percent per annum) compared
to informal moneylenders and some large microfinance institutions (with rates of up to 90 percent per
annum).

    Access to electronic payment systems through various delivery channels has reduced delivery costs
as well as transaction costs of clients. The ICR of the BANSEFI I project estimated a savings of around
MXN 15 for each international remittance transactions. In the period 2011 there were around 730,000
international remittance transactions supported by the platform. This translates to a saving of transaction
cost reduction of about US$850,000 to the beneficiaries for 2011. More importantly, additional
transaction cost reductions such as considerable reduced travel or waiting time for the disbursement of the
funds are expected to exceed these benefits but could not be calculated for this ICR. As per an internal
BANSEFI study, the government agency SEDESOL (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social) has reduced its
reconciliation time-period for Oportunidades payments from 13 months to just over 22 days now.

       d) Fiscal impacts

      The use of the IT platform for programs such as Oportunidades has also lead to considerable
savings to the Government. For example, the ICR of the BANSEFI I project estimated government
savings at MXN 75 per year for each beneficiary. This translated to an additional USD36.9 million in
savings to the Government in 2011 alone22, considerably more than what the Government spent on
subsidizing the entire IT platform that year.


22
     Based on 6.3 million beneficiaries.

                                                     36
       As shown in the previous sections, all investments funded are financially sustainable after project
closure. The incremental cash flow attributable to the technology platform already exceeds the platform’s
operational costs and is expected to assist BANSEFI in achieving full financial sustainability by 2014.
The TA has increased the efficiency and sustainability of SCIs and enhanced the access to financial
services to households and enterprises thereby contributing to increased tax revenues from financial
institutions and economic activities of their clients.

Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return

Because of the overlap of the BANSEFI projects and the attribution problems of the technical assistance
to the sector, this ICR concentrates its calculation of the Project’s NPV and IRR on the IT-related costs
only. These account for over 74% of total project costs and therefore provide a reasonable idea of the
return of the project.

Because of the cumulative nature of the IT-investments, however, the analysis must incorporate all IT-
related costs, both operational and investments, under all three BANSEFI projects. The analysis
concentrates on three main elements: (i) the total investment and operating costs of the IT Platform under
BANSEFI I, II and III23, (ii) revenues directly generated by BANSEFI from the Oportunidades activities
(which can be broken down between transaction fees from the Government and other interest/fees)
(iii) the estimated savings to the Government from the increased efficiency and decreased leakages from
the use of electronic payments of Oportunidades (see above). The latter savings are based on the estimate
made under the ICR of the first BANSEFI project (P070108) which reports savings of MXP 75 per
person and about 6.3 million beneficiaries. To be sure, the NPV/IRR analysis is calculated under four
scenarios, varying the level of savings to the Government (MXP 75 vs. a more conservative MXP 37.5
per beneficiary) and the growth rate of IT-related expenses over the next 5 years (2% vs. 5% growth).


                       Table 4: NPV/IRR Analysis of BANSEFI’s IT Platform
Scenario 1
Savings to Government per beneficiary (annual)   MXP75
Future growth of IT-related expenses (annual)     2%
NPV at 12 percent discount24                     US$123 million
IRR                                              24.45%
Scenario 2
Savings to Government per beneficiary (annual)   MXP75
Future growth of IT-related expenses (annual)     5%
NPV at 12 percent discount                       US$121 million

23
   The cost of IT under all three projects need to be combined, as they finance a single architecture. Were this
analysis able to solely isolate the IT cost of the project under review by this ICR, the NPV/IRR would be
considerably higher because the revenues included in the analysis only started in 2011.

Scenario 3
Savings to Government per beneficiary (annual)          MXP37.5
Future growth of IT-related expenses (annual)           2%
NPV at 12 percent discount                              US$61 million
IRR                                                     18.8%
Scenario 4
Savings to Government per beneficiary (annual)          MXP37.5
Future growth of IT-related expenses (annual)           5%
NPV at 12 percent discount                              US$59 million
IRR                                                     18.87%


The calculated NPV and IRR numbers are possibly underestimated, as they do not include other incomes
from services such as remittances, bill paying or branchless banking and yet all IT-related costs for these
services are included in the NPV/IRR calculation. However, these incomes are relatively small compared
to the overall revenue structure of BANSEFI.

The above calculations indicate that, despite a more conservative estimation of the savings of
Oportunidades to the Government and a more rapid growth of IT-related expenses, 74% of the project
funds yield a substantial return. Together with the evaluation of over-achieved objectives for the
remaining 26% (an increase of the outreach of financial services 118% above target, the improvement of
the sustainability of the system 23% above target), the overall efficiency of the project is rated substantial.

Annex 5.    Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The ICR was a collaborative exercise between the Bank and the BANSEFI project
implementation team. The first draft of the ICR was discussed with the BANSEFI team in
September 2012. Comments were received and incorporated to prepare a revised draft in
November 2011. This final draft was sent to BANSEFI/Ministry of Finance on January 28,
2013, which accepted the draft on January 29, 2013.

The final comment from the Ministry of Finance is reproduced below:

“During the evolution of the project, BANSEFI has expressed strong interest in strengthening the
SCI sector with SCIs which are compliant with the Popular Savings and Credit Law, financially
viable, operationally effective, managerially sound and technologically upgraded. BANSEFI has
directed its efforts to achieve the objectives of the project, so that the Ministry of Finance
recognizes the work of BANSEFI. We would rate the project satisfactory or highly satisfactory,
given the exceeded outcomes, but it is the Bank’s report.?
