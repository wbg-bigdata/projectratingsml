APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Yugoslavia's transport system consists of ten main commercial
ports, 96,000 km of roads, 10,300 km of standard and narrow gauge railways,
a sizeable network of inland and coastal waterways and fifteen airports of
which ten handle international traffic. The railways, which before 1965 held
a dominant position, have been losing traffic to the roads. The share of
seaborne trade in total international trade (oil excluded) has been declining
from 44% in 1965 to 33% in 1972, but recovery is expected as a result of
changes in foreign trade structure.
ii.       Over the past two decades, Governmental authority has been progres-
sively transferred from the Federation to the Socialist Republics and Socialist
Autonomous Provinces. Despite some initial difficulties due to lack of adequate
staff, progress has generally been made in promoting more rational and co-
orclinated transport policies. Significant progress was made in railways where
the five railways enterprises have agreed to a common finance plan and in high-
wa- where the creation of the Road Council should improve project preparation
and execution.  Mluch remains to be done, however, to ensure proper coordination
within and among various modes.
iii.      The ten main Yugoslav ports are operated by fully autonomous and
largely competitive enterprises which, to some extent, also compete with the
Italian ports of Trieste and Venice. Over the past decade, port development
was based on arbitraty and somewhat overlapping expansion programs rather than
on a countrywide survey of future port requirements.  The situation appears
to be chianging and the main Port Enterprises are discussing the meLstures to
be taken to improve cooperation among ports. It is, however, premature for
the Bank to be directly involved in these discussions. However, the Bank
will pursuc this matter with the Government during project supervision.  The
Government was informed that a port development study would be a prerequisite
to fuirther Bank lending to the port sector.
iv.       The proposed project is closely related to the construction of
the Belgrade-Bar Railway line, which was partly financed by the Bank (Loan
531-YU, March 1968). This line is expected to be completed by mid-1976 and,
when it is, the overland route to eastern Yugoslavia will be shorter from
Bar than from Rijeka and Koper on the Northern Adriatic Coast. It is expected
that the use of the Belgrade Bar line and of the Port of Bar will reduce over-
land transport costs to users by as much as 30%. However, existing facilities
at Bar need to be expanded to cope with future traffic demand which is expected
to quadruple between 1975 and 1980.



- ii -
v.        The project is part of the long-tern, development plan of the port
and consists of: construction of wharves, storage facilities, housing and
services; procurement and installation of mechanical handling equipment for
general. and dry bulk cargo; and consulting services to assist management in
project preparation, execution and supervision. The project also includes
construction of new railway facilities at Bar. The total cost of the project,
including interest during construction, is estimated at US$78 million, of
which US$62 million and US$10 million will finance port and railway investments,
respectively, and US$6 million will finance interest during construction on
the Bank loan and on loans from local institutions. The project will be fi-
nanced by Government grants, loans from local institutions, internally generated
funds and the proposed Bank loan. The foreign exchange component is US$36.9
million (07.57) of which US$32.9 million (48.0%) are for ports and US$4.0 mil-
lion (40%) for railway facilities.  The Bank loan will be for US$44 million.
VS~39.4 million will cover 55% of the cost of port and railway facilities and
ITSP4.6 million will be for interest during construction on the Bank loan. Thus,
the Fank loan will finance US$7.1 million of local currency costs.  The loan
will be for a 25-year term including 4 years of grace; the Port of Bar Enter-
prise (PBE) will be the Borrower.
vi.       Procurement will be by international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement", with the exception of
civil work contracts below US$1 million and contracts below US$200,000 for
which local competitive bidding and bids from selected international suppliers
will be accepted.  Disbursement will be based on 100% of the CIF landed cost
for imported goods or of the ex-factory price of goods produced locally, 100%
of interest during construction on the Bank loan, 100% of foreign exchange
cost of consulting services, 57% on all civil works contracts except expropria-
tion, housing, and ongoing civil work and dredging contracts which will not be
financed by the Bank loan and 55% of total railway expenditures.
vii.      The project will be constructed between 1974 and 1977 and will pro-
vide enough capacity to meet traffic demand until 1980. Additional investment
of D 220 million (US$14.5 million) will be required after 1978 to meet the
demand beyond 1980 until about 1985. Technical assistance will be required
during the construction period, and has been provided for in the project cost.
viii.     The financial situation of PBE will be satisfactory by 1980.  Financial
forecasts indicate that in 1980 PBE will earn a rate of return on net fixed
assets in excess of 8% and that maximum debt/equity will not exceed 50/50.
Interest and debt service coverage will also be satisfactory. PBE will need
to improve its accounting procedures and management consulting services have
been included in the project for this purpose.
ix.       The project is the least cost solution for foreign trade in eastern
Yugoslavia. The main benefits achieved by the realization of the project will
be: (a) savings in port operating costs; and (b) savings in overland transport
costs. Some revenues will be generated from transit. The project yields a
return of 13%o which is conservative as some benefits were not taken into
account due to the uncertainty of other ports development schemes. The proj-
ect will create some 800 permanent jobs and it will not disrupt the environ-
ment.



- iii -
x.        The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$44 million
equivalent, for a 25-year term corresponding to the average economic life of
the assets, including 4 years of grace corresponding to the expected dis-
bursement period.






APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has asked the Bank
to help finance a project to expand the capacity of Port of Bar in the
Socialist Republic (SR) of Montenegro. The project has been prepared by the
Port of Bar Enterprise (PBE) and is designed to handle the traffic expected
after completion on of the Belgrade-Bar Railway which, is being partly financed
by the Bank (Loan 531-YU, March 1968). The project cost is US$78 million, of
which US$62 million is for port facilities, US$10 million for railway facil-
ities, and US$6 million for interest during construction on the Bank loan and
on loans from local institutions.
1.02      This will be the Bank's first port loan and twelfth transport sec-
tor loan in Yugoslavia (Annex 1). The proposed loan will be for US$44 million,
or 56.5% of the project cost; this amount includes US$7.1 million of local cur-
rency financing. The balance of the project cost is expected to be financed
by grants from the Governments of the SRs of Montenegro and Serbia (US$10.5
million) and loans from a federal agency dealing with food and strategic
stocks (The Directorate) (US$2.7 million) and the Investment Bank of Titograd
(IBT) (US$14.3 millionl.). PBE will contribute US$2 million from internally
generated funds and the Railway Transport Enterprise (RTE) of Belgrade will
provide 45% of the cost of the railway facilities (US$4.5 million).
1.03      The borrower will be PBE, which will undertake the project with
technical assistance provided under the Bank loan. PBE will on-lend to RTE
Belgrade 55% of the cost of the railway facilities. The Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia will guarantee the loan.
1.04      This report is the result of an identification mission in 1972 as
well as preappraisal and appraisal missions in 1973 and 1974. The appraisal
mission consisted of Messrs. P. Bourcier (Economist), J. Kesson (Consultant),
and K. Strong (Hu Harries and Associates, Canada). Mrs. P. Valad (Editor)
assisted in preparation of the main text of this Appraisal Report.

II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Yugoslavia, with a population of about 21 million that is increasing
at 1% p.a., has a diversified economy which has grown rapidly since World War
II. During the past decade, per capita income has grown at about 6% p.a. to
reach about US$900 in 1973. Rising economic activity and personal incomes
have led to a rapid growth in transport requirements and international trade.
Between 1960 and 1970, total overland freight and passenger traffic grew, re-
spectively at 10% and 7% p.a., while seaborne traffic 1/ grew at about 8% p.a.
2.02      Yugoslavia is a Socialist Federal Republic consisting of six Socialist
Republics 2/ (SRs) and two Socialist Autonomous Provinces 3/ (SAPs). During the
past two decades, governmental authority and administration, previously con-
centrated in the Federal Government, was decentralized to Republican and Pro-
vincial Covernments and two enterprises which have gained considerable autonomy.
2.03      A distinguishing feature of Yugoslavia is the "self-management"
principle of economic organizations. This means that transport enterprises,
including railways and ports, are autonomous entities managed by the Workers.
B. The Transport System
2.04      Yugoslavia's transportation system comprises ten main commercial
ports (para. 3.01) 96,000 km of roads; 10,300 km of standard and narrow gauge
railways; a sizeable network of inland and coastal waterways and fifteen air-
ports, ten of which handle international flights. Pipelines are an insignifi-
cant means of transport, but they will become more important when a major oil
pipeline system, now being planned, has been completed.
2.05      Since 1960, railways have lost their dominant role in internal trans-
port to roads. That year railways accounted for respectively 74% of freight
traffic and 67% of passenger traffic and in 1970 they accounted for 47% and
25% respectively. The railways are expected to regain some of their losses
as a result of heavy investment to modernize the equipment and improve the
quality of service. Inland water transport is significant, carrying about
11% of total freight.  The five main sea ports (para. 3.01) almost doubled cargo
handling since 1962 to reach about 18 million tons in 1973. A large part of
the increase is due to rising imports of crude oil and oil derivatives (Annex 2).

3/   Kosovo and Vojvodina.



-3-
2.06      Physical improvements to the transport infrastructure have progressed
rapidly over the past decade, yet much remains to be done. The railways need
further modernization, and many roads are still below standard for the traffic
they currently carry and need improvements to handle expected traffic effi-
ciently. The capacity of some ports needs to be increased to avoid congestion.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.07      Yugoslavia has no clearly defined transport policy, but its thrust
is implicit in the country's overall economic policies. The main principles
are: free choice by users in selecting transport facilities; free entry into
the sector and competition in a market economy among autonomous transport
enterprises; and equal pricing treatment by Government. These principles,
together with other major reforms in overall economic policies, have brought
about a rapid evolution toward greater decentralization of policy making and
liberalization of the transport industry.
?.n8      Within the framework of decentralization, the primary responsibility
for Sector Administration and Planning was transfered from the Federation to
SRs and SAPs and to transport enterprises.  This has somewhat disrupted trans-
port administration planning and coordination. Following discussion with
the Bank, the Yugoslav authorities have made significant progress in improving
sector coordination. A SFRY Secretariat of Transport and Communications was
established in 1971 and most SRs and SAPs have established and/or strengthened
similar secretariats. Since 1971, Governments have given considerable atten-
tion to transport problems. Despite this progress, problems are far from
solved and further improvements are being discussed with the Yugoslav author-
ities (para 2.09 and Annex 1).
2.09      Of the several modes, only the railways established a comprehensive
Five-Year Plan which provides both realistic financial plans as well as com-
prehensive schedules for implementation of investments. Investment Plans for
Road Transport and Ports did not provide a rational evaluation of future re-
quirements. Attempts were made, with Bank assistance to remedy these defi-
ciencies by promoting closer cooperation between independent transport enter-
prises, users and/or Government agencies. Substantial progress was made in
railways, pipelines and to a lesser extent in highways. In the port sector,
however, such attempts have been less successful, mainly because of institu-
tional problems and competition among individual ports (para 3.15).
III. THE PORT SECTOR
A. Facilities
3.01      Along a 600 km coastline, Yugoslavia has about 89 landing places
which are considered as ports of entry; ten of these, are considered main
ports of which the most important are: Koper (SR Slovenia), Rijeka and Bakar,



- 4 -
Split, Ploce, (SR Croatia) and Bar (SR Montenegro), (see Map IBRD No. 10918).
The coastline is separated from the interior by mountain ranges of consider-
able height; therefore, the most important ports are near passes through which
roads and railways were built. Ports in general have a good depth and no
siltation problems. To some extent, Yugoslavia and neighboring countries,
also use the Ports of Venice and Trieste (Italy) and Salonika (Greece).
Yugoslavia has its own free zone in Salonika.
3.02      Rijeka is the most important port and in 1972 accounted for about
50% of international and coastal traffic excluding petroleum and derivatives.
It has rail and road connections with the interior of the country; however,
rail connections are congested (Rijeka-Ljubljana) or subject to operating
difficulties due to steep gradients (Rijeka-Zagreb). Bakar, a bulk cargo
port located some 14 km to the southeast of Rijeka, is used mostly for bauxite,
iron ore and coal. Its capacity is sufficient for present needs but expansion
would be costly because of difficult physical conditions. Koper is a natural-
ly protected harbor and has rail connections with the main Yugoslav and
European systems. Split has new cargo handling facilities and also has good
rail and road connections with Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade and Ploce, re-
cently constructed, has a rail connection with Sarajevo.
3.03      The Port of Bar lies in a well-protected bay some 25 km from the
Albanian border. The port was planned to serve a large area encompassing most
of eastern Yugoslavia including SRs Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia and SAPs
Kosovo and Voivodina, (Map IBRD No. 10918). Its service area is presently
limited to Montenegro because of no adequate road and railway links with the
interior. Existing facilities have been, so far, more than adequate for gene-
ral cargo traffic, as well as for liquid and dry bulk cargo traffic.
3.04      After the Belgrade-Bar Railway line (para. 1.01) is open to traffic
by mid-1976, the service area will be greatly expanded. By 1980, total
traffic through the port is expected to be about five times the 1973 level.
Despite on-going construction of two new berths for bulk cargo and of some
storage sheds, existing port and railway facilities at Bar are not large
enough to process the expected traffic and need to be expanded; expansion
will be part of this project (para. 5.01).
B. Traffic
3.05      International traffic through the ten main Yugoslav ports, petroleum
excluded, was 7.2 million tons in :971, or about 33% of total foreign trade
(Annex 3). Coastal and transit traffic was 1.5 and 3.2 million tons respect-
ively. Petroleum traffic handled mostly through special facilities at Rijeka
was an additional 6.6 million tons.
3.06      Due to the large share of Western Europe in total Yugoslav exchanges
and to the increasing use of overland transport to reach European markets, the



- 5 -
relative importance of seaborne foreign trade has been decreasing consistently
since 1964, except for petroleum and derivatives. From 1961 to 1971, seaborne
traffic grew at an average rate of 3.5% p.a. while total foreign trade grew
at 9.75% p.a.
3.07      In 1971, Rijeka and Koper accounted for almost all transit traffic.
Since 1968, transit traffic remained almost constant. Coastal traffic consists
principally of petroleum products from the Rijeka refinery (1.2 million tons
in 1971); and of cement (300,000 tons in 1971). Except for petroleum products
coastal traffic did not grow substantially over the past five years and there
are no indications that this trend will be reversed in the future. Passenger
traffic between the main Yugoslav ports and Italy is substantial; from 1969
to 1971 it grew from 8.4 million to 9.3 million passengers.
Future Prospects
3.08      Yugoslav exports enjoy a favorable commodity structure with a rela-
tively large share of high elasticity products such as beef, wine, fruit and
vegetables among agricultural products, non-ferrous metals and a wide range
of engineering manufactures. Exports are expected to grow at a pace compar-
able with past trends. Projected rates of growth for exports over the next
five years vary from 2% for food products to 15% for electrical equipment
with the rate for most products at about 10 to 12% p.a. The Yugoslav economy
depends heavily on imports whose recent rapid growth is expected to level
off in the future.
3.09      Since 1963, the regional structure of Yugoslav trade has changed
considerably. Trade with the US and with less-developed countries has de-
creased, while trade with Eastern Europe remained almost constant, and trade
with Western Europe increased substantially. In the future, trade with
Eastern Europe is likely to increase, however, Yugoslavia's most important
trading partner will continue to be the West and more particularly the en-
larged EEC despite strong competition in the field of exports. Trade with
less-developed countries is not expected to grow substantially. The plan
for regional trade distribution is set out in the Social Development Plan as
50% to the West, 35% to the COMECON countries and 15% to less-developed
countries. Trade with the West is likely to take a larger share at the
expense of trade with less-developed countries.
3.10      Yugoslav trade projections, excluding petroleum show a strong re-
covery of seaborne trade against overland trade (Annex 4). But given the
future structure of foreign trade, such results are unlikely to be achieved,
at least during the indicated time period (1975-1985). While the share of
seaborne trade in total exports appears reasonable, it is likely to be over-
stated for imports which would mainly come from Western Europe and would use
overland transport routes.

C. Organization
3.11      Ports are operated by independent enterprises which provide and main-
tain port facilities, and carry out ship, shore and warehouse cargo handling.
Exceptions are Ploce, now owned by the Sarajevo Railway Enterprise, and Split,
where the Port Enterprise provides and maintains infrastructure while the
Stevedoring Enterprise handles cargo on ship and on shore. Port Enterprises
are fully independent and are responsible for their own development plans.
Little coordination exists between the various Enterprises.
3.12      The main sea ports have formed a group (the association of ports)
w- 'iittin the Federal Chamber of Economy. This association is a consultative
body with no real executive power, it now consists of the ten main ports and
of several enterprises in charge of port construction and operation. The
association deals mostly with tariffs and represents the ports within the
Federal Chamber of Economy. Within the association, decisions have to be
unaniious, and this is seldom achieved since several ports compete to serve
CAie same hinterland.
D. Operations
3.13      General cargo traffic is congested in Koper and Rijeka due to:  (i)
insufficient and obsolete handling equipment; (ii) inadequate layout of railway
facilities; and (iii) lack of storage capacity especially in covered storage,
grain silos, and edible-oil tanks. Problems are most acute at Rijeka, where
large ship operation is hampered by shallow depth. Some problems could be
alleviated by streamlining cargo and by penalizing users for long storage
periods. These steps appear difficult to take, however, because of the lack
of coordination between Port Enterprises and users. Cargo handling rates are
generally acceptable at the largest ports, and labor relations are good.
E. Development Planning and Sector Coordination
3.14      In 1971, the Port Association published a five-year development plan
(1971-1975) prepared by the various ports. The plan proposed a total invest-
ment of D 2,300 million (US$151 million) which was subsequently scaled down to
D 1,770 million (US$116 million) after discussions within the association.
The ports, however, made little attempt to eliminate duplication in estimating
future traffic and defining facilities to be provided to meet future demand.
The plan called for an increase of 30% in the length of general cargo berthage
in the ten principal ports and the addition of one major bulk handling installa-
tion at Bar and two minor container terminals at Rijeka and Koper, but did not
contain any analysis of capacity versus traffic, did not provide a rational
evaluation of future port requirements and did not address the main issues of
the port sector such as the choice between alternative development schemes
and the financing of investment programs.



3.15      Partly because tariffs have been kept low to compete with Italian
ports, Yugoslav ports have not been able to mobilize enough resources to carry
out their program. Actual expenditures, amount to D 580 million i.e. 33% of
the planned amount. Since ports could not secure long-term loans to finance
their expansion, Ploce and Rijeka used short-term borrowings and now face
liquidity problems. Recurrent financial problems as well as growing opera-
tional difficulties induced more cooperation among main ports. Within the
framework of the preparation of the next five-year plan, the main ports are
discussing, through the Chamber of Economy of the Federal Assembly, the mea-
sures to be taken to improve cooperation among ports. In particular, the
major ports have been considering a joint port development study to be carried
out by Yugoslav consultants.
3.16      Over the past three years, the Bank has been urging the Yugoslavs to
carry out a port development study that would have provided the framework for
further investment in the port sector. During loan negotiations, the Bank
expressed its willingness to assist in the financing of the foreign exchange
cost of such a study under the present loan. The Government stated that the
ports must decide jointly on the measures to be taken to improve coordination,
including the proposed study, and that this collective decision process would
take time. The Government felt, therefore, that although the study would be
useful, it would he premature to discuss it in connection with this project.
The Government was informed that, although che Bank understood these problems,
a port development study would be a prerequisite for Bank financing another
port project in Yugoslavia. The Bank will further discuss this matter with
the Government during project supervision.
IV. THE PORT OF BAR ENTERPRISE
A. Background
4.01      PBE was created in 1954 to construct the port facilities at Bar.
After construction was completed, PBE's status was changed from an "Enterprise
at Construction" into an Economic Organization in charge of "receiving, storing
and dispatching goods, providing transport services for its own or for third
parties' needs and of constructing and maintaining port facilities at Bar".
The port has been operational on a small-scale since 1967 and is fully auto-
nomous.
4.02      PBE follows the general concept of decentralized economic control
and workers' self management of "social property." The policy making body is
the Workers' Council elected by the personnel of the Enterprises (workers'
collective) which acts in much the same fashion as a board of directors in
a western type corporation. The Workers' Council appoints the general manager.



- 8 -
4.03      Starting January 1, 1974, PBE consists of five semi-independent
units of associated labor, without legal personality (Annex 5). Each unit
has a large degree of autonomy in internal matters, and is responsible for its
own budget which must, however, be approved by the Workers' Council. Separate
accounts are kept principally for profit sharing purposes. Since no unit can
commit funds by itself no problem of inter-unit liability arises and no indica-
tions exist that PBE would change its legal structure in the near future
(Annex 5).
B. Organization and Management
4.04      The operational stricture of PBE consists of two departments dealing
respectively with operation and maintenance; finances, legal and marketing;
and of a Project Management Group (PMG), whose head is directly responsible to
the General Manager, dealing with project preparations and supervision (Annex
6). Although all positions have not yet been filled, the principles adopted
are satisfactory inasmuch as they will help management in promoting delegation
of power and operational responsibility as well as proper coordination between
the various units. Senior management is generally qualified and experienced,
but middle management requires strengthening and technical assistance for the
next few years.
4.05      The relative inexperience of the existing staff has generally re-
sulted in deficiencies in the elaboration, transmission and analysis of
costing, statistical and other financial information essential to management.
The accounting department has an over-legalistic approach and sometimes lacks
a clear understanding of accounting principles (paras. 6.01 and 6.04). The
general manager and the Workers' Council are aware of these problems and have
employed the Economic Bureau, (Consultants, Yugoslavia), to assist PBE in
reviewing existing accounting practices and implementing a proper accounting
system. The consultants have already produced an interim report recommending
improvements in costing procedures and budget control for each unit. These
recommendations are being implemented, but they are just a first step towards
improving the accounting system. The consultants are presently studying the
adequacy of existing tariff-setting, marketing, and financial procedures in
the light of future port expansion and should submit their final report by the
end of 1974.
4.06      During loan negotiation the Bank and PBE agreed that PBE will con-
tinue employing consultants acceptable to the Bank to assist in improving and
implementing managerial and accounting systems, and in reviewing tariff setting
policies.
4.07      PMG with the assistance of the Economic Bureau is handling project
preparation. PBE also intends to supervise project execution itself, and for
this purpose, PBE has recently appointed new staff to PMG. These arrangements
are satisfactory since PBE agreed: (i) to employ engineering consultants for
the design and detailed engineering of the main structures under the project
(para 5.11); and (ii) to maintain the staff of PMG at standards acceptable to



the Bank. During loan negotiations the Bank and PBE agreed that PBE will add,
not later than March 31, 1975, an economist and a financial analyst to the
present PMC staff and that the services of the Economic Bureau will be continued
until the new staff is fully acquainted with the project. PBE also agreed to
submit to the Bank not later than March 31, 1975, the experience and qualifica-
tion of senior staff to be appointed to PMG.
C. Operations
4.08      Operations are generally adequate for the volume of traffic handled,
although considerable improvement could be achieved by further training and
better use of available equipment (Annex 7). The growth in traffic at the
opening of the Belgrade-Bar line will require an increase in the port labor
force from 560 workers in 1973 to about 1,500 in 1980. At the same time it is
planned that the output per worker will increase from 1,450 tons p.a. in 1972
to about 2,900 tons p.a. in 1980. This increase in staff as well as new cargo
handling procedures will require both training and technical assistance in
the introduction and development of new methods of cargo handling. PBE intends
to retain consultants to assist in improving existing cargo handling procedures
and to devise new procedures in line with the volume of traffic expected after
the opening of the Belgrade-Bar line.  During loan negotiations PBE agreed
to employ such consultants on conditions satisfactory to the Bank and to make
satisfactory training arrangements for new staff. Operating targets given in
Annex 7 were agreed upon by PBE and the Bank during loan negotiations.
4.09      Most of the cargo in and out of the Port is expected to travel by
rail and PBE has decided that the RTE Belg;rade will undertake railway opera-
tion and provide the necessary equipment (locomotives, rolling stock) for
cargo movements in and out of the Port area. During loan negotiations, PBE,
RTE and the Bank agreed that RTE and PBE will, not later than March 31, 1975,
make the necessary arrangements to ensure proper coordination between rail and
port traffic.
D. Insurance
4. 10     P1E has full and adequate insurance coverage for all risks including
third party risks.
E. Tariffs and Finance
4.11      PBE is free to set its tariffs, but decisions on tariffs have
usuallv been taken within the Port Association in consultation with other
ports. Because of the competition of other Yugoslav ports, whose tariffs
are already low because of the competition with Italian Ports, PBE's tariffs



- 10 -
have generally been 10%, to 15% lower than those of Rijeka and Koper. The
present tariffs went into effect in September 1974.   Over the past four years
tariffs were increased four times. The present tariff structure does not
fully reflect costs (Annex 8). This is due partly to the necessity of follow-
ing charges of competitive ports and also to the lack of adequate cost informa-
tion. This is presently under study and should be corrected before the end
of the construction period (para. 4.05). During loan negotiations PBE agreed
that a cost based tariff structure will be prepared before January 1, 1976
and be made available to the Bank for review.
4.12      PBE's past financial results have been poor with the Port showing
small operating losses in 1971 and 1972 (para. 6.02). This situation is due
partly to the low level of traffic for the capacity of the Port and to primi-
tive operating procedures (para. 4.08). The financial situation of PBE is
expected to improve substantially during the construction period as a result
of better operating procedures and by 1976 the operating ratio is expected to
be 64% compared to 97% in 1971 and 89% in 1972. PBE will be able to contri-
bute D 30.7 million (US$2 million) to the financing of the proposed project.
PBE's financial situation will continue to improve after project completion.
F. Audit
4.13      The audit of PBE's accounts by the Social Accounting Service (SAS)
is limited to verifying that accounts are kept and statements produced accord-
ing to the prescribed uniform format. During loan negotiations, PBE agreed
that it will have its accounts audited, in accordance with sound auditing prin-
ciples consistently applied, by SAS or another competent and experienced inde-
pendent auditing organization and that the certified statements and the auditor's
report will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each year.
V. THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THIE PROJECT
A. General
5.01      In 1970, PBE with the assistance of the Kirilo Savic Institute
Consultants, Belgrade, prepared a program for expansion of the port including
expropriation of houses near the port area, construction of new bulk cargo
handling facilities, extension of the general cargo and passenger handling
facilities, construction of a bulk petroleum berth, and dredging of the main
port area to 14 m depth. The cost of the program was estimated at D 560
million (US$37 million) and was expected to be financed largely by Government
grants. Because of difficulties in obtaining local financing the program was
curtailed and initial development was limited to construction of the petroleum
berth and of about 80% of the new bulk facilities and dredging; and to the



- 1 1 -
necessary expropriation. The Government and PBE requested Bank assistance for
financing of the remainder. PBE's original proposal was not totally acceptable
and at the request of the Bank, PBE revised its original program and added
railway facilities at Bar. The new program was reviewed by the appraisal
mission and is satisfactory.
B. The Investment Program
5.02      PBE's investment program (Annex 9) covers the period 1974-80 and is
estimated at D 1,160 million (US$76.5 million) of which D 553 million (US$36.5
million) is estimated to be foreign exchange. It will bring the port capacity
to about 5 million tons in 1980, sufficient to handle the 1982 projected
traffic. Plans for development beyond 1982 will be prepared during construc-
tion of the proposed project. PBE's investment program was agreed upon during
loan negotiations and PBE agreed, that, except as the Bank shall otherwise
agree, its investments would be limited to those included in the program, ex-
cept for small items not exceeding a total of D 6 million (US$400,000) annually.
C. Project Objectives
5.03      The objective of the project is to shorten overland transport for
goods imported to or exported from Eastern Yugoslavia. Such goods would
otherwise be handled through other distant ports (Rijeka and Koper).
D. Project Description
5.04      The project is the realization of the 1974-1977 portion of the
investment program and includes:
(a)  Port Facilities
(M)  Expropriation:  Compensation to be paid for clearing
about 250 private and municipal houses from sections
of the land to be developed by the port.
(ii)  Accommodation:  Construction of a hostel providing single
accommodation for about 500 workers and of about 250
apartments for family accommodation.
(iii)  Infrastructure:  Completion of the dry bulk cargo wharf
now under construction, construction of two new general
cargo berths, extension of the passenger ferry facil-
ities and completion of the dredging program to provide
14 m depth below L.W.O.S.T. in the main port area and
13 m along the new general cargo berths.



- 12 -
(iv)  Services:  Provision of water supply, drainage, electric
power, communication, roads, truck parking and railway
facilities within the port working area.
(v)   Storage:  Construction of transit and storage sheds and
of adequate open storage to increase existing shedding
and open stacking areas by 65% and 80% respectively; as
well as construction of grain silos and edible oil tanks
with an initial capacity of 30,000 and 20,000 tons
respectively.
(vi)  Equipment:  Procurement and installation of:  5 portal
cranes and 3 transporter bridges for handling scrap
iron, coal, grain, bauxite and phosphates; 4 portal
cranes, 5 mobile cranes, 15 fork-lift trucks, 10 tractors
and 40 trailers for the general cargo berths; and of 2
tug boats.
(vii)  Technical Assistance:  Including the services of consult-
ants to assist PBE in: planning and improving port
management and financial control of operations; designing
wharf structures, sheds, silos and bulk handling equipment;
in improving the existing accounting system and in training
existing and additional staff.
(b)  Railway Facilities.  Construction of reception and dispatch yards
outside the port area and of sidings for the distribution and
marshalling of wagons near the working area.
A detailed description of the project is given in Annex 10 and the layout of
the main facilities is given on Map IBRD No. 10916.
E. Cost Estimates
5.05      The total project cost, including interest during construction is
estimated at US$78 million, of which US$67.8 million is for port facilities
and US$10.2 million for railway facilities. The foreign exchange component is
US$36.9 million (47%) of which US$32.9 million (89%) is for port and US$4 mil-
lion (11%) for railway facilities. Interest during construction on the Bank
loan and loans from local institutions amounts to US$6 million. Annex 11 shows
details of the cost estimate and page 13 shows a summary.
5.06      PBE with the assistance of the Economic Bureau prepared the cost
estimates. Expropriation costs are based on compensation paid to date.
Costs of civil works are derived largely from prices of similar works under-
taken by local contractors or joint ventures between local and foreign con-
tractors and reflect prices expected by the end of 1974. Equipment costs
are based on recent quotations from foreign suppliers updated to reflect

price increases of the first six months of 1974. Costs of consultant serv-
ices are based on current rates for Yugoslavia and foreign experts.
5.07      The physical contingency applied is 15% on wharf structure still
to be designed in detail, 10% on other civil works and 5% on equipment; no
physical contingency has been applied on expropriation. The price contingency
for local cost is based on trends in Yugoslavia for the first part of 1974 and
for foreign costs on average European inflation rates. The assessed figures
are 20%, 16% and 10% for local costs and 12%, 10%, and 8% for foreign costs for
1975, 1976 and 1977 respectively. No price contingency was applied to ex-
propriation as compensation is expected to be settled by the end of 1974.
Prices for housing and hostel include contingencies of 25% of the estimated
cost. Total price contingencies on port and railway facilities (expropriation,
housing and accommodation excluded) account for 26% and 14% of the local cur-
rency and foreign exchange costs respectively, excluding interest during
construction but including physical contingencies.

5.09      A US$44 million Bank loan is proposed, with a 25-year term including
4 years of grace. The loan will finance US$39.4 million (557O) of the project
cost including US$7.1 million of local costs. Since PBE will not generate
enough revenue during the construction period, the Bank loan will also finance
interest during construction on the Bank loan for an amount estimated at
US$4.6 million. PBE will onlend US$5.7 million to RTE Belgrade on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan to cover 55% of the cost of railway
facilities (US$5.5 million) and interest during construction (US$0.2 million) 1/.
Contributions from Montenegro and Serbia will be grants. The Montenegro con-
tribution will be used exclusively to finance expropriation. The IBT loan will
be for 13 years, including three years of grace at 8% and would include in-
terest during construction. The Directorate loan will be for 30 years at 3%
and 10 years at 8% for D 30 million and D 10 million respectively. RTE Belgrade
will provide 45% of the cost of railway facilities from internally generated
funds. IBT and RTE will guarantee the timely availability of funds for port
and railway expenditures respectively; IBT will guarantee cost overruns for
local and foreign costs. The financing plan was reviewed during loan negotia-
tions and is satisfactory. Execution and ratification of agreements satisfac-
tory to the Bank between the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, PBE, IBT,
the Directorate and RTE Belgrade are conditions of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan.
5.10      PBE has started employing consultants in 1974 and retroactive fi-
nancing for consultant services is recommended for an amount estimated at
USS100,000 equivalent for expenditures incurred since January 1, 1974.
G. Implementation
Responsibility
5.11      PBE will be responsible for carrying out the project with the as-
sistance of engineering consultants for the detailed design and preparation
of bid documents for wharf structure, transit and storage sheds, grain silos
cargo handling equipment and tug boats, on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. PBE will also employ consultants to assist in the overall coordina-
tion of the project. Suitable consultants are available in Yugoslavia, but
for bulk handling equipment foreign experts will be engaged to advise on the
selection of equipment before final detailing. During loan negotiations, PBE
agreed to employ engineering consultants in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines for "Uses of Consultants".
1/   Since the amount of interest during construction is small (US$0.2 million),
it has been included in the project cost to simplify accounting and re-
payment procedures between RTE, PBE and the Bank.



- 16 -
5.12      Port management has been strengthened by a Project Management Group
(PMG) which will coordinate and supervise the execution of the project. This
is acceptable subject to the conditions in para 4.07.
5.13      RTE Belgrade will be responsible for carrying out the railway part
of the project and for coordinating with PBE. During loan negotiations, PBE
and RTE agreed to consult periodically to coordinate project execution and
supervision.
Procurement
5.14      Procurement will be on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement." Civil
works contracts will be drawn for the major infrastructure, service and stor-
age items and supply contracts for wharf cranes, bulk handling equipment,
mobile mechanical handling equipment and tug boats each with an initial stock
of spare parts.  The list of contracts in Annex 13 was agreed by the Bank and
PBE during loan negotiations and provides for grouping of contracts.  Most
equipment financed under the Bank loan will  be procured from abroad.
Yugoslavia has no preference treaties and bids will be compared on a CIF basis
net of custom duties.  Local manufacturers are not expected to contribute
substantially to procurement of Bank financed items.  For the purpose of bid
comparison, preference of 15% of the CIF landed price of imported goods or
the actual custom duty, whichever is lower, will be given to local manufacturers
who qualify as preferred bidders.
5.15      There are competent contractors for civil and marine works in
Yugoslavia; it is, therefore, doubtful whether overseas contractors will be
interested even for the larger work contracts except possibly in joint venture
with Yugoslav contractors. Prequalification of bidders will be desirable to
confine bidding to reliable and experienced contractors. During loan nego-
tiation, PBE agreed that prequalification will apply for all civil works
contracts estimated to cost more than D 45 million (US$3 million).
5.16      Experienced foreign contractors and suppliers are well represented
in Yugoslavia and local competitive bidding is recommended for work contracts
under D 15 million (US$1 million) and supply contracts under D 3 million
(US$200,000).
Construction Schedule
5.17      Expropriation and detailed design are expected to start before the
end of 1974 with project execution starting at the end of the first quarter of
1975 and completion by the end of 1977. The construction schedule was prepared
on the basis of the bulk handling facilities being available by mid-1976 for
the start of the Belgrade-Bar line and the remaining work being completed in
1977 in line with the expected build-up of general cargo traffic. More details
are given in Annex 14.



< _ ~17-\
H. Disbursement
5.18      Disbursement for the items under the Bank loan is expected to
start early in 1975, except for technical assistance (para 5.10). For port
facilities disbursement will be made on the basis of: (i) 100% of the CIF
landed cost of imported goods or of the ex-factory prices for goods procured
locally; (ii) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of consulting services; (iii)
100% of interest during construction on the Bank loan; and (iv) 57% on civil
work contracts. The Bank will not disburse for expropriation, accommodation,
housing, or dredging, which are governed by local regulations or are the
continuation of existing contracts; or for local duties and taxes on imported
items. For railway facilities the Bank will disburse 55% of all expenditures.
Any savings on the Bank financed items are recommended to be used to finance
similar items essential to the project. The disbursement schedule on the
Bank loan is given at Annex 15.
I. Ecology
5.19      The development of the port is in accordance with the general zon-
ing plan of the Commune of Bar (Map IBRD 10917). No major changes to the
existing coastal regime will occur and there will be no detrimental effect
on the existing environment. The port area has been studied by consultants
(Industrio Project, Zagreb) and measures recommended for bilge water dis-
charge and oil spillage containment are satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
6.01      PBE's financial statements for 1971 and 1972 are unreliable because
of inadequate methods of accounting used by the Port. They were revised as
required for this analysis. Except for financial statements required by law,
PBE does not maintain a meaningful cost accounting system, and proper financial
and management information is not available for investment planning and control
of project execution. Technical assistance will be provided under this loan
to improve PBE's accounting and management information systems (para. 4.06).



- 18 -
B. Past Financial Performance
6.02      Past financial performance has generally been poor with PBE showing
small operating losses in 1971 and 1972, operating ratios being respectively
97% and 89%. This situation is partly due to the low level of traffic for
the capacity of the port resulting from delays in the completion of the
Belgrade-Bar Line and from poor operating procedures. In the past, PBE has
not been able to earn a reasonable rate of return on its net fixed assets or
to contribute to the financing of its investment. Investment funds were pro-
vided by Government grants and PBE was not required to incur any substantial
long-term debt. The debt equity ratio for 1971 and 1972 was 6:94 and 5:95,
respectively.
C.  Forecast Financial Performance
6.03      PBE's financial performance is expected to improve substantially
until 1976 due to traffic increase and improvement of operating procedures,
(para 4.08). It should remain stable for the two years following the com-
pletion of the project as traffic builds up and should resume improving after
1978 when all assets provided under the project are used to capacity. Gross
revenues, based on 1974 tariffs are expected to increase from D 26 million
in 1973 to D 88.5 million and D 203 million in 1976 and 1980 respectively
reflecting traffic increase after the opening of the Belgrade-Bar line. The
operating ratio is expected to decrease from 85% in 1973 to 64% and 57% in
1976 and 1980 respectively. The rate of return on net fixed assets will
increase from 2.3% in 1973 to 8.7% and 9.8% in 1976 and 1980 respectively.
Debt and interest service coverage should be satisfactory through the period
and should reach 2:1 times and 2.8:1 times respectively in 1980. Annex 16
summarizes the assumptions used in the preparation of the forecasts and An-
nexes 17 to 19 show past and projected financial statements for the period of
1971-1980.
6.04      These projections assume, however, that proper depreciation be
charged on breakwaters and wharves. This is not presently the case, so far
the main breakwater has been kept in work in progress although it is complete,
because PBE feels that it was built for a larger capacity. Depreciation on
wharves and secondary breakwaters has been charged directly to equity on the
balance sheet. This does not allow for the cost to be recovered and gives a
distorted picture of operating results. During loan negotiations, PBE agreed
to transfer the main breakwater to fixed assets and to charge depreciation
on breakwaters and wharves through its income statement starting January 1, 1976.
D. Cash Flow
6.05      Cash flow projection show that although PBE will be able to con-
tribute D 30.7 million towards the project in 1977, it will not generate



- 19 -
sufficient cash during the construction period to pay interest on its loans.
It is, therefore, proposed that the Bank loan include interest during cons-
truction on the amounts financed by the Bank (para 5.09). After construction
is complete and the facilities provided start earning revenue the cash flow
shows a lhealthy surplus (para 6.09). Details for the period 1975-80 are
shown in Annex 18.
6.06      During loan negotiations, PBE, IBT and RTE Belgrade agreed to guaran-
tee the timely provision of funds for the financing of the project (para 5.09).
6.07      Because of the lending arrangements (para 5.09) the cost of rail-
way facilities at Bar was not included in PBE's cash flow projections. It
was, however, taken into account in the financial evaluation of the fourth
railway project (Loan 1026-YU).
E. Balance Sheets (Annex 18)
6.08      The balance sheet at the end of 1972 shows PBE with negative work-
ing capital. However, by the end of 1973, working capital should be at an
acceptable level because of increased earnings and payment of government con-
tributions to cover 1971 and 1972 capital expenditures which were originally
financed out of working capital. Projected debt equity ratios of 53:47 and
48:52 in 1978 and 1980 respectively are satisfactory.
F. Future Cash Position
6.09      PBE will invest an additional D 220 million between 1977 and 1980
to meet the expected traffic after 1980 which is expected to grow at 5% p.a.
Starting in 1979, PBE is expected to earn a return on average net fixed assets
in excess of 8% and the financial projections show that it should be able to
finance more than 85% (D 170 million) of the investment required from internal-
ly generated funds. It is expected that the balance (D 50 million) would be
provided by Government grants. During loan negotiations the Bank obtained
assurances from PBE that the necessity for Government assistance would be
reviewed before launching the second phase of the expansion. A sensitivity
analysis shows that if traffic is 20% lower than projected in 1980, PBE will
still earn a return on net fixed assets in excess of 5%, which along with a
reasonable debt/equity 1/ ratio should enable PBE to dispense with Government
assistance in financing future developments.
1/   The concept of equity does not exist in Yugoslavia since the assets of
the enterprise are the social property of the workers, however, for
practical purposes the work equity was used to differentiate the enter-
prise own funds and Government grants as opposed to borrowings.



- 20 -
G. Financial Covenants
6.10      During loan negotiations PBE agreed to employ consultants, to improve
its operating procedures during the construction period and to achieve an
operating ratio of not more than 70% by 1976. PBE also agreed: (i) to main-
tain tariffs at such a level that it will earn a return on average net fixed
assets of not less than 4% between the year following the opening of the
Belgrade-Bar line and 1980 and of not less than 8% thereafter; 1/ and (ii)
not to incur any additional long-term debt unless its net income for the
fiscal year would be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements
of any succeeding year on all its long-term debt, including the debt to be
incurred.
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
7.01      The main benefits generated by the project will be:  (i) savings in
port operating costs; (ii) savings in overland transport costs; and (iii) net
revenues from transit. The main beneficiaries will be port users and shippers
and consumers in eastern Yugoslavia to whom part of the savings in overland
transport cost will be passed on.
B. Traffic Projections
7.02      PBE prepared traffic projections with the assistance of the Economic
Bureau, based on extensive interviews with future users of the Port of Bar,
Government and public agencies, and, to some extent, competitive ports. They
are considered reasonable.
7.03      Annexes 20 and 21 give traffic projections for the main commodities,
and the various types of traffic, (general cargo as well as liquid and dry
bulk cargo). They show that after the Belgrade-Bar line is opened, traffic
is expected to increase to 1.1 million ton in 1975 and 4.3 million ton in 1980
witlh dry bulk cargo traffic increasing from 490,000 ton to 2.4 million ton and
general cargo from 365,000 ton to 1.4 million ton during the same period.
1/   This is believed to be realistic despite competition among ports.  As
explained in para 4.11, tariff increases are decided jointly by the main
ports and past experience shows that the Yugoslav ports have consistently
adjusted their tariffs to reflect cost increases.



- 21 -
7.04      To evaluate savings in overland transport costs, the Economic
Bureau carried out an origin and destination analysis for: (i) local traf-
fic; (ii) diverted traffic; and (iii) transit traffic. The results show
that by 1980 diverted traffic will account from about 59 percent of total
traffic, petroleum excluded, and that traffic diverted to Bar from alter-
native ports, Rijeka and Koper, represents the least cost transport alter-
native to users. Based on prevailing railway and port tariffs, users' sav-
ings are estimated at about D 100 million annually by 1980 or one third of
the total transport cost to Northern Adriatic Ports. It is, therefore,
reasonable to consider that users will use the Port of Bar rather than alter-
native ports when the Belgrade-Bar line is open to traffic.
7.05      Traffic projections prepared by the Economic Bureau are substantial-
ly lower than those prepared by the railways due to a more optimistic atti-
tude of the railways regarding the possibility of diverting bulk traffic from
alternative routes and modes. Railway projections are expected to be revised
in the near future. During loan negotiations, PBE and RTE Belgrade agreed to
establish and maintain proper coordination for the evaluation of future
traffic and to keep the Bank informed of changes in traffic projections by
means of quarterly progress reports starting June 30, 1975. For the purpose
of this evaluation, the projections prepared by the Economic Bureau have been
retained.
C. Rate of Return
7.06      The basis for the economic evaluation is given in Annexes 22 and 23.
The rate of return of the project compared to the next best alternative
(Northern Adriatic Ports) is 13%, which is higher than the estimated oppor-
tunity cost of capital in the country. This rate is conservative since the:
(a)  present project is burdened by expropriation charges which
are not entirely related to port capacity expansion, but
would enable the municipality to promote a policy of gradual
industrialization in the rear area of the port. If only 50%
of these costs were attributed to the project, the rate of
return rises to 16%; and
(b)  because of the lack of coordination between ports in Yugoslavia
(Chapter II), it has not been deemed reasonable to take into
account any postponement of capacity expansion at Rijeka as a
result of diversion of traffic to the Port of Bar.
7.07      The proposed project will create some 800 permanent jobs in Nlontenegro
and will enable PBE to increase the level of wages of port workers to the
average level in Yugoslav ports.



- 22 -
D. Sensitivity Analysis
7.08      An increase of 20% in the project cost would cause the rate of re-
turn to drop by two percentage points, an increase of 20% in projected traffic
would cause the rate of return to increase by three percentage points.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations, the Bank obtained agreement from:
(a) RTE Belgrade regarding the financing of 45% of the cost of
railway facilities (para 5.09) and the timely availability
of funds (para 6.06); and
(b) PBE regarding:
-    employment of management and accounting consultants
(para 4.06), engineering consultants (para 4.07) and
port operations consultants (para 4.08);
-    employment of qualified staff in PMG (para 4.07);
-    preparation of a cost based tariff before January 1,
1976 (para 4.11);
-    audit of PBE's accounts by qualified independent auditors
(para 4.13);
-    investment limitation (para 5.02);
-    prequalification of bidders (para 5.15);
-    adoption of realistic depreciation practices (para 6.04);
-    future financial performance (para 6.10); and
-    debt limitation (para 6.10).
(c) PBE and RTE regarding the creation of a joint unit to coordinate
project execution and supervision (para 5.13) as well as for
operation at Bar (paras 4.09 and 7.05); and
(d) IBT regarding the financing plan (para 5.08) and the timely
availability of funds (para 6.06).



- 23 -
8.02      The Government was informed that a port development study would be
a prerequisite for Bank financing another port project in Yugoslavia (para
3.1 ).
8.03      A condition of loan effectiveness will be that the agreements refer-
red to in para 5.09 have been ratified by competent authorities.
8.04      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$44 million to PBE for
a 25-year term corresponding to the average life of the assets, including 4
years of grace corresponding to the expected disbursement period.

Transportation Projects Previously
Financed by the Bank
1.        So far the Bank has lent US$487.4 million in total to the transport
sector, including US$180 million for six Highway Projects, US$59.4 million for
the Naftagas Project and US$248 million for four railway projects.
Highway Projects
2.        The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was financed
in 1963 and the Second (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million) in 1967; they were com-
pleted within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The
Third (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million) Project was financed in 1969 was substan-
tially completed within the closing date but for an access road which delayed
final completion by 20 months. The Fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was
financed in 1970 and is being implemented satisfactorily, although with some
delays and cost increases due to inflation and foreign exchange rate adjust-
ments. The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective
one year late due to Government administrative delays, but is now being im-
plemented satisfactorily, although also with some cost increases due to infla-
tion and foreign exchange rate adjustments. The cost overruns are being
covered by additional domestic financing. The Sixth Highway Project (Loan
990-YU, US$30.0 million) was signed on May 31, 1974 and is not yet effective.
Naftagas Project
3.        The loan for the Naftagas Project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million)
was made in June 1973, but due to organizational reforms within the Enter-
prises, and Government delay in ratifying the guarantee agreement, became
effective on March 22, 1974, after almost six months delay.
Railways
4.        The first railway loan was made in 1963 (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million)
to finance the completion of the Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge, with
electric traction and modern signalling and telecommunications equipment.
The project was substantially completed and put in operation in 1970, i.e.
with a delay of about two years.
5.        The second railway loan was made in 1964 to help finance a Moderni-
zation Program for the main lines (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million). The project
was to be executed between 1964 and 1968, at an estimated cost of US$185 mil-
lion; the Bank loan was US$70 million. The project is now expected to be



ANNEX 1
Page 2
completed at the end of 1976 at a total cost of about US$360 million (includ-
ing contingencies), twice the original estimate. The increase is due to
quantity increases and inflation, the latter due largely to the long delay
in completing the project.
6.        The third railway loan in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million) financed
the completion of 372 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with electric traction,
signalling and telecommunications equipment. Its completion was originally
scheduled for 1973, but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in
mountainous terrain are expected to delay operation of the line at least until
the middle of 1976. Also, the cost estimate has increased from US$225 million
to about US$300 million. SFRY, SR Serbia and Montenegro have already taken
measures to provide funds for all the works to be carried out in 1974, as
well as part of the works in 1975, further steps will be necessary to close
the remaining financing gap estimates at US$21 million.
7.        The fourth railway loan (1026-YU, US$93 million) for a modernization
program for main railway lines was signed on July 10, 1974 and it is not yet
effective.
8.        The first three railway projects experienced considerable difficul-
ties which resulted from (i) insufficient project preparation; (ii) declining
rail traffic due to increased road competition; (iii) transfer of responsibi-
lity from the Federal Government to the Republics and Provinces which created
some financial problems; and (iv) managerial difficulties. The Yugoslav
Government after discussing with the Bank agreed to take the measures required
to create more stable conditions for the railways and the railways agreed to
a more realistic investment plan and to an action plan to improve their manage-
ment. Subject to the Government and the railway implementing these measures,
there will be adequate finance for railway investment and substantially in-
formed management.

ANNEX 7
Page 1
APPRAISAL OF
TIlE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Present and Future Operations
A. Shipping
1.        The number of ships entering the Port in 1972 was about 400 and is
estimated to increase to about 1,400 in 1978 and 1,800 in 1980. According
to analysis made by Economic Bureau, there is not likely to be any fundamental
changes in the size of ships using the port in the period in 1980.
2.        Bulk cargo shipping should be spread evenly throughout the year at
about 15 - 18 vessels entering the port per month, but for general cargo there
are two peak periods at Yugoslav Adriatic ports. The main one is in July -
September arising from agricultural exports and imports of cotton and other
commodity; the lesser and occasional one is in November - December due to
enterprises endeavoring to achieve their planned target by the year end.
The summer peak could bring into Bar about 120 ships a month in 1978 and 160
a month in 1980. The respective numbers in the slackest periods may be about
50 to 70. The average cargo carried per ship is likely to vary between 300
and 1,000 tons for coasters and from 1,000 to 25,000 tons for general and bulk
cargo ships.
3.        The port has an additional pilot boat on order and can recruit
additional pilots as and when required. Two tugs are proposed for purchase
under the Project for assistance in handling ships. With these arrangements
the port does not anticipate any difficulties in dealing with the increased
amount of shipping.
B. Cargo Working
Present Situation
4.        In 1972, the total traffic was 810,000 tons of which 115,000 tons
was bulk oil, 350,000 tons dry bulk cargo and 345,000 tons general cargo.
This was handled as follows:

Pier 5 (coasters)                     68,000          78,000       146,000

The output for general and dry bulk cargo was about 91,000 tons per berth
and about 565 tons per meter of wharf.
5.        Cargo handling is carried out both on ship and on shore by port
staff. Normal working time is 42 hours per week on 5 days, there are two
shifts per day. Overtime can be worked at weekends and on an extra night
shift; at port or at ship cost. The port is able to engage extra temporary
workers, if required, during the summer peak periods.
6.        There are agreed norms for gang strengths and for outputs per gang
shift for various cargoes and for the various operations on the ship, on
the wharf apron and to and from storage shed and open stacking area.

7.        Norms are usually exceeded by an average of 30% but studies by
Economic Bureau indicate that still better overall outputs could be achieved
by improved operating methods and additional mobile equipment. Examples, for
complete movement, ship to storage area or vice versa, are:
Present             Possible        Percentage

8.        Existing shed and stacking areas are small for the number of berths
and because of the lack of alternative warehouse space, some goods remain for
long periods in the transit sheds. The overall result is that the throughput
of cargo is low but, on the other hand, has been adequate so far for the
present traffic offering.

9.        Future Situation:  The position will change radically with the
greatly increased traffic forecast after the opening of the Belgrade-Bar
Railway connection. Summarized from Table 1, the forecasts will require
cargo to be handled as follows:

(i) Bulk Cargo
10.       Bulk alumina, cement, oil and chemicals will continue to be handled
at the installations owned by the respective Enterprises, all in the Volujica
area. These are adequate for the tonnages forecast. Bulk liquid vegetable
oils will be stored in new tanks to be constructed adjacent to the liquid
chemical tanks. All dry bulk cargo operations will be transferred to the
area at Volujica where new wharves are being built. They are to be equipped
with a grain silo, phosphate store, open stacking for other commodities and
bulk handling equipment. The tonnages per year, per ship and outputs for
loading are given at Table 1 with the assessed number of ships and berth
days occupation per year. Summarized the latter are:



ANNEX 7
Page 4
1978      1980
Number of ships                                  173       193
Number of berth days occupation                 502        586
Number of berth days available                  875        875
Percentage berth occupation                       57        67
The maximum capacity of the berths and equipment, at about 90% berth occupation,
would be about 3.0 million tons. This could be increased further by occasional
third shift working but normally the period should be retained for routine
maintenance of equipment and to offset any delays through major breakdowns.
For traffic beyond 3.0 million per year additional wharfage will be required.
(ii) General Cargo
11.       The existing six berths will be used entirely for general cargo.
Additional mobile handling equipment, transit and storage shedding and par-
ticularly, improvement in handling methods, will improve the general cargo
capacity. However, the number of ships and the volume of cargo also requires
the provision of two deep water berths, with sheds, open stacking areas and
associated facilities. This would give a total of 8 berths and for the peak
months the position will be fully occupied 1/. That is, during peak seasons,
even with two additional berths, seven day a week general cargo operations
plus some additional third shift working, may be needed to avoid undue con-
gestion and ship waiting time. During other periods the percentage occupa-
tion would vary between 50 and 75%.
B. Storage
12.       With the provision of 3,800 m2 of transit shed and storage sheds,
there will be a 10% excess available in 1978 against peaks but by 1980 more
covered storage will be needed. For open storage the existing area surfaced
is about 7,000 m2 with other areas unsurfaced. An addition of 26,000 m2 of
surfaced space is proposed; of this some 2,000 m2 is intended for livestock,
giving 24,000 m2 net for general cargo which will be sufficient for the
level and structure of traffic expected until 1980.
C. Staff
13.       The increased traffic is assessed as requiring an increase in port
workers from 560 in 1973 to about 1,300 in 1978 and 1,500 in 1980. No prob-
lem is envisaged in recruiting additional staff. Output per worker will in-
crease from about 1,440 tons/year to about 2,690 tons/year in 1978 and 2,890
tons/year in 1980. The increase in staff and the changes in operations will,
1/   Based on 700 tons handled per ship per day.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
however, require both (a) intensive training of new and existing staff, and
(b) technical assistance on the introduction and development of the opera-
tional improvements. The traffic foreseen will also require seven days a
week operations, both on dry bulk and general cargoes, for continuous
periods. The port management consider this to be feasible with gangs work-
ing overlapping 5-day periods.
D. Railway
14.       RTE and Ekonomski Biro assess that 90% of port traffic will arrive
and depart by railway. At present with the railway serving Titograd and Niksic
only, the percentage is about 80%. The tonnage to be handled by rail will
then be about 3.1 million tons in 1978 and 3.8 million in 1980. RTE propose
to provide (i) a reception and dispatch yard to the east of the port and
(ii) three sets of distribution sidings immediately adjacent to the port.
The latter are intended to serve the (a) Pier 2 area; (b) Pier 1 area; and
(c) bulk cargo area.   The preliminary design of these facilities was re-
viewed by the mission and was found adequate to handle the traffic until 1980.

Tariffs
1.        The present tariff structure and level of rates for the Port of Bar
went into effect in September 1974, when the ports in Yugoslavia were allowed
to freely establish their charges.  Prior to this, proposed tariff increases
were subject to government review and approval before they could be implement-
ed. Over the last four years the Port of Bar has increased its tariffs four
times.
2.        The ports along the Eastern Adriatic coast operate in competition
with each other and tariff structure and level of charges are established by
reference to the two largest ports, Rijeka in Yugoslavia and Trieste in Italy.
The remaining ports in Yugoslavia set their tariffs approximately 10% to 20%
lower than those established by Rijeka. The present tariffs of the Port of
Bar are about 10% lower than those of Rijeka. However, with the completion
of the Belgrade-Bar Railway and the building of the facilities included in
the project, Bar will be in a much stronger competitive position with regard
to Rijeka, and it is expected that tariffs will be increased to the same
level as Rijeka's tariffs.
3.        The published Tariff Book for the Port of Bar lists charges for
the following activities: (Based on 1973 rates)
(i)  Stevedoring and Shorehandling of Cargo.  Per ton of cargo
listed by various commodities. The following movement of
goods are charged:
-    Ship's hold to/from ship's tackle
-    Ship's tackle to/from vehicles
-    Ship's tackle to/from warehouse
-    Warehouse to/from vehicle
(ii) Storage - Per ton of cargo and divided into either covered
or open storage. The charges are on an increasing scale
depending on the number of weeks of storage. One week of
free storage is given for imports and two weeks of free
storage for exports. This free storage time is reasonable
in light of the time necessary for the dispersal or assembly
of commodities and compares favorably to Rijeka where up to
4 weeks of free storage is given.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(iii) Ship Charges:
lWharfage. This is a charge to ships for the use of quay
and is charged per ton of cargo loaded or unloaded. Most
general cargo is charged 3.34 dinars per ton and most bulk
cargo is charged 2.58 dinars per ton.
Towage. Per tug boat hour and by tonnage of ship.
Pilotage. According to tonnage of ship.
Mooring and Unmooring. According to tonnage of ship.
Miscellaneous charges:
-    Berthage when a ship is not loading or unloading
cargo
-    Use of telephone, electricity and fresh water
-    Services in workshop
-    Sorting and other work on cargo
-    Palletizing of goods
-    Shifting cargo on ship
4.        The Port of Bar has also entered into contracts with four enter-
prises in Yugoslavia for the handling of their goods. The contract prices
for 1973 are:
(a) Scrap iron, raw iron and iron products - 40 dinars per ton.
(b) Alumina clay - 5.5 dinars per ton for a minimum of 160,000
tons.
(c) Import of copper at 30 dinars per ton and export of cable
at 78 dinars per ton.
(d) Oil and oil derivatives - 850,000 dinars for all shipments
in 1973.
5.        The present tariffs of the Port of Bar provide for charges for the
use of specific services and facilities, but they are not based on costs.
This results from the necessity of following the charges of other competitive
ports. Also, the present small size of the port and the inadequacies of the
present accounting system make it difficult to accumulate any cost informa-
tion and to establish cost centers.
6.        Technical assistance has been included in the project to improve
the accounting system and develop costing data. This will enable the Com-
mercial Department of the Port to work with meaningful cost information when



ANNEX 8
Page 3
they are renegotiating present contracts and negotiating new contracts for.
commodities that will be handled when the Belgrade-Bar Railway opens. It
will also alow the Port to review the adequacy of its published tariffs to
recover costs. However, until a review of the structure and costs of tariffs
for all the major Yugoslav ports is carried out and implemented, any changes
in tariffs that Bar may desire to make will be somewhat limited by the charges
of these other ports, especially Rijeka.

APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Existing and Future Facilities
A. General
1.        The Port of Bar lies at the southern end of a large bay, some 10 km.
long; the port is protected by a main breakwater of 1,300 m and a secondary
breakwater of 770 m. The bottom, mainly silty sand, varies in depth from 5
to 14 mi, work on deepening to the latter figure, (from 13 m) being still in
progress. No siltation is normally experienced. Tidal range is small, at
about 50 cm.  Maximum winds, force 8, are from the northeast from which the
bay is partly protected by the land to the north; maximum recorded wave
height outside the port has been about 5 m while inside wave action is small.
Bar is in an earthquake area, intensity 9 on the Richter scale.
B. Existing Facilities
2.        The principal existing facilities (see Map 10916) are:
(a)  Pier 2, a finger pier with water depth of 10 m with five ship
berths (total length 800 m); at present the north side is used
for general cargo and the end and south side for dry bulk
cargo, mainly mineral ores and scrap iron. There are three
transit sheds, each of about 3,500 m2 and four 3-ton and six
5-ton portal wharf cranes. Storage silos of 8,200 m3 capacity
and mechanical handling equipment are provided, for bulk
aluminia, by a separate enterprise.
(b)  A marginal single berth, 170 m long, with a water depth of 10 m
used for general cargo; a transit shed of 3,500 m2 is owned by
another enterprise, centro-textil and is used as a warehouse
for imported cotton bales.
(c) Additional storage to the rear of Pier 2 and the marginal quay;
there is one transit shed of 3,500 m2 and another 6,300 m2 under
construction. Adjacent to these is a multi-storied building
belonging to two enterprises, Centroprom and Agricombinat, and
used partly for storage and partly for produce processsing.
(d) A bulk oil tanker berth, recently constructed, with a depth of
14 m, on the main breakwater; piping to and storage tanks on
high ground at the inner and of the breakwater, belong to
Jugopetrol, the petrolewn enterprise.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(e) A quay 300 m long, at the inner end of the main breakwater
and with 5 m depth alongside, for small bulk cement ships;
the handling and the storage (2,500 m3 capacity) equipment
belong to the cement importing enterprise.
(f) A finger pier (Pier 5), 100 m long on the secondary break-
water with depths alongside of 4-6 m used for passenger ships
and ferries; these also lie alongside adjoining sections of
the breakwater.
(g)  Rear storage, consisting of a cold store, 13,000 m  capacity,
and a "Matrez" multi-storied warehouse, both belonging to
separate enterprises.
3.        Reclamation has been partly carried out in the past for Pier 1 but
is not at present used.  Also nearby, and below the "Volujica" hill, a wharf
structure 317 m long for two future bulk cargo berths, is now being built.
4.        Ships at anchor or awaiting berths use the anchorage in the bay and
outside the breakwater where there is ample room. Tug facilities are at pre-
sent provided by one old tug from a sea-going tug enterprise. The port has
one pilot launch.
5.        Port road and railway access and facilities are adequate for present
traffic.  Open stacking areas are also provided but are not now sufficient, es-
pecially for export timber traffic; they are also mainly unpaved and diffi-
cult for mechanical handling equipment.
6.        The existing mobile cargo handling equipment consists of the
following:
1 Mobile crane, 11 ton capacity
2 Mobile cranes, 3 ton capacity
2 Forklift trucks, 5 ton capacity
24 Forklift trucks, 2-3.5 ton capacity
7 Tractors, 32 Il.P.
4 Tractor trailers, 10 ton capacity
29 Tractor trailers, 5 ton capacity
C. Tute Project
7.        The project includes:
(a) Expropriation. A housing area, partly private and partly
municipal, exists below the "Volujica" hill and requires to
be cleared for the storage and road and rail facilities at
the new bulk cargo berths. The Commune of Bar is providing
a new site, with services for private development; residents



ANNEX 10
Page 3
removed receive compensation and can either build on this
land or rent municipal owned apartments. Some 130 houses
have already been replaced, with another 250 still to be
dealt with.
(b) Hostel Accommodation and Housing. The increase in port
operations will involve the worker strength being increased
from some 560 at present to about 1,200 in 1977-78. The
port now provides hostel accommodation for 100 men and will
have to provide accommodation in future for an additional
single 500 men. The port will also provide 250 apartments
for married workers.
(c) Infrastructure
(i) Excavation. The existing port area has been largely
formed by reclamation, the material coming from the
rocky Volujica hill on the south side; rock from here
was also used to form the breakwaters. Material will
continue to be excavated to carry on withl the formation
of Pier 1 (already partly filled), to the rear of the
two new general cargo berths to be constructed in the
present phase. Selected stone from this excavation
will also be used for concrete works, roadways and
open storage areas. The area being thus levelled, to
the rear of the new dry bulk carrier berths (para 5
below), will form the handling and storage areas for
the various bulk commodities.
(ii) Dredging. Under a contract starting in 1972, the entrance
channel to the port and the approaches to the new oil and
dry bulk cargo berths are being dredged (about 80%
complete) to give 14 m depth. There will remain a limited
amount of dredging to provide a depth of 13 m in the
vicinity of the new Pier 1; this work is not large and
should be continued by the existing contractor. The
material being dredge is a silty sand and is not suitable
for reclamation in the port; it is pumped over the main
breakwater for deposit in deeper water.
(iii) Bulk Wharf Extension. The original plan had been to
build, below the Volujica hill, (in 1972-73), two
berths with a wharf length of 396 m to take dry bulk
carriers up to 25,000 ton capacity. Due to the limited
funds available, however, the length, now being cons-
tructed was reduced to 317 m. The remaining 79 m needs
to be built to complete both the full wharf length and
the road and rail access to the berths. This extension
should be provided to the same design of structure as



ANNEX 10
Page 4
the present; concrete deck and beams carried on large
diameter reinforced concrete cylinders taken down to
the rock strata. The structure has been designed to
carry portal wharf cranes and also the seaward legs of
transporter bridges for the handling of bulk grain,
phosphate and bauxite.
(iv) New Wharves, Pier 1. The provision of wharves, storage
areas and handling equipment for dry bulk cargoes in
the Volujica area will enable the existing Pier 2 to be
used entirely for general cargo handling in future. The
level of general traffic forecast however will still
require the provision of additional ship berthing and
cargo handling room (see Annex 7 on operations). The
first two berths, totalling 330 m length, are therefore
to be constructed on the new south side of Pier 1. The
type of construction proposed is reinforced concrete
superstructure carried on large diameter cylinders. The
wharf structure is to be capable of carrying portal wharf
cranes and also container cranes should these be required
in future.
(v) Wharf Extension Pier 5. To cater for increasing passenger
and freight vehicle traffic and also for a new Italian
vehicular vessel, the port propose to construct additional
berthing facilities at the present passenger handling area,
Pier 5. This will be mainly a wharf extension of about
100 m, parallel to the secondary breakwater, with end-on
berthing facilities for the new roll-on roll-off Italian
ferry. The wharf wall will be constructed of mass concrete
blocks already available from a previous project, later
abandoned.
(d) Services
(i)  Water Supply and Drainage.  The extension of water supply
and drainage facilities to serve the extended port area
will be required. Drainage and sewage are handled in a
single system and are, at present, discharged into the
port area; the same occurs with discharge from the nearby
new and developing town area. The port and municipality
propose that a new main outfall will be taken by tunnel
under the Volujica hill for discharge into the open sea
to the southward. Later they proposed that a treatment



ANNEX 10
Page 5
works be added for full treatment of all effluent before
discharge, but this is not included in the present project.
(ii) A stream previously had its outlet into the port area
(Rena Creek) but was diverted by tunnel through the Volujica
hill. Trouble is still occasionally experienced from flood-
ing of the stream channel and some additional work is
necessary to protect the port area.
(iii) Power Supply and Cormmunications. The electric power
supply will also require extension to serve the enlarged
area and increased equipment. The existing rnain supply,
also serving the commune area, is not reliable with
seasonal liimitations on utilization. The port therefore
proposes to provide additionally its own generator and
transformers for its own requirements.
(iv) The itema for communications is mainly to cover the
extension of the internal telephone system to the new
wharves, sheds, etc. and to provide a fire alarm system
for the whole port area.
(v)  Railway Tracks.  The arrangement agreed between the port
and the railway (RTE) enterprise is that the port will
provide the tracks serving the various port facilities,
with the RTE being responsible for the groups of marshal-
ling sidings and for the main freight train reception and
dispatch yard. Rails on the wharf structures will be
laid directly on the concrete decks while elsewhere they
will be carried on impregnated local timber sleepers.
(vi)  Roads and Parking.  The present elementary road system in
the port area will require considerable enlargement to
serve all the extended facilities; hard surface parking
areas for freight vehicles and for staff and public will
also be provided.
(vii)  Workshops.  The existing port workshops for the maintenance
of mechanical hancdling equipment are small and will require
enlargement and particularly the addition of more machine
tools to handle the increased amount of equipment.
(viii) Ilarbor Oil Protection. There is a need to protect the
port sea area from contanmination by oil spillage from
tankers at the bulk oil berth and also by waste and
garbage from ships at the cargo berths. Equipment is to
be provided in accordance with recommendations made by
consultants (Industra - projekt, Zagreb) during 1973.



ANNEX 10
Page 6
(e) Storage
(i) Grain Silos and Natural Oil Tanks. The first phase,
capacity 30,000 tons of grain silos is to be constructed
adjacent to the new dry bulk cargo berths; the ultimate
capacity will be 100,000 tons. The silos, including
equipment, are to be provided in partnership with the
grain handling enterprise, Matrez, which will contribute
towards the cost. The design will be prepared by con-
sultants, to be appointed by the port, in agreement with
Matrez which will provide the outline requirements.
(ii) Four oil tanks, with a total capacity of 20,000 tons,
for vegetable oils and molasses, will also be provided
in partnership with Matrez.
(iii) Storage Sheds and Stacking Areas. Considerable exten-
sion of the transit storage sheds and open stacking
will be needed to cater for the general cargo traffic
forecast at 1978. A large amount of container traffic
is not anticipated until at least this time. Provision
is accordingly made for about 21,000 m2 of transit
shedding, 17,000 m2 of storage shedding and 26,000 mn2
of hard surfaced open stacking areas. Additionally a
bulk phosphate store of about 3,400 m2 will be constructed
at the dry bulk cargo berths. All shedding will be de-
signed with clear level floors for ease of cargo handling
by mobile equipment. The storage shedding will be used
initially for both short- and long-term storage but the
port will encourage enterprises using the port, after the
opening of the railway to Belgrade, to build their own
long-term shedding for storage and processing; this will
then enable the port to concern itself mainly with transit
and short-term storage for goods awaiting on-ward land
transport or shipmenit. There will be adequate land avail-
able for public storage facilities in the rear port area
and the port has the right to lease such land to other
users.
(i)  Bulk Cargo Wharves.  The main equipment proposed is three
travelling transporter bridges, complete with ship off-
loading and loading gear and conveyors, one to handle
grain, one for bauxite, and the third for phosphate.
There will also be five portal 8 ton cranes to deal with
scrap iron, coal/coke and metal ingots. Molasses and
vegetable oils will be handled by pumps and pipelines.
Economic Bureau's proposals for the equipment are to be
checked by seeking advice from foreign mechanical handling
experts before details are finalized and bids called for.



ANNEX 10
Page 7
(ii) General Cargo Wharves. Four 5 ton portal cranes are
proposed for the two new general cargo wharves at Pier 1.
Additionally a considerable increase is proposed in the
port fleet of mobile cranes, fork lift trucks, palettes,
tractors and trailers to increase the potential output
per hatch hour between wharves, sheds and stacking grounds.
Road/rail tractors are allowed to enable the port to make
local movements of railway wagons, especially at the wharves
and transit sheds. Provision is also made for weighing
scales for use in sheds and tarpaulines for covering cargo
temporarily outdoors.
(iii) Tug Boats. The existing arrangement by which one tug
is provided by an Adriatic deep sea towing enterprise
is not satisfactory because the vessel is not under
port control, is old, unreliable and not powerful enough
to handle the bigger ships in strong winds. There will
also be an increasing number of ships, especially bulk
carriers using the port. Provision is therefore made
for the port to have two tugs under its own control for
future operations.
(iv) Spares. The large increase of mechanical equipment
will involve the build up of stocks of normal operational
spare parts. Provision is accordingly made for initial
supply to cover the first two years.
(g) Consultants/Technical Assistance. The port management will
continue the services of general consultants to assist in the
general planning of the project and also for short-term (2 years)
technical assistance to develop and improve the management, ope-
rations and financial control of the port. Additionally, the
port will engage technical consultants for the detailed design
and documentation of: (i) new deep water wharf structures, (ii)
transit and storage shedding, (iii) grain silos and natural oil
storage tanks and (iv) bulk handling equipment.
(h) Railway. The RTE will be responsible for principal railway
freight wagon operations within the port and particularly
for the distribution of wagons between the various main
areas and for the reception and dispatch of freight trains
from and to the interior. For this purpose it will provide
three groups of marshalling sidings adjacent to the port
and, further to the eastward, a group of reception and dis-
patch tracks. The RTE siding and yard additions will require
about 20 track km of rail. RTE proposes that new rail be
obtained and be installed on the main Titograd/Bar line;
second-hand rail released would then be used for the sidings



ANNEX 10
Page 8
and yards. The remainder of the rail Titograd/Bar is con-
pidered by RTE to be adequate for traffic until towards 1985.
Some additional expropriation of housing will be involved
at the site of the port marshalling sidings and reception
and dispatch yard. This will be dealt with in the same way
as the main expropriation at para. 1 above.

ANNEX 16
APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Bases and Assumptions Used in Financial Analysis
1.        Operating revenues and expenses have been calculated using 1973
tariffs and costs, escalated to account for 1974 tariff increase and infla-
tion. Commencing in 1976, wage expense has been calculated using the cur-
rent average Yugoslav wage paid to various categories of port workers, which
is higher than those presently paid by the Port.
2.        In order to keep the financial projections in constant 1974 terms,
price contingencies have been excluded from fixed assets. Depreciation on
new assets to be acquired thus has been calculated on 1974 costs. Price
contingencies also have been excluded from debt service calculations so that
these figures are also in constant 1974 terms.
3.        The present work under construction has been assumed to be complet-
ed and capitalized as a fixed asset on January 1, 1975. The breakwater
presently in work in progress is assumed to be capitalized as of January 1,
1976 and maximum depreciation taken for 1976 and subsequent years.
4.        Contributions for housing funds have been calculated according to
the legal requirements. Contributions for the workers' common assets were
based on the estimates made by the consultants.
5.        Income taxes were calculated according to the law that came into
effect for 1974 and subsequent years.
6.        The terms and conditions used for the long-term debt are:
-    IBRD Loan - Interest at 8%, repayable in 42 semi-annual
instalments, first payment October 1, 1978.
-    Investment Bank of Titograd - Interest at 8%, repayable
in 20 semi-annual instalments, first payment December 31,
1977.
-    Directorate:  D 30 million at 2% interest repayable in 60
semi-annual instalments, first payment December 31, 1978.
D 10 million at 8% interest repayable in 20 semi-annual
instalments, first payment December 31, 1978.
7.        For the construction work necessary in 1978-80 costing D 220 mil-
lion, it has been assumed that government grants will be made in the same
proportion as for the present project. The remaining funds required (D 170
million) have been assumed to come from internally generated funds.

ANNEX 20

APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Port Service Area
A. General
1.        The Port of Bar currently serves a small hinterland along the rail
connections to Titograd and Niksic (see Map IBRD 10918). Road connections
with the rest of Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia exist, but roads are rough
due to mountainous terrain and are subject to temporary closures during the
winter timne. Once the Belgrade-Bar line is open, at the end of 1975, the
potential hinterland of the Port of Bar will include the Republics of Monte-
negro, Serbia and Macedonia and the Autonomous Provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina.
2.        The limits of the Port of Bar service area have been determined on
the basis of transport distances from tlie main urban centers to existing
Ports, Rijeka and Ploce and to the Port of Bar. These distances have been
calculated using existing railway routes and the Belgrade-Bar line route.
While the differential is important for Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo, it is
less si-nficant for the northiern part of the service area, particularly
Vojvodina (Table 1). The miiost likely alternative to Bar is the Port of
Rijeka.
B. The Transport System in the Service Area
3.        The port service area includes 47, of total railway track in
Yugoslavia, (Belgrade-bar line excluded) and 49% of roads. It accounts for
about 40% of total rail traffic, passengers and freight and for about 50%
of total road traffic.  The Port of Bar is the only port located within the
service area anid it accounted for only 3%' of total port traffic in 1971.
MIore detailed figures are given in Table 2.
4.        Main cities in the service area are or will be connected to the
railway system, after the completion of the Belgrade-Bar line.  Road connec-
tions are relatively good in the northern part of the service area, but are
poor in the soutlhern part and are not expected to improve substantially in
the foreseable future.



ANNEX 20
Page 2
C. Economic Potential of the Service Area
5.        The Port of Bar service area covers about half of the territory
of FR Yugoslavia, with about half the population. The whole area includes
two of the less-developed regions; SR Montenegro and SAP Kosovo, in 1971 it
accounted for about 40% of Gross Material Product (GMP).
(i) Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry
6.        The northern part of the service area include some of the richest
agricultural regions of Yugoslavia, Vojvodina in Serbia, together with
Slovenia represent only one sixth of the country total area but contain near-
ly a third of the arable land and produce more than half of the country's
output of wheat and corn and over three quarters of its sugar beet. The
hills in Serbia are important for livestock raising and fruit production.
Cereals are grown in river valleys. The mountainous part is generally un-
favorable for crop production but extensive pasture make possible livestock
raising (Table 3). There is also an important potential in forestry exploit-
ation and development along the Belgrade-Bar line.
7.        The northern part of the service area is fairly well developed but
the southern part (SR Montenegro and SAP Kosovo) has not yet been reached by
modern methods of production. The main constraints for further development
are: (i) lack of capital; (ii) lack of credit facilities for the purchase
of better quality inputs, seeds and fertilizers; (iii) poor mechanization;
and (iv) lack of extension services. These weaknesses have been identified
in the "green plan" and concrete steps are to be taken in the near future to
improve the situation (see Basic Economic Report 194a-YU, November 26, 1973).
It is expected that these measures, and the completion of the Belgrade-Bar
line and of the project, will help the opening of these less-developed areas.
(ii) Industry and Mining
8.        A large part of the Yugoslav industry is located within the service
area (Table 4) which is particularly important in coal, crude oil and mineral
production, food processing and fertilizer production. The large potential
in wood processing and paper production is presently under exploited.
9.        Except for non-ferrous metallurgy, most of the industries are rely-
ing on imports (iron ore and scrap iron for Smederevo and Niksic plants,
phosphate for the fertilizer industry, raw edible oil for refining, etc.).
Exports are limited to steel products, processed food, timber and non-ferrous
ores. Presently raw materials are imported through northern Adriatic ports
and transported overland by rail to eastern Yugoslavia. In most cases, the
Port of Bar is a better alternative to the users.
10.       The main expected developments are in non-ferrous metallurgy, food
processing, clothing and fertilizers and there are indications that enter-
prices are taking steps to develop their production.

In addition the area is rich in bauxite which could be profitably exported,
in 1971, 1.75 million tons were exported, of which 220,000 tons went through
Bar. It is expected that exports will remain at the same level in the future
and that the Port of Bar will capture most of the traffic.
D. Conclusions
11.       The service area has a potential for economic development, although
in some less-developed areas, it might take some time to materialize. It is
presently relatively isolated from other regions and there is little doubt
that an integrated transport system giving access to the coast will help
promote new activities which otherwise would have been located somewhere else
or would not have been created at all. However, the impact of these new
activities would only be felt progressively in the less-developed regions,
since potential investors would probably wait until the link between the
Adriatic Coast and Belgrade is completed before making any decision to locate
large capacities in the area.

APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Traffic Projections
A. General
1.        Traffic projections prepared by the Port of Bar with the assistance
of the Economic Bureau (Belgrade) are based on results of discussions with
future users of the port and with the main associations of importers and
exporters which together account for about 80% of the projected traffic in
1980. These projections have been reviewed by the mission and checked
against previous Bank reports and are considered reasonable.  A summary of
future traffic is given below for main commodities or group of commodities.
B. Total International Traffic Expected Through the Port of Bar
2.        Agricultural Products:  The main products likely to go through Bar
are: grains, edible oil and molasses, fruit, vegetable and processed food
wood, and agricultural inputs (cattle food, seeds, fertilizers ...).
(i) Grain - (corn and wheat)
In the past Yugoslavia has been a traditional exporter of
corn and importer of wheat mostly from the U.S.A. The
"Green Plan" projections indicate that by 1985 there should
be a surplus of corn which will be exported to Western
European countries of which 200,000 tons p.a. will be
exported to Southern Italy through Bar by 1980. Although
Yugoslavia should achieve self-sufficiency in wheat
production by 1975, it is expected that by 1980 about
100,000 tons of wheat will be imported annually through
Bar to complement local production in certain qualities
of wheat.
(ii) Edible Oil
Yugoslavia has always been a large consumer of animal fats
and edible oil, however over the years, the structure of
consumption changed in favor of vegetable oil. More than
two-thirds of the raw oil (soya and sunflower) imported is
refined within the Port of Bar service area.

Other edible oil                             7.1    9.7
The predominance of vegetable oil is likely to continue and
it is expected that by 1980 about 80,000 tons of raw oil as
well as 45,000 tons of molasses will be imported through Bar.
(iii) Fruit, Vegetables, and Processed Food
Yugoslavia is a major exporter of fresh and dried fruit
(plums, apricots, strawberries ...). In 1972, about 45,000
tons were exported mostly to western Europe, of which about
4,000 tons will be exported to Italy annually through Bar.
Consumption of tropical and citrus fruit has been increasing
from 119,000 tons in 1969 to 166,000 tons in 1972 at an
average rate of 12X p.a. Most of these fruits are
presently imported through Rijeka and transported by road
and rail to the main consumption centers. The main importers
consider that once the Belgrade-Bar line and the Port of Bar
are open to traffic about 40% of their products could be
imported through Bar, thus saving in transportation cost
and reducing losses due to long travelling time. Total
imports through Bar are estimated at about 120,000 tons
in 1980.
(iv)  Other Food Products, Beverages and Tobacco
Traffic estimates for these products are based on discussions
with the main importers (Centroprom, Granexport and Pik-Pec.)
and reflect their judgement as to what volume of traffic could
be diverted to Bar or generated in the area. These projections
are considered reasonable.

(v)  Cattle Food, Seeds
Yugoslavia is a net importer of cattle food and exporter of
seeds. The main part of these products comes from or is
destined to overseas countries and is presently processed
tihrough north Adriatic ports.  It is expected that by 1980,
a total volume of 170,000 tons will go through the Port of
Bar.

(vi)  Wlood and Wlood Products
Total trade for wood and wood products amounted to 2.1 million
tons in 1972 (1.4 million tons for export, 0.7 million tons
for imports), and consisted mostly of pulp wood, import of
exotic wood from Gabon and Ivory Coast and Timber. A large
part of these products are used in the Port of Bar service
area which accounts for 25 to 50% of the production of semi-
finished and finished wood products and paper. It is expected
that by 1980 about 90,000 tons of import of raw material and
about 40,000 tons of exports of finished products will be
diverted to Bar.



ANNEX 21
Page 4
(vii) Fertilizers and Plhosphates
Yugoslavia is a net exporter of manufactured fertilizers,
however, the export potential of the Port of Bar is limited.
Despite the number of fertilizer, plants located in the
service area tle main exporter, IPrahilavo, uses the Danube
and Black Sea ports. Total export through Bar should not
exceed 60,000 tons in 1980. The other plants, Zorka, Sabac
and Subotica and Kosovska Mtitrovica depend entirely on
imported phosphates for their production.  Raw phosphates
are presently imported through the Port of Sibenik which
has no adequate bulk handling facilities. The three
manufacturers have indicated their intention to use Bar
as soon as the facilities included in the project are ready
and the Belgrade-bar line is open to traffic. Total imports
based on the development plans of these plants would amount
to about 1.0 million tons in 1980.
!aw VLaterials and Semi-Finished Products
3.        The nmain raw materials likely to be handled through the Port of
Bar are: bauxite and non-metallic ores, scrap iron and other semi-finished
ietal products.
(i)  Bauxite and Alumina
Total bauxite commercial reserves in the service area exceed
30 million tons. Production which is presently about 350,000
tons p.a. is projected to increase up to about 1.0 million
tons bv 1980, 80%' of which will be used to supply industrial
plants in the service area, the remainder will be exported
thlrough bar. Aluraina is produced in the service area to
supplv aluminium plants, there is presently an excess capacity
of about 100,000 tons which is presently and will continue
to be exported through Bar.
(ii)  Scrap Iron and Semi-Finished Steel Products
The steel industry in Yugoslavia lacks raw materials and semi-
finislied products and over a million tons of these products
were imported in 1972.  There are three steel plants in the
service area (Niksic, Smederevo, and Skopje) which together
account respectively for 30%, 20%' and 60% of the domestic
production of pig iron, rolled semi-finished products and
special steel. All three mills are presently expanding their
capacity whicii by 1980 should reachi about 1.7 million tons
p.a. compared to 750,000 tons in 1972.  The supply and demand
programs of these firms show that from 1976 to 1980 the fol-
lowing quantities will be exported or imported through Bar.

Chemical Products
The main chemical products are sulphuric acid, caustic
soda and aluminium chloride which in 1980 will amount to
10,000 tons of exports and 60,000 tons of imports.
C.   Coastal Traffic
4.        The main commodities transported by coasters are, oil products
froma the Rijeka refinery, cement fron Split, and some general cargo, (mostly
agricultural products and supplies). Except for oil products traffic which
is expected to grow at about 14% p.a. between 1973 and 1980, other traffic
is not expected to grow substantially.



ANNEX 21

D.   Transit Traffic
5.        The best opportunity for transit traffic are with Romania, which
although it has port facilities on the Black Sea could use the Port of Bar
and the Belgrade-Bar line to supply the western part of its territory. On
the basis of sea and overland distances Bar is an attractive alternative to
the Port of Constanza, however, the final volume of traffic will depend on
negotiations presently underway between the Port of Bar, the Railway and
Romanian authorities.
6.        Prospects for Bulgaria and Hungary are much dimer, Bulgaria uses
and will continue to use its own ports as they provide shorter routes.
Hlungary which has no access to the Adriatic Sea will continue to use Rijeka
or Triest for the major part of its requirements. On the basis of preliminary
discussions transit traffic, which will consist of general cargo has been
estimated to 60,000 tons in 1976 growing up to 165,000 tons in 1980. Al-
though these figures are considered conservative by RTE Belgrade, it is not
expected that under the most favorable circumstances transit traffic could
grow beyond 300,000 tons in 1980. For the purpose of the evaluation the
lower estimate has been retained.
E. Summary and Conclusions
7.        Total traffic, by type is given in Table 1 for the years 1974 to
1980 and can be summarized as follows:
1973   1976   1978   1980
_____ _~00 -   tons -
Oil products          150    250    290    380
Liquid bulk            -      117    155    175
Dry bulk              375  1,290  2,001  2,385
General cargo         315    545  1,056  1,387
Total            840  2,182  3,502  4,327
The main increase is in bulk cargo, which will consist mainly of phosphates,
grains, scrap iron and semi-finished steel products and bauxite and will
be handled by specialized facilities.
8.        Part of this traffic can be considered as natural growth of
existing traffic or as traffic generated in the service area, while the
other part can be considered as traffic diverted from other ports. The
distinction between the two kinds of traffic is somewhat arbitrary since the
reasons for the users to use one or another alternative are not always
rational. However, it has been estimated, and this has been confirmed by
interviews with future users of the Port of Bar, that users will divert
traffic from alternative ports when: (i) the financial incentive to do so
is large enough; and (ii) when operating conditions in Bar are superior to
those existing in other ports.



ANNEX 21
Page 7
9.        On the basis of distances and assuming that port charges at Bar
would be similar and possibly lower than at competitive ports, (Rijeka
and Ploce), most users do have a financial incentive to switch over to Bar.
Calculated according to existing tariffs transport savings would amount to
the following:
1976              1978              1980
Rijeka   Ploce   Rijeka   Ploce   Rijeka   Ploce
---------------- -000 dinars ----------------
Imports         19,500  27,500   44,700  63,000   52,250  73,800
Exports          9,300  12,500   24,600  29,600   29,500  37,600
Total     29,300  40,000   69,300  92,600   81,750  11,400
Direct savings to the users amount to about 30% of the total transport
cost which is substantial.  For some commodities (phosphates, scrap iron)
the savings would be greater since alternative ports are Sibenik and Zadar
rather than Rijeka.
10.       The quality of service should also improve considerably for the
users of the Port of Bar against other ports, and more particularly Rijeka.
For bulk cargo, Bar will be equipped with modern handling equipment and
is e;pected to operate more efficiently than most other ports. This is
particularly true for phosphates which are presently handled by inadequate
facilities at Sibenik (users have been reviewing their contract on an
annuial basis in order to take advantage of the bar facilities as soon as
they are operating) and for edible oil which is handled at Zadar where
there are no proper storage facilities.
11.       According to the above, it is estimated that traffic would be
distributed between existing diverted and generated as follows:
1976               1978                 1980
'000 tons   /o   '000 tons    %    '000 tons    %

Diverted traffic        855       44      1,929      60      2,330       59

ANNEX 22
Page 1
APPRAISAL OF
THE PORT OF BAR
YUGOSLAVIA
Basis for the Economic Evaluation
A. General
1.        The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of the situation
which would prevail if the proposed project is not undertaken and the situa-
tion which would prevail after the project is completed. The economic life
of the project is considered to be of 25 years of age on an average, however,
it has been assumed that traffic will remain constant beyond 1980. This as-
sumption is conservative, but is justified by the present lack of knowledge
on the development plans of other ports in Yugoslavia.
B. Project Cost
2.        The total project cost excluding custom duties, taxes and price con-
tingencies is D 880.0 million equivalent to US$58.2 million. Railway facilities
outside the custom area have been included since they will be required in con-
nection with port traffic. Additional investments after the completion of the
project have not been included with the exception of those required to replace
project items and existing facilities. The project cost excludes the cost of
silos and edible oil tanks which are to be built in the port area on account
of the Directorate. The decision to build these facilities was taken by the
Directorate and only their location was in question. The economic justifica-
tion of building these facilities was not appraised, and the present evalua-
tion only measures the relative benefits of locating them at Bar instead of
at another Port (Rijeka).
3.        No attempt was made to shadow price land since there are no immediate
alternative uses for land allocated to port development. Past investments have
been considered as sunk costs.
C. Project Benefits
4.        Benefits of the projects are:  (i) savings in operating costs; (ii)
savings in overland transport costs; and (iii) net revenues derived from trans-
it to llungary and Czechoslovakia.



ANNEX 22
Page 2
(i) Saving in Operating Costs
Once the proposed project is completed, direct operating costs
are expected to amount to about D 20/ton of cargo which will
compare favorably with the present situation at Bar (D 30/ton)
and other Yugoslav ports (D 50/ton on average). Savings in
operating costs have been calculated at D 10/ton for local
traffic at Bar and at D 30/ton for diverted traffic for the
economic life of the project as reduction in operating costs
in competitive ports would imply further investments which
have not been taken into account.
(ii) Savings in Overland Transport Costs
Distances from Bar to Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo are shorter
than those from alternative ports. Savings in overland trans-
port costs were calculated on the basis of origin and destina-
tion for the years 1976, 1978 and 1980 for diverted and gen-
erated traffic only.
Resulting savings in terms of ton-km are as follows:
1976      1978       1980
Million ton-km ----
Serbia
North                                36.0       84.0      100.0
Southl                               50.0       86.0       95.0
Subtotal                        86.0      170.0     195.0
Macedonia                                  24.0      48.0       48.0
Kosovo                                     45.0      90.0      110.0
Total                          155.0      308.0     393.0
The savings in railway operating cost (fuel and other consumable)
have been estimated at D 0.17/ton-km on the basis of re-evaluated
fuel prices to take into account recent changes in world petroleum
prices (taxes have been excluded).
(iii) Income from Transit Traffic
The income, net of direct operating costs, has been calculated
on the basis of present tariffs applied by RTE Belgrade for
freight. Since transit will remain marginal, compared to
total traffic on the Belgrade-Bar line no provision was made
for additional maintenance cost on the line.



ANNEX 22
Page 3
D. Non-Quantifiable Benefits
5.        Although the use of the Port of Bar will reduce ship turn around time
compared to the use of alternative ports, these benefits have not been taken
into account for the following reasons: (i) due to competition between Yugoslav
ports, it has not been possible to obtain reliable data on shipping patterns;
and (ii) PBE will not be able to charge higher tariffs than competing ports
and, therefore, recover a substantial portion of the benefits accruing to
foreign shipping organizations as a result of reduced congestion in the
Yugoslav ports.
