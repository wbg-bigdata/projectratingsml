MEMORANDUM AND RECOMKENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS, Srs
FOrt A TELECOMNUNICATIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servlicos Publlcos, SNC (BANOBRAS) for the
equivalent of $22.0 million to help finance a telecommunications technical
assistance project. The loan would be repaid over 17 years, including 5 years
of grace, at the standard variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan
would be on-lent to the Government for its Secretaria de Comunlcaciones y
Transportes (SCT).
Backg-round
2.        Mexico's present telecommunications system is a major constraint to
economic growth. There are over 1.5 million applications for telephone
service awaiting installation and many more potential subscribers that do not
bother to apply given long delays in obtaining service. Telephone service is
also of poor quality, unreliable, and the network is heavily congested with
the result that it is virtually impossible to get through during peak business
hours. In the recent past, Telefonos de Mexico S.A. de C.V. (TELMEX), which
has a monopoly in the provision of telephone services, has installd about
230,000 lines per year, which barely keeps up with the growth of demand. More
advanced services (e.g., data transmission, cellular telephony, access to
time-shared data processing and data banks) are only starting to develop.
Given Mexico's drive to open its economy, it is becoming increasingly
important to ensure that business firms operating throughout Mexico have
access to state-of-the-art telecommunications and information services, and
that households gain access to markets and business activities through a more
effective basic telephone infrastructure.
3.        Until 1972, TELMEX was controlled and managed by the private sector
and still today 49 percent of its stock is publicly traded, while the other 51
percent is held by the Government. TELMEX is run as a government enterprise.
Its tariffs, investment decisions, finances and management are constrained by
the same factors as in other parastatal enterprises. A government ministry,
the SecretarLa de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) is responsible for
telecommunications sector policy and regulation. The latter includes
licensing of telecommunications networks, approval of customer premises
equipment, and planning, administering and monitoring the use of the radio
spectrum. Until late 1989, SCT also had direct operational responsibility for
the provision of some services (mainly telex and data transmission), and
operated a sizeable but antiquated microwave network, a modern and
underutilized domestic satellite system, and a network of maritime coastal
stations. These operations are now undertaken by the newly created state-
owned, commercially oriented entity, Telecomunicaciones de Mexico (TELECOMN).
4.        Government Strategy.  The Government has decided that a major effort
to step up the pace of telecommunications development is required and has set
as a goal an investment program of $10 billion over 6 years (1989-94). This



- 2 -
would allow increasing the telephone density from about 5.3 lines per 100
inhabitants (end-1988) to 8.4 in 1994. To achieve this objective, the
Government is initiating a far-reaching program of reforms of the telecommuni-
cations sector involving privatization of TELMEX, commercialization of
remaining government telecommunications operations and creation of a modern
regulatory framework that promotes competition in the sector and protects the
public interest from potential monopoly abuses.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  This proposed technical assistance
loan is linked to the telecommunications component of the proposed Road
Transport and Telecommunications Sector Adjustment Loan, which is being
processed in parallel. Together, these two loans will support the
restructuring of the Mexican telecommunications service sector. In
particular, once TEU4EX is privatized, technical assistance will be required
to support a regulatory capability to promote competition in the sector and to
control potential monopoly abuses in pricing and the provision of service.
Further, the loan will support the modernization of SCT's management and
monitoring of the radioelectric spectrum. Finally, the loan will support the
business development of the newly created TELECOMM, which could become an
important player in the development of competition in the sector. As a result
of the Bank's involvement in the design of the sector adjustment program and
the important policy commitments under it, the Bank is in a unique position to
provide assistance in the areas outlined above. The proposed project will be
the Bank's first operation in the sector. The Interamerican Development Bank
(IDB), which would co-finance the adjustment program, would also collaborate
to meet technical assistance needs by funding urgently needed short-term
experts from a non-reimbursable project preparation facility which it
administers.
6.        Project Obiectives.  The proposed project will:
(a) assist SCT's Direccion General de PolutIcas y Normas de
Comunicaclones (DGPNC) to strengthen its capability to regulate
telecommunication services and networks;
(b) assist SCT's DGPNC in (i) modernizing and improving its
administrative and technical capability to plan and control the use
of the radio spectrum, and (ii) establishing a computer-assisted
radio-frequency spectrum management and monitoring system; and
(c) assist TELECOMK in developing its business activities as a
competitive entity in a restructured environment.
7.        Proiect Description.  The project consists of three components.
(a) Regulation of Services and Networks (29 percent of total costs).
This work would be undertaken in three stages. In Stage 1, already
under way, short-term experts on telecommunications pricing and on a
regime for authorizing different categories of networks and services
are helping the Government to finalize the draft TELMEX license and
the regulations for competitive services. In Stage 2, a consulting
firm would prepare a program to strengthen SCT's capability to
regulate telecommunications networks and services and help prepare



- 3 -
initial implementation.  In Stage 3, experts, training, equipment
and other technical support to SCT required to implement the first
two years of the program would be provided.
(b) RegulatLon of the Radio Spectrum (69 percent of total costs).  This
work would be undertaken in two stages. In Stage 1 (already under
way), a short-term expert would prepare an assessment of existing
capabilities and ongoing work, write terms of reference for
consultants and provide a tentative estimate of the composition and
cost of a modernization and improvement program. In Stage 2, a
consulting firm would prepare a plan for the modernization and
improvement of SCT management and monitoring of the radio spectrum,
prepare a detailed specification and costing of equipment and
training required, and assist with the procurement of equipment and
its installation. The consultants would also provide technical
support to DGPNC during the first two years of implementation of the
modernization program.
(c) TELECOMM--Business Develooment (2 percent of total costs). This
project component would provide assistance by consultants in
planning the expansion and modernization of TELECOMM's satellite
system and other transmission facilities, assessing the market
potential of new services, and exploring opportunities for joint
ventures.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at about $24.3 million.
Two components of the project (i.e., (a) regulation of services and networks
and (b) regulation of the radio spectrum) will be administered by DGPNC. The
third component of the project, TELECONM business development, will be
administered by TELECOMN. The project would be completed by December 31, 1993
and the closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1994. Retroactive
financing as from February 28, 1990 would be provided. Procurement and
engagement of consultants would follow Bank guidelines. The detailed cost
estimates, methods of procurement, and disbursements are shown in Schedules A
and B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D. A detailed project
description is given in Annex 1. The proposed chronology for the project is
provided in Annexes 2 and 3. Terms of reference are provided in Annex 4.
Organization charts of SCT and TELECOMM are provided in Annexes 5 and 6.
Background documentation available in the project file is listed in Annex 7.
9.        Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, final agreement was reached on the
terms of reference for the consultants that would assist SCT to strengthen its
regulatory capacity and its effectiveness in planning and controlling use of
the radio frequency spectrum (Annex 4). SCT also agreed to furnish quarterly
reports on the execution of the project and to hold annual consultations with
the Bank on the progress achieved in developing its regulatory capacity,
which, if necessary, could lead to a reformulation of its plans and of the
staffing needs. Effectiveness of the sector adjustment loan is a condition of
effectiveness of this loan. Execution of satisfa-tory on-lending arrangements
between BANOBRAS and the Government is also a condition for loan
effectiveness.



10.       Benefits.  The proposed technical assistance loan will assist the
development of a regulatory capability at SCT which is critical to the overall
success of the TELMSX privatization and the Government's efforts to develop
competition in the sector. Further, it will improve sCTVs ability to monitor
and control use of the radio spectrum and, thereby, expedite increased use of
private user networks and improve the utilization of the limited radio
spectrum. Finally, the technical assistance will contribute to the necessary
rapid development of TELECONM's strategic business development, which in turn
would contribute to the development of competition in the sector and spur
TELMEX to improve its performance.
11.       Risks.  Project-related risks would be very limited, given its
nature. However, the breadth of the policy reforms that are being undertaken
does entail risks. First, it is important to ensure that the divestiture of
the Government's controlling interest in TEU4EX is 'well" handled, since this
is the largest parastatal to be privatized and all aspects of the operation
will be particularly scrutinized by opponents of the Government's
privatization policies. Errors in this respect could jeopardize attempts in
other sectors. Second, the Government does not now have staff with adequate
experience to regulate public utilities, and the   gulatory framework is still
in an inception stage. Third, there are practica_ and financial limits to the
pace at which investments in telephone services may proceed, even under
private ownership. These risks seem manageable. They are alleviated to some
extent by this proposed technical assistance project and are outweighod by the
potential benefit of the reform process Lhat is under way. Evidence of
government commitment is strong and is reflected in the important policy
decisions already undertaken under the secLor adjustment project.
11. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would o *ply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Exe   ive
Directors approve it.

MEXICO
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN FOR THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
TECHNICAL ANNEX
A. Backgroand
1.          Overview.  The program of technical assistance for the
telecommunications sector to be financed by the proposed IBRD technical
assistance loan is closely linked to the telecommunications component of the
proposed Road Transport and Telecommunications Sector Adjustment Loan (Report
No. PE-5254-M, dated April, 1990). Together, these two loans will support
far-reaching reforms in the Mexican telecommunications sector involving
privatization of the dominant telecommunications service provider, TELMEX,
commercialization of remaining government telecommunications operations, and
creation of a modern regulatory framework that promotes competition in the
sector and protects the public interest from potential monopoly abuses. The
program of technical assistance would cover three areas: (a) SCT regulation
of telecommunications networks and services, (b) SCT regulation of the radio
spectrum, and (c) TELECOMM business development. Following preparation
assistance in early 1990, the bulk of the program would be implemented from
mid-1990 to December 1993. Up to $22 million would be made available for this
program under the proposed loan. Chart 1 summarizes the program in schematic
form.
2.          Telecommunications Sector Reform.  In September 1989, the Mexican
Government published its "Programs de Hodernlzaclon de las Telecomunlcaclones"
for the period 1989-94, aimed at achieving major improvements in telecommuni-,
cations services. Objectives included under this program are to (a) improve
service quality to approach international standards, (b) expand service
coverage in urban and rural areas, (c) modernize and diversify services,
(d) establish competitive rates at the international level and achieve
financial self-sufficiency of telecommunications providers, and (e) promote
greater private investment and competition in the sector. Specific
initiatives towards these objectives are (a) the planned privatization of
TELMEX, (b) the creation of the state-owned, commercially oriented TELECONM
with a mandate to operate the Morelos satellite system and to provide a range
of telecommunications services to businesses including some in competition
with TELMEX, and (c) promotion of increased competition in the provision of a
wide range of data, value added and other services and terminal equipment.
These initiatives will require the development of a different and greatly
improved regulatory capability in SCT'F Dlrecclon General de Politicas y
Normas de Comunicaclones (DGPNC) and, where appropriate in the Instituto
Hexicano de las Comunlcaclones (IMC), in the following areas: (a) regulatory
policy, (b) monitoring and regulation of TELMEX and other service providers 'n
respect of their monopoly power, (c) authorization of the operation of
different categories of networks, and (d) development and approval of
technical standards.

B. Project Descriotion
(i) Regulation of Telecommunications Services and Networks
3.          Need.  The need for regulation of the telecommunications sector
arises primarily from the significant level of monopoly power that can be
exercised by TELMEX after the Government of Mexico (GOM) gives up ownership
control of the corporation. Given that TELMEX, the largest telephone company
in Latin America and one of the largest companies in Mexico, has access to
large resources and is the origin of most sector information, the Government's
regulatory capability must be strong, technically capable and credible in
order to be effective. Regulatory intervention may be required to promote
competition in the sector, by policing conditions for competitors to access
TELMEX's monopoly facilities, and to control potential monopoly abuses in
pricing and the provision of service.
4.          Objective.  The objective of this component of the technical
assistance project is to assist SCT's DGPNC to strengthen its capability to
regulate telecommunications services and networks, including the development
of systems for approval of technical standards for telecommunications
equipment. The work will be undertaken in three stages, as shown in Annex 2
and described below.
5.          Stage 1.  Short-term experts on (a) methodologies for pricing
basic telephone service, and (b) the classification of the different types of
networks and services and their regulation in a competitive environment, would
provide inputs that help the Government finalize the draft TELMEX franchise
and the regulations for competitive services. A total of up to six weeks of
individual experts would be available to SCT and other participating agencies
between April and May 1990, financed by project preparation funds administered
by the IDB.
6.          Stagg 2. A consulting firm, selected under the IBRD's procedures
for the engagement of consultants and on the basis of satisfactory terms of
reference, would prepare a program to strengthen SCT's capability to regulate
telecommunications networks and services and help prepare initial
implementation. The work would include preparing a detailed specification and
costing of technical assistance required for the first two years of
implementation of Stage 3. $400,000 out of a total estimated cost of about
$41,n,000 would be financed under the proposed loan. The work would be
undertaken over five to six months beginning in the first half of 1990.
7.          Tasks.  The main tasks to be undertaken during Stage 2 are:
(a)   assessing the implications of recent government policies (in
particular, the new TULMEX franchise and the regulations for the
provision of competitive services) for the emerging regulatory
regime, reviewing with DGPNC the bases of its regulatory
authority, identifying problem areas and proposing changes that
may be considered by SCT, and reviewing with DGPNC other options
still open for decision. This is likely to include
(i) consultation with officials in other government agencies,
TELMEX, TELECOMM and major users, (ii) organizing a series of
consultative seminars including invited foreign regulatory



- 15 -                             ANNEX 1
Page 4
officials and experts, and (iii) providing written conclusions
from these seminars;
(b)   preparing, in close consultation with DGPNC, a written description
of a proposed regulatory regime with respect to (i) pricing of
services, (ii) quality and conditions of service, (iii) network
interconnection, (iv) provision of leased lines for resale,
(v) approval of network facilities, (vi) approval of resellers,
(vii) application of technical standards, and (viii) sale of
terminal equipment;
(c)   identifying and describing in detail the regulatory tasks of DGPNC
that correspond with the proposed regime. Regulatory tasks
include ensuring compliance of service providers with laws,
authorizations and regulations with respect to prices, quality and
conditions of service, interconnection arrangements and
competitive behavior;
(d)   identifying the procedures, activities, functions and information
necessary for DGPNC to undertake the above regulatory tasks;
(e)   based on the findings of items (c) and (d) above, developing and
proposing a revised or adapted organization structure for DGPNC,
to the extent necessary, that will enable it to carry out its
responsibilities in an efficient and effective way. This will
include a description of the roles of organizational units,
staffing requirements, and necessary administrative and
information systems;
(f)   preparing a detailed implementation program for the strengthening
of DGPNC along the lines determined by SCT. Particular attention
will be given to the development of human resources, establishment
of procedures, and implementation of regulatory tasks of
particular importance in the transition to a competitive,
privatized sector structure;
(g)   preparing a detailed specification and cost estimates of technical
assistance,proposed to be financed by the IBRD, including
(i) experts and consultants, (ii) secondment of experienced
personnel, (iii) training, and (iv) equipment, computers and
software; and
(h)   assisting DGPNC in the initial implementation of the recommended
program, in terms of recruitment of staff and experts, procurement
of equipment, and firming up arrangements for training.
8.          Stage 3.  Technical assistance will support DGPNC in undertaking
regulatory activities by providing experts, on-the-job and off-site training,
and equipment. The technical assistance will focus on building up a minimum
core of expertise in four areas, namely, (a) regulatory policy, (b) price,
cost and financial analysis, (c) quality of service, investment program,
technical standards and terminal equipment, and (d) administrative, legal and
information systems.

Page 5
9.          Regulatory Policy.  DGPNC must build up a capability to develop
and implement regulatory policies with respect to:
(a)   licensing of telecommunications networks facilities,
(b)   licensing of resellers and other competitive service providers,
(c)   provision of leased lines,
(d)   anticompetitive or unduly discriminatory behavior by facilities-
based service providers,
(e)   network interconnection and revenue settlement arrangements, and
(f)   other regulatory issues.
The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff is estimated to be
thbre.  One expert would be needed for a total of about 30 months over a 3-
year period. An average of at least 2 months of training per year would be
needed for each DGPNC professional staff member, for a total of 18 staff-
months in 3 years.
10.         Price. Cost and Financial Analysis.  DGPNC must build up a
capability to:
(a)   monitor, analyze and approve or reject tariff proposals,
(b)   review financial projections of service providers and develop an
SCT financial model of TELMEX to forecast rates of return and
other financial indicators, and
(e)   review methodologies and estimates of the costs of providing
telecommuications services.
The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff in this area is
estimated to be six. Three experts would be needed for a total of about 90
months over a 3-year period. An average of at least 2 months of training per
year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 36
staff-months in 3 years.
11.         Ouality of Service. Investment Program. TechnicAl Standards and
Terminal Equinment. DGPNC must develop a capacity to:
(a)   establish performance indicators and systems to monitor results,
(b)   assess TELME$'s investment program, depreciation and procurement
policies, and
(c)   establish, monitor and enforce technical standards for networks
(including national fundamental technical plans) and terminal
equipment.
The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff in this area is
estimated to be six. Three experts would be needed for a total of about



- 17 -                             ANNEX1
Page 6
90 months over a 3-year period. An average of at least 2 months of training
per year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 36
staff-months in 3 years.
12.         Administrative. Legal and Information Systems.  DGPNC must develop
a capability to:
(a)   operate modern administrative systems for both externally oriented
needs (e.g., processing of license applications, regulatory
proceedings) and internal requirements (e.g., personnel, finance,
supplies),
(b)   provide in-house legal advice and undertake legal actions in
support of its operations, and
(c)   establish and maintain information systems to support the
oper-tions of DGPNC.
The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff in this area is
estimated to be eight. Four experts would be needed for a total uf about 120
months over a 3-year period. An average of at least 2 months of training per
year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 48
staff-months in 3 years. Equipment, including computers and standard software
would cost about $220,000.
(ii) Regulation of the Radio SRectrum
13.        Need. The following problems have been identified in the process
of allocating and licensing the radio spectrum in Mexico:
(a) procedures for granting licenses for the use of radio frequencies
and the installation of telecommunications equipment are mostly
manual and take several months to process;
(b) this slow processing encourages illegal use of frequencies and
results in loss of revenue to the Government;
(c) coordination with foreign networks, particularly with the USA,
cannot be adequately studied within the prescribed time because of
its large volume;
(d) in several areas of the country, the radio spectrum is saturated;
(e) the data base for concessions and permits is inaccurate and
fragmentary;
(f) monitoring stations must be modernized or replaced by mobile units;
(g) organizational changes aimed at substantially improving the
attention of the public and shortening the processing of
applications, at the same time assuring that multiple networks can
operate under conditions free of harmful interference, are urgently
required.



- 18 -                             ANNEX 1
Page 7
14.        Modernization of the Mexican telecommunications network and
specific government initiatives toward the privatization of TELMEX, the
creation of the state-owned commercially oriented TELECOIM, and the promotion
of competition in the provision of services require the strengthening of SCT
regulatory capability in several areas, including the control and monitoring
of the radioelectric spectrum.
15.        The radioelectric frequency spectrum (10 Khz-300 Ghz) is recognized
as a natural resource that must be fairly, efficiently and economically
allocated and exploited. Both national and international radio communications
would degenerate in chaos without a coherent and integrated system for
allocating and managing the finite number of places on the spectrum among the
growing number of services and users. The International Consultative
Committee for Radio (CCIR) has stated that "with the increasing complexity of
spectrum management, due to growing demands on the spectrum, administratiuns
may find it desirable to employ computer-assisted analysis techniques to
achieve more efficient spectrum utilization," and that "a substantial range of
spectrum utilization problems encompass data storage, retrieval and analysis
and are consequently amenable to the application of computer-based methods."
16.        Solutions to the problems outlined above through the proposed
technical assistance will result in improved attention to the public, and
effective planning and control of revenue collection, effective and timely
reaction to coordination requests, fair use of the radio spectrum, and orderly
development of the telecommunications infrastructure.
17.        Obiective.  Technical assistance to SCT for the regulation of the
radio spectrum has the following objectives:
(a) to modernize and improve SCT's administrative and technical
capability to manage the use of the radio spectrum;
(b) to establish a computer-assisted radio-frequency spectrum
management and monitoring system in the country.
The work would be undertaken in two stages.
18.        Stage l. A short-term expert would prepare a background assessment
of existing capabilities and ongoing work, write terms of reference for the
Stage 2 consultants, and provide a tentative estimate of the composition and
cost of a modernization and improvement program. The expert would be made
available to SCT for about one month between April and May 1990, financed by
consultant trust funds administered by the IBRD.
19.        Stage 2. A consulting firm would prepare a program for the
modernization and improvement of SCT's control of the radio spectrum, prepare
a detailed specification and costing of equipment and prepare for its
installation. The consultants will also provide technical support to DGPNC
during the first two years of implementation of the plan. The estimated
consulting cost of about $1 million would be financed under the proposed loan.
Tentatively, up to $12 million could be allocated for the proposed loan for
equipment and training required for implementation.
20.        Components.  The project will comprise the following components:



- 19 -                             ANE
Page 8
(a) organization of the units under DGPNC that will manage the radio
spectrum;
(b) development of computer-assisted administrative procedures for
every step in the analysis of systems, granting of licenses, and
collection of revenues;
(c) assistance to update or develop regulation on the use of the
spectrum;
(d) assistance to update or develop enforcement procedures;
(e) development of propagation models and computerized systems for
interference analysis and frequency assignment;
(f) development of a topographic data base and other documentation
necessary to perform spectrum management;
(g) procurement and installation of a system for the purpose of
automating radio-frequency management and monitoring, including a
computer network linking Mexico City and the state capitals,
specialized operative application software, fixed monitoring
stations, and mobile spectrum monitoring vehicles;
(h) implementation of the new administrative and technical systems;
(i) on-the-job training and specifications for foreign training of
DGPNC staff;
(j) evaluation of the new systems some time after their implementation.
21.        The main tasks to be undertaken by the consultants provided through
the technical assistance and a chronogram of activities are shown in Annex 3.
Consultant-month estimates and approximate consultant, training and equipment
costs are contained in Schedule A.
(iii) TELECOMK Business DeveloRment
22.        Need.  As already noted, TELECOMM is a new, government-owned,
competitive telecommunications entity which has inherited the Mexican Morelos
satellite system, an old and increasingly obsolete microwave network and
responsibility for providing the dying telegraph service. It is also
aggressively competing in the provision of very small aperture satellite
terminal (VSAT) private networks to large corporate customers and provides
telex and data comwunications services.  In these ways TELECOMM provides a
valuable element of competition in the sector. However, given the limited
experience of the entity and its management in operating in a competitive
environment, it can benefit significantly from technica' assistance.
23.        Objective.  The objective is to provide highly specialized expert
advice to TELECOMK management in developing its business activities as a
competitive entity in the restructured environment. This would include
assistance in planning the expansion and modernization of TELECOMM's domestic



- 20 -                              Page 9
satellite system and other transmission facilities, assessing the market
potential of new services, and exploring opportunities for joirt ventures and
other modalities of private investment.
24.        ScoDe.  About 15 staff-months of senior corporate, marketing and
technical experts would be made available to TELECOMM from mid-1990 to the end
of 1991. The estimated cost of about $500,000 would be financed under the
proposed loan.1/
C. Project Administration and Implementation
25.        Prolect Organization and Administration.  DGPNC, located within SCT
(see Annex 4), is responsible for regulation of the telecommunications
services sector including regulation of TELNEX, licensing of networks and
services, and management and control of the radio frequency spectrum.
Suitably qualified international consulting firms, possibly in joint venture
with local firms, would be hired by SCT/DGPNC to assist in strengthening its
capability to regulate telecommunications services and networks, and the radio
spectrum. Two components of the project (i.e., (a) regulation of services and
networks, and (b) regulation of the radio spectrum) will be administered by
DGPNC which, for that purpose, will assign the required counterpart staff to
the consultants. DGPNC would have relative managerial and administrative
autonomy, under the general guidance of SCT, to undertake the actions needed
to produce the expected results according to recommendations from the
consultants.
26.        TELECOMM will administer the third component of the project
(TELECOMK business development), will hire qualified international experts for
short-term assignments, and will assign an appropriate counterpart group.
27.        Project Coordination and Reportin.  SCT and TELECOMN shouid
appoint project coordinators who, in addition to the normal coordinating
functions, would prepare documents containing the information on project
outputs and would explain their contents to the concerned Mexican authorities,
for comments and approval. These documents, after approval by the Government,'
may serve as the basis for the final project reports. Special emphasis would
be placed on the selection and assignment on a full time basis of DGPNC
personnel to serve as counterpart staff. The counterpart groups required by
the various activities of the project will be integrated with senior profes-
sionals, to ensure that consideration is given at an appropriate level to the
recommendations emerging from the project, but newly graduated professionals
would also be employed as a nucleus of the future regulatory organization.
The groups, assisted by the consultants, will prepare quarterly reports on
progress of project implementation.
28.        Procurement.  The goods and services to be financed under the
project, as summarized in Schedule B, would be procured in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for the procurement of
equipment, supplies and maintenance items to cost the equivalent of $250,000
or more would be awarded through ICB. Local manufacturers would be eligible
1/   This includes a significant amount of travel costs in order to bring
experts to TELECONM for a series of short-term visits.



AgNNE I
- 21 -                            Page 10
for a 15% preference. Contracts for smaller items of equipment and supplies
would be procured through LCB when valued below $250,000 equivalent and up to
an aggregate amount of $2 million equivalent; and (if required) through local
or international shopping by requesting quotations from at least three
eligible suppliers, when valued below $20,000 equivalent and up to an
aggregate amount of $500,000. Consultants for technical assistance and
training services under the project would be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
29. Disbursements and Retroactive Financing. In order to facilitate
payments under the loan, a special account will be established in the amount
of $3.0 million. For amounts below the ICB thresholds, expenditures will be
disbursed against statements of expenses (SOEs), for which detailed
documentation evidencing expenditures would be retained by DGPNC and made
available for the required audit and also for supervision by the Bank. The
Bank will require prior review of all contracts awarded under ICB and of the
first two contracts awarded under LCB. All other contracts would be subject
to ex post review by the Bank. The loan would provide retroactive financing
of up to $2 million for expenditures made after February 28, 1990.
30.        Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts would be kept for all
expenditures made under the project. DGPNC would maintain records and
accounits for all project activities. The accounts and statements of
expenditures would be audited each year by auditors acceptable to the Bank in
accordance with the Bank's Auditing Guidelines, and the audit reports would be
submitted to the Bank no latter than six months after the close of the fiscal
year.

A. TERMS OF REFERENCE:
SHORT-TERM EXPERT ON PRICING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (STAGE I)
1.         Introduction.   The Government of Mexico has decided that a major
effort to step up the pace of development of the telecommunications sector is
required. To achieve this objective, the Government is initiating a far-
reaching preoram of reforms of the sector involving privatization of TELMEX,
commercialization of remaining government telecommunications operations and
creation of a modern regulatory framework that promotes competition in the
sector and protects the public interest from potential monopoly abuses. The
development of a suitable regulatory framework involving both price regulation
of basic telecommunications services provided by TELMEX and a regime for
authorizing telecommunications networks and services is critical to the
successful privatization of TEIMEX and the development of competition in the
sector. Furthermore, progress in the developmant of the regulatory framework
is sought under the proposed World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank
sector adjustment loans that are supporting reform of the sector.
2.         Objectives.  The objectives of this assignment are to assist the
Mexican authorities: (a) in elaborating, reviewing and assessing alternative
methodologies and approaches for the regulation of TELMEX's tariffs; and
(b) in specifying the mechanics of the recommended alternative.
3.         Tasks.  The expert will:
(a) Review with officials of SCT, other government agencies and TELMEX
the report "Regulation of Telecommunications Prices in Mexico"
(February 1990) and other options (not included in the report) for
the regulation of telecommunications prices. This work will also
include consideration of approaches to regulating TELMEX's
performance with respect to quality and quantity of service, and
consideration of other associated regulatory issues. In reviewing
alternative approaches with Mexican officials, the expert will
help develop a common understanding of their merits and weaknesses
and, thereby, contribute to the development of a consensus amongst
Mexican officials.
(b) Drawing on experience in other countries, on known data sources
and professional statistical techniques, assist Mexican
authorities in specifying and defining the mechanics of a
recommended price regulation approach, in particular with a view
to contributing to the drafting of wording that may be included in
the TELMEX franchise and, possibly, in a document that supplements
the franchise in specifying the mechanics of the price regulation
regime.
4.          Conduct of the assignment. In undertaking this assignment, the
expert will visit Mexico City on two occasions for approximately three-four
days each time, with an interval of approximately two weeks between the
visits. During the approximate two week interval, he will stay in close touch
with his Mexican counterparts by telephone and fax to promote follow-up on
items identified at the end of the first visit. Further, on return from the



- 26 -                              ANNEX 4
Page 3
first visit, the consultant will review progress on the project with the Task
Manager or his designate. At the end of the assignment, within two weeks of
the return from the second visit, the expert will provide the Task Manager
with a reporting letter outlining activities undertaken, results achieved,
remaining problems and issues to be resolved, if any, and appending drafts of
documents that the expert contributed to during the assignment.
B. TERMS OF REFERENCE:
SHORT-TERM EXPERT ON AUTHORIZATION OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND SERVICES (STAGE I)
1.          Introduction.  The Government of Mexico has decided that a major
effort to step up the pace of development of the telecommunications sector is
required.  To achieve this objective, the Government is initiating a far-
reaching program of reforms of the sector involving privatization of TELMEX,
commercialization of remaining government telecommunications operations and
creation of a modern regulatory framework that promotes competition in the
sector and protects the public interest from potential monopoly abuses. The
development of a suitable regulatory framework involving both price regulation
of basic telecommunications services provided by TELMEX and a regime for
authorizing telecommunications network and services is critical to the
successful privatization of TELNUEX and the development of competition in the
sector. Furthermore, progress in the development of the regulatory framework
is sought under the proposed World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank
sector adjustment loans that are supporting reform of the sector.
2.         Objective.  The objective of this assignment is to assist the
Mexican authorities in the timely drafting of regulations that will govern the
authorization of telecommunications networks and the provision of services,
and that support the policy of the Government of Mexico to promote competitiorI.
in the sector.
3.         Tasks.  The expert will:
(a)   review the existing draft "reglamento" in the context of the
Government's "Plan de Modernizacion de las Telecomunicaciones" of
September 1989, and review other relevant documentation on the
Mexican Telecommunications sector;
(b)   develop a preliminary revised framework for drafting the
regulations;
(c)   discuss with officials of SCT, other government agencies, TELMEX
and TELECOMK: (a) outstanding issues concerning the regulation of
telecommunications networks and the provision of services, and
(b) the preliminary revised framework for drafting the
regulations;
(d)   in light of these discussions, revise the framework, propose
solutions to issues and problems and propose an outline of the



- 27 -                              ANNEX 4
Page 4
(d)   in light of these discussions, revise the framew6rk, propose
solutions to issues and problems and propose an outline of the
finalized "reglamento" including recommendations on the different
categories of authorizations, the main conditions of authorization
under each category, and the criteria for allocating service
providers or network operators to each category, bearing in mind
the need to minimize the administrative burden on both SCT and
applicants, as well as SCT's human resource constraints;
(e)   review and comment on subsequent drafts of the "reglamento" that
are prepared by Mexican officials.
4.          Conduct of the assignment.  In undertaking this assignment, the
expert will work closely with, and advise and guide the designated counterpart
staff. He will visit Mexico City on three occasions for approximately three-
four days each time, with an interval of approximately two weeks between the
visits. On return from each visit, the expert will review progress on the
project with the Task Manager or his designate. During the intervals between
visits, he will stay in close touch with his Mexican counterparts by telephone
and fax to promote follow-up on items identified during the previous visit, to
provide advice and guidance, and to propose solutions to problems. At the end
of the assignment, within two weeks of the return from the final visit to
Mexico City, the expert will provide the Task Manager with a reporting letter
that outlines activities undertaken, results achieved, that critiques the then
current draft "reglamento",identifies problems and issues to be resolved, and
proposes solutions where possible. Drafts of documents that the expert
contributed to during the assignment and copies of correspondence with Mexican
officials are to be appended to the reporting letter.
C. TERMS-OF REEERENCE:
PREPARATION AND INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM FOR
REGULATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND SERVICES (STAGE II)
Background
1.          In September, 1989 the Mexican government published its "Programa
de Modernizacion de las Telecomunicaciones" for the period 1989-94, aimed at
achieving major improvements in telecommunications services. Some of the
objectives included under this program are to (i) improve service quality to
approach international standards, (ii) expand service coverage in urban and
rural areas, (iii) modernize and diversify services, (iv) establish
competitive rates at the international level and achieve financial self-
sufficiency of telecommunications providers, and (v) promote greater private
investment and competition in the sector.
2.          Specific initiatives towards these objectives are (i) the planned
privatization of TELMEX, (ii) the creation of the state-owned, competitive
TELECOMM with a mandate to operate the Morelos domestic satellite system and
to provide a range of telecommunications services to businesses including some
in competition with TELMEX, and (iii) promotion of increased competition in

Page 5
the provision of a wide range of data, value-added and other services and
terminal equipment.
3.          These government initiatives will require the development of a
different and greatly improved regulatory capability in SCT's Direccion
General de Politicas y Normas de Comunicaciones (DGPNC) and, where
appropriate, in the Mexican Institute of Communications (IMC), in the
following areas:
(a)   regulatory policy;
(b)   monitoring and regulation of TETWMX and other service providers in
respect of their monopoly powers,
(c)   authorization of the operation of different categories of
networks, and
(d)   development and approval of technical standards.
4.          In this context the consultants, in close consultation with DGPNC
and other relevant organizations, will prepare a program for the development
of DGPNC's telecommunications regulatory capability, including an
implementation plan and specification of technical assistance requirements
until mid-1993. The consultants will assist DGPNC in the initial
implementation of these plans.
Tasks
S.          The following are the main specific tasks that the consul.Ants
will undertake:
(a)   Assess the implications of recent government policies (in
particular, the new TELMEX franchise and the regulations for the
provision of competitive services) for the emerging regulatory
regime, review with DGPNC the bases of its regulatory authority,
identify problem areas and prepare proposals that may be
considered by SCT, and review with DGPNC other options still open
for decision. This is likely to include (i) consultation with
officials in other government agencies, TELMEX, TELECONM and major
users, (ii) organizing a series of consultative seminars including
invited foreign regulatory officials and experts, and
(iii) providing written conclusions from these seminars.
(b)     Prepare, in close consultation with DGPNC, a written description
of a proposed regulatory regime, with respect to:
(i)   pricing of services,
(ii) quality and conditions of service,
(iii) network interconnection,



- 29 -                               ANEX 4
Page 6
(iv) provision of leased lines for resale,
(v)   approval of network facilities,
(vi) approval of resellers,
(vii) application of technical standards, and
(viii) sale of terminal equipment.
(c)   Identify in detail the regulatory tasks of DGPNC that correspond
with the proposed regime. Regulatory tasks include insuring
compliance of service providers with laws, authorizations and
regulations with respect to prices, quality and conditions of
service, interconnection arrangements and competitive behavior.
(d)    Identify the procedures, activities, functions and information
necessary for DGPNC to undertake the above regulatory tasks.
(e)   Based on the findings of items (d) and (e) above, develop and
propose a revised or adapted organization structure for DGPNC, to
the extent necessary, that will enable it to carry out its
responsibilities in an efficient and effective way. This will
include a description of the roles of organizational units,
staffing requirements, and necessary administrative and
information systems.
(f)   Prepare a detailed implementation program for the development of
DGPNC along the lines determined by SCT. Particular attention
should be given to the development of human resources,
establishment of procedures, and implementation of regulatory
tasks of particular importance in the transition to a competitive
privatized sector structure.
(g)   Prepare a detailed specification and cost estimates of technical
assistance, proposed to be financed by the IBRD, including
(i) experts and consultants, (ii) secondment of experienced
personnel, (iii) training, and (iv) equipment, computers and
software. And
(h)   Assist DGPNC in the initial implementation of the proposed
program, in terms of recruitment of staff and experts, procurement
of equipment, and firming up arrangements for training.
D. OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE:
REGULATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND SERVICES (STAGE III)
1.          In Stage III, technical assistance will support DGPNC in
undertaking regulatory activities, by providing experts, on-the-job and off-
site training, and equipment. The technical assistance will focus on building
up a minimum core of expertise in four areas, namely (a) regulatory policy,



- 30 -                             ANNEX 4
Page 7
(b) price, cost and financial analysis, (c) quality of service, investment
program, technical standards and terminal equipment, and (d) administrative,
legal and information systems. Tentative estimates of the minimum requirements
of DGPNC professional staff, and of the requirements and costs of experts,
training and equipment for the initial three years of development of these
areas, are summxrized in the Attachment.
Regulatory Policy
2.          DGPNC must build up a capability to develop and implement
regulatory policies with respect to:
(a)    licensing of telecommunications networks facilities,
(b)    licensing of resellers and other competitive service providers,
(c)   provision of leased lines,
(d)   anticompetitive or unduly discriminatory behavior by facilities-
based service providers,
(e)   network interconnection and revenue settlement arrangements and
(f)   other regulatory issues.
3.          The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff is
estimated to be 3. One expert would be needed for a total of about 30 months
over a three-year period. An average of at least 2 months' training per year
would be needed for each DGPNC professional staff member, for a total of 18
staff-months in three years.
Price. Cost and Financial Analysis
4.          DGPNC must build up a capability to
(a)   monitor, analyze and approve or reject tariff proposals,
(b)    review financial projections of service providers and develop an
SCT financial model of TELMEX to forecast rates of return and
other financial indicators, and
(c)   review methodologies and estimates of the costs of providing
telecommunications services.
5.          The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff in this
area is estimated to be 6. Three experts would be needed for a total of about
90 months over a three-year period. An average of at least 2 months' training
per year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 36
staff-months in three years.
Quality of Service. Investment Program. Technical Standards and Terminal
Ecuipment
6.          DGPNC must develop a capacity to:

90 months over a three-year period. An average of at least 2 months' training
per year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 36
staff-months in three years.
Administrative. Legal and Information Systems
8.          DGPNC must develop a capability to:
(a)   operate modern administrative systems for both externally oriented
needs (e.g., processing of license applications, regulatory
proceedings) and internal requirements (e.g., personnel, finance,
supplies),
(b)   provide in-house legal advice and undertake legal actions in
support of its operations, and
(c)   establish and maintain information systems to support the
operations of DGPNC.
9.          The minimum number of initial DGPNC professional staff in this
area is estimated to be 8. Four experts would be needed for a total of about
120 months over a three-year period. An average of at least 2 months' training
per year would be needed for each professional staff member, for a total of 48
staff-months in three years. Equipment, including computers and standard

E. TERMS OF REFERENCE:
REGULATION OF THE RADIO SPECTRUM (STAGES I AND II)
Obiectives
1.         Technical assistance to SCT regarding the regulation of the radio
spectrum has the following objectives:
(a)   to modernize and improve SCT's administrative and technical
capability to manage the use of the radio spectrum;
(b)   to establish a computer-assisted radio-frequency spectrum control
and monitoring system in the country, taking account of ongoing
work.
Project Justification
2.         The following problems have been identified in the process of
allocation and licencing of the radio spectrum in Mexico:
(a)   procedures for granting licenses for the use of radio frequencies
and the installation of telecommunications equipment are mostly
manual and take several months to process;
(b)   this low processing encourages illegal use of frequencies and
results in loss of revenue to the Government;
(c)   coordination with foreign networks, particularly with the USA,
cannot be adequately studied within the prescribed time periods
because of its large volume;
(d)   in several areas of the country, the radio spectrum is saturated;
(e)   the data base for concessions and permits is inaccurate and
fragmentary;
(f)   monitoring stations must be modernized or replaced by mobile
u-nits;
(g)   organizational changes aimed at substantially improving the
attention to the public and shortening the processing of
applications, at the same time assuring that multiple networks can
operate under conditions free of harmful interference, are
urgently required.
3.         Modernization of the Mexican telecommunications network and
specific government initiatives towards the privatization of TEUMEX, the
creation of the st te-owned comnercially oriented TELECOMM, and the promotion
of competition in the provision of services requires the strengthening of SCT
regulatory capability in several areas, including the control and monitoring
of the radioelectric spectrum.



- 34 -                            ANNEX 4
Page 11
4.          The radioelectric freouency spectrum (10 kilohertz-300 gigahertz)
is recognized as a natural resource that must be fairly, efficiently and
economically allocated and exploited. Both national and international radio
communications would degenerate in chaos without a coherent and integrated
system for allocating and managing the finite number of places on the spectrum
among the growing number of services and users.
5.         The CCIR has stated that "with the increasing complexity of
spectrum management, due to growing demands on the spectrum, administrations
may find it desiraule to employ computer-assisted analysis techniques to
achieve more efficient spectrum utilization," and that "a substantial range of
spectrum utilization problems encompass data storage, retrieval and analysis
activities, and are consequently amenable to the application of computer-
based methods."
6.          Solutions to the problems listed in para. 2 above through the
proposed technical assistance will result in improved attention to the public,
an effective planning and control of revenue collection, effective and timely
reaction to coordination requests, fair use of the radio spectrum, and orderly
development of the telecommunications infrastructure.
Project Scoee
7.   The Project will comprise the following components:
(a)   organization of the units under Dlreccldn General de Politlcas y
Normas de Comunlcaclones (DGPNC) that will manage the radio
spectrum;
(b)   development of computer-assisted administrative procedures for
every step in the an.lysis of systems, granting of licenses, and
collection of revenues;
(c)   assistance to update or develop regulation on the use of the
spectrum;
(d)   assistance to update or develop enforcement procedures;
(e)   development of computerized systems for interference analysis and
frequency assignment;
(f)   development of a topographic data base and other documentation
necessary to perform the spectrum management functions;
(g)   procurement and installation of a system for the purpose of
automating the radio-frequency management and monitoring
functions, including a computer network linking Mexico City and
the state capitals, specialized operative application software,
fixed monitoring stations, and mobile spectrum monitoring
vehicles;
(h)   implementation of the new administrative and technical systems;



- 35 -                              ANNEX
page 12
(i)   on-the-Job and abroad training of DGPNC staff; and
(J)   evaluation of the new systems some time after their
implementation.
8.         The main tasks to be assumed by the consultants provided through
the technical assistance are summarized in Table 1. A general chronogram of
activities is shown in Annex 3.
