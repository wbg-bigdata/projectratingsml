APPRAISAL OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REFINERY REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has requested an IDA Credit of
US$28.5 million to assist in financing an Energy Efficiency and Refinery
Rehabilitation Project consisting of an integrated package of investments,
studies and institution-building measures to conserve and diversify energy
use in the industrial sector and rehabilitate the country's petroleum
refinery at Chittagong. The Project is aimed at reducing the level of
imported petroleum consumption which in FY82 is estimated to have claimed
about US$543.0 million or 87% of the country's total export earnings.
1.02      The Project consists of five components:  (a) rehabilitation of
the Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL) facilities in Chittagong--to restore its
mechanical integrity, increase capacity utilization, improve its opera-
tions, reduce its energy consumption--and the execution of a techno-
economic study to determine further modifications required to ensure that
the refinery's yield pattern would be in balance with the changing
long-term demand profile for petroleum fuels in the country; (b) technical
assistance to improve the accounting, financial and management information
systems of the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the parent company
of ERL; (c) an energy conservation program to identify and prepare energy
savings measures/investments to improve the efficiency of energy use in the
industrial sector; (d) the carrying out of detailed feasibility studies on
gas-based export-oriented projects to provide a basis for Bangladesh to
capture the foreign exchange potential of its abundant natural gas
resource; and (e) research and development on the possibilities of using
natural gas-derived methanol as an extender of middle distillate petroleum
products and in other non-conventional applications. Implementation of the
Ref inery Rehabilitation Component is expected to be completed by March
1986; the technical assistance to improve BPC's accounting and management
information system is expected to be initiated by September 1983 for
completion by March 1985; the energy conservation component is expected to
begin in March 1984 and scheduled for completion by September 1985. The
detailed feasibility studies of gas-based export-oriented projects would be
executed over a 28-month period starting June 1983; while the research and
development on methanol use as an extender of middle distillate petroleum
products will support a three-year continuation of the research work in
this area being carried out by the Chemical Engineering Department of the
Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
1.03      Total financing requirements for the Project, including physical
and price contingencies, are estimated at US$36 million, including US$27.4
million in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA Credit of US$28.5 million
will cover the full foreign exchange cost and 13% of the local cost. ERL
will provide the balance of the local cost from its internal resources.
The IDA Credit will be made

to GOB on standard IDA terms.  GOB will on-lend a portion of the IDA Credit
to ERL at an interest rate of 14% per annum (p.a.) and on repayment terms
of 12 years including 4 years of grace. The terms, which are consistent
with those applicable to long-term lending in Bangladesh, are satisfactory.
1.04      The Energy Conservation Component is a key innovative feature in
the design of the Project. It will provide financing for carrying out
energy audits in up to 40 industrial facilities in the country to identify
their energy savings potential and prepare measures to capture the
identified energy savings. This component of the Project will also assist
in strengthening thie capabilities of the newly created Energy Monitoring
Unit (EMU) in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources which has been
charged with the responsibility of preparing a national energy conserva-
tion program as part of GOB's efforts to address the long-term issues of
energy demand management.
1.05      The Project has been accorded a high priority by the Government.
The economic rate of return on the Refinery Rehabilitation component is
estimated at 68%. Total annual reductions in the oil import bill as a
result of the Project are estimated to range from about US$19 million in
1986 to about US$26 million in 1995; total savings over the life of the
Project are estimated at about US$226 million.
1.06      The Project was identified in the course of a joint IDA-Asian
Development Bank (ADB) energy assessment mission to Bangladesh in October
1981. Its structure and design were guided by key recommendations made by
that mission, and accepted by GOB, to initiate quick-yielding projects to
reduce the mounting claims of imported energy on Bangladesh's export
earnings and begin the preparatory activities necessary to design projects
aimed at capturing the export potential of Bangladesh's substantial natural
gas reserves. It was appraised in May 1982 by Isaac K. Sam (Mission
Chief), Surendra Agarwal, Priscilla Urbano and Lakdasa Wijetilleke of the
Industry Department and C.R. Das Gupta and Alain Streicher, consultants. A
follow-up mission in October 1982 finalized the implementation arrangements
with the Government and the beneficiary companies.
II. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Background
2.01      Bangladesh has no known oil reserves, no economically exploitable
coal, very limited hydropower potential, already largely exploited, and a
dwindling base of biomass fuels. Total per capita energy consumption,
estimated in the range of 100 to 130 kilograms (kg) of oil equivalent (oe)
p.a., is among the lowest in the world. Less than a third (about 31 kg per
capita) of the total consumption is derived from commercial fuels, of which
some 52% is supplied from imported petroleum, 40% from indigenous natural
gas, 6% from imported coal, and 2% from hydroelectricity. Despite the low
levels of energy consumption, Bangladesh is faced with escalating claims of
imported energy on its limited export earnings and rapidly declining
biomass fuel sources.  The value of the oil import bill, which amounted to
around 30% of export earnings in the FY77-79 period, had reached 69% in
FY81 even though the volumes imported increased by no more than 5% over the
FY77-79 period.  For FY82, the oil import bill is estimated to have reached
about US$543 million or about 87% of export earnings.

On the biomass fuels side, domestic resources do not offer substantial
potential to cover the needs of the country in the future. In fact, the
forestry base is severely limited while important sources such as
agricultural wastes are rapidly declining due to the progressive shift from
traditional varieties to high yielding varieties (HYV) of rice which have
less straw material. At the same time, per capita availability of cow
dung, also an important source of fuel in the rural areas, is declining.
B. Energy Consumption
1. Ihistorical Energy Consumption
2.02      There are no reliable data for biomass fuels consumption in
Bangladesh. Data for the various commercial fuels consumed in the country
over FY76-81 are presented below:

2.03      While the annual growth of commercial energy consumption between
FY76-79 averaged 5.5%, the growth rate between FY79-81 averaged 8%. This
increase was virtually due to a 20% p.a. increase in gas utilization
between FY79 and FY81. The historical consumption, however, does not
reflect the real energy demand in the country since the consumption levels
have always been constrained by availability of foreign exchange for
imported energy and in the case of natural gas and hydroelectricity by
uncertainties surrounding the funding and on-stream timing of their
capital-intensive development and delivery systems.
2.04      Consumption of different forms of commercial energy by end-use
for FY81 is presented on the following page.

Appraisal Mission.
2.05      Industry and power accounted for about 60% of the total
commercial energy consumption in FY81. In particular, the industrial
sector accounted for 50% of the total natural gas consumption, 77% of coal,
and 21% of petroleum fuels. Power generation accounted for 36% of the
total natural gas consumption, and 16% of the petroleum fuels. Residential
energy accounted for about 18% of total energy and 27% of petroleum fuels;
residential petroleum fuel consumption is mostly kerosene used for lighting
purposes in non-electrified households. Transportation accounted for 16%
of commercial energy, the bulk of it being diesel fuel used in road,
rail and cabotage transportation.
2. Projected Commercial Energy Balance
2.06      The actual commercial energy balance for FY81 and the projected

2.07      The above projected FY85 commercial energy demand-supply balance
takes into account the likely on-stream timing of the various energy supply
systems under implementation for which financing has either been secured or
is soon to be secured and which can be completed for use within the
projected time period. Coal supply is assumed to remain constant while
petroleum demand growth takes into account projected displacements of
petroleum fuels by natural gas. Overall, commercial energy demand is
projected to grow at an annual rate of 6.4%.  Substantial changes in the
composition of supply are forecast in this period and throughout the 1980s,
due to the expected increased availability of natural gas on completion of
the Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD). In fact, over 85%
all of the projected increase in commercial energy supply is estimated to
come from natural gas whose consumption is expected to grow at about 17%
p.a. Petroleum fuel consumption, with its projected displacement by
natural gas in power generation and in industries in the Chittagong area,
is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.3%. As a result, while natural
gas will increase its share in commercial energy supply from 39.9% in FY81



- 6 -
to 58% in FY85, petroleum fuels' share will decline from 52.4% to 44.7%
during the same period. The projections for FY85 are in line with the
recent IDA-ADB energy assessment report.l/
C. Domestic Energy Resources
1. Natural Gas
2.08      The one major energy resource that Bangladesh is well-endowed
with is natural gas. So far eleven gas fields onshore and one offshore
have been discovered.  All discoveries are confined to the eastern part of
the country. Gas in place at the 12 fields is estimated at about 12.3 to
13.4 trillion cubic feet (about 280-310 million toe), of which about 75%
should be recoverable through normal production methods. The current gas
reserves are given in Annex 2-1. At present, only the Titas field is being
exploited in any significant measure to supply the capital, Dhaka, via
Ashuganj and Ghorasal, and six other towns. An IDA financed project due to
be completed in 1983 (Bakhrabad Gas Development Project--Credit 1091-BD)
will link Chittagong, Bangladesh's main commercial and port city, with the
newly-developed Bakhrabad gas field through a 24" high pressure pipeline.
Cumulative production of gas through FY81 was estimated at about 0.35
trillion cubic feet.  Taking the projected consumption through FY85 (para
2.06) into account, a highly optimistic consumption growth rate of 15%
p.a. thereafter, and a recovery rate of 75% of the gas in place, the
reserves are estimated to last about 33 years even if no new deposits are
found.
2.09      Besides using its substantial natural gas resource to meet
growing domestic energy demand and to substitute for more costly imported
fuel (para 2.13), Bangladesh, given the size of its deposits, needs to
initiate action to exploit the potential of natural gas as feedstock for
manufacturing economically-viable and exportable products. With the
relatively long gestation period for these types of projects, there is
urgency to initiate the necessary feasibility studies and preparatory work
and to develop the required investment programs. Further, as the minimum
economic scale of many of such projects most likely would be of a size
exceeding Bangladesh's own capacity for self-financing, and given the
renewed emphasis by GOB on attracting foreign investments, there is a need
to develop packages of incentives for attracting private foreign capital.
The Project would therefore include provision for specialized consultancy
services to carry out a study with the emphasis on (a) identifying the
potential for natural gas/natural gas liquids use either for direct export
or for chemical product industries for export markets (e.g., gas exports to
India, methanol and methanol derivatives, and ammonia-urea fertilizer); (b)
assessment of the investments needed for such projects; (c) evaluation of
the economic benefits of such investments; (d) recommendation of a priority
order of these investments based on expected economic benefits; and (e)
recommendations on incentive structure for attracting private foreign
capital into such investments (paras 5.14 to 5.17).

2.  Coal
2.10     Coal deposits, estimated to contain at least 700 million tons of
useable coal, exist near Tamalganj in the northwestern part of the
country.  However, these deposits are loc ted at depths ranging between 700
to 900 meters and underneath water-bearing, alluvial strata. This causes
difficult and costly production problems that so far have prevented any
development. Mcst recent studies of likely development and production
costs indicate that coal from these deposits could not compete with
imported steam coal from India in the foreseeable future. There are also
some peat deposits in the Faridpur and Khulna districts; however, these
individual deposits are small and lie under prime agricultural land, making
their mining neither practical nor economic.
3. Hydroel7 ectricity
2.11      In spite of the very large river systems (Ganges and Brahmaputra)
running through the country, Bangladesh's hydroelectric potential is rather
modest because of the flat deltaic terrain. At present, 80 MW of capacity
are operating at Kaptai in the southeastern part of the country. Plans
call for the commissioning of another 50 MW unit in 1983, and two
additional 50 MW units by 1987, for a total of 230 MW, all at the same
site. No further economically justifiable conventional sites appear to be
available, given the competitive production costs of alternative generating
facilities based on natural gas.
4. Biomass Fuels
2.12      Other than kerosene used for lighting purposes, the main sources
of fuel for more than 90% of Bangladesh's 90 million people who live in the
rural areas are cow dung, fuelwood, and agricultural residues, such as rice
straw, rice husks, and jute sticks. The medium- to long-term outlook for
these fuels is, however, not bright. Dung availability depends mainly on
livestock population growth; however, because of a lack of fodder, the
medium-term outlook is close to stagnation, hence per capita availability
of dung is likely to decline as the population increases. With respect to
fuelwood, about 2.3 million hectares (about 16% of the total land area)
have been designated as forests from which much of the fuelwood could be
derived, but presently much of these areas is largely denuded of tree
growth due to shifting cultivation. Their distribution is also uneven,
being concentrated in three districts in the southeastern region. The
shift to HYV rice, while critical to achieving the country's food
self-sufficiency goal, is also creating an unintended reduction in the
availability of biomass fuel in rural areas. The straw yield of HYV rice
(0.5 metric ton/hectare) is lower than that of the traditional variety
(0.6-0.8 metric ton/hectare), thus reducing the availability of rice straw
as fuel. The output of jute sticks is also projected to remain stagnant or
decline because no sustained increase in raw jute production is expected in
the short to medium term.

D. Scope for Energy Substitution and Conservation
2.13      Despite Bangladesh's low level of commercial energy consumption
(about 31 kg of oe2/ per capita (para 2.01)), there is substantial scope
for improving the efficiency of commercial energy use and for substituting
imported petroleum fuels by domestic natural gas, particularly in the
industrial and power sectors where the bulk of the consumption is
concentrated in a relatively small number of facilities. As shown below,
petroleum refining, and pulp and paper and steel producers are the largest
consumers of petroleum fuel (mostly fuel oil) in industry, accounting for
17%, 31%, and 15% respectively of total fuel consumption in the sector,
while the fertilizer industry is the largest consumer of natural gas (used
for both feedstock and fuel) accounting for 73% of total natural gas usage
in industry.  Other significant consumers of commercial energy in the
industrial sector include jute, textiles and tea estates.

2.14      The three main categories where the potential for fuel substitu-
tion and/or energy savings are most attractive are: (i) those facilities
using fuel oil that will have access to natural gas in 1983 when the
Bakhrabad-Chittagong gas pipeline being financed by IDA (Credit 1091-BD) is
completed; (ii) those facilities in and around Dhaka and Sylhet currently
using gas but which are largely inefficient and where energy conservation
investments would be attractive; and (iii) those facilities, such as the

respectively.



- 9 -
Khulna newsprint plant in the western part of the country where natural gas
is not expected to be available for the time being and will thus continue
using fuel oil.
2.15      The potential savings in energy in the industrial sector, both
through substitution and conservation, were reviewed during the IDA-ADB
energy assessment mission in October 1981, and again during the appraisal
of this Project. It is estimated that in the Chittagong area about 166,000
toe per year (mostly fuel oil), or about 50% of the present petroleum fuel
consumption in the industrial sector, can be replaced with natural gas
beginning in mid-1983 when the Bakhrabad-Chittagong gas pipeline is
completed. In addition, about 25,000 toe of natural gas per year can be
saved in these industrial facilities if appropriate energy conservation
programs are implemented in addition to the switchover to natural gas.
Another 21,000 toe per year of fuel oil can be expected to be saved through
conservation measures in the operations of those facilities located in
areas where gas is not expected to be available and will continue using
imported fuel. Finally, about 27,500 toe per year can be saved through
conservation measures in plants already using natural gas. Total potential
annual savings of energy in the industrial sector is estimated at about
239,500 toe (i.e., 73,500 toe through conservation and about 166,000 tons
of fuel oil which can be replaced by natural gas from Bakhrabad). The
total potential savings from conservation and substitution are estimated to
be equivalent to about US$35 million p.a. at FOB (Chittagong) March 1983
fuel oil prices.  Substitution of about 130,000 tons of petroleum per year
fuel by natural gas at four major industrial facilities and a power plant
at Chittagong is being carried out under Credit 1091-BD while the ADB, in a
recently-approved project, is providing for the switchover to natural gas
of small and medium-scale industrial energy users and residential consumers
in the Chittagong area. Substitution of another 36,000 tons per year of
petroleum fuel by natural gas at the petroleum refinery will be covered
under this Project. To initiate the institutional structure to carry out
necessary activities for energy conservation and capture the potential
energy savings, the Government has established the Energy Monitoring Unit
(EMU) within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to be responsible
for energy conservation activities. The Energy Efficiency component of
this Project will be directed towards assisting the EMU to strengthen its
capabilities and to carry out energy audits to provide a basis for
capturing the energy savings potential.
E. Energy Pricing
2.16      Pricing of biomass-derived fuels in Bangladesh is determined in
the market place. Prices of petroleum products, natural gas, coal and
electricity, on the other hand, are set by the Government both at the
ex-refinery/well-head/wholesale/bulk levels and at the consumer level.
Except for natural gas for which GOB sets differential prices for various
classes of consumers, the prices of the other energy products are uniform
for all classes of consumers throughout the country.
1. Petroleum Product Prices
2.17      Petroleum product prices in Bangladesh have always been highest
among the commercial fuels. GOB's pricing policy with regard to petroleum



- 10 -
products is based on the principle of periodic adjustments to recover
increases in procurement, processing and distribution costs. The most
recent adjustment was on July 1, 1982 when prices were increased by 41% on
a weighted average basis. The current ex-refinery price levels are satis-
factory as shown by the following comparison with import parity equivalent
prices:

2.18      Retail prices, which include import duty and excise taxes ranging
from 5% of the ex-refinery price for kerosene to 11% for premium gasoline,
as well as transportation, dealer handling and reasonable returns for the
distributors, are also satisfactory and compare well with final consumer
prices in other coantries.

2.19      While the Government is committed to the principle of periodic
price adjustments to recover increases in procurement and processing costs,
lapses in the implementation of this pricing policy have been evident in
the past.  To ensure that correct price levels which reflect the full cost
of each petroleum product would be maintained, assurances have been
obtained from the Government that it will periodically, but at least once a
year, review and make adjustments to the ex-refinery and retail prices of
petroleum products to the extent that may be required to ensure that
sufficient revenues are generated to recover the full cost of petroleum
procurement, processing and handling, plus reasonable returns.

2. Other Commercial Energy Prices
2.20      On July 1, 1982, adjustments were also made to the prices of
natural gas and electricity, raising them by 13% and 40% respectively.
While the adjustment to electricity prices are reasonable, the natural gas
prices for some major classes of consumers are considered low. Industrial,
commercial and domestic users pay natural gas tariffs ranging from US$1.40
to US$2.90 per million BTU which are in line with the estimated opportunity
cost of gas (estimated to be in the range of US$0.70 to US$1.35 per million
BTU in 1982 prices). However, electric power and fertilizer users pay
tariffs amounting to only US$0.50 per million BTU. In order to assist the
Government in establishing reasonable gas prices, a tariff study is being
carried out under Credit 1091-BD; the study is expected to be completed in
early 1984 for review with IDA. IDA's objective in this regard is to
encourage the Government to set natural gas prices at levels sufficient to
cover the full economic cost as well as to mobilize resources for the
development of the energy and other sectors.
F. Energy Sector Organization
2.21      An organization chart of the institutions involved in the energy
sector of Bangladesh is presented as Annex 2-2. The responsibility for
energy policies and programs in Bangladesh is dispersed over numerous
agencies. Petrobangla, established in 1974, is responsible for explora-
tion, production, transmission and distribution of natural gas, while the
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is responsible for imports of crude
oil and refined products, and refining and marketing of petroleum products.
Both companies are under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources and act as holding companies within each sub-sector for
companies which function under their supervision and control. The
Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is responsible for generation,
transmission, and distribution of electric power, while rural electrifi-
cation is the responsibility of the Rural Electrification Board (REB).
Non-commercial fuels come under the responsibility of various government
agencies, including the Ministries of Agriculture, and of Local Government,
Rural Development and Cooperatives.
2.22       In 1981, in the course of preparing the energy sector for the
draft Second Five Year Plan (SFYP), the Government became aware of the
urgent need for an integrated energy planning process and policy-making.
It has since taken positive steps towards central energy planning by
establishing an Energy Study and Planning Cell (ESPC) in the Planning
Commission under a UNDP-ADB financed project; however, more reorganization
might be necessary and more effort will be required to enhance the Govern-
ment's integrated energy planning capability.
G. IDA's Role in the Energy Sector
2.23      IDA began its involvement in Bangladesh's energy sector in FY79
with a US$28 million credit (Credit 934-RD) for an electric power distri-
bution project in the Khulna district. This was followed in FY81 with
Credit 1091-BD which provided US$85 million equivalent to assist in the



- 12 -
development of the Bakhrabad gas field and construction of a 110-mile
24-inch pipeline to supply gas from that field to Chittagong.  The
Association has since followed that credit with two others amounting to
US$132 million in FY82 to assist in financing the Ashuganj Thermal Power
Project (Credit 1254-BD) and the Rural Electrification Project (Credit
1262-BD). The focus of IDA's role in the sector is to support (i) expanded
production, distribution and use of natural gas, particularly for power
generation and industry, to meet growing energy demand and to substitute
for more costly imported fuels; (ii) major improvements in domestic oil
refining facilities; (iii) more efficient use of energy through better
control of conversion and distribution losses and industrial energy
conservation; and (iv) increases in energy prices to economic levels,
particularly for electricity, petroleum fuels and gas.
2.24      IDA has pursued its role in complement with other donors
operating in the energy sector. In addition to project lending, IDA,
following the energy assessment work carried out in collaboration with the
ADB, is providing direct technical assistance to the GOB to review energy
sector investment programs to take account of increasing financial resource
constraints.  The objective of this exercise is to develop a "hard core"
investment program for the sector consisting of investments to complete as
rapidly as possible those ongoing projects which are already well-advanced
and concentrate additional resources on recognized high priority under-
takings with quick and high payoffs. Priority is to be accorded to (i)
projects for which donor assistance has already been secured; (ii) projects
with important linkages to others already completed or nearing completion;
(iii) projects with an immediate impact on reducing the energy import
dependence; and (iv) projects improving the energy supply to the western
part of the country.  Projects judged to be of lower priority or doubtful
viability are to be reduced, postponed or eliminated. This Project has
been accorded the highest priority in the "hard-core" investment program,
given its focus on improving the efficiency of the country's oil refining
operations and initiating energy conservation activities.
III. PETROLEUM REFINING SUBSECTOR
A.   Past Consumption of Petroleum Products
3.01      Consumption of petroleum products in Bangladesh grew from 1.22
million tons in FY76 to 1.55 million tons in FY81, an average rate of 5.9%
p.a. Like most developing countries, the consumption pattern in
Bangladesh is skewed in favor of middle distillates, i.e., kerosene and
diesel oil. Kerosene is used largely for illumination in the rural areas
and marginally for domestic cooking in the urban areas. Diesel is used for
rail, road and cabotage transportation, electric power generation and
extensively in irrigation. The structure of demand in Bangladesh has



- 13 -
undergone some important shifts. Middle distillates, which accounted for
57% of petroleum products demand in FY76, had grown to 67% by FY81, while
the shares of light distillates (gasoline) and heavy ends (fuel oil
primarily) have declined. This trend is expected to continue in the
future, but more slowly than in the past. A summary of the shifts in
demand for the various petroleum products is presented in Annex 3-1.
B.   Petroleum Product Demand Forecast
3.02     The rate of growth of energy use in the 1980s will depend on the
successful completion of ongoing and planned investment activities, on the
level and composition of foreign aid to Bangladesh, and on outside events
such as changes in world oil prices, or the production and relative prices
of jute goods, the country's most important. export commodity.  The
uncertainties surrounding these factors make long-term projections of
energy consumption subject to wide margins of error. Forecasts for
petroleum products demand to FY85 are available from the Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC) and the Planning Commission, but they differ by
some 20%. BPC's projections reflect a continuation of past trends with an
average annual growth rate of 5.4%. The Planning Commission projects a
marginal decline in absolute quantities between FY81 and FY85, largely
because of its expectation of large-scale (optimistic) substitution by
natural gas in electric power generation and industry. The IDA-ADB Energy
Sector Report of October 1982, taking into account the various sectoral
developments that are likely to affect petroleum demand in the future,
assumes an average annual increase in total petroleum product demand of
some 2.3% between FY81 and FY85 as shown below; detailed projections to
FY90 are presented in Annex 3-2.

- 14 -
3.03      The demand for middle distillates is expected to grow at a lower
rate (2.5% p.a) than in the past (8% p.a., FY76-81) but would continue to
dominate the consumption profile, with diesel oil and kerosene together
constituting about 68% of total demand. A slight increase in fuel oil and
bitumen consumption is expected although their share in the total demand
profile in projected to remain at about 27%.
3.04      The demand for diesel and fuel oil is greatly affected by the
consumption patterns of the BPDB and Bangladesh Railway (BR). With the
recommissioning of a 60 MW fuel-oil power unit in Khulna, total diesel
consumption by BPDB is expected to go down with a corresponding increase in
fuel oil usage. By FY84, another 110 MW fuel-oil power unit is expected to
be commissioned in Khulna, resulting in a further decline in diesel
consumption and increase in fuel oil. However, the decrease in diesel
consumption by BPDB is expected to be more than offset by BR with the
continuation of its dieselization program. In addition, given the
increasing emphasis on food production, it is estimated that consumption of
diesel for irrigation in the agricultural sector will increase by at least
10% per year.
C.   Petroleum Refining Subsector Operations
3.05      As noted in para 2.01, Bangladesh has no known petroleum
reserves; petroleum fuels requirements are met entirely through imports.
Petroleum products are obtained from four different sources: (i) domestic
refining of imported crude oil in the Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL)
facilities at Chittagong; (ii) processing of Bangladesh-purchased crude oil
in Singapore refineries under contractual arrangements; (iii) purchases of
petroleum products from spot markets; and (iv) barter trade for petroleum
products with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Responsibi-
lity for importing and refining of crude oil, marketing of refined pro-
ducts, and imports of deficit petroleum products is assigned to BPC. The
operations, management and performance of BPC are discussed in Chapter IV

3.06      Currently, about 60% of Bangladesh's petroleum fuel requirements
is processed in the ERL refinery in Chittagong. In FY81, the remaining4O%
requirement of petroleum products were met, (a) 37% through processing of
Bangladesh-procured crude oil in refineries in Singapore for a fee and
bringing to Bangladesh the kerosene and diesel oil produced and selling the
surplus naptha and fuel oil in the Singapore market at negotiated prices;
and (b) 3% by importing, through barter arrangements, marginal quantities
of diesel oil from the USSR. Analysis of the overall arrangements for
meeting Bangladesh's petroleum fuel requirements has concluded that at
prevailing petroleum product prices, supplementing deficit products by
processing crude purchased by Bangladesh in the Singapore refineries is
less economic than the direct import of diesel oil and kerosene, given that
Bangladesh would need to sell the surplus fuel oil produced in those
refineries at depressed prices.  The Government, beginning in 1983, has
decided to put an end to this mode of meeting deficit requirements.  With
respect to domestic refining, since ERL has no fuel oil conversion
facilities, its production profile does not match the market demand (para
4.09) with the result that surplus naphtha and fuel oil have to be exported
at depressed prices. This situation will be exacerbated as domestic

natural gas displaces fuel oil when the Bakhrabad-Chittagong pipeline is
completed.  Unless fuel oil conversion facilities are added to the ERL
refinery, the level of surplus fuel oil to be exported will increase for a
given crude throughput, while the need t- import deficit middle distillates
to meet increasing domestic demand for these products will rise. To address
the imbalance between the ERL refinery yield pattern and product demand and
to reduce the cost of imported petroleum to Bangladesh, a techno-economic
study will be carried out under the Project to determine the most
appropriate secondary conversion facilities and additional capacity
required at the ERL refinery to meet Bangladesh's petroleum requirements
economically (para 5.03).
D. Petroleum Product Marketing and Distribution
3.07      The distribution and marketing of petroleum products is
undertaken by three marketing companies: Burmah Eastern Company, Jammunah
Oil Company and Meghna Petroleum Company. The major share of the market
(41%) is held by Burmah Eastern; Jammunah Oil has 32% of the petroleum
products markets; while Meghna Petroleum controls 27%. According to BPC,
facilities for product distribution throughout the country are reasonably
adequate. In addition to these distributing companies, two special
products companies, the Eastern Lubricants Blenders Limited and the
Standard Asiatic Company, also subsidiaries of BPC, are engaged in the
blending and marketing of lubricants and special products.
IV. PROJECT SPONSORS
4.01      The sponsors of the Project are the Eastern Refinery Limited
(ERL), the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), and GOB (for the Energy
Monitoring Unit (EMU), the Planning Commission and the Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)). The EMU, the Planning
Commission and BUST are all GOB institutions. The operations and
performance of ERL and BPC are discussed below.
A. Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL)
1. Background
4.02      ERL was established in 1966 as a fully-integrated refinery
responsible for crude procurement, processing and sale of refined products.
It was originally owned 70% by the Pakistan Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation and 30% by French interests. In 1968, the 30%
French interests were purchased by the Burmah Oil Corporation (BOC) of the
United Kingdom. Following Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the 70%
Pakistani interests were taken over by GOB. The GOB interests were
transferred to BPC in 1976.  BOC continues to hold 30% of ERL's equity.
4.03      The 34,000 barrels per stream day (bpsd) (or 1.6 million metric
tons per year (tpy)) refinery was commissioned in 1968. It was designed to
process 34 API Arab Light crude oil.  Its processing facilities consist
of: (i) a crude unit; (ii) a distillate hydrotreater; (iii) a product
fractionator; and (iv) a catalytic naphtha reformer. A 70,000 tpy bitumen
plant located at the refinery is 100% owned by BPC.



- 16 -
4.04       In 1979, GOB transferred the procurement of crude and sale of
refined products to BPC, leaving ERL as a processing refinery only. ERL's
revenues from that time have been derived from the processing fee on crude
processed for BPC, and since FY82 also from the operating management fee in
respect of the 70,000 tpy bitumen plant it operates on behalf of BPC.  For
the crude processed for BPC, ERL is paid a processing fee made up of actual
expenses, including interest expense and depreciation, plus a profit
amounting to 15% (net of taxes) of its paid-in capital. In addition, ERL
receives a bonus equivalent to 25% of the value of any process fuel that it
may save from the 4.5 volume percent process fuel and loss that it is
allowed by BPC under the processing agreement; similarly, ERL is charged a
penalty equivalent to 25% of the value of process fuel used in excess of
the allowance. For the operating management of the bitumen plant, FRL
received in FY82 a fee of Taka 300,000 per month (approximately US$13,000)
after reimbursement of actual operating expenses.
2. ERL's Recent Financial Performance
4.05       ERL's fiscal year is July 1 to June 30.  A summary of its
financial performance in recent years, based on audited financial
statements for FY80 and FY81 (Project File, Reference A), unaudited
statements for FY82 and budget estimates for FY83 provided to the appraisal
mission are presented in Annex 4. Key statistics are summarized below:

Source: Eastern Refinery Limited
4.06      ERL's financial performance has been generally satisfactory
except for the long-term debt/equity ratio which stood at 75:25 as of June
30, 1982.  Of the Taka 212.2 million long-term debt outstanding, nearly 60%



- 17 -
(Taka 124.0 million) of it relates to debts contracted before the creation
of Bangladesh and whose servicing were frozen by GOB after 1971. Taka 93.4
million of this outstanding debt is due to ENSA (France) for the
construction of the refinery. The original amount of this liability was
French franc (ff) 78.8 million and Pakistani Rupees (Rs) 12.8 million.
Fifteen percent (15%) of the amount in ff was paid as downpayment with the
remainder payable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing in May 1968 at
an interest of 5% p.a. Payment of principal and interest was guaranteed by
the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation for the local
currency component, and COFACE of France for the French credit. Eight
semi-annual installments were paid from May 1968 up to Bangladesh's
independence in November 1971. No further payments have been made since
then as the liabilities were frozen by the GOB. Another Taka 13.6 million
are on account of crude oil procured under letters of credit in the
pre-independence period through then east Pakistan branches of a Karachi
bank for which payment was not due up to the day of independence. An
additional Taka 17 million are unpaid balances (since independence)
balances of redeemable debentures issued to then east Pakistan branches of
Karachi-based banks. All the debentures are past due for redemption. The
debentures are secured against fixed assets of ERL at an interest rate of
3.5% above the local bank rate subject to a minimum of 8.5% p.a. payable
half-yearly on the unpaid principal sum. ERL paid the interest up to the
date of maturity of the respective debentures to the Agrani Bank and the
Janata Bank of Bangladesh which indicated to be the successors to the
Karachi-based banks.
4.07     The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, together with BPC
and ERL, has taken up the settlement of these obligations with the External
Resources Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance. ERD has determined
that the pre-independence debts have not yet been settled; the obligors and
the payment procedures, however, have not been determined to date. The
payment procedures would need to take into account the changed operating
environment of ERL, that is, the fact that ERL is no longer an integrated
refinery and therefore deprived of the earning potential from the
substantial added value of the refined products.  Satisfactory assurances
have been obtained from the Government that the obligation for the payment
of these debts will be determined by June 30, 1984; and that the payment
procedures will not in any case adversely affect the financial condition of
ERL.
4.08      Outside of these pre-independence debts, the only long-term debts
of ERL are loans provided by GOB for tankage and other capital
improvements, the outstanding balance of which is Taka 88.2 million.
3. ERL's Operations and Current State of its Facilities
4.09       As stated in para 3.06, about 60% of Bangladesh's petroleum fuel
requirements are currently processed by ERL.' The production pattern of the
ERL refinery is limited to the composition of crude oil processed. The
existing process configuration does not include any secondary conversion
facilities and therefore does not provide flexibility to adjust the yield



- 18 -
pattern of the refinery to meet the changing demand profile for petroleum
products. The refinery's production yield pattern in FY81 compared to the
country's demand is presented below:
Bangladesh - ERL Production v/s Total Demand, FY81
(000s tons)
Surplus (+)
Product                     Production   Demand   Deficit (-)
LPG                             4.8         4.9         -0.1
Gasoline/Naphtha              152.3        55.6        +96.7
Middle Distillates            517.9    1,008.9        -491.0
Fuel Oil/Bitumen              540.5       421.6       +118.9
SubtotaL                 1,215.5    1,491.0        -275.5
Refinery Fuel and Losses       55.5        -
Total           1,271.0    1,491.0
It can be seen that in FY81, surpluses of about 97,000 tons of gasoline/
naphtha and about 119,000 tons of fuel oil had to be exported, while about
491,000 tons of kerosene and diesel oil had to be imported.
4.10      In addition to the inflexibility of the existing process
equipment which results in the imbalances between refinery yield and
demand, the current state of ERL's facilities limits refined product yield
to about 82% of design norms, as shown below:
Bangladesh - ERL Current Yields v/s Yields at Design Norms
(in 000s of tons, based on 34 API Arab Light Crude)

Motor Spirit                 53.7          73.0
Kerosene                    324.2         338.3
High Speed Diesel           122.7         246.0
Jute Batching Oil            37.2          37.2
Light Diesel Oil             33.8          33.8
Fuel Oil                    510.5         571.6
Bitumen                      30.0          70.0
Total          1,215.5       1,482.2
4.11       In addition to the main ERL refining facilities described in
para 4.03, ancillary facilities for the operation and maintenance of the
refinery consist of 4 diesel-operated power generators of 1.1 MW each to



- 19 -
supply the entire power requirement of the refinery as the grid power
supply from BPDB is most unreliable; 3 crude tanks providing 40 days of
crude storage requirements; 20 product tanks for storing and blending of
products; a workshop for repair and maint-nance; and fire-fighting
facilities.
4.12    All of ERL's facilities are in an acute state of disrepair due to
inadequate preventive maintenance. Repairs and replacements that are
necessitated by wear and tear in a complex industrial operation like a
petroleum refinery and have to be undertaken on a periodic, regular basis,
have not taken place due to lack of foreign exchange and continuous
departure of skilled personnel over the years (para 4.15). The cumulative
effect of the neglect, as noted, is that the refinery's crude throughput is
now limited to no more than 82% of design capability, while its yield
pattern is less than optimum. Substantial investment is required to
rehabilitate the process units to their design conditions and mechanical
integrity in order to increase capacity utilization and improve the yield
pattern.
4.13      The major problems facing the refinery are:  (a) due to its
inability to generate sufficient reliable power from the captive diesel
generating units, the naphtha reformer, a critical process unit, has been
shut down for over a year; (b) the efficiency of the crude unit has
deteriorated through the years and now requires complete replacement of
tubes and refractories; (c) several critical items of ancillary equipment
have corroded to a level requiring major repairs or replacement; and (d)
process pipelines as well as storage tanks are in poor condition requiring
repair and/or replacement. Even though the refinery is in a poor
condition, its mechanical state has still not reached a level where
rehabilitation would be uneconomic. Preliminary evaluation indicates that
the rehabilitation of the refinery could be accomplished at a cost
considerably below the investment that would be required to install a new
refinery of a similar configuration and capacity.  It is necessary however
to rehabilitate the refinery as a matter of urgency to avoid further
deterioration.  The Project will therefore, provide for the equipment,
materials and services required to restore the refinery's mechanical
integrity and increase capacity utilization to design levels. Assurances
have been received from ERL that it will prepare a long-term facilities
maintenance plan for IDA's review by December 31, 1984 and to implement
such a plan after the review.
4.14      In addition to the required rehabilitation, the ERL refinery,
similar to process units in other countries which were built prior to the
mid-1970s, had been constructed to minimize capital cost at the expense of
operating costs, primarily at the expense of higher energy consumption.
With the increase in petroleum prices experienced during the last 10 years,
there is now considerable economic incentive to reduce energy consumption
of the refinery through improvement of furnace efficiency, recovery of
energy from hot product streams to preheat the crude, reduction of
hydrocarbon gases lost through flaring, and substitution of fuel oil used
for energy generation in operations by natural gas. The Project will
provide for the execution of these measures.

4. Training Requirements of ERL
4.15      A major reason for the current state of ERL's facilities is the
dearth of experienced personnel, both in numbers and skills. ERL's current
professional staff (managers, engineers, skilled craftsmen and operators)
amounts to 116, against an approved level of 158. A large number of
experienced engineers and technicians have left the refinery for better job
opportunities abroad. Due to this exodus of trained personnel, refinery
operations and management have fallen below acceptable levels. There is
an urgent need to strengthen staff skills at all levels. Senior technical
and managerial staff are out of touch with current refinery technologies,
operating practices and management methods, and would need to attend
refresher courses and seminars that are organized by industry professional
bodies as well as spend time in modern refineries abroad to gain exposure
to modern techniques of refinery management, production planning, mainten-
ance procedures and other aspects associated with refinery operations. The
junior engineers, craftsmen and operators would need formal instruction in
refinery operations as well as on-the-job training. At present, ERL does
not have a satisfactory training program; the need for such a program is
however recognized. The post of Training Manager has remained vacant for
several years due to non-availability of a suitable candidate. Currently,
fresh recruits are assigned directly to operators without any formal
training or orientation. During negotiations, ERL agreed to engage a
suitably qualified and experienced person to fill the Training Manager
position as a condition of Credit effectiveness. Provision has been made
in the proposed Credit for ERL's training requirements, including the
services of a Training Manager for a 3-year period. In addition, to ensure
that staff trained under the Project are discouraged from leaving, ERL has
agreed to require these employees to provide adequate bonds assuring their
continued employment in ERL for a period of not less than 5 years, unless
the employees satisfactorily compensate ERL for the training costs
incurred.
5.  Insurance
4.16      At the time of appraisal, ERL was insuring the refinery facili-
ties for its depreciated book value, estimated at about US$6 million
equivalent. The replacement value of the facilities, even in their present
condition, was estimated by the refinery engineer consultant engaged by IDA
for the appraisal mission at US$60-80 million equivalent. Following
discussions during appraisal, ERL has since increased refinery insurance
coverage to US$16 million equivalent, and is currently reviewing with its
insurers critical elements of the refinery with a view to insuring these on
a replacement value basis.  Satisfactory agreement has been reached with
ERL that it will insure the refinery facilities for an appropriate amount
satisfactory to IDA.

B. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC)
1. BPC and Its Subsidiaries
4.17      BPC is a 100% state-owned corporation established in December
1976 to take over Government shares in petroleum companies operating in
Bangladesh. Except for planning and controlling activities, the
contracting of off-shore processing of Bangladesh-purchased crude and
the disposal of surplus products from refining operations, BPC performs its
functions through its subsidiaries. BPC's subsidiaries, their
responsibilities and ownership structure are summarized below:
BPC Subsidiaries

2. BPC Management and Operations
4.18      Management responsibility in BPC is vested in a Government-
appointed Board of Directors which consists of a Chairman and five
members. Two of the directors--the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources and the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of
Finance--are ex-officio. BPC employs a staff of 208 distributed as
follows: 107 in the secretariat (front office), 29 in operations
(commercial, distribution and marketing), 18 in planning and training and
54 in finance. At the time of appraisal, BPC had only a part-time
Chairman, no full-time Finance Director and no Operations Director. These



- 22 -
critical management positions have now been filled with full-time persons
whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory. The new chairman of
BPC was a member of the GOB delegation to the negotiations.
4.19      BPC's operations claim the largest share of Bangladesh's foreign
exchange earnings. In FY81, it required about US$490 million or about 69%
of the country's export earnings to finance its crude and product purchases
and, in FY82, about US$543 million and 87%, respectively. A review of
BPC's operations and management information system during the appraisal
identified two major weaknesses that need to be addressed urgently if BPC
is to be able to effectively carry out its responsibilities: (i) although a
small group of the professional staff consists of qualified individuals,
there is a need to strengthen this group with staff possessing the
necessary degree of skills and experience required to effectively carry out
the volume, diversity and complexity of the operations that BPC is charged
with; and (ii) the accounting and management information systems are
inadequate and cannot be used for effective decision-making. The last set
of financial statements examined by independent auditors is for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1979.  The findings of this audit, which reported
numerous system weaknesses, are still under discussion between BPC and the
auditors. The audit of FYs8O, 81 and 82 financial statements are yet to be
carried out.  BPC has agreed to: (i) ensure that the audit of its financial
statements for FY79-82 are completed by December 31, 1983 by independent
external auditors acceptable to IDA; (ii) thereafter have its annual
financial statements audited by independent external auditors acceptable to
IDA within six months of each fiscal year; and (iii) furnish to IDA copies
of its financial statements promptly upon completion of the audits.
4.20     The delays of the audits relate directly to the existing
weaknesses of the accounting and management information base. For example,
BPC has no fixed asset register; share certificates representing invest-
ments in some subsidiary companies are not available; and no reconciliation
is done for intra and intercompany transactions. These weaknesses need to
be addressed simultaneously. The Project would therefore provide financing
to upgrade the technical and managerial skills at both senior and middle
management levels, and to engage specialized consultants, in association
with BPC's external auditors, to review the existing accounting, control
and management information systems with the objective of restructuring them
to strengthen BPC's operating effectiveness.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Background
5.01      The main objectives of the Project are to assist Bangladesh to
(i) reduce the cost of imported petroleum; (ii) initiate energy
conservation activities; and (iii) carry out the necessary preparatory
work to capture the foreign exchange potential of its substantial natural
gas reserves. The Project was identified in the course of the joint
IDA-ADB energy assessment mission in October 1981. Its structure and
design were guided by the key recommendations made by that mission, and
accepted by GOB. It was appraised in two stages in May and October, 1982.



- 23 -
A key innovative feature of the Project is the carrying out of energy
audits in industrial facilities and preparation of a long-term energy
conservation program under the Energy Efficiency component included in the
Project (paras 5.10-5.133
B. Project Scope, Description and Implementation Arrangements
1. Project Scope
5.02      The Project consists of five components: (i) rehabilitation of
the ERL refinery in Chittagong to restore its mechanical integrity and
increase capacity utilization to design levels, improve its operations, and
reduce its energy consumption, and the carrying out of a techno-economic
study to determine further modifications required to ensure that the
refinery's yield pattern will be in balance with the changing long-term
demand profile for petroleum fuels in the country; (ii) technical
assistance to improve the accounting, financial and management information
systems of BPC; (iii) an energy conservation program to improve the
efficiency of energy use in the industrial sector; (iv) the carrying out of
detailed feasibility studies on gas-based export-oriented projects to
establish their viability; and (v) research and development on the
possibilities of using natural gas-derived methanol as an extender of
middle distillate products and in other non-conventional applications.
Details of each of the components and the implementation arrangements are
described below.
2. Detailed Description and Implementation Arrangements
(a) Refinery Rehabilitation Component
5.03       This component consists of four subcomponents:
(i) provision of equipment, materials and engineering
services to carry out repair, replacement and maintenance of tanks,
furnaces, columns, vessels, pumps, compressors, pipes, etc., to restore the
mechanical integrity and increase capacity utilization of the refinery by
about 15%, reduce refinery petroleum fuel consumption and losses, and
displace about 36,000 tons per year of petroleum process fuel by the use of
natural gas. A detailed list of the items is presented in Annex 5-1;
(ii) 138 man-months of project implementation, operating and
maintenance expertise to assist ERL to carry out the rehabilitation work
and operate and maintain the refinery in an acceptable manner;
(iii) training, including 36 man-months of services of a
Training Manager, to upgrade the skills of existing refinery staff and
of new staff. The outline of the proposed training program and the
qualifications and experience of the Training Manager are presented in
Annex 5-2; and
(iv) 320 man-months, including an estimated 295 man-months
of expertise from specialized consultants to carry out a study to
debottleneck the refinery and determine the appropriate secondary



- 24 -
conversion and additional capacity required to remove the imbalance between
the refinery yield pattern and the country's demand profile.3/
5.04      ERL will be responsible for implementation of this component with
assistance from local contractors and vendor specialists where required.
TECHNTP (France), the original designers of the refinery, were retained
under the ongoing Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 1124-BD) to confirm
the extent of work required to restore the refinery's mechanical integrity.
TECHNIP provided 10 man-months of inspection expertise during ERL's
October-November 1982 maintenance shutdown period and prepared detailed
implementation design, including bill of materials with specifications, for
the acquisition of the necessary equipment and materials. TECHNIP's report
was made available to ERL and IDA in February 1983. The implementation
arrangements are designed to ensure that the refinery can continue to
operate during repair/maintenance work; activities requiring a shutdown of
the refinery will be scheduled for the 1983 and 1984 planned maintenance
shutdown periods. The appointment of a project implementation coordinator,
with experience and qualifications satisfactory to IDA, to be responsible
for the repairs, maintenance and replacement sub-component (para 5.03 (i)),
is a condition of credit effectiveness; the coordinator will be retained
till completion of the rehabilitation work. The project coordinator will
be responsible for the procurement and supervision of the necessary
repa'rs, maintenance and replacement work.  Erection and commissioning will
be carried out by ERL's maintenance staff who have adequate skills for this
aspect of implementation. They will be assisted by local contractors and
vendor technicians where required.
5.05      To assist in operating and maintaining the refinery in an
acceptable manner (para 5.03 (ii), ERL will engage an experienced firm by
September 30, 1983 to provide operating technical and maintenance
expertise. The firm will be required to provide a full-time technical
services expert for the duration of Project implementation and other
experts such as process engineer, maintenance specialist and refinery
management advisor on call for various periods to be determined by ERL.
The work of these experts will be arranged in a manner to permit their
counterpart ERL staff, after gaining initial exposure to them, to go on
study tours and visit foreign refineries (para 5.03 (iii)) and return
before the end of the experts' tenure. In addition to these, ERL has
agreed, as a condition of credit effectiveness (para 4.15), to engage the
services of a Training Manager with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDA to assist in designing and implementing a training
program consistent with ERL's requirements and to retain such services at
least for 3 years. The design of the training program will be subject to
IDA's review; ERL will be required to submit the training program design
for IDA's review by December 31, 1983, and to implement the program after
such review.
3/   Tne man-month estimates include the basic engineering and tender
documents preparation for the secondary conversion facility selected.

5.06      With respect to the Debottlenecking and Secondary Conversion
Techno-Economic Study subcomponent (para 5.03 (iv)), a task force
consisting of the BPC Chairman, the General Manager of ERL, the Manager for
Planning, Control, and Research and Development (ERL), and the Chief
Planning Manager (BPC) has been established to supervise the carrying out
of the study. The task force has received proposals from five firms
approved by IDA; the Terms of Reference (Project File, Reference B) on
which the proposals were based, were prepared with IDA's assistance.
Selection of the firm to carry out the study is expected to be completed by
end-May 1983; the consultants are expected to begin work by June 1983. The
study is divided into two phases: the first phase will study the extent of
additional debottlenecking that may be viable and will carry out the
identification and techno-economic analysis of various technical options
for process modification to provide the refinery with the necessary
secondary conversion facilities to match its yield to the long-term
petroleum product demand profile. The second phase, which will cover
detailed preparation of the selected option for implementation, including
development of its process engineering package, will commence only after
GOB, BPC, ERL, and IDA have approved the first phase findings and agreed on
an option as being optimum.  The first phase of the study is expected to be
completed by October 1983 and the second phase by September 1984. GOB will
submit the results of the first phase for IDA's review by November 30,
1983.
5.07   The design, detailed elements and implementation arrangements for
the Refinery Rehabilitation Component were discussed with Burmah Oil
Corporation in London by the appraisal mission, in addition to their being
discussed at ERL's Board meetings on which Burmah Oil is represented.
Burmah is in agreement with the proposed rehabilitation measures and has
expressed support for the proposed IDA Credit.
(b) BPC Accounting and Management Information
Systems Technical Assistance Component
5.08     This component consists of two parts: (i) 45 man-months of
services from an experienced accounting and management information systems
consulting firm to review the existing accounting, control and management
information system, design an improved system to support BPC's operations,
and design a training program to improve the skills of BPC's financial
staff; and (ii) training abroad of up to eight BPC senior and middle-level
management staff. Terms of Reference for the work to be carried out by the
selected consultants which have been agreed on with BPC are presented as
Annex 5-3.
5.09      The study will be executed under the supervision of BPC's Finance
Director with the assistance of foreign consultants and BPC's external
auditors. Together with these auditors, the consultants will conduct an
audit of the existing accounting and information systems and design a
package of improvements and a program of implementation. In the course of
the systems audit, staff requirements, both in terms of numbers and skills,
will also be identified and a hiring/training program incorporated in the
improvement program. Up to eight senior and middle-level staff of BPC
will be sent abroad for short professional courses as part of the training



- 26 -
program.  The experience, qualifications, selection and service conditions
of the consulting firm will need to be satisfactory to IDA. It is expected
that invitations to a short-list of qualified firms will be issued by June
1983 and the successful consulting firm selected by September 1983. The
work by the consultants under this component, which includes implementation
of the improved system as well as training of BPC accounting and finance
staff, is expected to be completed by March 31, 1985.  BPC will be required
to submit, no later than June 30, 1984, the consultant's report for IDA's
review before its implementation. The overseas training of the
middle-level and senior staff will be carried out at the same time and is
expected to be completed by March 1985.
(c) Energy Efficiency Component
5.10     This component consists of four parts:  (i) 110 man-months of
consulting expertise to assist the EMU to prepare and carry out a long-term
program of national industrial energy conservation and the carrying out of
energy audits in up to 40 medium-to-large energy-using enterprises in the
chemicals, fertilizer, pulp and paper, steel and metal works, textiles,
jute, cement, brick and clay, sugar, tea and tobacco industries and power
plants; (ii) mobile energy measuring equipment for use by the EMU sEaff;
(iii) overseas training for EMU staff; and (iv) developing a library of
relevant literature on energy conservation. About 85 of the 110 man-months
of the consulting expertise will be utilized to carry out the energy
audits. It is the intention of GOB to package the results of the energy
audits into an industrial energy conservation project in order to seek
donor assistance for carrying it out.
5.11      In preparation for carrying out the activities under this
component, the Government established in January 1983 the EMU in the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The unit will initially be
staffed by a Director and two senior persons with extensive practical
experience in the management of energy in the industrial and power sectors
and be assisted by six persons with backgrounds in industrial energy use
who would be trained under the Project to become energy auditors. The
EMU's responsibilities will include (i) acting as the coordinating agency
for all activities for improving the efficiency of energy use in the
industrial and power sectors; (ii) formulating policies and preparing
programs for energy conservation, initially with the help of the
specialized consultants to be employed under the component, and in
cooperation with other Government Ministries and agencies (e.g., the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and public sector corporations); (iii)
carrying out, initially with the help of the specialized consultants,
energy audits of all major energy-using industries to identify their energy
savings potential, and appraising measures for capturing the identified
savings; (iv) organizing and conducting, initially with the help of the
consultants and thereafter with its own staff, promotional and awareness
seminars for senior officials of the concerned Ministries and agencies,
including public sector corporations and managers of enterprises in the
industrial and power sectors; (v) developing a library of relevant
technical literature in the area of energy conservation, including
pamphlets and brochures for making the industries aware of the benefits of



- 27 -
energy conservation, and of ways to achieve them; (vi) establishing and
publicizing standards and targets for improving the energy use by
industry/products; and (vii) providing analysis, by sub-sector, on energy
savings potential and achievable consumptioa targets by type of facilities,
or major processes or product lines, and by categories of equipment to
enable formulation of policies and programs by the Government for long-term
energy conservation.
5.12      In addition to the EMU, GOB has agreed to require each of the
concerned public sector corporations and major energy-consuming industries
and power plants to be covered under this component to appoint energy
coordinators at the corporate level and energy managers4/ in the respec-
tive plants to be in charge of the energy conservation activities. An
Energy Conservation Coordination Group will also be formed to provide
guidance to EMU and to ensure coordination and cooperation of concerned
ministries and agencies. Its membership will include appropriate senior
officials responsible for the industry and/or energy divisions in the
Planning Commission, Ministry of Industry and Commerce and will be chaired
by the representative of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The
appointment of the Director of EMU will be a condition of credit
effectiveness, while staffing of the EMU with persons whose qualifications
and experience are acceptable to IDA, and the setting up of the Energy
Conservation Coordination Group in a manner satisfactory to IDA are
conditions of disbursement for the portion of the Credit allocated to this
component. GOB has agreed to keep the EMU adequately staffed with
experienced personnel throughout the Project implementation period.
5.13      The energy audits to be carried out under this component by the
consultants are expected to begin by March 1984 and be completed by
September 1985. Under the energy audits, the consulting firm will (i)
identify and prepare specifications of the equipment needed for economi-
cally viable short- and medium-term conservation in all selected industrial
facilities; and (ii) recommend energy saving measures through desired
changes in operating procedures. While focusing on measures for improving
the efficiency of energy use, the energy audits will also aim at identi-
fying other measures which could lead to improvements in the efficiency of
overall operations of the plants.  The consultants will also assess
required training of equipment operators, maintenance staff and engineers,
and design an appropriate training program. They will provide on-the-job
training to Bangladeshi counterpart staff (EMU energy auditors, energy
4/ These are not expected to be new staff; they will be persons already
employed by their respective organizations who have primary
responsibilities for production cost management and/or energy supply
units in their organization.



- 28 -
coordinators and energy managers), conduct training seminars for energy
coordinators and energy managers, and workshops for energy equipment
operators, maintenance engineers and technicians of the facilities
visited. It is estimated that about 25 man-months of the total expertise
financed uinder the component will be required for the assistance in
organizing the work of the EMU, and the training. Terms of Reference for
the consulting services will be discussed and agreed upon with GOB upon the
appointment of the EMU Director. The qualifications, experience, selection
and conditions of service of the consulting firm will need to be acceptable
to IDA,
(d) Gas-based Projects Feasibility Studies Component
5.14      This component consists of the provision of 140 man-months of
specialized consultancy services to carry out a study to (i) identify the
potential for natural gas use either for direct export or for chemical
product industries for export markets; (ii) assess the investment needed
for such projects; (iii) evaluate the economic benefits of such invest-
ments; (iv) recommiend a priority order of these investments based on
economic benefits; and (v) recommend an incentive structure for attracting
foreign private capital.
5 15      The component will be carried out by the Chemical Industries
Division of the Planning Commission with the assistance of James Chemical
Engineering (JCE) of the US who have been selected to provide the
consultancy services. The latter were selected from among seven firms who
submitted proposals in response to invitations from the Planning
Commission. The Terms of Reference on which proposals were invited were
prepared with IDA's assistance (Project File, Reference C). The contract
for JCE's services will be signed by the end of May, with the work expected
to begin by June 1, 1983.
5.16       The study is divided into two phases.  Phase I consists of(i)
identifying all potential uses of known natural gas, based on proven
tecnnology, for both domestic and export markets; (ii) assessment of
investment and operating costs associated with the facilities required for
such uses; (iii) analysis of the transmission and distribution facilities
needed to support such identified potential uses; (iv) ranking of the
identified potentical uses on the basis of the net-back value of the natural
gas, in constant prices, taking into account the recovery of the capital
and operating costs and the transmission and distribution costs associated
with each identified potential use, at opportunity costs of capital ranging
between 12 and 20%, and (v) recommendations of an overall strategy that
should be pursued by GOB in carrying out the projects with the highest
net-back value. Phase I is expected to be completed by December 1983.
5.17      Phase II of the study consists of detailed feasibility studies
and preparation of practical and economic implementation plans for the
individual projects. The execution of this phase would be contingent on



- 29 -
GOB and IDA reviewing the conclusions emerging from the Phase I and being
satisfied that the recommended strategy would lead to maximization of the
benefits from natural gas if further developed in Phase II. About three
months are expected to be required by GOB and IDA for the indicated review,
following which GOB will indicate to the consultants the potential projects
emerging out of Phase I for which the detailed feasibility studies will be
carried out. The study is expected to be carried out over a period of 28
months.
(e) Research and Development Component
5.18-     A methanol project based on natural gas, which is sponsored by
Davy McKee Corporation of the United Kingdom (UK) and a private Bangladeshi
investor, is being considered by the Government for implementation. While
the output of the project is currently destined for export, the Government
would like to examine the possibilities of methanol use in Bangladesh as an
extender of middle distillates and in other non-conventional applications.
Preliminary work in this area has already been carried out at the Chemical
Engineering Department of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and
Technology (BUET).  This component would support a program to continue the
research work over a three-year period. The proposed 3-year research
program was reviewed by the mission (Project File, Reference D) and found
satisfactory. The work to be carried out will include studies of methanol
as a blended fuel, the appropriate levels of blend, properties for safe
handling, toxicity levels and the potential for methanol use as domestic
and/or industrial fuel.
5.19      BUET will carry out this phase of its research program in
collaboration with an experienced foreign research institution to ensure
access to peer review of research results. It will be a condition of
disbursement for the portion of the proposed Credit allocated to this
component that BUET has entered into an arrangement satisfactory to IDA for
the required collaboration.
C. Implementation Schedule
5.20      The above implementation arrangements have been discussed with
GOB and the executing agencies of the various components and are considered
satisfactory. A detailed schedule of the implementation of the Project is
presented in Annex 5-4.
D. Monitoring and Reporting
5.21      Each of the five executing agencies in the Project (ERL, BPC,
EMU, Planning Commission and BUET) will be required to keep separate
records and accounts on their respective components. The Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources will prepare quarterly progress reports
covering all aspects of the Project, based on review of the activities in
each Project component, for submission to and exchange of views with IDA.
5.22      ERL and BPC have agreed to submit to IDA, within six months of
their respective financial years, their annual financial statements audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audits are to include



- 30 -
separate comments on the use of the IDA funds. In addition, BPC has agreed
to have its backlog of annual financial statements audited up-to-date by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA (para 4.19); copies of these audited
statements will be submitted to IDA no later than December 30, 1983.
Thereafter, BPC will submit its annual financial statements, audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, within six months of each fiscal
year.
VI. PROJECT COST, FINANCING PLAN AND IDA CREDIT FEATURES
A. Project Cost Estimate
6.01      The total financing requirements of the Project, including
physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$36 million
equivalent, of which US$27.4 million is in foreign exchange. The detailed

6.02      The base cost estimates are expressed in December 1982 prices.
Estimates for the Refinery Rehabilitation Component were prepared by ERL
staff based on preliminary engineering design, price quotation of major
replacement items and materials for repairs received from vendors. These
were reviewed by the TECHNIP inspectors (para 5.04) and IDA staff and found
reasonable. Cost estimates for the Energy Efficiency component are based
on the estimates of the IDA energy conservation consultant on the appraisal
mission. Consultant services, which are expected to be obtained from
abroad are based on the following average man-month rates:
Average Man-Month Rates for Consultant Services

- Gas-based Projects Feasibility Studies                         14,000
The above average man-month rates, which cover fees, reimbursable expenses
such as travel and computer programming, are within the range of prevailing
man-month rates in the energy industries.
6.03      Physical contingencies were calculated at 10% of base cost
estimate for the Refinery Rehabilitation Component and 15% for all the
other components. Price contingencies were calculated on the basis of
expected increases in international prices, in dollar terms, of 8% in 1983,
7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986. These rates were applied on both
foreign and local costs assuming that the difference between international
and domestic inflation rates will be accounted for in the foreign exchange
rate adjustments undertaken by the Government periodically.
B. Financing Plan
6.04      The proposed IDA Credit of US$28.5 million will provide 79% of
the total financing requirements; it will cover 100% of the foreign ex-
change cost of the Project and 13% of the local cost. The balance of the
local cost will be provided by ERL from internal sources. To assure that
there would be sufficient resources to complete the Project, GOB is
required to commit itself to provide, or cause to be provided by other



- 33 -
beneficiaries of the Credit, funds, as well as facilities, services and
other resources necessary to complete the Project. The proposed financing
plan is summarized below:

6.06     GOB will relend the portion of the proposed Credit allocated to
ERL at an interest rate of 14% p.a. and on repayment terms of 12 years,
including 4 years of grace; these terms are consistent with those
applicable to long-term lending in Bangladesh. Interest on the on-lent
portion accruing during the construction period will be paid by ERL from



- 34 -
its internal cash generation. ERL will bear the foreign exchange risk.
The proceeds of the IDA Credit for the Energy Efficiency, the Gas-based
Projects Feasibility Studies and the Research and Development components
will be retained by the Government for those components. The portion of
the Credit allocated for the BPC technical assistance will be passed on as
a grant.
D. Procurement
6.07      About 47% of the proposed IDA Credit will be applied to financing
the procurement of equipment, materials and engineering services; another
39% for consulting services for studies and energy audits; and the balance
of 14% for institution-building (Operating and Maintenance Management
Assistance to ERL, training for ERL, BPC and EMU staff, and the Research
and Development Component).  Consulting services under the Project will be
obtained in accordance with IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Equipment financed by the proposed Credit will be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) except for (i) equipment proprietary to process
design or requiring compatibility with existing units which will be
procured from single source by negotiation, and (ii) small items estimated
to cost less than US$80,000 each which may be procured through limited
international bidding (LIB) from at least three suppliers outside
Bangladesh. Contractor services required by ERL, which are expected to be
obtained locally, will be by local competitive bidding procedures, which
are satisfactory.

6.09      Items to be procured from single source through normal commercial
practice, which consist of proprietary technology for the Merox unit and
replacement parts for existing equipment included in the ERL Rehabilitation
component, will not: exceed US$2.2 million; while items to be procured
through LIB will not exceed US$1.7 million.
E.   Disbursement
6.10      As noted previously, the proposed IDA Credit will finance 100% of
the foreign exchange cost and 13% of the local cost or 79% of the total
Project cost. The proceeds of the Credit are expected to be completely
disbursed by the first quarter of calendar 1987. All disbursements will be
fully-documented. Detailed estimates of disbursements of the IDA Credit
are presented in Ainex 6-2. The estimates take into account Bank and IDA
experience on projects reflecting the characteristics of the individual
components and the stages of implementation activities of each component.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Given the nature of the Project, financial analysis was carried
out for the Refinery Rehabilitation Component only. The projected
financial performance of ERL and the financial rate of return analysis of
the component are discussed.below.
A. ERL's Financial Outlook
1. Production Schedule After Rehabilitation
7.02      The rehabilitation of the refinery facilities is expected to be
completed by March 1986, and increase processing capability from the
current 1.2 million tons p.a. to 1.5 million tons p.a. The overall
refinery is expected to have a useful life of 10 years after
rehabilitation. The expected incremental yields following rehabilitation
are shown below:

In addition to the facilities required to achieve the increase in
production, the Project includes facilities to enable ERL to reduce its
process fuel consumption from 4.5% on crude to 3.7% and to substitute
36,000 tons per year of petroleum fuel consumed for process operations by
natural gas. The natural gas substitution facilities are expected to be
completed for use by December 1984.
2. Processing Costs
7.03      Two items in processing costs--administrative overheads and
salaries, wages and employee benefits--are expected to remain about the
same in real terms after rehabilitation. However, to keep the refinery in
efficient running condition after rehabilitation, it is assumed that repair
and maintenance costs estimated at 2.5% of the year-end fixed operating
assets after rehabilitation would be required; this assumption is con-
sistent with industry practice. Also, in line with the insurance require-
ment in para 4.16, it is assumed that the refinery will be insured for its
approximate replacement value, the premium for which has been estimated at
1% of the year-end gross fixed assets. Further, it is expected that after
Project completion, ERL will require technical services support from an
experienced foreign refinery operator to continue the critical elements of
the Operating and Maintenance Management Technical Assistance being
provided under the Project; it is estimated that about 10 man-months p.a.
of such technical expertise, at an estimated cost of about US$15,000 per
man-month in 1982 terms, will be required. Depreciation has been based on
straight line over 10 years. All other processing costs are based on ERL's
experience.

3. Financial Projections
7.04      Pro-forma financial statements (income, sources and application
of funds and balance sheet) for ERL with the rehabilitation were prepared
in current Takas on the basis of ERL's fiscal year (July 1 to June 30).
Revenues were calculated on the basis of the present process fee formula
between ERL and BPC (para 4.04) assuming that settlement of the pre-indep-
endence long-term debt outstanding without prejudice to ERL's financial
position (para 4.07) will result in their conversion to paid-in capital.
Assumptions used and the detailed projections are presented in Annex 7-1.
7.05      Key data from the detailed projections summarizing ERL's expected
financial performance and comparison with FY82 performances are presented
below:

7.06      As can be seen from the financial projections, the rehabilitation
will have a positive impact on ERL's financial position. Net income after
taxes is calculated to increase from the Taka 27.3 million in FY84 to Taka
51.7 million in FY87, the first year of operation after rehabilitation;
internal cash generation is projected to increase from Taka 77 million to
Taka 194.7 million during the same period. Net income after taxes is pro-
jected to improve throughout the component's life. Minimum current and
debt service ratios (2.0 and 1.7, respectively) during the life of the com-
ponent are projected to occur in FY88 when ERL begins to repay the on-lent
IDA funds to GOB.

B. Financial Rate of Return
7.07      The financial rate of return analysis was carried out in constant
1982 prices. Given the nature of the component, an incremental approach
was used for the analysis.  The capital co,  was derived from the total
base capital cost and associated physical contingencies, after subtracting
the base capital cost and associated physical contingencies of the
Debottlenecking and Secondary Conversion Techno-Economic Study whose
benefits would be associated with a future modification project. On this
basis, the capital cost for this component is estimated to be US$20.2
million, or Taka 465.6 million, in December 1982 prices. A 10-year
economic life with no residual value was assumed. Assumptions used in the
analysis are presented in Annex 7-2; a summary of the financial cost and
benefit streams is presented in Annex 7-3. The base case financial rate of
return before taxes and results of sensitivity tests carried out are
summarized below:
Refinery Rehabilitation Component--Financial Rate of Return (%)
Base Case (Before taxes)                             17
Sensitivity Analysis
(a) Capital Costs up 10%                             14
(b) Bonus on fuel savings down 10%                   16
(c) Bonus on fuel savings down 20%                   15
(d) Fuel savings delayed by 1 year                   15
(e) Component delayed by 1 year                      13
(f) Combination of (a) and (c)                       12
7.08      The base case financial rate of return before taxes in real terms
is calculated at 17%, reflecting a reasonable profit and positive cash flow
beginning FY85 when ERL begins to displace petroleum process fuel by
natural gas upon completion of the natural gas substitution facilities
included in the component. ERL is expected to earn 25% of the value of
petroleum process fuel saved from the process fuel allowed by BPC; these
savings have been conservatively valued at the FOB (Chittagong) fuel oil
price.  Sensitivity test on variations in operating costs have not been
carried out as these will not affect the return since the process fee
formula compensates ERL for any of these variations. Sensitivity analysis
carried out indicates that the financial rate of return is most sensitive
to delays in completion of the rehabilitation. The financial rate of
return is substantially below the economic rate of return because the
processing fee paid to ERL, though sufficient to provide a reasonable
profit, does not reflect the total added value on the incremental refined
products.  These, and 75% of the value of petroleum process fuel saved,
accrue to BPC.
C. Financial Covenants
7.09      Agreements have been reached with GOB and the credit
beneficiaries on financial covenants that will ensure that the financing
plan for the overall Project is adequate and the Project is



- 40 -
satisfactorily funded. Agreements reached on the Project's financing plan
are discussed in paras 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06. Regarding the financial
position of ERL, agreement has been obtained from GOB that it will, by
June 30, 1984, provide an appropriate disposition for ERL's outstanding
pre-independence long-term debts in a manner that will not adversely affect
ERL's financial position (para 4.07). ERL has agreed to follow prudent
financial practices in its operations and meet the following requirements:
(i) maintain a long-term debt/equity ratio of not greater than 65:35 after
FY87; (ii) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5:1; (iii) not take any
action such as pre-payment of debt or distribution of dividends during the
implementation period and thereafter if such action will reduce the current
ratio below 1.5; (iv) not incur additional debt during the implementation
period and thereafter if by so doing the projected debt service coverage
will fall below 1.5; (v) not make any investments in fixed assets (other
than the Refinery Rehabilitation Component under the Project and for
maintenance purposes) during the implementation period in excess of an
aggregate amount of US$5.0 million without prior approval of IDA.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT RISKS
A. Introduction
8.01      As in the case of the financial analysis, the economic analysis
was carried out on the Refinery Rehabilitation Component only since the
benefits of the other components of the Project are not quantifiable. The
economic analysis was carried out on an incremental basis, that is, taking
into account only the refinery rehabilitation investments, the associated
incremental crude cost and incremental operating costs after rehabilitation
and the incremental benefits from increased yields and energy savings. The
costs and benefits used in the economic analysis were expressed in 1982
terms. No shadow price adjustments were made since the inputs and outputs
are tradeable goods. Major assumptions and details of the calculations are
presented in Annex 8-1; a summary of the economic cost and benefit streams
and the economic rate of return are presented in Annex 8-2.
B. Economic Capital and Operating Costs
8.02      The capital cost used for the economic analysis was the same as
that in the financial rate of return analysis.  Similarly, a 10-year
economic life with no residual value was assumed.
8.03      As shown in para 7.02, 230,800 metric tons p.a. of incremental
crude would be required after rehabilitation. The cost of the 230,800
incremental crude has been estimated on the prevailing FOR (Middle East)
price of US$29.0 per barrel, plus US$0.70 per barrel for freight, insurance
and handling to Chittagong which is consistent with Bangladesh's
experience. The per barrel CIF cost of US$29.70 is assumed to remain
constant to 1985 and in line with recent Bank Group assessment of future
petroleum price increases is assumed to increase in real terms at 3.3% per



- 41 -
annum from 1985 to 1990 and 4.2% p.a. to 1995. The annual incremental
crude costs after rehabilitation estimated on this basis and reflecting
appropriate real price increases are shown in Annex 8-1.
8.04      Fixed operating costs, without depreciation, and variable-costs
except process fuel, were derived on the same basis as the incremental
processing costs used in the financial rate of return analysis. Process
fuel costs were based on the FOB price of fuel oil for the marginal
increment in petroleum fuel (100 tons - para 7.02) required for process
operations after rehabilitation and on the opportunity value equivalent for
the 36,000 toe of natural gas to be used annually to displace petroleum
fuel for processing. Details of the calculations are presented in Annex
8-1.
C. Incremental Economic Benefits
8.05      Incremental economic benefits attributable to the component
consist of two elements: (a) the economic value of the incremental yields;
and (b) the economic value of the 36,000 tons of fuel of oil displaced
annually by natural gas. The economic value of the incremental yields was
based on the crude/product price ratios of recent refinery projects
financed by the Bank Group. The estimated economic value (in 1982 terms)
of the expected incremental yields in 1986, the first year of incremental
throughput, is summarized below:
Economic Value of Refinery Incremental Yields

a/ From para 7.02
D. Economic Rate of Return
8.06      The base case economic rate of return is estimated at about 68%.
A summary of the results of the analysis, along with sensitivity tests
carried out, is presented below:

Sensitivity Analysis
(a) Capital cost up 20%                                  58
(b) Capital and crude costs up 10%                       48
(c) Capital, processing and crude costs up 10%           47
(d) Benefits down 10%                                    44
(e) Benefits delayed 1 year                              16
(f) Combination of (a) and (d)                           37
While the component is sensitive to capital and crude cost increases and
particularly to delays in benefits, even under these adverse conditions the
rehabilitation appears satisfactorily attractive for Bangladesh to carry it
out.
E. Foreign Exchange Savings
8.07      The Refinery Rehabilitation Component is expected to result in
about US$225.8 million reduction in Bangladesh's oil import bill over the
life of the Project. Annual reductions range from an estimated US$18.6
million in 1986 to US$26.2 million in 1995. The calculations are summar-
ized in Annex 8-3. The reduction in petroleum import bill has been
estimated on the basis of the incremental refined petroleum products
imports avoided as a result of the rehabilitation less the incremental
crude imports required and incremental process chemicals plus the export
parity value of the 36,000 tons of process fuel oil displaced by natural
gas.
F. Sectoral Impact and Other Benefits
8.08      In addition to the economic benefits discussed above, the Project
will also assist in improving the operations of BPC, an organization which
in FY82 used about 87% of Bangladesh's export earnings for its operations.
The Project also provides for a techno-economic study which is expected to
result in a modification of the ERL refinery to further reduce the cost of
imported petroleum to Bangladesh.  The Project will assist Bangladesh to
strengthen the capability of the Energy Monitoring Unit to carry out energy
audits which will lead to an energy conservation project whose economic
benefits are expected to be very high and which will support the Govern-
ment's efforts to reduce its dependence on imported energy.  In addition,
the Project, through the Gas-Based Projects Feasibility Studies, will be
assisting Bangladesh to prepare to capture the foreign exchange potential
of its natural gas reserves.

G. Project Risks
8.09      The main risks are those deriving from the integrated nature of
the package of investments, technical assistance, studies and              %
institution-building included in the Project. The Project is complex in
design and ambitious in scope, involving several diverse institutions and a
number of components. A key factor for its success will be effective
coordination. In this regard, the coordination arrangements for the
overall Project as well as for the Energy Efficiency Component described in
Chapter V are considered satisfactory. Still, taking into account the
innovative feature of the Energy Efficiency Component and the weak
institutional capacity of ERL and BPC, a substantial effort in monitoring
and supervision on the part of IDA staff will be required and is planned
for. To the extent that IDA will thus assist Bangladesh to reduce its
imported energy bill, switch to low cost domestic natural gas for refinery
operations and provide critical analysis in preparation to realizing the
foreign exchange potential of the country's vast resources of natural gas,
the IDA monitoring and supervision effort on this Project is justified.
From a national standpoint, the Project entails on the other hand more
limited risks than other projects in Bangladesh involving significant
capital outlays and expansion of productive capacity.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      The following major assurances were obtained from GOB and the
beneficiaries during negotiations of the proposed Credit:
From GOB, BPC and ERL that
(a) the qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment of consultants to be engaged under the Project
will be satisfactory to IDA (paras 5.05, 5.06, 5.09, 5.13 and
5.15).
From GOB that it will
(a) periodically, but at least once a year, review and make
adjustments to the ex-refinery and retail prices of petroleum
products to the extent that may be required to ensure that
sufficient revenues are generated to cover the full cost of
petroleum procurement, processing and handling and allow
reasonable returns (para 2.19);
(b) submit the results of the study on BPC's accounting and
management information systems, for IDA's review by June 30,
1984 (paras 5.09);
(c) submit the results of the first phase of the Gas-Based
Projects Feasibility Study for IDA's review prior to
commencement of the second phase (paras 5.16 and 5.17);

(d)  direct corporations and plants to be audited for energy
conservation under the Project to appoint energy coordinators
at the corporate level and energy managers at the plant level
to be responsible for the energy conservation activities in
their respective corporations and plants (para 5.12);
(e)  establish an Energy Conservation Coordination Group, with
membership drawn from appropriate senior levels of Ministries
andL agencies with responsibilities for energy and industry to
provide guidance to the EMU and to ensure coordination and
cooperation of concerned Ministries and agencies (para 5.12);
(f)  cause all beneficiaries under the Project to keep separate
records and accounts on their respective components and,
further, cause the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
to prepare quarterly reports covering all aspects of the
Project for submission to and exchange of views with IDA
(para 5.21);
(g)  provide or cause to be provided funds, facilities, services
and other resources necessary to complete the Project
(paras 6.04 and 7.09);
(h)  relend the portion of the proceeds of the IDA Credit
allocated to ERL at an interest rate and on repayment terms
satisfactory to IDA (para 6.06);
(i)  cause procurement of equipment and services under the Project
to be carried out in accordance with IDA guidelines (para
6.07);
(j) by June 30, 1984 provide an appopriate disposition
of ERL's outstanding pre-independence long-term debts in a
manner that will not adversely affect ERL's financial
position (paras 4.07 and 7.09).
From BPC and ERL that each will
(a) submit to IDA, within six months of their respective
financial years, their annual financial statements audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA (para 5.22).
From BPC that it will
(a)   ensure that the audit of its financial statements are
brought up to date by independent external auditors
acceptable to IDA and furnish such audited statements to IDA
by December 31, 1983 (para 4.19).



- 45 -
From ERL that it will
(a) present to IDA for review (i) by December 31, 1984 a
long-term facilities maintenance plan and to implement such
a plan after the review (para 4.13);
(b) require employees trained under the Project to provide
adequate bonds assuring their continued employment in ERL
for a period of not less than 5 years, unless the employees
satisfactorily compensate ERL for the training costs
incurred (para 4.15);
(c) insure the refinery facilities for an appropriate amount
satisfactory to IDA (para 4.16);
(d) engage by September 30, 1983 a firm to provide maintenance,
technical, process engineering and refinery management
advisory services for the operation and maintenance of the
refinery during the Project implementation period (para
5.05);
(e) design a training program for its staff by December 1983 and
implement such training program after IDA's review (para
5.05); and
(f) submit to IDA by November 30, 1983 for review the results of
the first phase of the Debottlenecking and Secondary
Conversion Study (para 5.08); and
(g) follow prudent financial practices and comply with financial
covenants as described in para 7.09.
9.02      Subject to the above agreements, the Project is suitable for an
IDA Credit of US$28.5 million. A portion of the IDA Credit will be on-lent
to ERL at an interest rate satisfactory to IDA and on repayment terms
described in para 6.06. Execution of a satisfactory subsidiary loan
agreement between GOB and ERL and the approval by GOB of the Project
Proforma are conditions of Credit effectiveness. Other conditions of
Credit effectiveness are (i) appointment of the project implementation
coordinator and the Training Manager by ERL; and (ii) appointment of the
Director of EMU by GOB. Staffing of the EMU with persons whose
qualifications and experience are acceptable to IDA and the setting up of
the Energy Conservation Coordination Group are conditions of disbursement
for the portion of the IDA Credit allocated for the Energy Efficiency
component (para 5.12); satisfactory collaboration agreement between BUET
and an experienced foreign research institution assuring BUET of access to
peer review of its research and development program to be financed under
the Project is also a condition of disbursement for the IDA Credit funds
allocated to that component (para 5.19).

BANGLADESH - ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REFINERY REHABILITATION PROJECT
EASTERN REFINFRY LIMITED
Outline of Proposed Training Program
A. Introduction
1.        For the efficient operation, maintenance and administration of
the ERL refinery, there is an urgent need for starting a training program
at two levels: (a) senior management/technical staff, and (b) junior
engineer, operator and craftsman levels. As discussed in Section III of
the text, a large number of senior engineers and other experienced
technical staff of the refinery have left for better job opportunities
abroad. Due to this exodus of trained personnel, the refinery management
is finding it extremely difficult to function efficiently. As part of the
Project, ERL would institute a training program to upgrade the skills of
existing personnel and new recruits. To ensure that staff trained under
the Project are discouraged from leaving, the Government and ERL will
require these employees to provide adequate bonds assuring their continued
employment in ERL for a period of not less than 5 years, unless the
employee satisfactorily compensates ERL for the training costs incurred.
B.   Scope of Training Program
2.        Within the training program, it is intended for up to 12 senior
technical and managerial staff to be sent abroad to attend seminars,
various courses organized by industry professonal bodies and also to
foreign refineries to gain exposure to modern techniques of refinery
management, process economics, maintenance procedures and petroleum
economics over a three-year period. For the junior engineers, craftsmen
and operators, a full-fledged formal classroom training combined with
on-the-job training, is required. For this purpose, a formal training
center with classrooms, audio-visual aids, simulators, common refinery
equipment, such as heat-exchangers, condensers, valves, various types of
instruments, welding machines, pumps, tools, workshop equipment, etc.
would be established.
3.        The type of training envisaged would be along the following
lines:
(a) welder trainees will be given training on the theory of
welding, different types of welds, welding operation,
and maintenance of welding machines;after successful
training, the trainee would be attached to an
experienced staff for practical training on the job;
(b) operators would be given theoretical knowledge of
physical -'eparation by distillation, reforming,
treating, visbreaking, heat transfer, operation of
heater, coolers, condensers, pumps, compressors,
operating variables, operation of instruments, and
quality control.



- 54 -                            ANNEX 5-2
Page 2 of 2
For graduate engineers, the courses in the above training program will be
of a higher standard with special emphasis on material and heat balances,
unit operations covering various processes of the refinery, fundamentals of
refinery process design, calculation of the efficiency of furnaces and
exchangers, refinery economics and technical audit, production planning,
quality control, conservation of energy, etc.
4.        The training period for the craftsmen and operators will vary
from 3 to 12 months depending on the skill requirements while that of
engineering graduates will vary from 12 to 18 months.
C.   Qualifications of the Training Manager
5.        ERL does not now have a Training Manager.  As a condition of
Credit effectiveness, ERL is required to engage the services of an
experienced Training Manager to assist in carrying out the training program
(para 4.15 of text).
6.        The Training Manager will be required to have a degree in
chemical or mechanical engineering with not less than 15 years experience
in petroleum refining operations, with at least 5 of those years in
training of refinery personnel. The desired candidate is expected to be
from abroad.
D.   Responsibilities of Training Manager
7.        The Training Manager's responsibilities shall include, but not be
limited to:
(a)  developing a training program and coordinating all
activities for this program for refinery personnel
training;
(b) preparing the syllabus for training operators,
craftsmen and junior engineers;
(c) preparing a list of equipment and aids required for the
training center and monitoring their procurement and
their installation; and
(d) classroom lectures and training of the instructors
associated with the training program.
It is expected that many of the instructors would be senior refinery
technical personnel who will carry out the training function as part of
their normal schedule. The Training Manager will report to the Refinery
General Manager and will carry out other activities concerning the training
program as required.
8.        The detailed design of the training program, which is expected to
be completed by December 31, 1983, will be subject to IDA review (para
5.05) of the text).

BANGLADESH
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REFINERY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for BPC Accounting and Management Information
Systems Improvement Study
A.   Introduction
1.        The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has requested assistance from
the International Development Association (IDA) to finance a proposed
Energy Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project. The proposed
Project consists of an integrated package of investments, studies, and
institution-building measures directed towards the (a) improvement of the
operations of Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL), the country's only refinery;
(b) conservation of energy in the industrial sector; (c) an accounting
and management information systems improvement program for the Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC), parent company of ERL; (d) maximization of
benefits from the country's natural gas resources through the development
of export-oriented gas-based projects; and (e) a research and development
program on methanol as an extender of middle distillate petroleum
products. These Terms of Reference describe the scope of work required
from an experienced management and accounting firm to assist in carrying
out the accounting and management information systems improvement program
for BPC included in the proposed Project.
B.   Background
2.        BPC was established in 1976 as a holding company charged with the
responsibility of importing crude oil and refining, marketing and exporting
surplus petroleum products not required by the country. These activities
are carried out through six subsidiary companies. BPC's foreign operations
include processing arrangements with Shell and Esso Eastern Refineries in
Singapore, purchases of products from the spot market and from the USSR
under barter arrangements, and crude oil importations from Saudi Arabia,
UAE and Indonesia. BPC's accounting, control and management information
systems have proved inadequate to support these diverse activities.
External auditors who examined BPC's financial statements for FY 79, the
latest statements completely audited, have reported numerous system
weaknesses. The situation is worsened by the severe shortage of manpower
both in number and in skills. BPC is managed by a Board of Directors whose
members are appointed by the GOB.
3.        It is intended under the proposed Project to assist BPC in the
improvement of its accounting, control and management information systems
with the employment of external consultants, along with BPC's external
auditors, who would initiate work through a thorough audit of the existing
system. Improved systems would then be designed and implemented initially
with the assistance of the consultants. A training program to assure
continued availability of skilled personnel to implement the proposed
improved system should form part of the results.

ANNEX 5-3
Page 2 of 5
C.   Objectives
4.        The objectives of the consulting services for the accounting,
control and financial management improvement are:
(a)  To study the nature and type of powers and
responsibilities of BPC's Board of Directors, Chairman
and the Government, and recommend measures to bring out
the necessary changes to make the company management
responsible for day-to-day financial operations, and
overall future operations policies.
(b) To design an effective financial management unit at the
corporate level and assist BPC in implementing the new
organization and financial management practices.
(c) To develop and institute efficient management systems
and practices with special emphasis on management
reporting, financial accounting, internal auditing,
cost accounting and control, personnel management, long
and short-term corporate planning, etc., consistent
with local legal considerations.
D.   Scope of Work
Reorganization at Corporate Level
5.        To effectively function as a holding company for subsidiaries
engaged in diversified operations, a reorganization of BPC's corporate
finance unit may be necessary. However, such reorganization may have
restrictions and the implementation may require legislative action.
6.        In this context corporate finance level reorganization work will
cover:
(a) A thorough study and understanding of the legal and
institutional framework governing the formation and
operation of BPC, its transformation through the years
and present status, as well as proposed changes.
(b) After this study is completed a detailed report will be
prepared to establish the present status and problems
and recommendations of changes and/or reforms required
for effective functioning, suggesting alternative
arrangements for restructuring.
(c) Review and discuss this report with BPC Chairman, and
if so required, with the Ministries of Energy and
Mineral Resources and Finance as well as the Planning
Commission and establish accepted and practicable
principles, requirements and goals to form the basis of
the reorganization work.



- 57 -
ANNEX 5-3
Page 3 of 5
(d) Based on these principles, prepare a detailed proposal
for the reorganization of BPC's corporate finance unit
clearly delineating and explaining all line and staff
functions keeping in mind the financial organization
and operations of subsidiary companies.
(e) Present, review and discuss these proposals with BPC's
General Management, and if required, with other
authorities and/or institutions to establish an
acceptable solution.
(f) Based upon the accepted organization scheme, prepare or
help prepare the manpower requirements, personnel job
descriptions, training programs, job evaluations, and
procedures and standards clearly indicating line of
authorities and responsibilities.
Development of Financial Control and Accounting System
7.        The consulting firm should provide experienced finance and
accounting experts to develop, design and implement a financial control and
accounting system in BPC. Such a system should be designed as to properly
and timely reflect the corporation's operations and those of the
subsidiaries. It should be capable of accurately recording the various
inputs from all aspects of the corporation's and subsidiaries'operations
and should readily provide the wide range of data needed to assist
management in its operations and financial decisions. In developing the
financial control and accounting system, a careful review of Bangladeshi
laws and regulations as well as BPC's internal requirements is required to
avoid solutions which may not be compatible with local laws and conditions.
8.        The task of accounting experts shall include, but not be limited
to the following:
(a) Develop and help implement a "Cost Accounting System"
with accounts classification into variable and fixed
costs and direct and indirect costs, detailing cost
centers. The cost accounting system should be able to
generate information for assigning responsibility,
measuring inputs against norms, analyzing and
controlling cost variances from the norms and for
determining the level of profitability at plant level
so that petroleum prices can be fixed by the
Government, in consultation with BPC, with the full
knowledge of all costs. The system should also include
payroll accounting and procedures.



- 58 -
ANNEX 5-3
Page 4 of 5
(b) Develop and help implement a 'Standard Financial
Accounting System" and general accounts classifications
detailing balance sheets, income statements, cash flow
statements, etc., together with related policies,
systems procedures, principles of accounting,
recommended follow-up methods, and definitions.
(c) Develop and help implement a system of "Financial
Planning" including the introduction of operational
objectives and the planned allocation of resources in
the form of Operating Expense Budgets and Capital
Expenditures Budgets to be incorporated in the
consolidated corporation budget. The budgeting system
should be coordinated with the financial accounts in
order to reconcile budget variances with financial
figures.
(d) Help implement the use of related analytical techniques
for recording, planning, control and evaluation of
operational activities, including production
inventories, deliveries, stores management,
transportation, personnel, etc., and evaluate their
financial implications.
(e) Help implement an "Internal Auditing System" through
internal audit procedures and built-in internal checks
especially for the handling and accounting of cash,

ANNEX 5-3
Page 5 of 5
9.        The consulting services for Financial Management Improvement
component shall be carried out in coordination and consultation with the
financial units within BPC's subsidiaries.
Development and Implementation of a Training Program on Financial Control
and Accounting System
1Q.       The consulting firm engaged for this assignment would also
develop and implement a comprehensive training program on the financial
control and accounting system to be adopted in BPC. The consultants should
be prepared to provide close guidance to BPC finance personnel during the
early stages of the program implementation. The consultants will prepare a
Training Manual on Financial Control and Accounting System for BPC.
11.       The consultants would work closely with a core finance group in
BPC on the development of the financial control and accounting systems and
the training program. This core group should then be made ready to assume
full financial, accounting and/or training responsibilities when the
consultants complete the assignment.
E.   Qualifications of External Consulting Firm
12.       The selected consulting firm would have had at least 15 years of
experience in auditing, design of accounting management information
systems, accounting controls, as well as design of training programs to
train client staff to run the designed systems effectively. Experience in
petroleum industries in developing countries would be essential. A firm
deficient in any of the areas required by the Terms of Reference is
encouraged to associate itself with another firm to overcome the
deficiency(ies). All the personnel to be provided by the consulting firm
should have qualifications and experience acceptable to BPC and IDA. In
case BPC requests one or several of the personnel assigned to the job to be
changed, the consulting firm will respond to this request immediately and
will achieve the completion of the work on time and in accordance with
BPC's requests, by allocating and/or employing other personnel with
qualifications and experience acceptable to BPC and IDA.
F.   Schedule of Work
13.       The proposed work is expected to require about 45 man-months of
expertise; consulting firms submitting proposals are, however, requested to
quote their own man-month estimates based on their review of these Terms of
Reference. The work is expected to start September 1983 and to be
completed by March 1985. Two interim reviews would be required: the first
at the end of the audits of the backlog of financial statements and BPC
accounting and management information system weaknesses and the second at
the end of the draft report stage of the proposed systems improvements.
Following review and approval of the proposed system by BPC and IDA the
consultants would provide experts to assist BPC to put the approved system
in place.

REHABILITATION PROJECT
EASTERN REFINERY LIMITED
Assumptions Used for Financial Projections
I. Basis of Financial Projections
1.        Pro forma financial statements for ERL, based on its fiscal year
of July 1 to June 30, were prepared in nominal Takas for the years FY84 to
FY95. Inflation rates assumed were: 8/% in FY84, 7.5% in FY85, 7% in FY86
and 6% thereafter. The detailed projections are presented at the end of
this Annex as Tables 1 (Pro forma Income Statements), 2 (Pro forma
Statement of Sources and Application of Funds) and 3 (Pro forma Balance
Sheets). Key assumptions underlying the projections are presented below.
II. Capital Expenditures
2.        The expenditure profile shown below reflects the nature of the
component (repair of existing facilities, technical assistance, training
and studies), the advanced stage of implementation activities and Bank
Group experience with projects in the petroleum refining industries.
Disbursement in the first year is larger than in similar projects due to
(a) ERL having already started with some of the repair work, (b)
arrangements for obtaining some of the critical technical assistance
personnel being made a condition of effectiveness and (c) the engagement of
consultants for the Debottlenecking and Secondary Conversion Techno-
economic Study expected to be completed before credit effectiveness. The
expenditure profile includes physical contingencies of 10% and price
escalation estimated on the basis of international inflation rates
projected by the Bank Group (para 6.03 of the text). Interest charges on
the on-lent IDA funds have been computed at the rate of 14.0% p.a.; the
payments have been reflected in the pro-forma income statements as an
operating expense.

3.        Due to the nature of the Component, the assets replaced or
repaired are expected to be added to assets in operation as and when they
are completed. It is assumed that 75% of assets under repair/replacement
in the year would be completed and added to assets in operation during the
year, as shown below:

Year-end                                    53.0   87.5       57.6
4.        Following rehabilitation, the facilities are expected to have a
useful life of at least 10 years. Depreciation is on a straight line
basis.
III. Component Financing
5.        ERL would finance the local cost component from internally
generated funds. ERL's financial position is projected to be sufficiently
satisfactory to enable it to generate sufficient internal funds for the
local cost contributions. In addition, ERL would be prevented from paying
dividends to its shareholders until the Project is completed (para 7.09 of
the text). These assumptions, reflected in the cash flow statements, show
ERL generating sufficient funds to cover the local cost.
IV. Projected Income Statements
Production Schedule
6.        The ERL rehabilitation program is expected to be mechanically
completed by March 1986.  It would increase the refinery's processing
capability within design from the current 1.2 million tpy to the design
norm of 1.5 million tpy. The expected incremental yields are shown on the
following page:

Revenue Build-up
7.       Revenues have been calculated on the basis of the current process-
ing agreement between ERL and BPC (para 4.04 of the text), assuming that
the settlement by GOB of the outstanding pre-liberation long-term debts
(para 7.09 of the text) will result in their being converted into paid-in
capital. The existing processing fee arrangement calls for reimbursement
by BPC of all actual processing costs of ERL for the crude processed for
BPC, including depreciation and interest charges, plus 15% return after
taxes, on paid-in capital which at the 50% corporate tax rate translates
to 30% return on paid-in capital before taxes. Management fee for the
bitumen plant has been included in the revenues on the basis of existing
arrangements of Taka 3.6 million per year in 1982 prices. The bitumen
plant is assumed to have a 12-year economic life and revenues derived by
ERL from management of its operation are phased out after FY93. ERL is
also paid a bonus of 25% of process fuel saved from the 4.5% process fuel
and losses on crude it is allowed. With the energy efficiency features
included in the component, ERL is expected to operate on a long-term basis
of process fuel and losses of not more than 3.7% on crude. Facilities
which have been included in the component to enable ERL to use natural gas
for a substantial portion of its operations will allow, annually, 36,000
tons of the expected 3.7% fuel consumption level to be displaced by natural
gas. Facilities for the substitution of the 36,000 tons of petroleum
process fuel by natural gas are expected to be completed for use by
December 1984. It is expected that BPC would seek to reduce the fuel
consumption allowed ERL from the present 4.5% to 3.7% after rehabilitation
and only the value of the bonus on the 36,000 tons of petroleum process



- 66 -
ANNEX 7-1
Page 4 of 5
fuel saved through substitution by natural gas has been included in the
revenue projections. The petroleum fuel savings bonus earned by ERL is
compensated for on the basis of ex-refinery prices of expected product
yields based on the type of crude processed. These prices are
substantially higher than the import parity equivalent prices (para 2.17 of
the text). For the purposes of the projections, however, the bonus to be
derived by ERL from the petroleum fuel savings has been conservatively
valued at the FOB fuel oil price estimated at US$150 per ton in 1982 terms
on the basis of the prevailing crude oil price of US$29 per barrel p.a. The
value of the bonus is assumed to increase in real terms at 3.3% p.a. from
FY86 to FY90 and 4.2% p.a. thereafter in line with recent Bank Group
assessment of future energy prices.
Processing Costs
8.      Fixed Costs:  Salaries, wages and personnel benefits and overheads
are not expected to materially increase in real terms as a result of the
rehabilitation. To keep the refinery in efficient running condition after
rehabilitation, annual repair and maintenance costs estimated at 2.5% of
the year-end fixed operating assets after rehabilitation are assumed to be
required; this assumption is consistent with industry practice. In line
with the insurance requirement in para 4.16 of the text, it is assumed that
the refinery will be insured for its approximate replacement value--
insurance premium on this basis has been estimated at 1% of the year-end
gross fixed assets. Further, it is assumed that after Project completion,
ERL will require technical services support from an experienced foreign
refinery operator or refinery process engineering firm to continue the
Operating Management technical assistance included in the component. Such
technical service has been estimated at 10 man-months p.a. at a cost of
US$15,000 per man-month in 1982 US dollar terms. Depreciation is based on
straight line over 10 years with no residual value. All other fixed costs
are based on ERL's experience.
9.      Variable Costs:  Variable costs, which are also based on ERL's
experience, have been adjusted to the expected 1.5 million tpy crude
throughput level beginning FY87 when the refinery is expected to be in
operation at design norm.
Finance Charges on GOB Loans
10.     ERL has received various loans from the Government for capital
expenditures. Interests on these loans are determined by the Government at
the time of each disbursement. These loans have been assumed to carry an
average interest rate of 12% p.a., chargeable to revenues beginning FY84.
The loans are assumed to be repayable over 8 years in equal installments
beginning FY84.
Taxes
11.     The corporate tax rate is 50%.  In addition, ERL is required to
contribute 2.5% of its income after taxes to a Workers' Profit
Participation Fund. These have been reflected in the projections.

V. Working Capital
12.     As a processing refinery with no need for crude or refined product
inventories, ERL's working capital requirements are substantially less than
they would be if it were a fully-integrated refinery. ERL's recent histor-
ical current assets and current liabilities levels have been conditioned
more by the demands of the current state of the facilities than the operat-
ing cash requirements of a normal processing refinery. With rehabilita-
tion, working capital requirements are expected to reflect normal
operations. Working capital requirements after rehabilitation have been
estimated on this basis. Current assets and current liabilities during the
implementation period have also been adjusted accordingly via the cash flow
statements; excess current assets not required in normal operations have
been converted into surplus cash.

BANGLADESH - ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REFINE.RY REHABILITATION PROJECT
REFINERY REHABILITATION COMPONENT
FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS
Assumptions Used in the Analysis
1.      Given the nature of the component, the financial rate of return
analysis was carried out on an incremental basis. While ERL is expected to
add to fixed assets in operation as and when these are repaired/replaced
under the Project, the analysis has been carried out assuming that the
assets, except the gas-using facilities are brought into operation only
after the entire rehabilitation is completed. This approach was used to
minimize complications in identifying benefits associated with specific
facilities brought into operation in different time periods during the
implementation.  Costs and benefits used for the analysis have been
expressed in constant 1982 Takas at an exchange rate of Taka 23.0 to
US$1.00. Data and assumptions used for the analysis are presented below;
financial cost and benefit streams and the results of the analysis are
shown in Annex 7-3.
Capital Expenditures
2.      The capital cost used for the financial rate of return analysis was
derived from the base capital cost in 1982 prices plus the physical
contingency, less the base capital cost and associated physical contingency
of the Debottlenecking and Secondary Conversion Techno-Economic Study whose
benefits would be associated with a future modification project.

Incremental Financial Processing Costs
3.      Fixed Costs:  Incremental annual fixed processing costs in 1982
prices have been derived on the basis of the assumptions stated in
para 8 of Annex 7-1 and are shown below:
(In millions of Takas 1982 prices)
Repairs and Maintenance (2.5% of Capital
Expenditures)                                           11.6
Insurance (1% of Capital Expenditures)                     4.7

Incremental Financial Benefits
5.      Incremental financial benefits attributable to the component
consist of two elements: (a) bonus to be derived from displacement of
36,000 tons of petroleum process fuel by the use of natural gas; and (b)
incremental processing fee from BPC.  The bonus was calculated on the basis
of the energy savings formula between ERL and BPC (25% of the value of the
savings) based on the export value of the fuel oil saved.  The bonus is
assumed to be earned beginning January, 1985 when ERL is expected to begin
to use natural gas. The incremental processing fee was also derived on the
basis of the processing fee formula, that is, reimbursement of the incre-
mental processing cost (see paras 4.04 of text) plus interest charges on

the IDA funds to be on-lent to ERL. The latter (see Table 2 of Annex 7-1,
Sources and Application of Funds) were deflated to 1982 prices by factors
derived from the projected inflation used for the financial projections.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Assumptions and Details of Calculations
I. Refinery Rehabiliation Component
1.      The economic analysis was also carried out on incremental basis.
The same capital cost were used as in the case of the financial rate of
return analysis; however the disbursement profile was adjusted to calendar
year basis. A similar economic life (10 years) and production schedule
were also assumed in the economic analysis as in the case of the financial
rate of return analysis.
A. Incremental Crude Costs
2.      As shown in the production schedule presented in Annex 7-1 (para
6), about 230,800 metric tons per year of incremental crude will be
required after rehabilitation. The cost of this crude has been estimated
on the basis of the landed cost (Chittagong) of crude oil, including
freight, insurance and handling. The FOB price of crude was based on the
current OPEC price of US$29 per barrel (Middle East) which is assumed to
remain constant to 1985; freight, insurance and handling per barrel is
based on Bangladesh's experience of US$0.70/barrel. The derived CIF
(Chittagong) price/barrel of US$29.70 is assumed to increase by 3.3% p.a.
in real terms from 1986 to 1990 and by 4.2% p.a. to 1995 in line with
recent Bank assessment of petroleum price increases. The annual
incremental crude cost after rehabilitation estimated on this basis is
shown below:

B. Incremental Processing Costs
3.      Incremental fixed costs, without depreciation, were derived on the
same basis as the fixed costs used for the financial rate of return analy-
sis. Variable costs of stores and chemicals and other consumables were
also based on the incremental costs used in the financial rate of return
analysis. Process fuel costs were however based on the FOB value of fuel
oil for the marginal increment (100 tons) in petroleum fuel required for
process operations; for the 36,000 toe of natural gas to be used annually
to displace petroleum fuel for processing, its opportunity value equivalent
was used. The recent IDA-ADB energy assessment report estimated the
opportunity value of natural gas in Bangladesh to be in the range of
US$0.70/MSCF or US$30.50/metric toe in 1982 prices and US$1.35/MSCF or
US$58.82 per metric toe. The lower end of the opportunity value range
represents the "high" cost gas from newly discovered and developed fields
as the replacement fuel to the existing low-cost gas when the presently
known reserves of natural gas are expected to be completely committed by
year 2000; the high end of the opportunity value range represents the cost
of imported coal as replacement fuel when all the natural gas runs out.
The low end of the opportunity value was assumed to represent the cost of
the natural gas to be used to displace the 36,000 tons of fuel oil. This
assumption is considered reasonable in view of the fact that (i) Bangladesh
has very large gas reserves relative to domestic demand for at least the
next couple of decades, and (ii) the prospects for exports of massive
quantities of gas over the next several years either overland to India or
in other forms to other countries are modest. The process fuel costs
derived on these bases are assumed to increase at 3.3% in real terms from
1986 to 1990 and at 4.2% to 1995. The incremental economic processing
costs in 1986, the first year of design norm production after
rehabilitation, estimated on this basis are shown below:

beginning January 1985.
