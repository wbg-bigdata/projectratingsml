APPRAISAL OF
LIVESTOCK IV (CATTLE) PROJECT
ROMANIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania has requested
assistance from the Bank in financing a portion of its 5-year (1981-1985)
National Development Program for milk and beef production.  This project was
conceived on the basis of a Cattle and Sheep Subsector Survey, the field
work for which took place in May-June 1979. Bank missions, including dairy
engineering and animal nutrition specialists, assisted and reviewed Romanian
design and preparation efforts in September and November/December 1979. The
project was appraised in May 1980 by a mission consisting of Messrs. R. Hunt
and F. Wright (Bank) and Messrs. P. Harrison, W. Murphy and M. Walshe
(Consultants).
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN ROMANIA
A. Role and Land Endowment
2.01     Agriculture continues to be a key sector in the Romanian economy,
providing almost all of the nation's food, the raw materials required for
agricultural processing industries and significant foreign exchange earn-
ings. In 1978 agriculture accounted for 14% of GDP, 33% of the labor force
and 14% of export earnings. The proportion of the total labor force
employed in agriculture declined from 74% in 1950 to 33% in 1978, thereby
releasing a large number of people for employment elsewhere in the rapidly
growing Romanian economy. National income increased at an average rate of
about 9% from 1951 to 1978. During this period national income in agricul-
ture grew at a rate of 3.5% per annum. Agriculture's share of national
income declined from 28% in 1950 to 15% in 1978.
2.02     About 14.9 million ha, or 63% of Romania's land area, are used for
agriculture. Of the agricultural area about 66% is cultivated, 29% is
grassland and 5% under vineyards and orchards. There are three principal
agro-climatic zones; the Plains (Zone I), the Foothills (Zone II) and the
Mountain and Tableland (Zone III). The Plains Zone is the richest agricul-
tural area, including all of the land in the Danube plains, and contains 52%
of Romania's arable land and most of the irrigated land. Major crops are
cereals, sunflower, sugar beet, soybeans, potatoes, vegetables, fodder
crops, grapes and fruit. The Foothills zone is less productive. It con-
tains about 28% of the arable and 32% of the pasture and meadow land. The
Mountain and Tableland covers the mountain and northern areas and accounts



-2-
for 19% of the arable land and 50% of the grasslands. In 1979 crop produc-
tion accounted for 56% of total agricultural output. Livestock production
accounted for 44 percent. In that year the livestock population in Romania
included some 6 million cattle, 10 million pigs, 16 million sheep and 100
million poultry.
B. Sector Organization
2.03     Romanian agriculture has undergone a major transformation following
the collectivization measures introduced since the Second World War. Cur-
rently, there are five types of production entities: (a) State units,
including State agricultural enterprises (UASs); (b) Cooperative complexes
(CAPs); (c) intercooperative associations (ICAs); (d) small individual plots
used by CAP members; and (e) individually owned private farms. The State
owns 30% of,all agricultural land, CAPs 54%, CAP members 6% and Individual
Farmers 10%. Agricultural production, especially crop production, is
dominated by the state agricultural enterprises (UASs) and agricultural
production cooperatives (CAPs). In 1978, 87% of cereal production was in
the socialist sector. Production by individual farmers and from small
private plots of cooperative members is important in several areas, espe-
cially fruit and livestock. Agricultural mechanization stations (SMAs) play
a major role in providing machinery hire services. Recently a number of
Inter-Cooperative Associations (ICAs) have been formed through combining the
activities of a number of individual cooperatives. These ICAs are engaged
in various large-scale agricultural operations such as cattle, pig and
poultry production.
2.04     In 1978 Romania had 396 IASs with an average size of 5,100 ha and a
labor force of 660 people each. They farmed 2.0 million ha, equivalent to
14% of all agricultural land. In the same year, there were 4,400 CAPs, with
an average size of 2,060 ha and 550 members. The total area of land under
CAPs was 9.1 million ha, equivalent to 61% of all agricultural land. Each
working member of a CAP is allocated a small plot (normally 0.15 ha) which
he can use for production of crops. Members are also allowed to keep
limited numbers of livestock on CAP land. About 10% of the land controlled
by CAPs was used for individual members' plots. Individual farmers number
about 470,000. Most of their farms are in the more mountainous regions.
They own only 4% of the nation's arable land, but 19% of the grasslands.
2.05     At the national level, the major State institution in the agricul-
tural sector is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI).  MAFI
plays a major role in preparing the Five-Year Plan for the sector and is the
supervisory institution for plan implementation. In each district the
Ministry is represented by a general directorate, which is responsible for
all agricultural activity in the district including both IASs and CAPs.
Marketing is organized nationally under MAFI, with general economic direc-
torates responsible for processing and marketing specified commodities.
Foreign trade companies are responsible for the exports of the general
economic directorates.



C. Performance in the Agricultural Sector
2.06      Although considerable progress has been made in developing agricul-
ture, the sector remains relatively undeveloped. Between 19' -nd 1978
gross agricultural output increased at an average rate of 4.5%. During this
period the area of arable land has remained about the same but crop yields
have increased markedly. For example, the average yield of wheat increased
from 1.1 tons per ha in 1951-1955 to 2.8 tons per ha in 1976-1978, while
maize yields increased from 1.3 tons per ha to 3.2 tons per ha over the same
period. Livestock yields have also increased and there have been signif-
icant increases in the numbers of all types of livestock. Milk yields, for
instance, increased from 867 liters per cow in 1950 to 1,968 liters per cow
in 1978. Nevertheless, crop and livestock yields in Romania are still
appreciably lower than those obtained in a number of othier European coun-
tries. While agricultural production has been increasing, the labor force
in agriculture has been falling. Labor productivity has thus increased much
faster than agricultural output. In 1978 gross agricultural output per
worker was more than six times the level of 1950. Despite this substantial
improvement, the absolute level of labor productivity is still relatively
low. Labor intensive methods of production, such as hand harvesting of
maize and the use of animal-drawn carts, are still common, especially on
cooperatives and in the individual farm sector.
D. Sector Issues and Development Strategy
2.07      The growth of Romanian agriculture has been constrained by several
factors, especially uncertain rainfall, lack of machinery and farm inputs
and problems concerned with organization and incentives. Rainfall in
Romania is both low and erratic, especially in the main cropping areas in
the Plains Zone. Flooding has also been serious in many low lying areas.
Fortunately the soils in the Plains Zone are good while there are excellent
sources of water in the Danube and its tributaries. Romania has therefore
given high priority to development of irrigation and drainage. The total
area under irrigation has increased from 200,000 ha in 1960 to 2.2 million
ha in 1979. Government plans to increase this to 3.4 million ha by 1985.
By then about 38% of arable land would be irrigated. However, inadequate
speciaiization of cropping patterns on irrigated land is likely to constrain
the potential output from these areas.
2.08      Serious shortages of machinery and farm inputs, especially fertil-
izers, insecticides and herbicides have been experienced. These shortages
have been aggravated by Romania's foreign exchange policies, for Government
has sometimes exported fertilizers or restricted imports of other inputs
needed by the agricultural sector. The fertilizer deficit is expected to be
substantially resolved during the 1981-85 Plan period but other deficits are
likely to persist.



-4-
2.09     Hitherto, Government policy has given much greater emphasis to
development of IASs rather than CAPs. IAS have been provided with the best
managers and have received much higher levels of investment and supplies of
tractors, machinery and fertilizers, while CAPs have been neglected. In
1978 the level of investment per ha of IASs was more than five times that of
CAPs and they were therefore more productive than CAPs. This neglect of
CAPs has been one of the key weaknesses of Romania agriculture, for CAPs
control more than 60% of all agricultural land. In 1978 Government decided
to accord equal treatment to IASs and CAPs. This new policy is to be imple-
mented through the creation of Unified Agro-industrial Councils (UACs) which
are responsible for providing equal levels of service and material inputs to
IASs and CAPs. About 700 UACs have been established, and for each one there
is an SMA. Each UAC will be responsible for coordinating all agricultural
activities undertaken by the IASs and CAPs for which it is responsible. On
average each UAC will be responsible for about 20,000 ha of land.
2.10     Agricultural policy is formulated within the framework of a
national plan approved by Government and the Romanian Communist Party. For
the 1981-85 plan, the guidelines forecast that national income will increase
between 6.7 and 7.4% p.a., gross industrial production will increase in the
range 8.0 to 9.0% p.a. and gross agricultural production at 4.5 to 5.0%
p.a. Investment in agriculture in this period will amount to 155 billion
Lei (US$8.6 billion), equivalent to 12% of total national investment for the
plan period. The main thrust of agricultural development strategy will be
to increase crop and livestock yields through improved organization, the use
of more efficient techniques, especially greater mechanization, increased
use of fertilizers and other inputs, and further large investments in irri-
gation.
E. Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry
2.11     The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) is the Govern-
ment's specialized agency for financing projects in agriculture, irrigation
and food processing. As such, BAFI has been the Borrower for all Bank loans
in support of agriculture and would be the Borrower for the proposed loan.
BAFI was established in 1968 as a channel for, and administrator of, all
investment funds provided under the State plan for the agricultural sector.
It lends to both IASs and CAPs and repays the Government as it receives re-
payments of subloans. BAFI is involved in all phases of project appraisal,
execution and supervision, and it has a large technical and economic staff
located in Bucharest, in 39 district (judet) branch offices and in 92 sub-
branches throughout the country. BAFI has thorough review and approval
procedures for all investment projects. In addition to BAFI's review, all
agricultural investments for more than Lei 10,000,000 (US$560,000) are
reviewed and approved by MAFI and those greater than Lei 70,000,000 (US$3.9
million) must be approved by the Council of Ministers. BAFI also provides
short-term credit to, and maintains settlement accounts for, all cooperative
and State agricultural enterprises; and acts as fiscal agent for the)



- 5 -
Government for collection of State revenues from these enterprises. As the
Government's channel for investment financing in agriculture, BAFI's primary
source of funds is the State budget.
F. BAFI Lending through Credit Cooperatives
2.12     BAFI and the Central Commission of Credit Cooperatives maintain a
protocol by which BAFI lending to individual producers is channelled through
the CRC system. BAFI pays to the CRC a commission of 0.41% of the total
value of loans processed on its behalf. BAFI provides both short-term and
long-term investment loans to individuals through the CRCs. In order to
receive loans from BAFI, the individual must contract with a socialist
enterprise (or indirectly through a Consumer Cooperative Acquisition Center)
for 100% of the value of the BAFI loan. The CRCs represent a considerably
more important source of long- and short-term funds for the individual
producers than BAFI. Total CRC lending has grown at an average of about 18%
annually for the past 10 years from 641 million Lei (US$35.6 million) in
1970. Its structure remained fairly stable, about 87% being short-term
loans and the balance long-term investment loans. The structure of BAFI
lending remained relatively constant with about 97% being short-term loans
and the balance long-term loans. The decline in BAFI lending is attributed
to the fact that in recent years the CRCs have made special efforts to
expand their lending operations especially for livestock production activi-
ties, and that the CRCs put much less restrictive contracting conditions on
their lending. In order to receive BAFI loans the individual must contract
to market through a socialist enterprise all of the products obtained as a
result of use of the loans, while the contract marketing conditions on CRC
lending are limited to products representing 20% of the value of the loan
granted for loans up to 10,000 Lei and 25% for loans exceeding 10,000 Lei.
Although the CRC loan terms are more stringent than those of BAFI (3 years
at 7% versus 5 years at 3%) the less restrictive marketing conditions
together with the significantly higher free market price during certain
seasons offset this difference in terms.
G. Bank Contributions in the Agricultural Sector
2.13     The Bank's lending strategy is based on the findings of various
reports, including the Agricultural Sector Survey of October 1976 (No.
953a-RO), the Basic Economic Report of March 1978 (No. 1601-RO) and a number
of recent appraisal reports. The main objectives of Bank lending remain to
assist the Government in addressing the problems of production instability
and low productivity. In addition, in appropriate cases, foreign exchange
earnings or savings are an objective. Attainment of these objectives will
help to raise the level and quality of domestic food consumption.



-6-
2.14     With increasing experience in the agricultural sector and a greatly
improved relationship with the Romanian authorities, the Bank has been able
to make other significant contributions. Technical improvements in project
concept and design have been attained in a number of fields, including irri-
gation, poultry and pig production and horticulture.   Additionally, BAFI
has decided to introduce the Bank methodology in its economic evaluation of
subprojects. The Bank has made 12 loans for agriculture totalling US$741.5
million since 1975. The Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project, the first
agricultural project financed by the Bank in Romania, has been successfully
completed and a completion report on this project has been sent to OED.
No reports of the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department have yet been
prepared on agricultural projects in Romania.
III. THE CATTLE SUBSECTOR
A. Structure
3.01     Romania's climate and resource base are well suited to cattle and
sheep and there is a long history of animal husbandry in the country. The
share of livestock to total agricultural production has gradually grown from
35% in 1960 to 44% in 1978, and is planned to approach 50% during the
1981-85 National Development Plan period. This increased emphasis is due to
(a) the government's desire to improve the quality and quantity of per
capita consumption of meat and (b) to increase foreign exchange earnings of
beef, lamb and pork.
3.02     Pigs and poultry have traditionally been the most important live-
stock commodities. However beef and milk, which currently account for about
35% of total livestock output, would have the fastest growth over the next
five years. Milk production is planned to increase from 21% of total live-
stock production to 28%, and beef from 12 to 18%.
3.03     There are about 6.3 million cattle in Romania.  About 43% are owned
by Individual Farmers and CAP Members, 43% by CAPs and 14% by the State.
Both beef cattle and dairy cows are fairly evenly distributed among the
three climatic zones, with no reflection of the uneven distribution of
arable land, pastures and meadows. However stocking rates are highest in
the foothills and mountain zones where Individual and CAP Member ownership
is concentrated. Beef and milk production follows ownership patterns,
although output from CAP Members and Individuals is higher (milk 53% and
beef 47%) due to higher productivity.
B. Performance
3.04     Past growth rates for both cattle and sheep, in numbers and produc-
tion, are very acceptable for a mature industry such as Romania's. But



- 7 -
productivity is low when compared to countries in Europe and North America
with similar industries. Average milk yields were 1,951 liters per cow in
1977, 40% below the average level of European countries and New Zealand.
Beef production is similar, with annual herd offtake rates and carcass
yields 40% and 20% respectively below the same standard by a Ti  margin.
The core problem lies in the quality of inputs and implementation. Animal
health is virtually the sole satisfactory aspect of production. Compared to
other technical services, veterinarians are well trained. But this has
caused undue concentration on health and resulted in control of the industry
by veterinarians rather than production specialists. Other technical
specialities and research staff suffer from poor training, international
isolation and inadequate incentives. Forage quality, all important to
economically efficient ruminant animal production, is very poor and there is
a gross deficiency of protein feed. This quality factor is a serious direct
loss to the economy as too much expensive concentrate energy feed is used
instead of forages while the concentrates, mainly maize grain, could other-
wise be exported. It is also a serious indirect loss as inadequate animal
nutrution depresses productivity, thus losing potential production. The
animal gene pool is satisfactory with a potential for far better per-
formance. The Romanians are aware of the need for improved technology,
particularly in the area of cow housing and milking. The input deficiencies
can be remedied, although it will take time to turn the industry around. In
view of these considerations future livestock production is likely to
continue to grow at much the same rate as in the recent past at least
through 1985.
3.05     At present the feed base, particularly in the Social Sector,
depends heavily on crop production. Crop yields are comparatively poor,
particularly in view of the high quality of the resource base. This is
largely the result of inadequate inputs, notably fertilizer and machinery.
The fertilizer deficiency may be overcome by 1985 but machinery inputs will
remain a problem.
3.06     The grassland base, divided into pasture which is too steep to
harvest (68%) and meadows which can be cut for hay (32%) totalling 4.4
million ha, is a major factor in the future of Romania's cattle and sheep
industry. Future plans call for a very large expansion in production by the
private sector most of whose animals are located in the grassland areas of
Zones II and III. At present only 40% of the area receives any fertilizer
but this is planned to increase to 80% in 1985. MAFI, through the activi-
ties of its Pasture Enterprises, is now actively engaged in pasture improve-
ment schemes involving clearing, reseeding, fencing and access road
construction. Such improvement will expand the carrying capacity of the
pasture, which has a potential for a 50% increase. To realize this poten-
tial, pasture management and utilization will have to improve greatly. As
there is little indigenous modern pasture management, exposure to systems in
other countries is essential.



C. Market Outlook
3.07     Due to presently constrained supplies, there is considerable poten-
tial for increased domestic consumption of beef, sheep meat and milk. Ex-
port market prospects for beef and sheep meat are also good, while milk
product exports are expected to continue to decline in view of the need to
satisfy domestic demand. If 1985 beef production targets were achieved,
there might be occasional difficulty in disposal due to cyclical fluctua-
tions in the export market. Similarly, if milk targets were attained
exports might need to be expanded again. However, since the Plan targets
are considered unrealistically ambitious no market constraints are foreseen.
D. Organizational Constraints
3.08     The Romanian agricultural development objectives and strategies as
they apply to the cattle and sheep industry are ambitious but appropriate.
However, the detailed economic planning and implementation strategies need
revision. Planning is too centralized and too often based on unrealistic
technical coefficients and standardized designs which are. incorporated in
the detailed plans. As a result managers frequently have little or no lati-
tude within which to manage. The "cost plus" pricing system, which is also
centrally managed, compounds these problems by its frequent, although un-
intended, inconsistency with the implementation of physical plans and
leading to inefficient use of inputs. The New Economic Policies introduced
in 1978 are designed to provide some greater latitude to individual enter-
prises, but will not substantially affect the planning system.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Concept and Objectives
4.01     The proposed project is designed to contribute to expanding produc-
tion of beef and milk, in both the Social and Individual Sectors, to
increase domestic consumption and generate additional foreign exchange earn-
ings. It would introduce modern commercial production technology to the
cattle sector. In view of shortfall in domestic supply of beef and milk,
the foreign exchange earning potential and the generally low productivity in
Romanian milk and beef production, these objectives are afforded high
priority by the Government. They will be achieved through increased invest-
ments incorporating the new technology and through the creation of new
institutions to serve the sector. The principal innovations would include
improved design of cow housing, introduction of herringbone milking parlors
into all dairy subprojects, improve forage quality and the augmentation and
strengthening of four major support services: (a) animal production and



-9-
grassland research, (b) milking machine testing and maintenance services,
(c) forage and concentrate feed analysis laboraitfries, and (d) animal nutri-
tion advisory service. Investment in grassland improvement will serve to
expand an important source of low cost feed. The project would also encour-
age specialization of beef and dairy production in the zones less well
suited to ''ivation and would concentrate investment in the CAPs which
have considerable potential for increased productivity.
B. Project Content
4.02     The project will consist of selected investments over a 3-year
period (mid-1981 to mid-1984) of the Romanian 1981-85 National Development
Program for milk and beef production. The investments comprise milk and
beef processing and storage, grassland improvement and technical services
and research. The project will comprise about 60% of the total planned
investment over the three-year period. Specific investments are as-follows:
(i) 92 new dairy farms, each of 922 cows and followers with an annual
average output at full development of 36.9 thousand hl of milk, 222
heifers for breeding or fattening, 407 calves for fattening and 184
cull cows for slaughter;
(ii) 32 modernized dairy farms, expanding from 520 cows and followers to
680 cows and followers, each with an incremental annual average
output at full development of 14.2 thousand hl of milk, 8 heifers
for breeding or fattening, 71 calves for fattening and 63 cull cows
for slaughter;
(iii)  17 new specialized breeding heifer production farms, each with an
annual average output at full development of 1,236 pregnant heifers
and 336 cull heifers for slaughter;
(iv) 19 new beef fattening units, with 7,700 head capacity each with an
annual average gross output at full development of 2.3 thousand
tons of beef l.w.;
(v) 109 improved pasture units, each averaging 1,000 ha, with an in-
cremental annual average output of 300 tons of beef l.w.;
(vi) support to Individual Producers and CAP Members for on-farm
production of cattle and sheep milk, meat, cheese and breeding
stock;
(vii) milk and beef processing and storage facilities; including dairies,
slaughter houses and cold stores; and
(viii)  technical services and research for feed analysis, animal nutri-
tion, milk machine testing and maintenance, animal husbandry and
pasture improvement.

4.03     Large-scale on-farm milk production investments would be undertaken
by both IASs and CAPs and .ocated both in hills and plains areas to make use
of available forage. The major innovation of the project will be to provide
a high quality, low cost feed mix as a substitute for the expensive
concentrate-based system currently in use. In the hills area this would be
mainly grass fed as green chop, hay or silage while in the plains area this
would be maize, alfalfa and rye grass fed as green chop, bay (alfalfa only)
or silage (maize only). In both areas grain and sugar beet crop by-products
would be used as well as some concentrate feed (maize grain and soybean and
sunflower seed meal) and root crops (mainly fodder beet). A minimum cost
feed base is assured through the maximum use of by-products and technical
crops, required in the rotation by good farming practice, thus having no
economic opportunity cost. This, together with improved forage quality,
ensures minimum use of high cost concentrate feeds and those having a high
opportunity cost (maize green chop or silage). Exclusive use of loose stall
housing and herringbone milking parlours, laid out to avoid bottlenecks in
the flow of operations, will minimize labor needed for both milking and
feeding, improve control of the animals and reduce the incidence of
mastitis. Provision is made under the project for 4 forage and feed
analysis laboratories linked to the farms by a specialized nutrition
advisory service. These units will help ensure full knowledge and correct
usage of the available feeds and forages. A milking machine maintenance and
testing service to be established under the project would assist in ensuring
mechanical performance of both the project machines and others. Applied
research is designed to develop country-specific data on the nutritional
aspects of Romanian produced feeds as well as on milking systems performance
and pasture utilization. Only on-farm subprojects incorporating the modern
technology and utilizing the supporting technical services would be included
in the project. Assurances to this end were obtained during negotiations.
4.04     Beef fattening and breeding heifer production to be undertaken in
the project by IASs and CAPs would be mainly in the hills area to maximize
use of the lower cost grass forage. To encourage specialization of produc-
tion in areas of least alternative use, grassland improvement in the project
would be confined exclusively to the hills area, defined as between 400 and
800 meters in elevation. This ensures that there will be no opportunity
cost to utilizing these areas as grassland. Also no irrigation of grassland
would be financed from Bank funds. Assurances of these were obtained during
negotiations. Improved grassland would be utilized as grass and hay, partly
by IASs and CAPs but mainly by CAP Members and Individual Producers. For
the latter, it would be administered by Popular Councils (local district
general administrative bodies) and would be mainly for beef production
although some manufacturing milk may also be produced.
4.05     A line of credit would be extended by BAFI, or its agent the Credit
Cooperative, to Individual Producers and CAP Members to support expanded
production of cattle and sheep meat, milk, cheese and breeding stock.
Funds would be used for the purchase of animals, feed, building materials
and equipment such as storage tanks, coolers and small milking machines.



- 11 -
4.06     Agroindustries investment would be in the form of a line of credit
to finance necessary expansion, through construction of new, and moderni-
zation of existing, milk and meat processing and storage facilities.
4.07     About 80% of the proposed dairy investment would be directed to
CAPs, with 20% for IASs, primarily in the Plains zone. In E -1 fattening
CAPs would receive 44% of project investment, IASs about 56%. About 90% of
the grassland improvement program would be for the benefit of CAP Members
and Individual Farmers.
4.08     Subloans would be made by BAFI to IASs and CAPs for on-farm invest-
ment in milk, heifers and beef production and pasture improvement and to
Milk and Meat Enterprises for processing and storage facilities. Subloans
would be made by BAFI to MAFI for grant financing by MAFI of investment in
Popular Council administered pasture improvement schemes. Similarly funds
would be made available by BAFI to MAFI for financing of technical services
and research all of which would be under MAFI control.
C. Project Costs
4.09     Total project cost is estimated at Lei 6.6 billion (about US$367
million) including an estimated foreign exchange cost of Lei 2.5 billion
(US$138 million) or 38%. These estimates, detailed by component below,
include taxes and duties on items expected to be directly imported under the
project. Incremental working capital comprises the operating costs not
covered by revenues in the initial years of the project. These are detailed
in the individual model cost tables in Annex 1 of the Project Implementation
File.
4.10     Cost estimates are based on prices prevailing in 1980.  They
include a physical contingency averaging about 4%. Price contingency allow-
ances are as set out below in the total project cost table and total about
14% of the base cost. This includes price contingencies on both physical
contingencies and incremental working capital. The exchange rate used to
estimate the costs is the Romanian officially determined trading rate of Lei
15 per US$1, which is scheduled to come into force on January 1, 1981.

4.12     A Bank loan of US$80 million and a loan of a presently unknown
amount from as yet unidentified cofinanciers would be made to BAFI. 1/  The
Bank loan would cover 19% of the total project cost or 58% of the foreign
exchange cost. Subborrowers' contributions amount to 27% of total project
cost. The remaining 54% would be financed by the Government (MAFI/BAFI)
together with cofinanciers. In accordance with the most recent regulations
IASs and other State enterprises (e.g. Milk and Meat Enterprises) would now
contribute on average 30% of their subproject investment costs from their
retained earnings. CAPs would continue as in the past to contribute 30% of
their subproject investment costs. Pasture improvements administered by
Popular Councils would be financed entirely from Bank, Government and
cofinancier funds.
4.13     The Bank loan would be for 15 years including 3 years grace.  Co-
financing terms are as yet undetermined, but undoubtedly will be more strin-
gent than those of the Bank.
1/ Cofinancing is not expected to be a problem as, starting with the Live-
stock II (Pigs) Project 1669-RO (1978), all Bank agricultural projects
in Romania have involved commercial cofinancing.

V. DEMAND AND MARKET OUTLOOK
5.01     Since the project comprises approximately 60% of the planned
investment in cattle development for only the first three of the five years
of the Romanian 1981-1985 Five-Year National Development Program, project
production would be readily absorbed by the marketing system if there are
satisfactory markets for the expected total 1985 production of milk and
beef. This chapter reviews the overall 1985 milk and beef markets for
Romania, drawing heavily on recent Bank sector work in Romania. The project
contribution to future production is summarized in Table 5.1 below.

Milk and Milk Products
5.02     More than 95% of the milk produced under the project would be sold
to the Milk Central, the remainder would be retained on the farms for feed-
ing to calves, or consumed by workers. The Milk Central would then process
the milk through its 39 Judet-based enterprises into a range of milk
products. These products will most probably be consumed entirely domesti-
cally. In the past Romania has been a minor exporter of butter and cheese,
but recently butter exports have declined rapidly in favor of domestic con-
sumption. Although continued exports of both are included in the Plan
through 1985, Bank projections of likely 1985 milk production (as opposed to
Romanian planned production) indicate that neither would be available for
export, if domestic demand were to be met. Consumption of milk in Romania,
as seen in Table 5.2 has been low compared to most other European countries.
5.03     Over the past 9 years, total Romanian cows milk production has
grown at 5.0% p.a.; total personal consumption at 5.7% p.a.; and Milk
Central purchases at 5.8% p.a. Growth in product sales by the Milk Central
have been at over 10% p.a. for fresh products (cream, soft cheeses and
yoghurts), but at a much lower rate for cheese and liquid milk, and during
the period of tight supply existing in the last two years, butter and dried
milk product sales have fallen.



- 15 -
5.04     Despite the increase in sales over recent years, the demand for
milk products is still unsatisfied. There are often long queues for milk
products; shops frequently sell out of fresh milk early in the day; and
peasant market prices for cheeses and cream are well above the social sector
controlled prices..  The excess demand seems to be greatest for fresh pro-
ducts and liquid milk. Over the country as a whole, the MiD`- central esti-
mates that the total milk products market is 15-30% undersupplied at present.

/2  Official figure, plus adjustment for butter.
/3  Plan figure - Mission's estimate is about 237 kg including butter.
5.05     While it is likely Romania would run into demand problems if it
were to achieve 1985 planned milk production (8.1-8.8% annual growth giving
85-88.7 million hl), under more realistic assumptions of supply development
(5.1% annual growth giving 71.9 million hl) it is projected that Romania
would continue to be in a milk deficit situation through 1985. The position
from 1986 onwards would depend on the level of post project investments.
The present excess demand for milk may be in part due to the relatively low
farmgate and retail prices of milk established by the Government (Lei 1.8
per liter and Lei 3.05 per liter respectively). While a market determined
price could be expected to be higher and thus reduce demand, market forces
do not operate under the Romanian economic system. In any event relative
prices are unlikely to change in the rigidly controlled Romanian economic
system.
5.06     The Bank's estimate of supplies available for human consumption by
1985 are 218 kg/capita, excluding butter compared to 1978 consumption of



- 16 -
160 kg. This is slightly below estimated demand of 223 kg/capita. Conse-
quently, provided no exports take place, Romania will likely be approxi-
mately in supply/demand equilibrium for milk and milk products by 1985.
Should planned butter and cheese exports occur there would would be unful-
filled domestic demand. This would also arise if as is quite possible,
output grows at a slower pace than that projected by the Bank. In any case
it is unlikely that the project milk output will face any market demand
problems.
Beef
5.07     Project beef production would all be sold to the Meat Central, and
processed into carcasses or canned products. It is likely that about 70% of
the production of young beef from the beef units would be exported, as
frozen carcass meat, and the remainder of the young beef and the culls con-
sumed domestically, either as fresh meat or in processed form.
5.08     Domestic Consumption.  Over the period 1970 to 1978 total Romanian
meat consumption has grown by 75% and per capita consumption by 65%.
Romanian per capita consumption figures for 1978 are given in Table 5.3,
together with those of selected other European countries. Despite the
recent increases Romanian per capita consumption both of beef and of total
meat is low by European standards.

5.09     The allocation for consumption between beef, sheep meat, chicken
and pig meat is made by government planning agencies who also consider the
export market possibilities for the different meats prior to deciding which



- 17 -
meats should be made available to consumers. Under the conditions of
general meat shortage which have prevailed in Romania to date, the public
has been ready to purchase whichever meats are made available for domestic
consumption. Officials within the Ministry for Internal Trade (MFIT) feel
that, if supplies were made available at present prices, per capita
consumptir- if meat in 1978 would have been about 70 kg rather than the
actual figure of 53 kg. Clear evidence of excess domestic demand is partic-
ularly manifested with pig meat for which prices on the "free market" aver-
age 55% higher than official prices. Beef is only available through the
official market outlets, and thus no free market price is available. The
lack of availability in many shops confirms the shortage.
5.10     Within its directives, leading to the next Five-Year Plan (1981-
1985), the Government indicates that it will aim to release 67 to 72 kg per
capita of meat and meat products on to the market by 1985. This compares
with Bank estimated potential demand for 1985 of 85 kg/capita at present
real prices. Compared to 12.5 kg in 1978, planned 1985 consumption of beef
at 16-18 kg/capita (about 25% of total meat consumption) is propor-
tionately fairly low compared with many other countries, thus, as there is
likely to be excess demand for total meat, this level of beef would readily
be absorbed on the domestic market.
5.11     Romania has been a consistent net exporter of beef over the last
decade.  It has sold live animals, carcass meat, deboned meat and processed
products to a wide range of countries, mainly in Europe, the Middle East and
North Africa.
5.12     Live cattle exports have shown no discernable trend, with quanti-
ties varying between 26,000 tons and 39,000 tons over the past decade;
canned beef exports have risen from 10,000 tons in 1976 to 15,000 tons in
1979; and between 1970 and 1979, carcass beef exports have increased from
22,000 tons to 94,000 tons. The market for Romanian carcass beef has become
increasingly broadly based, and in 1979, 10 different and diverse countries
imported over 2,000 tons each (USSR, Iran, Spain, Libya, Israel, Italy,
Algeria, West Germany, Lebanon, Jordan).
5.13     A recent FAO study 1/ estimates that, as a result of the increase
in demand and a shift in production, 1985 world trade is projected to
increase by 17-20% in volume over the 1972/74 level for beef and veal. A
large proportion of this would be in the Near East with a 7-fold increase
amounting to 355,000 tons.
5.14     Taking the FAO projections as a guideline, and using Romania 1972/
74 exports as a base, a reasonable judgement of the volume of the market
that Romania would be able to capture is 10-25% of the incremental demand
1/ Projections of Meat Production Demand and Trade to 1985 CCP: ME79/4,

Project Implementation File.



- 18 -
requirements of Other Western EuroEe and Near East countries and 5-10% of
the incremental requirements of Africa and the Far East. On this basis,
potential incremental exports over the 1972/74 levels would be between
60,000 and 140,000 tons p.a. giving an export accessibility for 1985 of
100,000-185,000 tons. To this can be added some probable increase in
exports to USSR and possibly Eastern Europe.
5.15     In the light of these factors, the 1985 draft plan figure of 152
thousand tons carcass meat exports is realistic from the market standpoint.
The market for live cattle exports, mainly to Libya and Lebanon, with minor
sales to Greece and Italy, might also be expected to grow, in parallel with
these countries imports. Consequently the planned 1985 figure of 30,000
tons of liveweight cattle, which is about equal to the 1975-1979 levels of
live cattle exports, appears conservative from the demand standpoint. A
detailed review of the probable supply situation for 1985 indicates that
insufficient beef is likely to be available to fulfill the Plan domestic
consumption and export targets. In this light, no overall marketing prob-
lems are envisaged in the disposal of beef produced under the project.
VI. TECHNOLOGY, RESEARCH AND PROCESSING
6.01     The principal objectives of the project will be to introduce
improved technology to the beef and dairy sector in Romania and to
strengthen the institutions responsible for technology development and
disseminations. The major innovations will occur in dairy farm housing and
milking animal nutrition and pasture development.
A. On-Farm Production Technology
6.02     Improved Design.  The principal technical deficiencies in Romania's
dairy and beef production are inefficient labor utilization, poor quality
(low nutritive value) forage and feeds and inadequate use of pasture land
resources. In physical design the dairy units under the proposed project
consist of loose stall housing, mechanized batch feeding, herringbone
(batch) milking parlors, all in a free-flow layout. 1/ The present system
consists of stanchion housing (cows permanently tied) with individual
in-line, bucket or hand milking. The physical design features incorporated
in the proposed project are the source of the improved labor utilization.
Project on-farm labor utilization will be improved from an existing average
level of about 10 cows/person to about 40 cows/person on new subprojects and
to about 30 cows/person on modernization subprojects. The Minister for
Agriculture has informed the Bank that it is intended to adopt this new
1/ Annex 1 contains a detailed description of this and other on-farm
investments.



- 19 -
technology for all future dairy subprojects. The introduction of the
efficient herringbone milking system will benefit the entire dairy industry
as its use is expanded, by reducing disease incidence (especially mastitis)
as well as by reducing labor requirements.
6.03     Forage.  The major problem causing low productivity in the beef
fattening system relates to animal nutrition. Overall forage quality is low
and present feeding practices call for excessive quantities of expensive
concentrates. To correct the low quality forage problem the project will
include: (i) four laboratories to provide an analytical and advisory ser-
vice on forage and feed quality to production units on a countrywide basis;
(ii) adequate on-farm storage facilities and mechanical forage and feed
mixing and feeding facilities; and (iii) a research component to fill the
gaps in the knowledge of the nutrient value of Romanian feeds. This is
expected to result in an increase in subproject milk output per cow from
about 2,000 to 3,000 liters at present to an average of about 4,000 liters.
The increased output would be achieved with no additional forage cost, and a
reduction of about 15% in expensive concentrate requirements. This pro-
jected yield compares with the present national average yield of about 2,000
liters which requires, on average, over 0.5 tons of concentrates. Depending
upon the extent and speed of uptake of new technology by non-project units,
the gains to the entire sector, including pigs, poultry and sheep, would be
substantial.
6.04     Pasture.  This is the first pasture improvement investment to be
financed by the Bank in Romania. It will benefit primarily Individual
Producers. Of the 109,000 ha included in the project, 95,000 ha would be
utilized by herds of CAP Members and Individual Producers. The component
will help make better use of the relatively under-developed pasture
resource. The actual work will be carried out by judet level Pasture Enter-
prises 1/, who are experienced contractors, under the direction of MAFI.
Improvements will involve clearing, draining, fencing, reseeding, fertiliza-
tion and provision of water. This will enable stocking rates to be greatly
increased.
B. Technical Services
6.05     A National Feed Analysis Service would be established as an autono-
mous service under the domain of MAFI, separate and independent from all
other research and analytical services. This is essential if it is to pro-
vide unbiased analysis and recommendations to its clients, the farm
managers. The Service would consist of 4 analytical laboratories: one
larger central laboratory located near Bucharest to serve the southern area
and 3 somewhat smaller ones located regionally to serve the western, north
1/ Annex 2 Appendix contains a detailed description of these organizations.



- 20 -
central and eastern areas. These would be equipped with high speed, auto-
mated multi-sample analysis equipment and staffed by specially trained
personnel. There would be capacity to serve other livestock industries
togetber with the cattle industry. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that such a service would be established. Details of the service,
including an implementation timetable, location of laboratories, equipment,
staffing and training would be submitted to the Bank for approval prior to
disbursement.
6.06     All IAS and CAP dairy and beef production units financed under the
project would be required to use this service for analysis of all feeds
utilized in the production process. A feeding plan for each would be drawn
up with the assistance of the Animal Nutrition Advisory Service. Adequate
subproject on farm records would be maintained to demonstrate the use and
impact of these project services. Assurances to this effect were obtained
during negotiations.
6.07     An Animal Nutrition Advisory Service is vital to provide the expert
link between the feed analysis laboratories and the farm production face.
The service, operating directly from the 4 regional laboratories would be
directed by MAFI. It would require approximately 65 specially trained
extension officers. About 25 would operate from the central laboratory with
the remainder divided among the 3 regional laboratories. They would be
university level graduates with at least one year's specialist training
under the guidance of the Animal Nutrition Research Institute at Balotesti.
Details of the training and tasks are given in Annex 2. Generally they
would sample feeds, interpret the results of the laboratory analysis for the
farm manager and devise nutritively balanced feeds for all categories of
animals utilizing all available feeds. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that this service would be established along the above lines.
6.08     The Milking Machine Testing and Maintenance Service existing under
MAFI would be strengthened under the project through specialist training,
overseas and domestically, and the provision of specialist testing and main-
tenance kits. Training abroad for about 3 months for each would be provided
for 2 dairy engineers and 2 dairy husbandry specialists, who in turn would
train local staff. The Directorate for Agricultural Mechanization in MAFI
would be responsible for the service, but would be expected to actively
involve the Romanian milking machine manufacturing concern IMAIA (Timis) and
the Dairy Research Unit at Corbeanca Cattle Breeding Research Institute,
particularly in initial training and refresher courses. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that this service would be established and that
the training abroad would be undertaken. A program and timetable for train-
ing and equipping this service would be submitted to the Bank for its
approval prior to disbursement.
C. Applied Research
6.09     The project would assist in strengthening the three weakest areas
of cattle production research in Romania: cattle nutrition, dairy husbandry



- 21 -
and pasture production and utilization. The programs, detailed in Annex 2,
are outlined below. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that this
applied research program would be carried out, that the Government would
provide the necessary land and financing and that the associated training
abroad would be undertaken.
Cattle Nutrition Research. Both dairy cow and beef cattle nutrition
research would be strengthened at Corbeanca Cattle Breeding Research
Institute and Balotesti Animal Nutrition Research Institute. At each
institute the project would provide: (i) specialized housing for nutri-
tion experiments on different categories of cattle; (ii) harvesting,
storage, processing and feeding equipment and facilities for various
forages and concentrate feeds; and (iii) study tours and training abroad
for 3 ruminant animal nutritionists for 1 year each. Additionally,
laboratory facilities and equipment would be provided at Corbeanca,
while Balotesti would be provided with a dairy cow herd and a beef
cattle herd to support experimentation. The broad objective of this
component is to provide the necessary technical depth and backing for
the Feed Analysis and Nutrition Advisory Services (paras. 6.05 to
6.07). Input-output data for a range of types and qualities of feeds
and forages would be generated and the value of high quality in these
demonstrated. Details of the program, including its timetable, building
designs, laboratory equipment and training, would be submitted to the
Bank for comments and agreement prior to implementation of the program.
Dairy Husbandry Research undertaken at the National Cattle Breeding
Research Institute at Corbeanca, would be strengthened through provision
of 3 experimental milking parlors; a laboratory and workshop; a 200-cow
dairy herd plus housing and feeding facilities, and funds for training
abroad of a 3-man research team for about 1 year each. Details of the
proposed program, including its timetable, building design, facilities,
equipment and training would be submitted to the Bank for comments and
agreement prior to implementation of the program.
Pasture Research would be undertaken principally at the Pasture Research
Institute at Magurele near Brasov. The weaknesses in current work
relate principally to pasture utilization (stocking rates and grazing
systems). To implement needed research on pasture utilization and
conservation, additional land, cattle, cattle housing, laboratory equip-
ment and funds for study tours and training abroad would be provided
under the project.  Details of the proposed program, including its time-
table, grassland layout, housing design, laboratory equipment and train-
ing, would be submitted to the Bank for comments and agreement prior to
implementation of the program.
D. Processing and Storage Facilities
6.10     Milk and meat processing and storage facilities would be con-
structed to meet incremental capacity requirements under the 1981-85
National Development Plan. The technology is well known in Romania and both



- 22 -
slaughtering and processing facilities and cold stores have been financed by
the Bank under previous livestock projects. The exact numbers and sizes of
the facilities and their locations are still to be determined, but it is
anticipated that about 5 milk processing plants, 6 cheese cold stores, 2
cattle slaughtering and processing facilities and 2 beef and beef product
cold stores would be constructed. Details of each plant including location,
capacity, investment cost and loan amount would be submitted to the Bank in
a master list of subprojects together with a justification of the industry-
wide need for such additional capacities. Also one sample subproject for
each type of investment detailing the financial and economic justification
for the subproject, together with the projected peak and average loading
factors, 1/ would be submitted to the Bank for its approval. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations.
VII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
7.01     BAFI would be the Borrower under guarantee of the Socialist
Republic of Romania, and individual subprojects would be implemented by
State Enterprises and Cooperatives after thorough appraisal by MAFI and
BAFI. As with previous Bank projects in agriculture in Romania this project
would be administered by BAFI through its 39 district branches. BAFI would
be responsible for overall project management and monitoring. In the sense
that this is another nationwide livestock credit project, it is a repeater
project and the sixth Bank-assisted agricultural credit project in BAFI to-
gether with 6 irrigation projects. Thus the institution is very experienced
in management of Bank projects. Previous projects are being implemented
satisfactorily, and general management of this project should also be satis-
factory.
7.02     BAFI branches would be responsible for directly supervising the
financial and administrative execution of the subprojects, with technical
assistance from MAFI, particularly the judet Directorates General for Agri-
culture, research stations, and the food inspection services. BAFI would
meet project expenditures from a special project account which would receive
funds from the State budget and from disbursements under the proposed Bank
loan.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
7.03     BAFI would examine all proposals for subprojects to be financed
under the project with a view towards determining their technical feasi-
bility and financial viability. Detailed subproject investment proposals
1/ Actual utilization/design capacity.



- 23 -
would be submitted to the branches or to BAFI's head office, depending upon
their cost scale, in accordance with normal BAFI procedure and subloan
approval authority delegation. All subproject investment proposals would
have to be cleared by the responsible MAFI agency before review by BAFI.
BAFI would prepare an individual summary analysis for each investmen-t sub-
project, including key operating and investment indicators. For subproject
review by the Bank BAFI would preps-re and submit, for Bank approval, indivi-
dual summary analyses for types and numbers of subprojects listed below.

7.04     At least 50% of the actual subprojects for which such analysis is
to be submitted would be nominated, in one listing, prior to any disburse-
ment and the remainder also in one listing within one year from the date of
effectiveness. Satisfactory analyses for all such subprojects nominated in
the first listing must be submitted to, and approved by, the Bank within
one year following the date of effectiveness. Similarly all subproject
analyses from the second listing must be submitted to, and approved by, the
Bank within two years following the date of effectiveness. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that analysis and submission to the Bank of
agreed subprojects would be undertaken according to this timetable and to a
format agreed between BAFI and the Bank during negotiations.
C. On-Lending Terms
7.05     In accordance with its current lending regulations BAFI would
onlend to (i) State Enterprises (including IASs) for a period of up to 10
years including a maximum grace period of 3 years; (ii) CAPs for up to 16
years including a maximum grace period of 3 years. BAFI would also provide
medium-term loans of up to 6 years to cover interest costs during construc-
tion. Short-term loans to Individual Producers would be provided by BAFI
through its agent the Credit Cooperative for up to 45% of the value of the
finished product contracted for sale through Social Sector Enterprises.
The interest charge is 2.5% annually. Long-term loans would be provided
for up to 70% of the total investment cost. The loan is for up to 5 years
at 3% interest annually and no grace period. Funds for financing
investment in improved pastures to be utilized by CAP Members and
Individual Producers would be on-lent to MAFI by BAFI to be repaid from the
State budget on terms and conditions similar to that for on-lending to



- 24 -
State Enterprises. Funds for financing technical services, research and
training would also be on-lent to MAFI by BAFI to be repaid from the State
budget on terms and conditions similar to that for on-lending to State
Enterprises.
7.06     Interest rates would be the same as those charged by BAFI for
similar investments. Medium-term loans extended to IASs and CAPs would be
at 4% and 3% p.a. respectively. Interest on investment subloans to IASs
would be 2% p.a. during construction and 4% p.a. after start of operations;
subloans to CAPs would be at a uniform 3% p.a. The weighted average
interest rate on total (medium- and long-term) BAFI loans made under the
project would   be about 3.6% p.a. and BAFI's financial and administrative
costs of providing these loans would be at a rate of about 2.5% p.a., so
that BAFI would realize a positive spread on its medium- and long-term
loans. As a result of central controls over domestic prices, Romania main-
tains a domestic inflation rate on retail prices of less than 1% per year.
This is expected to continue through the end of the 1981-85 Five-Year
Plan. This 1% annual rate of increase takes into account the past increase
in building and equipment costs since 1963. Because of the step-function
nature of such increases in the past, no significant further increase over
this level is anticipated during proj-ect implementation. Insulation of the
domestic economy from world inflation is expected to continue in the
future. In view of the above, BAFI lending operations under the project
would be performed at interest rates that are real and positive and
expected to remain so during repayment of subloans. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that BAFI would implement the project lending
policies, proce- dures and terms described above.
D. Procurement
7.07     In Romania, all civil works are constructed by Romanian
State-owned construction enterprises who are experienced and familiar with
local condi- tions, methods and regulations. Installations similar to
those proposed under the project have in the past proved well designed and
constructed. Construction of project facilities would be carried out under
contract by the Romanian construction enterprises.
7.08     The major physical innovation in the project would be herringbone
milking parlors. However, the Romanian milking machine factory, IMAIA
(Timis), is technically competent and its facilities are very adequate.
7.09     The total foreign exchange cost of the project is estimated at
US$138.2 million. The equipment and material required for the project is
estimated to cost about US$82.3 million (including contingencies), the
remainder being indirect foreign exchange associated with incremental work-
ing capital required during the construction period. An agreed list of
items costing US$80 million would be procured by Romagrimex under ICB in
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines, including construction mate-
rials, US$41 million; fertilizers, US$26 million; and equipment for milk



- 25 -
and beef processing and storage facilities, US$11 million. These items are
listed in detail in Annex 1, Table 1. Also, US$1.75 million worth of
specialized equipment for feed and forage analysis laboratories, 40 milking
machine testing and maintenance kits and 2 experimental milking machine
systems would be procured through limited international tendering, having
solicited bids from at least three Bank member countries or Switzerland.
Finally US$0.25 million would be used for specialized international
training to be arranged by MAFI. Romanian manufacturers would be allowed a
15% preference margin or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower.
Romanian manufacturers are highly competitive and it is anticipated that
foreign suppliers would be awarded contracts for only about US$2.7 million
for slaughterhouse and meat processing equipment which are not manufactured
in Romania. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that procurement
of items specified above would be through ICB or limited tendering as
appropriate and in accordance with Bank guidelines.
E. Disbursements
7.10     Bank disbursements would extend over an estimated 5-year period,
although the entire loan is expected to be committed by the end of the
second year. The annual phasing of investments and commitments and the
forecast of Bank quarterly disbursements are shown in Annex 3, Tables 1, 2
and 4 respectively. Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan of US$80
million would be as follows:
Category                                  % of Expenditures to be Financed
(1) Disbursement under BAFI loans:
(a)  New Dairy Farms                                        27
(b)  Breeding Heifer Farms                                  27
(c)  Dairy Farm Modernization                                27

and 100% of local expendi-
tures ex-factory.
(c) Training for Technical
Services and Research                 100% of foreign expenditures
Disbursement under Categories 1 and 2(a) will be made against certificates
of expenditure, the documentation for which is not submitted for review but



- 26 -
is retained by the Borrower and made available for inspection during the
course of Bank and cofinancier supervision missions.
F. Accounts and Audit
7.11     The existing accounting and auditing procedures in Romania are
quite strict and satisfactory. BAFI's accounts are subject to audit by
internal inspectors and an annual audit by inspectors from the Ministry of
Finance and the Court of Superior Control. The Court, which reports
directly to the President of the country, conducts an independent audit of
BAFI's accounts and of results of audits by inspectors from the Ministry of
Finance. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that BAFI would
submit to the Bank an annual audit report, satisfatory to the Bank, and
within 6 months of the close of the fiscal year.
7.12     BAFI would keep separate accounts for all project expenditures,
including those related to goods and services financed out of the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan. These accounts would be audited according to
existing procedures. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that such
project expenditure account satisfactory to the Bank and available to Bank
supervision mission would be kept by BAFI and that a report on the project
accounts, audited by the Ministry of Finance, would be submitted to the Bank
annually within 6 months of the close of the fiscal year.
G. Monitoring
7.13     BAFI maintains detailed records by borrowers of financial and
production results relative to subproject appraisal expectations which it
uses in its subproject supervision. In order to measure overall progress of
project implementation in relation to objectives, goals, and scbedules
established for each component, BAFI would submit quarterly reports to the
Bank within 45 days of the close of each quarter. These reports would
include data on progress of construction of all physical facilities,
progress in the procurement of equipment and materials, and data on project
expenditures and livestock production. Information would be collected on
each component and consolidated into an annual report whose coverage would
include data on the number of enterprises and farms financed; the type, size
and ownership of each; incremental milk and beef production; efficiency of
production; annual consumption and exports of milk and meat products. Since
its own procedures require BAFI to assemble such material and data the
incremental cost of monitoring the project would be negligible. BAFI would
also furnish to the Bank a project completion report promptly after comple-
tion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months after the
project closing date. BAFI would prepare its report in accordance with Bank
guidelines and format agreed during negotiations.

H. Environmental Impact
7.14     Romania now maintains a comprehensive system of standards and
controls to ensure satisfactory waste disposal, and a strict :ystem of
penalties is maintained to ensure compliance. Facilities financed under the
project would be constructed and operated in conformity with this environ-
mental protection code. During construction, each on-farm production
complex would be required by law to install suitable waste water treatment
works as well as separate well and water pumping facilities. In the manure
and waste disposal system, combined solid and liquid manure would be pumped
to concrete holding tanks for sedimentation and separation of liquid and
semi-solid materials for fertilization of agricultural land. Similarly, the
slaughtering and processing facilities and cold stores facilities would be
required to construct effluent treatment plants to separate fats and solid
materials, prior to discharge into the municipal sewerage system. Provision
would also be made for a separate drainage system for rainwater. A strict
system of penalties is maintained to ensure compliance with water purity
requirements.
I. Employment Effects
7.15     While there is a reduction in on-farm employment due to dairy
modernization, overall the project would provide employment for an addi-
tional number of about 3,000 people in both production and processing of
milk and meat. Although no problems are envisaged in filling these posi-
tions, the positions would be for skilled and semi-skilled workers requiring
significant training for most prospective employees. This would result in
increasing their wage earning ability.
J. Role of Women
7.16     Role of Women.  The project has no specific component designed
according to differentials based on sex. Romania haska policy of equal
employment opportunity and equal wages for women. From the nature of live-
stock production and field observation it is anticipated that a somewhat
bigher percentage of women will be employed in the dairy farms and heifer
rearing farms, than in the beef fattening farms and pasture components. The
staffing of dairy processing industry currently comprises 41.4% of women in
positions as shown below:

Total                                              41.4
Romania presently encounters increasing demands on the labor force, particu-
larly in agriculture, which will continue to increase employment of women in
all sectors of the economy.
VIII. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits and Cost Recovery
8.01     Production.  At full development, annual incremental off-farm proj-
ect production would be 379,000 tons (3.8 million hl) of milk, 40,000 tons
of carcass beef (or about 165,000 fattened cattle and 15,000 cull cows) and
33,000 breeding heifers. This increase in milk and meat output would meet
the project objectives of expanding supplies for increased domestic consump-
tion and foreign exchange earnings. Details of these outputs are contained
in Annex 3, Table 3. Additionally the incremental farmyard manure produced
would have an active substance fertilizer equivalent of about 14,000 tons of
N, 7,000 tons of P205 and 16,000 tons of K20. I/
8.02     Consumption and Trade.  Annual incremental milk production at full
development from the project would permit in the absence of exports an
increase in per capita consumption of 16 kg in 1985/86 or 10% over the 1978
level. For beef about 70% of the specialized beef units output would be
exported or some 25,000 tons c.w; per capita domestic consumption would
increase by 0.7 kg by 1985/86, almost 6% increase over the 1978 level.
8.03     Benefit Distribution.  Distribution of the proceeds of the project
are widespread. The main beneficiaries in terms of numbers of persons are
State Farm and CAP employees, followed closely by Individual Producers and
CAP Members and finally Food Processing Enterprises employees. The benefits
of increased output and productivity are distributed to Social Sector
1/ See Project Implementation File, Annex 8, Appendix 6.



29 -
employees, State Farm, CAP and Food Processing Enterprises through distribu-
tion of bonuses, wages being fixed and determined nationwide. 1/ Average
bonus payments will vary depending upon the yearly financial results. But
disposition of surplus earnings is legislated and this includes upper limits
on bonus pavments. Individual Producers and CAP Members are substantial
beneficiaries in that they benefit both from the investment credits made
available to them and from the improved pastures available to them. The
Government is also a beneficiary to the extent that domestic prices
(producer and consumer) for milk and beef are lower than economic prices.
These benefits are captured either directly as for beef exports or
indirectly through lower labor costs and thus lower domestic prices for
other export goods. Another very important aspect of benefit distribution
lies in increased domestic consumption of milk, milk products and beef.
Much of these increases are likely to be in urban areas where per capita
consumption is lowest. Although details of income distribution in Romania
are not well known it is not seen as particularly skewed and relative
poverty is not much evidenced. Consequently the project can be considered a
credit project rather than one of rural development.
8.04     Cost Recovery.  All subloan costs incurred by State Enterprises
(including IASs) and CAPs would be recovered through subborrower repay-
ments. Cost recovery for these is legislated in accordance with the finan-
cial characteristics of the type of investment, thus permitting the State's
investment fund to be replenished. Defaults are generally the result of
natural disasters (floods and earthquakes) making BAFI's default rates very
low. This is evidence of the reasonableness of the legislated loan terms.
Costs incurred in technical services and research would be borne directly by
the State from general revenues. However, multifold indirect recovery can
reasonably be expected as a result of increased productivity. Costs incur-
red in pasture improvement on State-owned land, administered by local Popu-
lar Councils and to be utilized by CAP Members and Individual Producers,
would be borne directly by the State out of general revenues. This is the
system currently in use. Despite allowing for the 25% increase auto-
matically incurred following improvement, user charges would be insufficient
to cover more than the traditional operating costs. The incremental operat-
ing costs incurred under the project would therefore be borne by the State
in the form of annual subventions to the local pasture administering
bodies. This form of operating cost financing has a precedent under exist-
ing Bank-financed irrigation projects in Romania. It is justified by the
fact that Romania's cost plus pricing system would otherwise require even
such a relatively small cost increase at the primary production level to be
reflected through the entire economy, involving a complete recasting of the
centrally planned wage and price structure. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government would provide the necessary annual subven-
tions to meet the incremental operating costs of these pastures.
1/ The wage remuneration system is less restrictive in CAPs being partly in
cash and partly in kind.

B. Financial Analysis
Financial Prices
8.05     The domestic pricing system is an administered one.  Without the
necessary Government directive prices may not be changed. Thus, incremental
demand for inputs and supply of milk and beef will have no endogenous effect
on these prices. A general input-output repricing exercise, now reported to
be underway, is aimed at bringing all domestic production costs and prices
closer to international prices. This when implemented will alter current
prices but profitability and viability are expected to remain unchanged.
Current financial prices used are contained in the Projected Income State-
ment and Investment Cost Tables for each model (Project Implementation File,
Annex 1).
Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
8.06     The financial viability of the project as measured by the FRR is
summarized in tabular form below. 1/ In the Romanian context of planned
investment decisions independent of marginal rate of financial return
analysis, the presented rates of return have very little value as indicators
of relative profitability of investments. Rather than permit any reduction
in the milk supply due to any relative unprofitability of such investment
the Government operates a subsidy program to cover any losses and ensures
the initial investment by requiring it as part of a total investment package
approved for a social sector production unit. Nonetheless, all subprojects
have highly positive FRRs with the exception of the pasture improvement
subprojects which are negative due to the constrained operating deficit
*described in para 8.04. Sensitivity analysis, in the form of switching
values and the more conventional variation in costs and benefits, confirms
these satisfactory results.
8.07     The analysis does reflect the differences in the pricing system
between CAP and IAS units. The FRR for dairy units is higher for the CAP
producers, as a result of production incentives in the form of higher milk
and calf prices, which more than offsets the CAPs' higher feed and labor
costs. The opposite is true for the heifer rearing and beef fattening
farms, where the system provides no production incentives and the higher CAP
operating costs result in a relatively lower FRR. Incremental operating
costs for dairy modernization are less than zero in all cases, which is a
result of labor cost savings and improved technical coefficients. The nega-
tive FRR for the Popular Council administered pasture improvement is also a
result of the rigid price structure where historical grazing charges

approximately cover the without project operating costs. 1/ As seen from
the IAS/CAP example, pasture models are quite sensitive to variations in
revenue. The major source in variation would be in pasture output which is
basically a function of fertilizer input. Thus assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the mission recommended levels of fertilizer,
including the recommended ratios of N:P205:K20 would be made available by
MAFI to all pasture improvement subprojects.
C. Economic Evaluation
8.08     Economic Prices.  With the exception of IAS/CAP produced grass and
hay and non tradeable by-product roughage feeds, all output and operating
input prices are based on international equivalent prices with adjustments
for quality differentials and transportation. Capital cost estimates are
based on prices currently prevailing in Romania. Changes in international
output and input prices as forecast by the Bank Commodities and Export
Projections Division are incorporated over time. For milk no trend increase
in real value is foreseen while for beef the Bank's projection of a 41%
increase between 1975/78 and 1985/90 is incorporated. Non-traded fresh milk
was priced at its international equivalent through the use of a product
specific conversion factor. Grass and hay was priced at an imputed value
assuming an economic rate of return of about 14% to its production costs and
this output becomes an input to IAS/CAP dairy and beef production. Non
tradeable roughage by-products were priced at their local levels without
adjustments.
8.09     Conversion factors (CF) are used to derive the correct relative
prices of products by adjusting their domestic market prices for trade-
policy induced distortions vis-a-vis their border prices to form efficiency
prices. In the case of tradeable products the border price of the product
is taken as the efficiency price, e.g. live cattle, beef, hard cheese and
butter. A blend of fresh (75%) and reconstituted (25%) liquid milk is the
only milk available in Romania's large urban areas for about 2 months in mid
winter. This is estimated to have a 5% discount in value to the consumer
vis-a-vis 100% fresh milk. For non-traded liquid milk and fresh products
(yoghurts, creams and soft cheeses) a proxy conversion factor of 2.06 was
formulated based on this blend and the domestic and border prices of the
tradeable constituents of milk, namely non fat dry milk (NFDM) and anhydrous
milk fat (AMF). Thus the economic value of beef is based on the projected
1985-1990 Romanian frozen carcass beef export price of Lei 35,295 (US$2,353)
per ton fob or a farmgate equivalent value of Lei 19,102 (US$1,273) per ton
liveweight. 2/ The derived economic value of milk used in the analysis is

pasture improvement would be borne by the State (para. 8.06).

Lei 3.24 (US$0.22) per liter at the farmgate. 1/ All financial and economic
prices used in the analyses are listed in Annex 4, Tables 4 and 5 of this
report. Details of the formation of these prices and conversion factors and
their application are set out in the Project Implementation File, Annex 8.
8.10     Economic Analysis consists of internal economic rate of return
(ERR) and net present value (NPV) estimations. Switching values lagging of
key variables and the conventional effect on the ERR of + 10% variation in
aggregate revenue and cost streams were estimated for sensitivity tests.
Quantifiable benefits include gross livestock and milk revenues from the new
dairy, heifer rearing and beef fattening farms, incremental revenues from
the dairy modernizations and pasture improvements, 2/ the fertilizer equiva-
lent (N, P205, K20) of incremental farmyard manure (excluding pasture
component) and the residual value of the incremental herd. Benefits from
the technical services and research component were non quantifiable
directly, but accrue to on-farm project components as well as to the live-
stock subsector in general. Costs and benefits associated with the agro-
industries investments and with credits to Individual Producers and CAP
Members are not included in the economic analyses. Similar agroindustries
investments under previous Bank-assisted Romanian livestock projects have
shown ERRs ranging from 15% to 20% which would be expected to be repeated
here. This component accounts for only 6% of total investment and would be
unlikely to alter the total on-farm components ERR (22%) by more than 1 to 2
points leaving this a good proxy for the project ERR. The private indivi-
dual's component also totals 6% of project cost. Again, similar types of
investment financing under the Livestock II (Pigs) Project have shown rates
of return, both financial and economic, equal to or somewhat greater than
for such investments in the social sector. Consequently a complete analysis
of this component would likely increase the overall economic rate of return
marginally. The results are summarized below: 3/

8.11     Excluding agroindustries investment and credit to Individual Pro-
ducers and CAP Members, the overall ERR is 22% and the NPVs are all posi-
tive. The ERR is seen as least sensitive to changes in capital costs and
most sensitive to revenues variations. The ratio of revenues NPV to operat-
ing costs NPV is 1.6:1, explaining the greater sensitivity of operating
costs. At the estimated Romanian investment rate of interest (IRI) of 9%
the lowest switching value is over 20%.
8.12     Even under some unlikely combinations of revenue lags and cost
increases the ERR remains above the IRI. Dairy farms are the major compo-
nent (63%) of investment cost NPV particularly new units (57%). Special

Poor performance in the rate of adoption and efficiency of utilization of
new technology here will show up in lower milk yields or increased feed
costs. As seen from the above table, the investment here is quite robust in
these respects. A 2-year lag in full production still leaves the ERR above
the IRI and switching values are high.
8.13     Economic rates of return for the individual components together
with sensitivity analysis are given in Annex 4, Table 2. Heifer rearing and
beef fattening components are seen to have the lowest rates of return, rang-
ing from 9 to 14%, and their sensitivities to revenues and operating costs
are highest. The estimated economic value of the heifers produced is based
on the financial prices as these animals are not traded. This estimate is
seen to be too low. If blended together the heifer rearing and dairy farms
components would be seen to be very viable and much less sensitive to
revenues and operating costs. Similarly animal inputs to the beef fattening
component are based on the financial price for calves and these appear to be
overvalued. If blended with the pasture and dairy components the results of
the analysis would also be much more satisfactory. This blending is essen-
tially displayed in the overall rate of return to the project since, in the
final analysis, all parts of the cattle industry are highly interrelated.
Also in the case of beef the economic value will undoubtedly fluctuate with
cyclical movements in international beef prices. But, given the long-run
positive trend in these prices, the component can be expected to remain
viable.

8.14     The project economic analysis above omits the benefits of the
improved technology and technical services to units outside the project as
well as those from research. These can be expected to be substantial over
time. Also, in the interests of simplification the benefits from expanded
milk production are under estimated. 1/ Given the robustness of the
quantified portion of the project and the significant unquantified benefits
the project has few risks and could tolerate fairly wide fluctuations in
input and output prices while still remaining viable.

Detailed Project Description and Phasing
Proposed Investments
1.       The project would include investments for:
(a) 92 new large-scale dairy farms (922 cows/farm);
(b) modernization of 32 existing large dairy farms;
(c) 19 large baby beef units (capacity 7,700 head/unit);
(d) 17 specialized heifer rearing farms (capacity 1,236 heifers/year);
(e) improving 109,000 ha of pasture land;
(f) 5 milk processing plants, 2 beef processing plants, 6 cold stores
for milk products and 2 for beef; and
(g) technical services and research: facilities for animal production,
dairy husbandry and pasture research; 4 laboratories and laboratory
equipment for feed analysis and advisory service; equipment for
milking machine maintenance service; and local and overseas train-
ing for these activities.
Model: Dairy Farm - 922 Cows
2.       Under the project, financing would be provided to establish 92
large-scale dairy farms. About 22 of these would be owned and operated by
IASs and 70 by CAPs. Fifty percent are expected to be located in the Hill
areas and 50% in the Plains. The main items financed would include cow
houses and ancillary buildings; milking parlor and dairy; installations,
equipment and services; tractors and vehicles; and incremental working
capital for two years to cover the purchase of breeding stock (10% imported)
and start-up capital for feeds, drugs, labor and other short-term inputs.
For IASs (Plains area), the total investment for the model would be about
Lei 26.5 million (US$1.77 million). About Lei 12.7 million (48%) would be
for buildings and constructions; about Lei 10.8 million (41%) for purchasing
in-calf heifers; about Lei 1.0 million (4%) for incremental working capital;
and about Lei 0.8 million (3%) for vehicles and equipment. For IAS models
in the hill area investments are virtually the same as for the plains area
and the difference in the cost of total investments is only about 0.3%.



- 42 -                       ANNEX 2
Page 2
Likewise investment costs for CAPs are virtually similar to those for IAS
for both plains and hill areas. Each model's investment would be phased
over two years and full production would be reached in the fifth year.
Commitments would be phased over two years, 1981-82. Model details are in
Project Implementation File, Annex 1, Tables 1-24.
Model: Dairy Farm Modernization - 520 Cows Increasing to 680
3.       Under the project, financing would be provided to renovate and
modernize 32 large-scale dairy farms which had been constructed over the
past 10-15 years. Eighteen would be owned and operated by IASs; 12 in the
plains area and six in the hill area. Fourteen would be owned and operated
by CAPs, nine in the plains area and five in the hill area. The main objec-
tive would be to convert existing stanchion barns to the loose housing
system and to provide modern herringbone milking parlor and equipment. In
addition, storage space for forage, feeds, machinery, and equipment for
mechanized feeding would be provided. Remodeling will increase the stock-
ing capacity by about 30% of the existing houses. These presently have
old-fashioned, inefficient, internal layouts, but are well constructed and
with many years of useful life remaining. Investments would include:
remodeling existing cow and young stock houses; a new herringbone milking
parlor and dairy; installations, equipment and services; tractors and
vehicles; and incremental in-calf heifers purchases. The total investment
for the model would be about Lei 7.6 million (US$0.51 million) excluding
retained heifers. About Lei 5.7 million (75%) would be for buildings and
construction; about Lei 0.8 million (10%) for purchasing in-calf heifers;
and about Lei 0.58 million (8%) for vehicles and equipment. Since
incremental working capital for feeds is not required and therefore not
.included the IAS and CAP model costs are the same. Investments per model
would be phased over two years and full production would be reached in the
fourth year. Commitments would be phased over two years, 1981-82. Model
details are in Project Implementation File, Annex 1, Tables 36-51.
Model: Beef Fattening Farm - Capacity 7,700 Head
4.       Under the project, financing would be provided to establish 19 beef
fattening farms. All farms would be located in the Hill area. Eight would
be owned and operated by IASs and eleven by CAPs. The main items financed
would include housing for different categories of stock (slatted houses for
older categories) and ancillary buildings; installations, equipment and
services; tractors and vehicles; and incremental working capital for three
years to cover the purchase of animals and start-up capital for feeds,
drugs, labor and other short-term inputs. For IASs the total investment for
the model would be about Lei 42.8 million (US$2.9 million). About Lei 19.8
million (46%) would be for buildings and constructions; about Lei 19.7 mil-
lion (46%) for incremental working capital for 3 years to cover start-up



- 43 -                       ANNEX 2
Page 3
capital for initial cattle purchases, feeds, drugs, labor and other short-
term inputs; and about Lei 1.0 million (2%) for vehicles and equipment. For
CAPs, investment per model would be about Lei 43.6 million (US$2.9 million),
which is about 2% higher than for IASs model because CAP feeds are more
expensive. Investments per model would be phased over three years and full
production would be reached in the fourth year. Commitments would be phased
over two years, 1981-82. Model details are in Project Implementation File,
Annex 1, Tables 52-63.
Model: Heifer Rearing Farm - 1,236 Pregnant Heifers/Year
5.       Under the project, financing would be provided to establish 17
specialized heifer rearing farms in the Hill area. Fifteen of them would be
owned and operated by CAPs and two by IASs. The main items financed would
include housing for different categories of stock (slatted floor houses for
older categories), and ancillary buildings; installations, equipment and
services; tractors and vehicles; and incremental working capital for four
years for purchasing heifers and start-up capital for feeds, drugs, labor
and other short-term inputs. For CAPs the total investment for the model
would be about Lei 24.9 million (US$1.66 million). About Lei 11.0 million
(44%) would be for buildings and constructions; about Lei 11.6 million (46%)
for incremental working capital for four years to cover start-up capital for
initial heifers, feeds, drugs, labor and other short-term inputs; and about
Lei 1.0 million (4%) for vehicles and equipment. For IASs the investment
per model would be about Lei 24.5 million (US$1.63 million) which is about
2% less than for the CAP model because IAS feed prices are less expensive.
Investments per model would be phased over four years and full production
would be reached in the fifth year. Commitments would be phased over two
-years, 1981-82. More details are in Project Implementation File, Annex 1,
Tables 25 to 35.
M4odel; Pasture Improvement Hill Area (1,000 ha)
6.       Under the project financing would be provided for 109 pasture
improvement model equivalents located in the Hill areas, between 400-800
meters elevation, where rainfall and temperature conditions are suitable for
grass growth and where 56% (2.4 million ha) of the total grassland resource
is located. The main items financed would include fertilizers for 100% of
the area, reseeding for about 50% of the area, liming for about 40% of the
area, clearing scrub from about 10% of the area and erosion control on about
10%. In addition, farm roads, permanent fencing into 25 ha paddocks plus
moveable electric fencing within paddocks and a water supply to each paddock
would be provided. The model is designed to reflect the average composition
of investments over the whole area (109,000 ha) to be developed. The
detailed composition of investments are therefore expected to vary somewhat
for each separate pasture area developed and the detailed investment plan



- 44 -                       ANNEX 2
Page 4
will be established for each subproject by studies and surveys. The average
investment per model (1,000 ha) is expected to be about Lei 5.5 million
(US$0.37 million). About Lei 2.0 million (36%) would be for fertilizers,
lime and seed; about Lei 1.1 million (21%) for farm roads; about Lei 1.0
million (18%) for fencing; about Lei 0.5 million (9%) for the water system;
and about Lei 0.3 million (5%) for scrub clearing and erosion control. It
is expected that the equivalent of about 95 pasture models (95,000 ha) will
be controlled and operated. by Popular Councils and the equivalent of about
eight (8,000 ha) and three (3,000 ha) by CAPs and IASs respectively. In-
vestments per model would be made over one year and full development would
be reached in the third year. Commitments would be phased over two years,
1981-82. Model details are in Project Implementation File, Annex 1, Tables
64 to 68. Detailed discussion of the pasture improvement program and the
pasture model under the project are available in Project Implementation
File, Annex 6.
Technical Services
7.       National Feed Analysis Service.  Under the project a national feed
and forage analysis service would be established by MAFI. It is important
that the service should have a large measure of autonomy and should be a
separate entity from research (although with close linkage) and other
analytical services. Under the project one central laboratory and three
regional laboratories would be established. The total investment in this
sub-component is estimated at about Lei 18.9 million (US$1.3 million). The
main items financed would include a central laboratory (450 m2) and 4
regional laboratories (each 225 m2) costing in total about Lei 6 million and
laboratory equipment and glassware costing about Lei 15 million. A list of
major laboratory equipment items required and their estimated cost is in the
Project Implementation File. The justification for this service is dis-
cussed in detail in the Romania Livestock IV (Cattle) preparation mission
report (September 1979) available in the Project Implementation File.
8.       This service would enable analysis of feeds and forages to be
undertaken for each production unit under the project and outside the proj-
ect. On the basis of this analysis an efficient feeding plan can and should
be drawn up for each farm. In addition, production units under the project
should price and purchase feeds and forages on the basis of nutritive
value. A scale of prices based on nutritive values should be drawn up by
the Nutrition Institute and MAFI. A most important project strategy is to
demonstrate and put in operation a workable practical mechanism and proce-
dures to overcome present serious deficiencies in feed quality and feeding
practices.
9.       Animal Nutrition Extension Service.  The establishment of
analytical facilities will be of no benefit unless a structure is designed



ANNEX 2
- 45 -                        Page 5
to ensure that the service will be used and the results implemented. This
can be accomplished by using a good extension service with specialist train-
ing in animal nutrition. The approximate requirements are for 30 extension
officers operating from the head laboratory, and 16 from each of the other
three. The extension personnel will have the following responsibilities;
(i) Advise farm managers and judet technical specialists on the impor-
tance of forage quality in terms of feed costs and animal nutrition;
(ii) Communicate new research findings to farm managers and judet tech-
nical specialists and advise on the implementation of new tech-
nology at farm level;
(iii) Ensure that all dietary components are adequately sampled and
analyzed to establish nutritive value;
(iv) Formulate properly balanced diets for various categories of animals
and levels of performance; and
(v) Advise farm managers and judet technical specialists on least cost
annual feeding program to make optimum use of available tillage and
industrial by-products.
10.      The personnel engaged in this extension service will be graduates
in Agriculture with at least one additional year of specialist training in
Animal Nutrition and Feed Evaluation. This course could be based at the
University and organized in close cooperation with the Nutrition Research
Institute at Balotesti. The personnel needed are already available and in
post at MAFI headquarters and in the judets. They need to be organized into
an effective service and retrained. MAFI realize fully that this service is
needed and have agreed to establish it. Nevertheless an assurance would be
obtained at negotiations that the service will be established on lines which
will have been discussed and agreed with the Bank. Under the project, in-
vestments for this component will be about Lei 9 million (US$0.5 million)
and will be allocated mainly for training personnel, about 40% of which
would be undertaken overseas by core personnel who would subsequently train
others domestically.
11.      Milking Machine Testing and Maintenance Service.  Under the project
MAFI's existing maintenance service will be strengthened. The main items
financed would include 40 equipment kits for maintenance technicians; 1/
overseas training (about 3 to 6 months) for a dairy engineer and a dairy
1/ See Table 2 for list of suitable equipment.

husbandry specialist; and local training which would be conducted by these
specially trained dairy engineers and dairy husbandry specialists. Total
investments would be about Lei 4.3 million (US$0.24 million), about Lei 2.2
million for testing equipment; about Lei 1.2 million for overseas training;
and about Lei 0.9 million for local training. The dairy engineer and dairy
husbandry specialist (after suitable training) would be charged with respon-
sibility for all details of the service and training of local staff. The
Directorate of Agricultural Mechanization would be responsible for the
service which should operate in close liaison with IMAIA (Timis) and the
Corbeanca dairy research unit. Although MAFI has agreed to strengthen the
service on the basis outlined, an assurance would be obtained during nego-
tiations that this will be carried out along lines discussed and agreed with
the Bank.
Applied Research
12.      Animal Production and Grassland Research.  Under the project,
financing would be provided to strengthen applied cattle nutrition research,
dairy husbandry research and pasture research. The main objectives and the
main items financed would be as follows.
13.      Cattle Nutrition Research.  Dairy cow and beef cattle nutrition
research would be strengthened at the Research Institute for Cattle Breeding
at Corbeanca and at the Animal Nutrition Institute at Balotesti. Total
investment for this sub-component would be about Lei 27.5 million (US$1.8
million). Specialized feeding houses suitable for conducting feeding
experiments for different categories of animals would be provided at both
Corbeanca and Balotesti. These should include (for each Institute):
specialized houses for conducting calf rearing trials (about 200 head
capacity), specialized houses for conducting individual and group feeding
trials on dairy heifers and beef animals (about 500 head capacity), special-
ized housing for conducting individual feeding trials with dairy cows (about
250 cow capacity) and ancillary housing and facilities. In addition, each
Institute would be provided with harvesting, storage, processing and feeding
facilities for feeds and forages. Laboratory facilities (about 300 m2)
and laboratory equipment would be provided at Corbeanca to support digest-
ible energy, protein and mineral studies. At least three ruminant animal
nutritionists and supporting staff should be based at Corbeanca and funds
are provided for overseas visits and training for 1 man-year each for each
animal nutritionist in an applied research center. Under the project
Balotesti would be provided with 250 dairy cows and followers and about 500
beef cattle to support the research program. A specified area (about 500
ha) should be allocated at each Institute to support the animal feeding work
by producing forages and other feed under the direct control of the research
unit. An assurance on this would be obtained during negotiations. An



- 47 -                        ANNEX 2
Page 7
assurance would also be obtained during negotiations that prior disburse-
ments are made for this component the proposed research program, the over-
seas training proposals and other investment plans would be submitted to the
Bank for approval prior to disbursement.
14.      The objective, of the proposed cattle nutrition component, is to
(a) provide input/output response data on the broad range of feeds and for-
ages available in Romania; (b) provide needed technical backing for the pro-
posed advisory service for cattle feeding (para 18); and (c) demonstrate the
gains that can be achieved in animal production efficiency throughout the
country when high quality forages and feeds are used. Nutrition research is
discussed in the Project Background File.
15.      Dairy Husbandry Research would be strengthened at Corbeanca.  The
main items financed would include (i) a modern well equipped 20-unit
herringbone milking parlour for general milking studies; (ii) a one-sided
tandem parlour equipped with the full range of measuring instruments for
detailed milking research; (iii) a four-stall two-unit abreast parlour for
detailed work on liners; (iv) a well equipped laboratory and workshop to
support the research program; (v) a 200 dairy cow herd together with housing
and feeding facilities, assigned permanently to milking research; and (vi) a
research team comprising at least one animal production specialist, one
dairy engineer, one bacteriologist and support staff to carry out the
research program. Funds have also been included for overseas training for
the research team (3 man years). Total investments would be about Lei 16.5
million (US$1.1 million) for this sub-component. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that before disbursements are made for this component
the proposed research program, the overseas training proposals and other
investment plans would be submitted to the Bank for approval.
16.      Pasture Research would be strengthened at the Magurele Pasture
Research Institute near Brasov. The main weakness in the on-going work is
that pasture utilization by the animal (effect of stocking rates and grazing
systems on animal output/ha) is virtually absent.  The main facilities that
must be provided include:
(i)  an additional 1,000 ha of pasture land for stocking rate, grazing
management and pasture conservation studies;
(ii) an additional 2,000-3,000 head of cattle (cows and other cattle)
together with livestock buildings and other support services and
facilities;
(iii)  laboratory equipment to enable large numbers of herbage samples to
be analyzed for major and minor minerals, botanical composition and
digestibility; and



-48--                     ANNEX 2
Page 8
(iv) laboratory and field equipment for detailed animal pasture intake
work.
17.      Total investments would be about Lei 18.3 million (US$1.2 million)
and include funds for overseas training and visits. This latter would be
used for exposure to applied research in a suitable experimental station for
training 2 Romanian pasture specialists in techniques and applied research
in pasture utilization by animals for a period of about 1 year each. An
assurance would be obtained during negotiations that before disbursements
are made for this component the proposed research program, the overseas
training proposals and other investment plans would be submitted to the Bank
for approval. Pasture research work envisaged under the project is
discussed in Project Implementation File Annex 4 and investments in Annex 6.

The Pasture Enterprise Organization
1.       The Ministry for Agriculture MAFI has in each judet an organization
called a pasture enterprise. These were set up in 1971 to improve the out-
put and utilization of the pastures. They do this by contracting for
improvement works with IASs, CAPs and CPs and by providing technical advice
and supervision on improved pastures and meadows. They are controlled at
the center by the Pasture Directorate in MAFI in Bucharest.
2.       In addition, the enterprise maintains a number of seed farms to
produce grass and legume seeds for their work and for sale.
3.       Funding.  The enterprises receive their funds from payments for
contracts sale of seeds, sale of hay from areas under improvement and sub-
vention by the State. IAS and CAP organizations are expected to pay the
full cost of reclamation works. Popular Councils are frequently unable to
pay for pasture improvement out of the grazing fees as the rates are very
low, 50-75 Lei per cow or equivalent. In this case part of the cost is
borne by the State via the pasture enterprise.
4.       Method of Operation.  When a contract is made the pasture enter-
prise plans and executes all the work either directly or by subcontracting.
Hand clearing is frequently subcontracted. The enterprise retains control
of the area for 4-5 years until the work is completed. During that time
they sell hay and may charge grazing fees or charge for liveweight gains
achieved by animals on the pasture. On Popular Council (CP) pastures the
enterprise sells hay during reclamation works and the CP organization
collects grazing fees which are paid to the enterprise for the works done.
Hay sales is an important source of revenue. The pastures in most improve-
ment schemes are reseeded where possible and it is claimed that they must be
cut for hay in the first year after seeding. This hay is saved usually on a
share cropping basis. Individuals mow and save the hay and receive one
third of the crop. The pasture enterprise receives the other two thirds.
There is a strong possibility that more reseeding than is necessary is being
done.
5.       Supervision.  When the control of the pasture is handed back to the
CP the pasture enterprise continues to provide technical advice and supervi-
sion. The management of the pasture, date of first grazing and number of



ANNEX 2
Appendix
- 52 -                         Page 2
animals must be agreed upon between the CP and the pasture enterprise
supervisor.
6. ---  Program to Date.  In 1971, 33,000 ha were reclaimed and in 1979 the
figure was 112,000 ha. A total of 936,000 ha is recorded as having been
ameliorated as follows; IAS 102,000 ha, CAP 205,000 ha, judet pasture
enterprises 203,000 ha i.e. on State land, and CP 426,000 ha. The pasture
enterprise was not responsible for all the IAS and CAP area improvement work.
7.       The pasture enterprise has the technical ability, experience and
organization to carry out a widespread pasture improvement program. In the
mission's view there should be no problem in implementing the proposed pro-
gram of pasture improvement as the pasture enterprises have already the
technical ability, organization and experience to carry out the necessary
works.

for calculations.
/2  36% below base prices in liveweight terms - Same ratio as on domestic
market (and as in Yugoslavia).
/3  Valued at base price.  Normal free market premium for lighter weight or
store animals is assumed to be offset by the fact that these typically
are culls.
/4  Domestic price is 11,150 per head - per kg price based on 519 kg.
/5  Assumed 519 kg liveweight valued at premium of 25% over slaughter price to
reflect higher real costs of production for breeding heifers compared with
beef from about 15 months of age.
/6  Price for IAS.  CAP price is 25.0.
/7  Base price + 25% - Same premium over meat price as in domestic market.  This
corresponds roughly to the veal premium.
