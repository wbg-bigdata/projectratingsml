INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIAN PORTS AUTHORITY (NPA)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A SECOND LAGOS PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) with the guarantee of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$55.0 million to help finance a project
for the expansion of the port at Lagos and for the improvement of management
and operations. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Current Economic Position and Long-Term
Prospects of Nigeria" (AW-35a) dated June 9, 1972 was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 20, 1972 (R72-169). A country data sheet is
attached at Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        Nigeria has recovered substantially from the consequences of the
civil war that ended in January 1970. The three Eastern States have been
rapidly integrated into the country's political and social life. It has
managed the economy effectively both during and since the war and has launched
its second development plan (1970-74) largely because of the technical compe-
tence of the senior echelons of the civil service. The Federal Government
has established a strong central position in the twelve state Federation.
Many important questions relating to Nigeria's future constitutional arrange-
ments remain to be solved. In this connection the successful implementation
of the national population census scheduled for November 1973 and the accep-
tance of its results by different sections of the population are important.
The Government is conscious of the importance of accurate population figures
as a basis for socio-economic planning as well as their wider political im-
plications and is making every effort to ensure a fair and objective census.
Preparations for its conduct are well advanced.
4.        The end of the civil war early in 1970 was followed by a rapid re-
vival of economic growth. Between 1969-70 and 1971-72, GDP increased by
about 36 percent. The overall rate of growth in FY 1972/73 is likely to be
lower partly as a result of a slowing down in the rate of expansion of crude
oil output and, more importantly, due to the slackening in industrial growth
following the liberalization of imports in 1971 and weaker agricultural per-
formance attributable in part to the drought in the Northern States. This
slowing down however is expected to be a temporary phenomenon. Other economic



-2-
performance indicators point to the underlving strength of the economy.     The
balance of payments position continues to be strong, mainly as a result of
the continued rapid growth in petroleum earnings.
5.        W4ith the slackening in the growth of imports, the Government con-
tinued to utilize its surplus to reduce short-term foreign indebtedness and
o relax further the restrictions on payments for imports and the repatriation
of dividends. The restrictions on import payments introduced in 1971 have
been abolished and the repatriation of accumulated dividend arrears for 1971
and up to 25 percent of the dividends accruing for 1972 will now be permitted.
Cross official reserves of foreign exchange at the end of March 1973 stood at
N292 million 1/ (equivalent to US$444 million), equivalent to about 3 months
imports. Import liberalization has helped to reduce the pressure on prices.
Food price indices which had risen at an average rate of some 23 percent per
year during 1969-71, showed an increase of only 4 percent during the first
10 months of 1972. Indices of other consumer goods prices rose even less.
6.        The Government's overall fiscal position also continues to be strong;
the 1973/74 Budget estimates a current surplus of N282 million (about $429
million), a further substantial increase in the volume of public development
expenditures, and larger transfers to the States to support their programs.
The Budget for 1973/74 provides for capital expenditures by the Federal Govern-
ment of N610 million compared to N468 million in 1972/73; details of the dis-
tribution of the propoFnd outlays by sectors are not yet available.
7.        Significant new policy developments during the current year include
a far reaching reform of the marketing board system, which will in effect sub-
stantially reduce the taxation of export crops; and the establishment of a
new bank to provide long-term finance to indigenous entrepreneurs.
Long-Term Prospects
8.        Nigeria's economic development in this decade is likely to follow the
pattern emerging immediately before the civil war.    A growth rate sufficiently
high and sustained to double average per capita income within the next 12-15
years appears feasible, if economic policies are geared to the objective of
economic growth.   This would raise Nigeria's per capita income in the 1980s
to roughly that of Ghana, Senegal and the Philippines today. The petroleum
mining sector is expected to lead with very high rates of growth through the
early and mid-1970s, decelerating subsequently to about 3-4 percent per year.
Thereafter, the other modern sectors of the economy - in particular, manufac-
turing, construction, transport and utilities - are expected to provide the
momentum of growth with rates ranging from 12 to 15 percent per year. Agri-
cultural growth, on the other hand, is unlikely to exceed its present level
of 3 percent per vea- at least until the mid-1980s. The transformation of the
economy implicit in these projections would be very substantial: for example,
agriculture may account for only one-quarter of GDP by the early 1980s, half
its share now; and value-added in manufacturing and construction is likely to
1/   Effective January 1, 1973, Nigeria introduced a new decimal currency
unit, the Naira. 1N= 1.52 US$.



-3-
increase from about 13 percent currently to about one-quarter, or to more than
one-third including petroluem.   Since the immediate impact of this growth will
be concentrated in the urban areas, with the incremental income thus generated
accruing mainlv to a small section of the urban population and the public sec-
tor, the translation of the country's potential resources into a permanent
improvement in the general standard of living will depend on the allocation
of government revenues between different claims and uses and, in particular,
on the government's capacity to expand public investment over a broad range
of sectors and geographical areas.
9.        Future employment and income distribution patterns in Nigeria will
be determined largely by developments in the rural sector. Although no relia-
ble data are available, it is clear that Nigeria's employment problems will
not respond easily to short-run or narrowly conceived remedies. Industriali-
zation is a long-term solution.   In the short and medium-term, improvement
in income and employment for most workers, particularly for new entrants to
the labor force, will depend largely on developments in the agricultural,
small industry and service sectors, where detailed planning and administrative
capacitv present the most difficult problems.
10.       Nigeria's current economic problem is not so much a problem of re-
source mobilization but rather of resource allocation and effective use. In
1971/72, petroleum revenues increased to about N640 million (US$960 million,
or about $13 per capita) from slightly less than N200 million in the previous
year; owing largely to expected further increases in these revenues, Govern-
ment revenues are expected to be strong over the remainder of the current
Plan period. Even assuming substantial increases in recurrent expenditures,
the Government's overall fiscal position should remain favorable, with current
budgetary surpluses equivalent to about 8 percent of CNP being realized from
1973/74 through 1980, roughly equal to projected public investment expendi-
tures. However, the distribution of resources between the Federal and State
Governments has serious developmental implications.    Under the interim revenue
allocation system now in effect, State revenues are likely to grow much slower
than Federal revenues, which are largely a function of the petroleum profits
tax. Consequently, xwhile the Federal Government can look forward to substantial
surpluses, the States may face rising recurrent deficits by mid-decade. It also
may be difficult for the States to make full use of existing infrastructure and
to establish the new facilities necessary to reduce present regional disparities.
The Federal Government seems to be well aware of this problem of State finances
and is apparently prepared to assume some of the States' economic and social
responsibilities.
II.       The scarcity of well prepared projects and the limitations of execu-
tive capacity hampers the fulfilment of the modest investment target of the
Second Plan.   However, the country's social and economic needs clearly justify
a much larger investment program in the future and the necessary financial re-
sources to sustain it are also available.    WNThat is needed is a concerted ef-
fort from now on to augment absorptive capacity by giving greater attention



-4-
to project preparation and to building the institutions and training the per-
sonnel necessary to plan and implement a larger investment program. Project
preparation on a very large scale is therefore an immediate priority for the
Government and external aid agencies.
12.       Nigeria's medium-term balance of payments prospects are favorable.
The external resource balance (net exports of goods and non-factor services),
''hich showed a N130 million surDlus in 1971, could increase to approximately
N1500 million (US$750 million) at the end of the current plan period, with fur-
cher growth thereafter.    Correspondingly rapid increases in factor payments
abroad by the oil sector are expected to result in small deficits in the cur-
rent account balance which should, however, be more than offset by private
and official capital inflows. The overall balance of payments position is
therefore expected to be strong at least through the mid-1970s. After 1975,
however, the growth of petroleum exports may decline to about 7 percent while
imports are likely to remain well above this level. A substantial resource
gap may therefore re-emerge in the early 1980's, again constraining economic
growth and development. Balance of payments difficulties could recur much
sooner, if public consumption were to rise more rapidly than projected.
External Finance
13.       Nigeria's requirements for external finance, over the short and
medium term, are based primarily on the country's need for new and improved
institutions, planning machinery and strengthened administrative capacity.
Yfost of the skills Nigeria needs are only available in adequate volume from
abroad and some are most economically and efficiently found and applied in
association with the tvpe of projects typically financed by external aid
agencies.  Aid programs can augment managerial and technical caoacity where
it is most needed and, where foreign and domestic resources are being used
in combination, can help to ensure that both are used effectively. The es-
tablishment of a substantial project pipeline by external aid agencies over
the next 5-8 years is therefore important because Nigeria's resource position
is likely to be considerably less favorable by the early 1980s when substan-
tial resource transfers will be required.
14.       As of December 31, 1971 Nigeria's total external public and publicly
guaranteed debt, including undisbursed, amounted to an estimated US$850 mil-
lion, of which approximately $65 million represented suppliers' credits.
Outstanding but undisbursed commitments of official capital currently amount
to about US$320 million. Debt service in 1971 was 3 percent of gross exports,
or 4 percent of exports less factor payments. Nigeria could clearly handle
a very substantial volume of additional borrowing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
15.       Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria to date amounts to $493.7 million (net
of cancellations) of which $220.8 million was committed before, $31.1 million
during and $241.8 million after the civil war. Transport and power together
(S353.2 million) account for about 72 percent of the total and agriculture,



- 5 -
education, industry and the post-war rehabilitation program loan for the
remaining 28 percent; excluding the program loan, the respective shares are
about 85 percent for transport and power and 15 percent for the other three
sectors. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
16.       Bank activities since 1970 have generally been aimed at assisting
Nigeria in the following three broad areas: (a) reconstruction and rehabili-
tation of the economy after the civil war; (b) institution-building in the
public sector; and (c) extensive economic, sector and project preparation
work. In pursuance of these aims, Bank commitments in FYs 1971 and 1972
amounted to $97.2 million and $119.6 million respectively; during the same
period, an economic mission and agriculture, education and transportation
sector missions visited Nigeria. Having substantially completed its post-
war reconstruction and rehabilitation program, Nigeria is now at the stage
where a major development effort is feasible. Similarly, the Bank, having
completed a preliminary assessment of Nigeria's medium and longer-term de-
velopment priorities and initiated substantial project preparation work, is
now in a position to develop a more extensive and forward looking pattern of
activities in Nigeria than has been possible in recent years. The results
of this preparatory work during the last two years, which are expected to
result in a gradual shift of emphasis in future Bank activities in Nigeria,
are outlined below.
17.       Given the size of Nigeria's population and its low level of per
capita income, there is room for a considerable increase in Bank lending to
the extent that this can help the country to develop its resources efficiently.
It is necessary, moreover, for Nigeria to prepare for the eventuality that
the growth of oil production may level off after 1980 and even possibly de-
cline, a situation which would justify substantial borrowing abroad to main-
tain the momentum of economic expansion. The Bank is therefore working with
the Federal Government to build up over the next 5-8 years a pipeline of pro-
jects suitable for external financing and to strengthen the administrative
capacity of the Federal and State agencies that will be responsible for
implementing these projects.
18.       Thus, in agreement with the Government, the emphasis of future Bank
lending will increasingly be placed on agriculture and the social sectors
where increased public investment is of high priority and where planning and
implementation institutions are weakest. In addition, Bank activities will
gradually be extended into new areas such as water supply and sewerage, tele-
communications, urban infrastructure and, eventually, the direct financing of
industrial projects. Meanwhile, substantial lending is expected to continue
in transportation and power to support the large investments still required,
pending the identification and preparation of sufficient new projects in the
high priority areas noted above. In this latter connection, institutions in
a few sectors (notably power and transport) are expected to develop in the
fairly short term to the stage where joint or parallel financing would be
practicable. Consequently, continued Bank lending in these infrastructure



- 6 -
sectors will be undertaken with the specific objective of assisting the Govern-
ment to improve institutions capable of attracting bilateral financing so that,
in the longer-term, Bank lending would be limited to the agriculture and social
sectors where the problems of project preparation and institution-building are
far more intractable.
19.       An important feature of the evolving strategy outlined above would
i-e a substantial increase in the level of Bank activities in the priority sec-
tors of the six Northern States which, with more than half of Nigeria's popu-
lation, now receive only about one-third of total income and have probably
tne least favorable development prospects in the medLum term.    Seven of six-
teen agricultural projects now under discussion are exclusively in the North-
ern States and would account for about half of the proposed lending in the
sector. In addition, the third education project now proposed is entirely
concerned with the Northern States and subsequent educational projects are
expected to include, at least in part, operations in the Northern States.
UThile the initial urban infrastructure projects now under consideration are
expected to be located in Lagos, where the needs are most urgent, the Bank
would hope to exnand activities to other urban centers subsequently.
20.       Several specific projects presently under discussion for the next
two years illustrate the Bank's effort to support the objectives noted above.
In agriculture, for example, the Bank hias strongly emphasized the importance
it attaches to rural dex-elopment in Nigeria and a recent preparation mission
reviewed a project covering about 6,000 sq. mi. of cotton growing areas in the
North-Central, North-Western and North-Eastern States. In addition to cotton,
the project is designed to increase the productivity of food crop production
(maize, sorghum). Investment requirements will include feeder roads, water
supply, credit and storage as well as the expansion of modern input use. In
the meantime, the Bank plans also to provide substantial support during the
next two years to food and tree crop development (e.g. rice, oil palm and
cocoa) in Eastern and Southern Nigeria. The proposerd projects in these areas
will be largely concerned with smallholder production and will provide addi-
tional income opportunities for large numbers of the rural population. The
need for institutional credit for agriculture will grow rapidly as input use
by farmers increases and longer-term development opportunities are realized.
The Nigerian Agricultural Bank (NAB), recently established with UONDP techni-
cal assistance, will help meet this need, although it will require continued
external technical assistance during its early years of operation. As a
vehicle for Bank assistance and support for NAB, an agricultural credit
project is also under consideration.
21.       In addition to the extensive activities in agriculture described
above, the Bank and the Nigerian Government are also considering the prepara-
tion of repeat projects in transport, power and education and the identifica-
tion of new nriority projects in telecommlunications, water supply and small-
scale industry within the next two years. A major objective of these opera-
tions will be to help establish new, and improve existing institutions in
these sectors through technical and capital assistance consistent with the
gen--al objectives of Bank operations in Nigeria noted above.



-7-
22.       In addition to the proposed Second Lagos Ports loan, two other
Bank operations are at an advanced stage of preparation: a proposed $15
million loan for livestock development; and a loan for highways.
PART III - TRANSPORT IN NIGERIA
23.       Nigeria's transport system consists of a 2,178 route mile single
track railway (Nigerian Railway Corporation); about 60,000 miles of roads,
of which about 11,000 miles are paved; the two major ports of Lagos and
Port Harcourt and secondary ports at Calabar, Warri and Koko; and two
international airports at Lagos and Kano as well as ten airfields serving
domestic traffic needs. W4hile the Benue and Niger rivers are navigable to
a limited extent in some sections, the civil war brought already declining
traffic to a virtual standstill and the future of river transport is there-
fore uncertain. In 1965 (the most recent "normal" year), about 61 percent
(in ton miles) of goods transported in Nigeria was by road, 27 percent by
rail and 12 percent by water. The main export traffic flows were from the
agricultural areas in the north to the port of Lagos in the south-west.
The heaviest internal movements were in the south, particularly between the
heavily populated areas that now comprise the Western, Mid-Western, East-
Central and Lagos States.
24.       Although military action was confined mainly to small areas in
the east, the repercussions of the civil war on transport were felt through-
out the country. Severe damage was inflicted on roads and bridges, mainly
in the east, the western railway line was unable to satisfy demand, and a
great deal of traffic was diverted to roads that proved to be inadequate.
By 1970, the modal allocation of freight transport was estimated to be 77
percent by road, 22 percent by rail and 1 percent by water. During the last
two years, there has been substantial rehabilitation of facilities but little
new investment, which is urgently needed in view of the rapid growth of the
economy.
25.       About N486 million (equivalent to $729 million) is allocated to
transport in the Second National Development Plan's public sector investment
program, N334 million for the Federal Government and N152 million for the
states, representing 26 percent of all public investment. Roads account for
69 percent of planned public investment in the transport sector, railways for
9 percent, airways and civil aviation for 11 percent and ports for 7 percent.
However, for reasons noted earlier, not all the planned works are likely to
be completed in the current Plan period.
Ports
21.       Nigeria has four general cargo port complexes:    Lagos, the Delta
ports (Koko, Burutu, Warri and Sapele), Port Harcourt and Calabar with a total
potential capacity of 5.2 million tons. These ports are administered and
operated by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an autonomous statutory corpo-
ration. In 1972, these ports handled about 5 million tons of bulk and dry



- 8 -
cargo, of which 3 percent was in transit to neighbouring countries, mainly
Niger and Chad. While the relative importance of these ports has varied sub-
stantially in the past, the port of Lagos has always been dominant; in 1972
Lagos handled about 76 percent of total port traffic, Port Harcourt 14 percent,
the Delta ports 8 percent and Calabar 2 percent. The latter two have only
local influence and suffer from inadequate access routes, although imports of
oil drilling equipment help sustain the modest activity of the Delta ports.
hapidly expanding petroleum exports are piped to privately operated shore and
offshore terminals near Escravos in the Delta and Bonny near Port Hlarcourt.
27.       The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), which began operations on April 1,
1955, is responsible for the administration and operation of Nigeria's ports.
NTA itself is administered by a Board of twenty members who, together with
the Chairman, are appointed by the Federal Commissioner for Transport. The
General Manager is appointed by NPA with the Federal Commissioners' approval.
NPA headquarters in Lagos handle policy matters and coordination between the
ports; each of the four port complexes has a manager responsible for day-to-day
operations and administration.   Tne Federal Government exercises control over
NPA through the Federal Commissioner for Transport, who approves rates and
dues and generally directs the Authority. NPA's functions include pilotage,
maintenance, buoyage, and surveying; berthing and unberthing of vessels; pro-
vision of wharves, transit sheds and storage areas; and provision of tugs and
cargo-handling equipment.
28.       The Federal Government's policy is to rehabilitate and develop the
ports of Lagos, Port Hlarcourt, Warri and Calabar as national ports and to im-
prove their access to the hinterland. About N36 million is allocated to ports
in the Plan's transport investment program, including, the proposed Lagos proj-
ect, the rebuilding of the existing two berths at Warri and the expansion of
Calabar from its present three berths to five.    However, the WsTarri and Calabar
projects are not yet ready for implementation.    The Federal Government is seek-
ing UNDP financing for a port development study with the Bank as Executing
Agency. The general purpose of the proposed study will be to determine the
economically optimum location, size and plan for the next stage of development
of Nigeria's port capacity. Its specific objective will be to ensure that
Nigeria's economic development is not retarded by lack of port facilities when
those to be provided under the proposed Lagos project become fully utilized.
This study will be completed before any construction work can be commenced at
either Calabar or Warri since considerable preparatory work is still required
on each of these projects. NPA has agreed (Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement)
to consult with the Bank on its plans for the carrying out of any major invest-
ment in port facilities.
Transport Coordination
29.       Transport in Nigeria is affected bv coordination problems of two
kinds: "vertical" coordinat-on between Federal and State agencies, concerned
respectively with Federal and State trunk roads, and "horizontal" coordination
between roads and other transport modes, particularly railways. The main
"horizontal" problems are due to the fact that, while Federal trunk roads are



- 9 -
the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH), all
other transport modes come under the Federal Ministry of Transport. The Fed-
eral Government is aware of the need to improve transport planning and coordi-
nation and proposes to reorganize and strengthen the Federal Ministry of Trans-
port to prepare it for a more active role in policy formation and investment
planning. To this end a new Transport Planning Unit has been established, with
the assistance of consultants (Robert R. Nathan, Ass. US) financed by the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID). The unit has started to
do useful work, but the FMWH has not so far enabled it to be involved in high-
way planning.
30.       The main transport coordination problem in Nigeria affects carriage
of bulk export produce from the agricultural north to the southern ports. An
increasing proportion of this traffic is carried by trucks too heavy for the
roads, although there is evidence that much of it could be carried at a lower
economic cost by rail. The reasons for the diversion of long distance bulk
produce from rail to road include: poor service offered by the railways and
inflexibility in their tariff structure; laxity in enforcing road vehicle
weight regulations and insufficient road use taxes on heavy vehicles which do
not pay the economic costs of road use. The Ministry of Transport, with the
assistance of the Transport Planning Unit, is currently preparing proposals
to deal with these and other difficulties. In particular, attention is being
given to ways of improving the operations of the railways, and a team of
Canadian consultants has recently published a report on this subject.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Lagos Ports Project (Apapa
Extension)" dated March 30, 1973, is being distributed separately. A loan
and project summary is attached at Annex III and three maps showing the loca-
tion of the project items are also attached.
32.       In 1962, the Bank made a loan of $13.5 million (Loan 326-UNI) for
the construction of 770 meters of quay wall at Apapa Wharfs in Lagos and
procurement of ancillary equipment. The project was completed in 1966.
Repairs to dock sheds and warehouses at Port Harcourt and the purchase of
equipment for all ports were financed under the $1.5 million ports component
of the $25 million transport rehabilitation loan (694-UNI) in 1970. Access
to and from the Lagos port complex has improved recently with the opening
early this year of the 4-lane Apapa road, which was partially financed by
Loan 426-UNI. Total dry cargo traffic is expected to reach 7.8 million tons
(150 percent of present potential capacity) by 1980, of which 6.0 million
tons are likely to be handled through Lagos. New facilities are therefore
necessary and, as a first step, NPA employed consultants to conduct the
feasibility study for the expansion of Lagos port. The project was prepared
and appraised by Bank missions which visted Lagos in August and December 1972.
Negotiations were conducted in Washington in May, 1973, and the Nigerian dele-
gation was headed by Mr. M.A. Tokunboh, General Manager of NPA.

Project Description
33.       The objectives of the project would be:    (a) to help provide addi-
tional physical capacity at Lagos port and (b) to assist NPA in improving
its management and operations. Specifically, the project would include (a)
construction of a new 1000 meter deep water berthage (5 berths); (b) construc-
on of transit sheds, a warehouse, service buildings, road accesses, rail tracks
^-d utilities; (c) purchase of cargo handling equipment including specialized
container handling equipment; (d) dredging of a harbor, channel and turning
!-isin; (e) consulting services for civil works construction and supervision;
and (f) expert services in management and accounting, if required. The con-
suiting services will start late in 1973 and civil works in July 1974. The
first berth is expected to be in service in 1976 and the entire project com-
pleted by 1978.
Project Execution and Organization of NPA
34.       NPA will be responsible for execution of the project.    Consultants
appointed in accordance with Bank guidelines will assist in supervising the
civil works element and, if necessary, additional consultants, acceptable to
the Bank, will be employed to revise specifications for heavy handling
equipment.
35,       Since the appo-I.ntment earlv this year of a General Manager, NPA's
management has been considerably strengthened, and under a recent reorganiza-
tion NPA Headquarters in Lagos establishes policy and coordinates the opera-
tions of the four port complexes, each of which has a manager responsible for
operations and administration, and its own budg,et.   The Bank has agreed with
the Government and NPA on a Plan of Action to improve financial management,
productivity and equipment availability and NPA has agreed that, in consulta-
tion with the Bank, it will employ consultants and/or experts in such areas
as engineering, finance and planning if it should appear that such services
are required in order to meet the targets set out in the Plan of Actiorn.
36.       NPA's financial situation is strong and is expected to remain so.
Each port complex maintains its own income and expense accounts, but the
establishment of a cost accounting system as provided under Loan 326-UNI has
not been fully implemented primarily due to administrative difficulties during
and after the civil war. As a result, NPA's rate structure is not fully cost
based and the profitability of each port is not assessed. Financial studies
are being conducted with U.K. technical support, and costing and accounting
improvements will be introduced in agreement with the Bank.    The proposed
loan provides funds for the services of additional experts should they be
required.
Cost and Financing Plan
37.       Estimated total cost of the project is $83.8 million.    The proposed
loan of $55.0 million represents the foreign exchange costs of civil works,
equirvment and consulting services.  Project costs have been derived from
estimatesprovided by the consultants who prepared the detailed preliminary



engineering. All estimates include duties and taxes where applicable. A
12-1/2 percent contingency is included for civil works owing to variable sub-
soil conditions. Price contingencies on equipment, management and labor have
been calculated on the basis of an assumed 10 percent annual increase in local
prices and costs and 8 percent in foreign costs.
38.       The proposed project represents slightly more than half of NPA's
investment requirements during the construction period. NPA will be able to
provide the entire local cost of the proposed project, the entire cost of a
dredger for use in the Delta ports, any expenditures on Calabar during the
project period and its normal program of equipment renewal and replacement.
During the project period cash reserves will be reduced by about $14.0 million
equivalent, but NPA's liquid position would remain satisfactory. After
completion of the Lagos project rising revenues will provide the funds for
completion of the Calabar and Warri projects should there be a decision to
implement these projects. NPA is subject to income tax on the same basis as
private corporations and provision for such payments has been included in
the financing plan.
39.       In order to preserve NPA's profitability it was agreed during nego-
tiations that (a) NPA would maintain an after tax rate of return of at least
6 percent on average fixed assets in operation during FYs 1974/75 through
1976/77; (b) that Lagos Port would achieve a working ratio of 92 percent in
financial years 1974/75 through 1976/77 and 85 percent in FY 1977/78; and
(c) that NPA's rate of return for FY 1977/78 and thereafter would be reviewed
in agreement with the Bank after the revaluation of fixed assets and a
review of the proposed Port Development Study. This review of rates would
take place no later than December 31, 1976.
40.       It was further agreed that, except with the prior approval of the
Bank, NPA will incur no additional long-term debt unless its net cash revenue
is at least one and a half times its maximum future debt service requirements.
Economic Evaluation
41.       Traffic at Lagos Port in 1971/72 was 3.8 million tons, above its
optimal capacity, with the result that ship waiting time at the port exceeded
50 percent of berth service time. A decline in export traffic and a slow-down
in the immediate post-war rush of imports has temporarily relieved congestion
at Lagos, but the congestion will recur by 1976 when traffic will reach
an expected 4.0 million tons, increasing substantially thereafter. Unless
major port development is undertaken immediately at Lagos, the threat of the
imposition of surcharges will be considerable.
42.       The selected site is an optimum economic solution.    The project would
increase capacity by about 1.6 million tons per annum. Some 1.3 million tons
of this would be handled over the 5 new berths, including 0.5 million tons of
container traffic. The remaining 0.3 million tons will be the product of



- 12 -
improved overall berth utilization resulting from reorganization of traffic
flows and increased efficiency of operations. Resultant benefits would cer-
tainly exceed the maximum annual value of ship waiting time experienced to
date, about $5 million equivalent per annum.
43.        If the additional capacity proposed for Lagos were not provided, the
traffic would have to be diverted to other ports. The only existing spare
capacity in the region is at I.Tarri, about 0.4 million tons, and Tema in Ghana,
which could handle the remaining 1.2 million tons. The additional transporta-
tion costs resulting from diversion to Warri would be about $1.1 million and
to Tema $16.8 million. The avoidance of these costs coupled with lower in-
surance costs which can be expected to result from the introduction of container-
ization and the improved efficiency of operations at Lagos produces an economic
rate of return of 22 percent with a first year return of 19 percent. Nearly
all of the project's benefits will accrue to Nigeria.,
44.        Sensitivity tests employed indicate that, even if traffic should
prove to be 25 percent less than the conservative estimates used or if costs
were 15 percent greater, the rate of return on the project would still be
over 20 percent.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.        Contracts for civil works and the supply of equipment will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding pursuant to the Bank's
procurement guidelines. The nature and size of the civil works contracts
make it likely that only foreign firms (some local based) will be in a posi-
tion to bid, but local firms are expected to participate as sub-contractors.
The loan would be disbursed against 65 percent of the cost of civil works
(representing the foreign exchange component), 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost
of imported equipment, and the foreign exchange cost of hiring consultants
and experts.
Ecological Effects
46.        The proposed project is not expected to have adverse effects on the
ecological conditions of the areas concerned. NPA has agreed to consult with
appropriate fisheries authorities and interests on the location of disposal
sites for the organic silt spoil resulting from the dredging during construc-
tion. Oil sumps to catch spillage will be fitted to all oil bunkering con-
nections on the quavs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRIUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.        The draft Loan Agr_ement between the Bank and the Nigerian Ports
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federal Republic of
Nigeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article



- 13 -
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan have been distributed separately. The draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for port development
projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

b.        viithdrawals under Loan 705-UNI have been slower than exroected durin-
the last year, owTing to cancellation of sub-project loan commitments and
reduced forecasts of new commitments. One factor in this connection is the
Government's policy to increase indigenous oimership in selected industrial
categories (the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree) which, at least
temporarily, may direct domestic funds towards existing, rathier than ne'w,
enterprises and investment. These developments are currently under review
with NIDB.
