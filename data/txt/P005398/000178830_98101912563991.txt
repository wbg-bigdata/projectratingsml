STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF A
FORESTRY PROJECT'
I. Introduction
1.01     The proposed industrial reforestation project is the first
comprehensive Bank investment in the forestry subsector in Morocco and
directed towards helping Government to alleviate some of the development
constraints in the forestry subsector. By replanting, improved forest
management and technical support the project is expected to increase the
supply of pulpwood for an existing pulpmill and increase its exports of
woodpulp; to reduce imports by meeting part cf the country's increasing
demand for fuelwood and industrial roundwood; and strengthen the forestry
services in overcoming certain institutional bottlenecks in the sector.
The project would be carried out over a five year period.
1.02     The project area selected has relatively favorable climatic and
ecological conditions for fast growing tree species and has comparative
advantages in the production of wood products relative to other
agricultural activities. In addition, proximtity to traditional export
markets provides Morocco with a good positior to capture an expanding share
of the growing European short and long fiber pulp market.
1.03     The project was identified by a World bank FAO/CP mission in
1979. It was prepared by Government in close collaboration with FAO/CP.
Preparation was completed in early 1981. This report is based on the
findings of an appraisal mission of Messrs. E. van de Poll, J. P. Chausse
and R. Chalk (Bank), and F. Weber and J. Maranda (Consultants) which
visited Morocco in June 1981.
II. The Forestry Subsector
A. The National EcDnomy
2.01     Morocco has a total land area of 67 million ha and a population of
20 million (1980) of which 60% is rural, growing at an estimated rate of
3.2% per annum. Per capita GNP was US$740 in 1978. Average GDP growth was
7.3% per year in the period 1973-77 through high levels of investment.
Because of an increasing debt servicing ratio and widening gap of the
balance of payments, a stabilization program was introduced in 1977 which
reduced investments and imports at the cost of reduced GDP growth and
increased unemployment. As a result GDP has only increased at about 3% per
annum since 1977. Details of agriculture in the economy are given in an
agricultural sector memorandum of May 1980 (Report 2667a-MOR).

b. Place of Forestry in the Economy
2.02     Moroccan natural forests including 2.6 million ha of esparto
grass, /I cover around 7.7 million ha, which represents 11.2% of the
country's total area. About 2.5 million ha of forests and 1 million ha of
esparto grass areas have real production potential. The remaining areas
(54% of total), especially in the more arid south, have as prime function
the protection of soils and water catchments. All natural forests and
esparto grass areas belong to the state (Dahir of October 10, 1917). In
addition there are about 367,000 ha of industrial plantations, mostly
eucalyptus (49%) and coniferous trees (44%).  As of 1979, 74% of these
plantations belonged to the state, 17% to collectivities, and 9% to private
individuals. The latter two categories have mostly been financed from
State funds. Un the basis of recorded wood fiber production in 1978, the
contribution of the forestry subsector to Morocco's agricultural GDP was
estimated at 1.5% and to total GDP at 0.3%. However, forestry's importance
for the country's economy is not adequately represented by recorded fiber
production. Moroccan forests supply unrecorded but considerable quantities
of fuelwood to rural populations. Furthermore forest rangelands contribute
about 1,500 million feed units/2 or 18% of total feed requirements to the
fodder supply of the national livestock. In 1977 the value of fodder
supplied by forest areas was estimated at DH 530 million, four times the
value of recorded wood fiber production.
2.03     Annual recorded wood fiber prodution shows considerable
fluctuations. Official annual figures for the period 1975-1979 are
summarized below but do not fully reflect the actual production of these
products, especially fuelwood (see para 2.10):

Annual domestic production of pulpwood, cork and esparto grass
more than cover domestic consumption and a large proportion is exported.
However, annual domestic production covers only 30% of the country's

requirements for other wood products (15% for sawlogs, 13% for mining
timber) and the balance is imported. Although fuelwood production covers
national demand, it vastly exceeds the annual allowable cut and this is one
of the main factors for decline in the country's forest resources. The
area under forest is presently declining at a rate of about 20,000 ha/year
(para 2.10). In 1979, wood product imports (70% coniferous) amounted to
DH 365 million and represented in value 9.8%. of the country's agricultural
imports and 2.5% of its total imports.  In -urrert terms. the value -_  we..J
imports increased at an average rate of 16% p.a. during the 1970-77
period. In 1978, wood import restrictions vere established and the value
of wood imports fell by 25%. However, between 1978 and 1980, value of
imports again increased at the same average annual rate of 16%. In 1979,
exports of wood products amounted to DH 159 million or 6.1% of Morocco's
agricultural exports and 2.2% of its total exports. Pulpwood exports
amounted to DH 90 million (56% of total wood product exports) that of cork
products to DH 40 million (25%) and that of plywood to DH 14 million
(8.8%).  The average rate of growth of wood exports' value over the period
1970-79 has been 17.4% p.a. in current terms, higher than that of
agricultural exports (7.6% p.a.) or total exports (14.2%). This was due
primarily to increases in the current value of exports of woodpulp and
plywood. However, Morocco's wood product trade balance has been
deteriorating steadily, reaching an estimated deficit of DH 280 million in
1980.
2.04     Forestry employment provides around 16.5 million man-days of labor
per year and is the main source of income for about 140,000 rural people,
most of whom with annual income below the rural absolute poverty level
estimated for Morocco at US$ 270 (in 1980) per capita. Primary productive
activities (logging and charcoal) provide an estimated 3 million man-days
of work to around 20,000 workers. Forestry administration employs
permanently around 2,500 staff members and offers full-time employment on a
contractual basis to 1,500 other employees. In addition, government
activities in reforestation, infrastructure, soil conservation and forest
maintenance provides on average about 3 million man-days of work per year.
The wood processing industries, many of them small scale sawmills or
joineries, employ an estimated 38,000 full-time workers. A major problem
in the forestry employment sector at present is the lack of vocational
training facilities, particularly for the forest workers and those employed
in the wood processing industries which has resulted in stagnation in the
introduction and use of improved forestry equipment and techniques.
Forest Industries
2.05     There are 31 sawmills in the country, mainly in the Casablanca
region and in the kif and Middle-Atlas forest regions. In 1979, their
combined output was around 70,000 m3 (s) L1. In general their equipment
is old and the recovery is low (45%). In addition, there are about 600
one-man sawmill operations scattered in rural and urban centers. Five
enterprises produced 65,000 m3 of woodbased panels in 1979. Five other
enterprises manufacture wooden crates. In 1979, they processed around
/1 m3 s = 1 solid m3 of sawnwood.

80,000 m3 u.b. of wood and produced 50 million crates, mostly for fruit and
vegetable exports.
2.06     The only pulp mill in Morocco (La Cellulose du Maroc) which is
efficiently managed is at Sidi Yahia near Rabat in the Kenitra Province.
The company was created in 1952. Presently 51/ of its shares are held by
Government-owned banks and the remainder by foreign shareholders. During
the last 6 years major technical improvements amounting to about US$80
million have been made to the mill, in order to increase its production
capacity from 60,000 to 100,000 ADTIL per annum. With the recent
improvements (January 1981) to the mill's evaporators, until then
considered to be the major bottleneck, the mill has now expanded its
production capacity to 100,000 ADT of pulp per year, corresponding to the
processing of 345,000 m3 u.b. of eucalyptus wood (para 3.05). During the
period 1976/79 the mill incurred recurrent financial losses, due to low
production levels, depressed international pulp prices and high financial
charges associated with the mills recent investment. However in 1980
increased production of 83,000 ADT combined with higher international pulp
prices helped the mill to break even financially. The mill's financial
position and profitability are expected to improve further with the mill
starting to produce at full capacity and international wood pulp prices
continuing to increase as projected in para. 6.07. The mill exports 80% of
its production to European countries. The remaining 20% are purchased by 6
domestic companies which manufacture paper and paperboard from domestically
produced eucalyptus (short fiber) pulp, imported long fiberpulp and
recycled waste paper. Their combined production in 1980 was around 60,000
tons or 40% of Morocco's paper consumption estimated at 150,000 tons.
Wood Product Demand
2.07     As can be seen below, per capita consumption of wood products in
Morocco is relatively low compared with countries at a similar stage of
development:
Apparent consumption per 1,000 capita (1975)

The present low current consumption together with an expected increase in
real per capita income coupled with a wood products positive income
elasticity of demand, indicate that Morocco's domestic demand for most wood
products will grow at an annual rate higher than that of the annual
population growth. Using however the conservative assumption of constant
per capita consumption, projected demand for roundwood, sawnwood and paper
and paper board is expected to increase at least as follows:

2.08     For paper and paper board Morocco's consumption is projected to
increase at an average rate of 5.5% p.a., reaching 270,000 tons in 1990 and
481,000 tons in 2000.
2.09     keforestation Requirements.  In 1970 a Reforestation Plan was
adopted by Government which still forms the basis for Morocco's
reforestation program. On the basis of an analysis of the production
potentials of the main forest regions and an assessment of future national
wood product consumption, the Plan proposed the planting during 1970-2000
of 662,000 ha representing an annual planting program of 22,000 ha.
However the actual achievement has fallen far short to this plan
(para 2.15). As a result of the slow pace of the actual replanting
program, illegal felling and rising demand for forest wood products,
Morocco's forest resource is rapidly declining, at an average of about
20,000 ha per year. Comparing Morocco's present annual wood production
with its projected wood demand, the country would now require a minimum
annual plantation program of 35,000 ha during the period 1980-2000!i.
That would be in addition to the need for fuel wood plantations (para 2.10)
and the regeneration of exploited forest areas necessary to maintain
existing resources. This highlights the need for additional plantations
with fast growing species.
2.10     Fuelwood.  In volume, fuelwood is by far the most important output
of Moroccan forests. However, current fuelwood consumption estimated at
about 10 million m3 o.b., is met through considerable overexploitation of
existing resources, as production significantly exceeds the estimated
maximum annual allowable cut of 3 million m3 o.b., implying an
overexploitation of some 7 million m3 o.b. per annum. The rate of
exploitation is not expected to increase in the future because increased

and hardwood species 9,000 ha) and protective and recreational
plantations 15,000 ha. Average m.a.i. of new productive plantations
estimated at 8 m3/year/ha. Of existing plantations (360,000 ha) only
200,000 are productive plantations.

use through population growth is expected to be balanced by an increase use
of alternative fuel (mainly butagas) as the population becomes more
urbanized. The latest fuelwood demand projections are given below. They
are based on expected rural and urban population growth of 1.8% p.a. and
4.8% respectively, FAU estimates of current fuelwood consumption, and an
expected substitution coefficient into alternative fuels of 40% over the
1980 - 2000 period.

Source;   FAO 1980 and Mission estimates
Assuming that current allowable cut of existing Moroccan forests
would be maintained until year 2000 - which is unlikely considering the
current overexploitation - the satisfaction of the projected fuelwood
demand in 2000 would require the establishment of around 1.0 million ha of
additional fuelwood plantations by year 2000, an average annual plantation
program of 50,000 ha, based on an estimated general growth rate of 6 m3
o.b. per ha/year under the poorer growing conditions due to lack of
rainfall in most of the country.
C. Main Constraints to National Forestry Development
2.11     To stop the regression of Morocco's forest resources and promote
their development, several constraints will have to be overcome, most of
them of an institutional and managerial nature.  Four major problems are
elaborated below.
2.12     Paucity of Data and Lack of Resource Planning.  Presently, only
very limited information is available on the location, quality and
exploitable volumes of Moroccan forests. The National Forest Inventory,
launched in 1976, aimed at providing recurrent stocktaking of the country's
forests over 10 year periods. As of 1980, only 1,100,000 ha (approximately
20% of total forest areas) has been subjected to detailed inventory and
mapping. Without this knowledge, forest resource planning cannot be
carried out. Only 700,000 ha (13%) of Morocco's forest have management
plans. This leads to suboptimal use of existing resources and investment
decisions. Completion of a first comprehensive coverage of Morocco's
forests is therefore a high priority. In the meantime, less detailed but
useful information could be obtained rapidly through a forest resource
study based on satellite imagery, which will be introduced under the
proposed project (para 4.15).



2.13     Unsatisfactory exploitation/market:ing system.  Under current
practices, tree stands are auctioned by the Forestry Department of the
Ministry of Agriculture to private loggers. The latter, who number around
500 for Morocco as a whole, fell and cut the trees and market the wood.
They are mostly middlemen with no professional skills in logging and they
recruit daily unskilled workers paid on a piece work basis. This often
results in low valorization of trees. For instance, most holm and cork oak
wood production (around 400,000 m3 u.b. year) is transformed into charcoal,
whereas a sizeable part could provide higher value sleepers or pit-props,
which are currently imported. The current plantation management practices
are also inadequate (i.e. lack of thinnings) and trees are often harvested
without regard to the best economic utilization of the wood. This has
resulted in suboptimum utilization of resources as trees are not always
harvested according to their best marketable end-product.  There is,
therefore, a need to train forest workers, to promote professional logging
operations, and to improve forest exploitat:ion management, a start of which
will be made under the project (paras 4.17/18).
2.14     Integration of Foresty and Livestock Development.  Because of
increased population pressure on agricultural land, the period spent yearly
by the cattle in forests has been steadily increasing with examples of
sedentarization on forest rangelands. Presently, it is estimated that
about 1.0 million cows, 3.5 million sheep and 4.0 million goats spend more
than 6 months every year in forests. At the same time and also because of
population pressure, there has been a dilution of traditional authorities
over collective rangeland management and a gradual abandonment of range
rotation. The growing anarchy presiding in the exploitation of forest
rangelands, particularly in natural forest;, has three main consequences
(i) a decrease in their productivity; (ii) the prevention of natural forest
regeneration; and (iii) the destruction of trees by browsing and lopping.
Because of the importance of forest for livestock production (it is
estimated that it produces about 35,000 toiis of meat per year or 15% of
total Moroccan production) and to protect Eorest resources, measures are
urgently needed to introduce a rational accion program for dealing with the
dual but sometimes conflicting interests between the Forestry Department
and the local population in the promotion of integrated forestry and
pastoral development. Specific measures to reduce the risk of cattle
encroachment in the newly established project plantations will be carried
out under the project (para 4.11).
2.15     Insufficient Investment.  Morocco's forestry policy aims at
reconciliating various interests: increased wood production, harmonious
integration of livestock and forest development, soil conservation and
larger participation of rural populations in the development of national
forests with better sharing into the economic benefits from their
exploitation. However Morocco's actual field programs have mainly centered
on the management and conservation of the natural forests, entrusted to the
state. Little resources have been devoted to inventory programs, resource
planning, plantation programs or soil conservation. During the 1978-80
Development Plan, public planned investmenls for the forestry subsector
amounted to DH 205 million or 5.6% of planned investment in agriculture.



- 8 -
Although the Government's 1970 National Reforestation Plan called for the
reforestation of 22,000 ha a year (para 2.09), the 1978-80 Development Plan
provided only for plantation of 5,000 ha/year of which 4,000 ha were
realized because of delays in the availability of funds and cost
escalation. During the same Plan period, none of the planned Inventory
Program was carried out (para 2.12), whereas the preparation of management
plans was reduced from 51,000 ha to 20,000 ha, and soil conservation works
reduced from 17,600 ha to 4,900 ha. However, steps have been taken in the
1981-85 Development Plan to redress this situation by more than doubling
(increment terms) the annual public forest investments compared with the
1978-80 Plan (para. 2.26).
D. Financing of the Sector
2.16     Sources of Funds.  Reforestation activities are financed from
several sources. Of the presently reforested area, totalling 367,000 ha,
about 225,000 ha (62% of total) were financed by appropriations from the
Government general budget, 55,000 ha (15%) by the resources of the National
Forestry Fund (FNF) (para 2.18), 64,000 ha (17%) by Soil Conservation
Programs and 23,000 ha (6%) by various other sources. Standing trees from
natural forests and from plantations established by Government on state,
private and collective land, are auctioned by the Forestry Department of
MARA (plantations established by private individuals or collectivities with
their own resources are nearly non-existent). In the case of the sale of
trees standing on private or collective land, the Forestry Department
recovers the historical establishment and maintenance costs of the
plantation (without interest). The balance goes to the owner of the land
or individuals making up the collectivities. In case of the sale of trees
grown on state land, the entire auction price is transferred to the commune
within whose administrative boundaries the land is located. In both cases,
however, the buyer has to pay in addition to the basic auction price; (a)
an ad valorem 10% tax whose proceeds are transferred to the FNF; and (ii)
various fees and taxes amounting to about 8 to 12% of the basic auction
price, covering administrative selling and recording costs and accruing to
the general budget of the Government. These financing arrangements present
major drawbacks discussed in the following paragraphs (paras 2.17/19).
2.17     Forest Revenues and Stumpage Rates.  Stumpage rates (value of
standing tree) for different species have never been systematically
assessed, but there are indications that current auction prices paid by
contract loggers for some plantation woodlots although set in competitive
markets are insufficient to pay for the replacement costs of plantations.
In 1981 for example, estimated establishment costs of one hectare of
eucalyptus plantations was about DH 3,000, whereas the revenues obtained
from clearfelling this hectare was only DH 2,700 /1. This difference is
mainly due to the relatively low yields of existing eucalyptus plantations
(5 - 6 m3 o.b./ha). Total forest revenues collected from existing
/1 Average standing volume of 60 m3 o.b./ha and clearfelling auction
price of DH 45/m3 o.b. However in the case of acacia for example,
where current unit auction price was DH 180 /m3 o.b., revenues of DH
14,000/ha were exceeding the plantation establishment costs of about DH
3,000 per ha.



-9-
plantations will remain below plantation replacement costs, unless average
plantation yields and wood product prices increase considerably in the
future or forest management standards are upgraded (including valorization
of trees) substantially, to improve the value of the standing trees. As a
first step to increase forest revenues, considerable efforts have to be
made to improve the yield and quality of wood fiber per ha by (i) planting
improved fast-growing species; (ii) using better exploitation techniques;
and (iii) improve stand management of the natural forest and plantations.
In addition it would be essential to assess and monitor the actual stumpage
rates for the various tree species, sothat real stumpage values could be
used in monitoring the base price for wocdlot auctioning.
2.18     The National Forestry Fund (FNF) was created by law dated
6eptember 12, 1949. FNF resources come from recovery of plantation
establishment and maintenance costs and from the 10% tax on auction prices
(para 2.16). Twenty percent of the Fund's resources are devoted to finance
forestry research and experimentation, and 80% to promote reforestation on
State, collective and private lands. This is done through two main types
of measures: (i) subsidies in kind to ccllectivities or private
individuals. An average of 2 million seedlings are distributed free of
charge annually; (ii) loans in kind and services. Collectivities or
private individuals enter into a contract with the Forestry Department, by
which the latter takes control over the use and management of the land for
a given period to establish and maintain tree plantations and sell the
trees in due course. Proceeds from the sale are then distributed as
mentioned in para 2.16. As only actual historical costs are recovered, the
landowner benefits from a long-term, interest free loan. For example, for
a plantation felled after 20 years and assuming a 10% discount rate, FNF
recovers only 15% of the costs incurred. This represents a substantial
drain of the Fund's resources. The FNF tax proceeds have increased
regularly from DH 4.0 million in 1974 to Di 7.0 million in 1980 but are
grossly inadequate to allow the Fund to play a major role in Morocco's
reforestation efforts with current establishment costs (DH 3,000/ha) for
productive plantations.
2.19     State Forests.  Prior to 1976, proceeds from the sale of trees
from state forests accrued to the Government's general budget. The law of
September 20, 1976 organized rural population's participation to forest
development through the creation of National, Provincial and Communal
Forestry Councils (para 2.20). The law also redirected the revenues from
state forests to the communes within whose boundaries the forests are
located. In turn, the communes should devote at least 20% of the proceeds
to investments inter alia into the forestry subsector.  Possible
investments are in reforestation or development of forest infrastructure
such as roads, shelters, waterholes and forest rangeland improvement at the
commune's discretion. These arrangements have resulted in a major
diversion of funds from reforestation and it is clear that this 20% formula
plus the current FNF taxation (para 2.18) is inadequate to finance the
renewal of the present forest resources. Communes well-endowed in forest
resources have generally reinvested very little of their forest revenues
into reforestation programs, relying on Government budget to finance these



- 10 -
activities. They have implemented a mining-type of exploitation of forest
resources, reaping as quickly as possible high revenues without
participating in the renewal of the resources. Various options which could
be introduced to improve the level of a more automatic self-financing of
the sector are described in Chapter VII.
E. Institutions and Training
2.20     The Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA) is respon-
sible for the overall development of the subsector. It exercises its
responsibilities mainly through the Forestry Department (Direction des Eaux
et Forats et de la Conservation des Sols) (DEFCS) (chart 1). DEFCS is
responsible for the sector planning, including protection and management of
the forests, plantation programs and supervision of all forestry exploita-
tion. The participation and decision making of the local population in
both the formulation and implementation of forest policy has been improved
by the creation in 1976 of Forestry Councils at national, provincial and
local level. The highest authority, the National Forestry Council has been
set up in MARA. It is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and consists
of the ministers or representatives of the Ministries of Interior, Finance,
Public Works, Commerce, and Justice, the Governors of the forest provinces
and representatives of provincial and local authorities (para. 5.02). This
Council is mainly responsible for coordinating all forest programs
including their financing and defining Government's policy and legislation
to facilitate the development of the national forestry resources including
livestock grazing in the forest areas. The Provincial Forestry Council has
basically the same function as the National Council but is only involved in
matters dealing with the implementation of provincial forestry programs
including forest exploitation and sylvo-pastoral development.  At local
level, the Communal Council plays an advisory role, and participates in the
organization of forest related programs within their communal boundaries
such as the auctioning of forest woodlots, the organization of forest
grazing (para. 5.06) and the collection of dead wood. Although it is still
too early to measure the effectiveness of these councils, the existing
Provincial and Communal Forestry Councils could certainly play a key role
in helping design practical and adequate legislative and administrative
instruments for the development of the forestry subsector including
pastoral development (paras 5.04/07).
2.21     DEFCS has five technical divisions at headquarters in Rabat
concerned with: (i) exploitation and marketing of wood products including
wood technology; (ii) reforestation and soil protection; (iii) forest
inventory and planning including sylvo pastoral development; (iv) inland
fishing and wildlife; and (v) research. At regional level DEFCS is
represented in all 28 provinces and is attached to the Provincial
Agricultural Services of MARA. The two provincial forestry services of
DEFCS (Kenitra and Khemisset) affected by the project are relatively well
staffed and will require only a limited number of additional staff to meet
the expanded work program under the project. DEFCS has a staff of 2500 of
which 270 managers and enginers, and 1200 junior level technicians.



- 11 -
Although staffing appears satisfactory, normal operation of DEFCS is
generally constrained by a shortage of funds. DEFCS is weak in forest
inventory and planning while management praci:ices of many field operations,
particularly stand management, needs to be improved to increase forest
productivity. In both fields the project wiLl undertake specific measures
to improve this situation (para 4.15)
2.22     Morocco has been engaged in forest :research since 1945.  The
senior research staff are all based in Rabat and are running experimental
plots on a rather limited scale in forest areas throughout the country.
IResearch topics presently being covered are silviculture, forest ecology,
tree genetics, seed testing, entomology and ]?athology and wood and cork
utilization technology. Greater emphasis is however desirable in genetic
improvement, provenance trials, silviculturaL practices through different
methods of thinnings, rotations, tree spacing, fertilizer use etc, wood
technology, and utilization, and these will be addressed in this project
(para 4.12).
2.23     All formal forestry training and education requirements are met by
the Royal Forestry Training School in Sale for junior (20 graduates per
year) and medium level technicians (20 per year) (respectively 1 and 2 year
courses) and by the National School of Forest Engineers in Sa16 for Forest
officers (4 year course and about 5 graduates per year). Senior Forest
officers undertake further degree courses at the Hassan II Agricultural and
Veterinary Institute. Problems are not foreseen in meeting training of
f'uture technical staffing requirements. Whal: is totally lacking at present
however is DEFCS's capability to direct and carry out in-service training
and refresher courses for its forestry services personnel in fields such as
modern plantation management techniques, improved silvicultural practices,
forest inventory work, equipment maintenance etc. In addition there are no
specialized vocational training centers or courses to train forest workers
in improved logging operations and charcoal mLaking. The Project would
initiate measures to overcome both of these shortcomings (paras 4.17/18).
2.24     The Ministry of Interior.  The Ministry of Interior (MOI) has an
important role in the development of the forestry subsector:
(i)    the Provincial Governors who represent MOI have overall
responsibility for development activities in their Provinces, and
are responsible for coordinating the operations of the technical
services including DEFCS;
(ii)    the Governors review and approve the decisions of local
authorities, including the communal budget; and
(iii)   the MOI, through the directorate of collectivities (Direction des
Collectivit6s Locales), has the trusteeship of collective lands.
For a successful implementation of plantation and pasture
development as well as an improvement in legislative and
administrative instruments for the subsector, MOI has to play a
key role.



- 12 -
F. Objectives and Strategies
2.25     Government objectives in the forestry subsector, as defined in the
five-year Development Plan (1981-1985), include:
(i)    increasing wood fiber production through establishment of
plantations with fast growing species at a rate of 50,000 ha per
annum (until year 2000) and by applying a more rational and
productive management and exploitation system of Morocco's forest
resources, which would reduce imports of forest related products
and increase exports of wood pulp, cork and alfa;
(ii)    maintaining, through improved forest management, the environmental
impact of forests in relation to soil stability, erosion and water
catchment; and
(iii)   control and supply of fodder for livestock by providing improved
sylvo-pastoral management.
2.26     These goals are considered reasonable given the present state of
the country's forestry resources, wood processing industries and
legislative and administrative instruments. However, development of
Morocco's forestry resources has been slow and are mainly due to
insufficient investment in the sector and other problems, most of which
emanate from lack of planning and management plans (paras 2.11/16).
Concerning the lack of investment in the subsector, Government has taken a
major step to improve this situation as the allocation of funds to forestry
in the new Plan have been raised to over 8.5% of public investments in
Agriculture compared with 7.3% during the 1973-1977 Plan and 3.9% during
the 1978-80 period. During the 1981-1985 Development Plan, public
investments in forestry will amount to DH 893 million (DH 179 million per
year) against DH 213 million during the 1973-1977 Plan (DH 43 million per
year) and DH 205 million during the 1978-1980 Plan (DH 68 million per
year). In respect to the other weaknesses of the subsector, Government is
aware of these problems and is willing to remedy this situation, both the
proposed Forestry Project and the Bank financed Middle Atlas Agriculture
Development Project _- (para. 2.27) are likely to assist in resolving
some of these problems.
G. Bank Involvement in the Agriculture Sector
2.27     Bank group lending for agriculture in Morocco began in 1965 and to
date 14 projects have been undertaken and supported by US$505 million
Bank/IDA funds (US$24.0 million in IDA credits). They include five
irrigation projects; Sidi Slimane (FY65 completed), Sebou I (FY70
completed), Souss Ground Water (FY75 completed), Doukkala I (FY76
completed) and Doukkala II (FY77). There also have been four agricultural
credit projects (FY66 completed, FY73 completed, FY77 completed, and FY79)
/1 une major objective of the proposed Bank loan for the Middle Atlas
Agricultural Development Project is the integration of wood and fodder
production.



- 13 -
an agro-industries and flood control projezt (Sebou II, FY74), four rainfed
agricultural development projects (Meknes FY75, Fes-Karia-Tissa FY78,
Loukkos FY80 and Middle Atlas FY82); and oie export oriented project
(Vegetable Production and Marketing project, FY79). The proposed project
would be the Bank's first major involvement in Morocco's forestry
subsector, although three rural development projects - Fes-Karia-Tissa
(Loan 1602-MOR), Loukkos (Loan 1848-MOR), and the Middle Atlas Project have
important forestry components with the objectives of reforestation for
erosion control, water catchment protection and sylvo-pastoral development.
2.28     Performance of bank-financed projects has generally been
satisfactory. Performance in irrigation projects has been good once
initial problems of land distribution, organization delays in construction
and in procurement of irrigation equipment had been overcome. Inadequate
cost recovery is the major issue. The impLementation of a recently decreed
increase of irrigation water charges by about 100% will contribute to the
solution of the cost recovery issue. The completion report for the Sebou I
project, an irrigation project situated in the same region as the proposed
Forestry Project, was submitted on April 29), 1981. The report stresses the
project's success in institution building and in providing infrastructure
to achieve increases in the production of irrigated crops. It also
stresses the importance of extension, the :imely allocation of funds for
O&M, as well as the collection of water charges due and the completion of
land reform as a remaining challenge to en3ure achievement of the
investments's economic and financial potential. Performance of the four
agricultural credit projects has been good. OED reports for three of them
are available (Report 2543, June 15, 1979, Report 3248, December 23,
1980)11. These reports stress the contribution made by these loans to
agricultural development, their success in establishing an efficient credit
institution and the successful expansion ol credit to small farmers. They
also underline the importance of agricultural price policy, extension and
input distribution for improved economic and financial performance of the
credit loans. These issues are being addressed through Bank sector work.
The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project has recently run into liquidity
problems because of the 1980/81 drought which resulted in rescheduling of
farmers' debts. Adequate measures to deal with these temporary problems
have been taken. In the rainfed subsector, the first project (Meknes
FY75), experienced considerable implementation delays due to land
redistribution problems, poor preparation of project components,
over-optimistic assessment of implementation targets, and inexperience in
the organization and management of rural development projects. The
Fes-Karia-Tissa Agriculture Project was designed to minimize organization
and management problems encountered with Meknes and is performing well.
The Loukkos project, which has recently become effective has made a good
start.
/1  The First Agricultural Credit Project was reviewed in OED's Report on
Agricultural Credit Programs, Background Paper No. 4.



- 14 -
2.29     Lessons learned from those projects, both technical and
institutional, have been taken into account in designing the proposed
project. Start-up delays which have been experienced by most projects in
Morocco would be minimized since key project staff have already been
appointed (para 5.01) and since a small pilot mechanized destumping program
(para 4.20) is reaching a successful conclusion. Detailed designs,
including quantities and specifications for roads and buildings to be
constructed during the first year are available. The proposed project is
in line with the Bank's 1978 Forestry Sector Policy Paper in emphasizing
the importance of industrial wood plantations and the crucial role of
management and institutional building for improved management in the
development of the forestry subsector.
III. The Project Area
A. Physical Features
3.01     Location.  The project area (Map IBID 15933) covers some 212,000
ha of natural (cork oak) and plantation (eucalyptus, pines and acacia)
forests in two provinces (Kenitra and Khemisset). The Mamora forms a large
single block (134,000 ha) of natural cork oak forest mixed with forest
plantations whereas the kharb consisting of about 78,000 ha of forest
plantations is dispersed in two separate areas north and south of the
alluvial plain of the Sebou River.
3.02     Topography and Soils.  The elevation in the project area ranges
between 25 and 300 m above sea level. The soils in Mamora are homogeneous
and consist of sandy pervious soils ranging in depth between 1-5 m
overlying rather impermeable clay formations. The area is fairly flat with
slopes rarely exceeding 5%. Agricultural potential of these soils for food
production is limited, because of lack of soil nutrients. The forest areas
in the kharb are located on the fringes of the alluvial plain and are more
undulating than the Mamora forest. In the South, the Rharb consist of
sandy Mamora type soils; in the West the sandy soils are part of recent and
consolidated dune formations, whereas the North and East have large
proportions of gravel mixed with sandy and clay soils. Only a small
percentage of these soils have good water retention capacity or have fair
potential for agricultural production other than forestry.
3.03     Climate.  The moderating influence from the ocean has created a
sub-humid climate in a band 20 km wide along the coast, while the rest of
the area inland has a drier sub-arid climate. Annual rainfall decreases
inland, varying between 600 mm along the coast to about 450 mm in the east
of the project area. Maximum mean monthly temperatures range between
200C and 370C, while in winter temperatures may drop to minus 50C,
with incidents of frost. The climatic conditions in combination with the
particular properties of the soils make the growing conditions in the
project area relatively favorable for relatively fast growing tree species,
but less attractive for crop production.



- 15 -
3.04     Infrastructure.  A road network of about 400 km of all weather
plantation access roads exists in the Mamora forest and Rharb area, linking
these forests with the public road system. The existing forest roads have
been constructed and maintained by road contractors under the supervision
of DEFCS. This system has been operating efficiently for 10 years.
Density of forest roads is low, averaging .40 km/100 ha in the natural
forest of Mamora. However, existing plantations are generally laid-out in
blocks of 300 x 300 m, each separated by fire lanes 12 to 30 m wide. Due
to the gentle topography of the area, fire lanes are often used as tracks
by four wheel drive vehicles and provide adequate access for plantation
management and fire protection. Maintenance of these tracks is carried out
by DEFCb on force account, using its own mnotorgrader. In the project area,
there are 6 nurseries with a total combined output of about 7 million
seedlings per year. Existing administrative offices and housing are
adequate for current level of operations, but will need to be increased to
support the expanded scale of operations proposed under the project (para
4.19).
3.05     In 1980, the pulpmill (para 2.06) produced 83,000 ADT of bleached
hardwood sulfate pulp from eucalyptus and has recently increased its
capacity to 100,000 ADT. To reach full capacity production, the mill's
annual pulp wood consumption would have to be increased from about 286,000
m3 u.b. to 345,000 m3 u.b.   This increase could be obtained by
replanting about 20,000 ha of present low yielding eucalyptus (5 m3
o.b./ha) with high yielding planting stock (12 m3 o.b./ha, para 4.08).
At present the mill purchases its pulp wood requirements from contract
loggers who cut eucalyptus wood lots scattered throughout the project area
and beyond, at distances ranging from 5 to 180 km from the mill. There
would however be sufficient existing eucalyptus plantations in the project
area within a 50 km radius of the pulpmill, which if properly upgraded
would provide the total wood requirements of the mill at significantly
reduced wood costs.
B. Socio-Economic Features
3.06     Population and Land Tenure.  The M4amora area is populated only at
the fringes of the forest. The population of the Rharb has however doubled
during the last 20 years to about 1.2 million people part of which may have
been caused by the success of the Sebou project (para. 2.28). The forest
in the project area is divided into state, collective and private (melk)
land. The Mamora forest consists entirely of state land, whereas the Rharb
area comprises 43% state land, 38% collective land and 19% private land.
*          Forest areas in the project area are well delimited.  While the Government
is undisputed owner of the state land, people living near forest state land
have grazing rights in these areas together with the right to collect dead
wood for domestic purposes. The forest plantations on collective and
private land are established and managed like forests on state land by
DEFCS (para 2.18).



- 16 -
Land Use and Forest Management
3.07     The project area consists of about 210,000 ha of forests of which
82,000 ha in natural cork oak vegetation and about 130,000 ha in
plantations, mainly eucalyptus (105,000 ha) and pines (18,000 ha). Their
wood production is generally low, particularly the eucalyptus plantations,
which on average have annual yields between 5-8 m3 o.b./ha, about half
the potential production levels of improved species in this type of soil
and climate (para 4.08). In order to make possible efficient exploitation
and management, the replacing of degraded natural forests and plantations
of low productivity by high yielding fast growing species is therefore one
of the main priorities in the project area. In 1973, a detailed management
plan for the Mamora forest prepared by DEFCS assisted by foreign
consultants, was introduced, outlining the areas and species to be
planted. DEFCS has already started with the implementation of this Plan
which will be enforced under the project. The existing forest management
in the project area is mainly based on the supply of pulpwood to the
pulpmill but a higher value of production would be obtained by allocating a
larger share to utility timber, poles and fuelwood from the same forests.
This will be possible with improved stand management techniques (i.e.
rotation, thinnings, more intensive plant spacing) to be strengthened under
the project.
3.08     Apart from the production of wood products the forest areas are
also used for grazing, particularly those areas which have a degraded
forest cover (cork oak) or young tree plantations (eucalyptus, pines,
acacia) which still have an open canopy allowing enough sunlight for the
production of fodder. The Mamora forest has been divided in 10 specific
grazing areas corresponding to each of the 10 tribes who have grazing
rights.The productivity of the forest rangeland is however very low due to
overgrazing and mismanagement. Forage output varies with the rainfall from
about 120 to 300 feed units per ha. Fodder production under eucalyptus or
acacia plantations is nearly nill, estimated at about 10 to 20 feed units
per ha.
3.09     Each family is allowed by right a maximum herd for subsistence of
8 cattle or 40 sheep. Grazing right holders have to pay a small fee for
each animal above this limit. Although grazing right holders have to
register their herd each year with the local authorities, the actual number
of livestock grazing in the Mamora forest is much too high in relation to
available fodder resources. In the Rharb area grazing is not regulated.
Most young plantations are protected by law against grazing during the
first 3 to 4 years but, since there is very little natural forest left
which can be used for rangeland, temporary grazing restrictions to protect
young plantations are seldom fully respected. Due to the generally severe
grazing pressures on forest lands DEFCS is only allowed by law to close off
20% of tribal rangeland/forest during plantation establishment and tree
regeneration, to livestock at the same time.
3.10     Agricultural crop production in part of the Rharb plain is
intensive since large areas are under irrigated crop production (about
70,000 ha). The rural life style is becoming increasingly sedentary. This



- 17 -
has resulted in a far more aggressive use of grazing areas available in the
forests of the project area. Particularly the rangeland in the Mamora
forest is not used any longer for winter grazing only b-t is now used
throughout the year, resulting in overgrazing and rapidly degrading
pastures. Although the deficit in fodder resources in the project area is
being reduced by increased fodder crop production in the Rharb plain, the
success of the proposed reforestation program would also be strengthened if
the productivity and management of the forest grazing areas were improved.
3.11     Major Constraint to Plantation Development in Project Area.  The
main forest development constraint in the project area is related to the
reiatively high human and livestock population increase in the area which
has resulted in overcutting the forest for fuelwood, conversion of
rangeland into agricultural land and increased grazing pressure in the
remaining forest areas. The proposed development actions under the project
have taken these constraints in consideration since the project would
replant mainly old plantations (20,000 ha) having a very low annual
incremental yield of 5 m3 per ha and which presently do not produce any
fodder for livestock. In respect to the rewly established plantations
(10,000 ha) in degraded cork oak forest, w,rhich are presently used for
grazing, pastoral improvements on other existing forest rangeland would be
made to compensate livestock holders for the loss in grazing resulting of
this reforestation program (para 4.11). The project will also help to
alleviate the fuelwood constraints in the project area, by using the stumps
and the balance portion of the production from the proposed plantations for
fuelwood.
3.12     A UNDP/FAO project (MOR 73/106), which has successfully studied
two tribal rangeland areas in the Mamora forest from 1973-1980, has made
specific proposals for the required improvement of project grazing areas
including its organization and management. These results would be used in
the implementation of the project pastoral component.
IV. The Project
A. Objectives and Summary Description
4.01     The principle objectives of the project are:
(i)  to increase roundwood production through new plantations to
provide short fiber pulpwood to the existing pulpmill at Sidi
Yahia in the Rharb and provide part of Morocco's increasing demand
for construction and industrial timber and fuelwood. This
increased production would result in increased exports of pulp and
reduced imports of timber; and
(ii)   introduce better planning and management techniques for the
forestry subsector, which would result in increased productivity
of forests as well as supply of forage for livestock.



- 18 -
4.02     The project is part of a long term plantation program in the
country (para 2.25). Plantations would be of two types: the first would
involve replanting of old eucalyptus plantations which are either of
unsuitable genetic stock (around 20%) or are already in their third or
fourth coppice rotation period with rapidly declining yields (80%), mainly
for the supply of pulpwood, fuelwood and poles (para 4.04); the second
would be reforestation with pines, acacia and eucalyptus in degraded
natural cork oak areas for the supply of utility timber, fuelwood, poles,
tanning bark and some pulpwood (para 4.06).
4.03     The proposed project would consist of:
(i) destumping and replanting of about 20,000 ha of existing
low-yielding eucalyptus plantations in the Mamora and Gharb areas;
(ii) reforestation in the Mamora forest area of about 10,000 ha
degraded cork oak forest with 3,000 ha eucalyptus, 3,500 ha Acacia
mollissima and 3,500 ha of pines;
(iii) upgrading and constructing of respectively about 140 and 40 km of
forest roads and tracks, and maintaining about 500 km of selected
plantation roads over the project construction period;
(iv) pasture improvements on about 2,600 ha;
(v) improving the research, forest inventory/planning and training
capabilities of DEFCS;
(vi) carrying out specialized studies including forest inventory,
management, exploitation (charcoal) and financing; and
(vii) establishment of a project management unit together with
technical, administrative and logistical support.
B. Detailed Features
Reforestation and related works
4.04     About 20,000 ha of existing low yielding eucalyptus plantations on
State or collective land would be logged, mechanically destumped and
replanted with improved eucalyptus planting stock. Since 50% of this
program would be carried out on collective land, assurances were obtained
at negotiations that MUI had received written approval from all
collectivities involved in the destumping program in the project area for
replanting their land with eucalyptus. Destumping will be done
mechanically. There are neither technical nor financial advantages to
manual destumping.  It costs about DH 3,500/ha (DH 3.5 per stump) and
requires further mechanical soil preparation (deep ploughing) at an average
additional cost of DH 500/ha. Mechanical destumping costs are estimated at
DH 5,500/ha from which must be deducted revenues from sales of stumps of
about DH 1,000/ha. Moreover, since it takes nearly 400 mandays to manually



- 19 -
destump one ha, proposed annual destumping programs can only be carried out
mechanically as there would be insufficient labor available in the area to
carry out the work within the available period (about 2 million mandays to
destump 5,000 ha in 6 to 8 months). The destumping program would be
carried out by private contractors financed by the project. The wood from
the stumps which amounts to about 40 tons per ha would be sold at auctions
to the loggers as part of the wood lots, together with standing trees and
imarketed as fuelwood or charcoal. Experiments would be carried out under
the project to establish the most efficient way of splitting these stumps
to facilitate transport and to introduce more efficient charcoal kilns
(para 4.18).
4.05     The nursery, field preparation, planting and maintenance program
would be carried out by DEFCS. To meet the increased demand for seedlings
in the project area an additional nursery would be established, which would
lbring the total number of nurseries in the project area to 7 with a total
annual capacity to 10 million seedlings.
4.06     A further 10,000 ha plantation program would be carried in the
Mlamora forest on state land to replace the much degraded cork oak
vegetation cover, by planting eucalyptus, pines, and Acacia molissima. In
contrast with the mechanical destumping program, with about 900 trees per
ha this area with only 30 to 40 trees per ha would be suitable for clearing
and destumping by hand.
4.07     The combined logging, destumping, land clearing and preparation
and plantation program over the 5 year period would be as follows:

4.08     The eucalyptus selected for planting would be Eucalyptus
camaldulensis, (provenance Lake Albacutya). It regenerates from its own
stump following cutting (coppices) and has shown under research conditions
a mean annual increment (m.a.i) in the project area between 17 and 21 m3
o.b./ha. Due to the variations in soils and rainfall in the project area,
the eucalyptus to be planted under the project is expected to yield an
average m.a.i. of 12 m3. o.b.  It would be harvested every 10 years and
would be allowed to coppice at least twice. The pines selected for
planting would be Pinus pinaster (syn maritimna) from Leiria (Portugal),
with an expected m.a.i of 6 mJ o.b./ha. It Would be cut after 30 years
with thinnings after 15 and 25 years.  Acacia mollissima would also be



- 20 -
planted, cut and destumped after 10 years giving a m.a.i of 8 m3 o.b./ha
and about 400 kg of dry bark for tanning.
4.09     The plantation establishment, maintenance and management
techniques proposed are all well proven in both Morocco and other similar
ecological areas including Southern Europe. Proposed mechanical destumping
techniques have been tested in Morocco with track type tractors and have
been found feasible. Nutrient loss caused by these operations appears to
be small, since debris and bark left behind from the wood exploitation is
properly mixed with the soil in the course of the land preparation
operations.
4.10     Roads and Firebreaks.  On the basis of the Management Plan (para
3.07) 140 km of selected roads will be upgraded to allow year round access
for standard road vehicles in order to provide better forest management and
exploitation. In addition a small new road construction program of 40 km
will be undertaken in the new plantation areas. Both upgraded and new
roads would have minimum design standards compatible with satisfactory
serviceability and would be based on standard 4 m gravel roads with
drainage ditches and culverts as required. Maintenance would be carried
out on about 500 km of selected roads in the project areas aiming at
keeping the roads open for light vehicular requirements. Road construction
costs (new roads US$19,000/km; upgraded US$14,500/km and maintenance
US$1,500/km) was based on recent bid documents and contracts for roads in
the project area. The road program would be carried out under the same
system described in para 3.04. Basic fire protection arrangements already
exist in the project area, but will be improved during the project. New
firebreaks would be constructed according to design standards of existing
plantations (para 3.04) which are satisfactory. Because of the flat
topography, firebreaks can also serve as access during the dry season which
compensates for the relatively low density of existing road network (para
3.04). Selected firebreaks would be upgraded as access tracks by DEFCS as
part of plantation maintenance operations using departmental labor and
equipment. These would bring the overall road track density to about
20 m/ha. Special patrols would be put into operation during the high risk
season.
4.11     Pasture Improvement.  Blocks of about 100 ha totalling some
2,600 ha of degraded cork oak forest would be selected in Mamora for
pasture improvement to compensate for the loss in grazing resulting from
the establishment of 10,000 ha of new plantations on forest range land in
Mamora (para. 4.06). The program would be carried out at an annual rate of
about 650 ha starting in PY2. Apart from the intrinsic social and economic
merits of this program, it would also provide an incentive to the
collectivities to cooperate with project staff in the protection of young
plantation stands. Pasture improvements would be based on the findings of
a project (para. 3.12) carried out in Mamora since 1973 by UNDP/FAO and
DEFCS and would follow its specific proposals in respect to the
organization, management and technical parameters for improved grazing
areas established under this project. Only the forest range of legitimate
herds affected by the plantation development program in Mamora would be



- 21 -
improved. The forest range would be improved by reseeding of the natural
vegetation, seeding of grasses and annual and perennial legumes,
fertilization, planting of forest shrubs and the establishment of
rotational and deferred grazing. Investments for fencing has also been
included in project costs. It is expected that the present low level
productivity of these ranges would be increased 3 to 4 fold. Most
important would also be the control of stocking rates and the organization
of the legitimate pastoralists into grazing associations, who would be
responsible for the maintenance of the improved pastures (para 5.06). Due
to lack of technical local expertise, two man-years of technical assistance
are included in the project (para 5.07) to help with the implementation of
this component.
4.12     Research and Technical Management.  A number of applied research
development efforts will be undertaken by the research division of DEFCS to
provide practical guidelines for the improvement of some forest management
operations. The program would concentrate on;
(i) studies on production and yields cf existing plantations;
(ii) increasing tree volume and growth through genetic improvement,
vegetative propagation, use of feitilizer and improvement of
sylvicultural practices (thinnings, tree spacing, rotations etc.);
and
(iii) technical and economic assessment of improved wood utilization and
its economics, including charcoal making;
4.13     Resource Management.  The research  program would closely monitor
project results and assist in reviewing anc formulating forest management
plans for the project area in Rharb and Manmora with the objective of better
rationalizing forest exploitation by earmarking specific forest areas for
specialized management of plantations for pulpwood for the pulpmill and
other areas for the production of utility timber and other wood demands
(paras 3.05 and 3.07). Although the realization of this goal is a long
term proposition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that a forest
management plan for the project area would be established. The plan would
rationalize land use and fiber production and would introduce specialized
sylvicultural practices adapted to different end uses. The plan would be
available for review by the Bank by December 31, 1983 and would be put into
effect, taking into account the Bank's comments, if any, not later than
June 30, 1984. Disease and insect control have not caused any major
problems in the project area. Although the cork oak has been affected by
the gypsy moth, no serious defoliating problems have been. reported in the
existing eucalyptus plantations. Future pest activity will however be
monitored by the project, and short courses in pest identification and
management control will be introduced by D].FCS in the proposed in-service
training programs.



- 22 -
4.14     Technical Research.  The genetic improvement of eucalyptus can be
considerably increased if propagated by rooted cuttings selected from
exceptionally fast growing parent trees (cloning). However this technique
has one inherent risk in that it has not the genetic diversity which is
important in resisting diseases, drought, frost etc. Vegetative
propagation must therefore be based on a wide range of parent material
stock which is not yet available. The project would continue with the
present technique of propagation from seed, but would at the same time
develop and select a wide range of parent stock so that rooted cuttings on
a large scale can be produced during the latter part of the project
period. Present fertilizer trials in Morocco have indicated a positive
response in the rate of wood fiber production. However the specific rate
and time for optimum fertilizer application together with the resulting
m.a.i. have not yet been determined. The project will therefore continue
these fertilizer trials and carry out economic and biological analysis to
evaluate the precise benefits. The application of fertilizers is not
included in the project, but funds would be allocated to the project area
by Government if the evaluation proves positive and warrants systematic
application of fertilizer. A possible technical alternative to the
proposed mechanical destumping is chemically killing the tree stumps and
planting between the stumps. Although sprouting (coppicing) of the stumps
could thus be eliminated, this technique is as yet untested. Major
questions are insufficiently resolved to warrant recommending this method
such as (i) the number and costs of chemical sprayings and techniques
required to kill the stumps; and (ii) extent of stumps and roots limiting
annual mechanical maintenance operations, and percentage of loss in annual
tree growth in the new planting caused by impediments during root establish-
ment. Since with further research this technique could become a viable
alternative to mechanical destumping in the future, it will be further
studied under the project's applied research program, and possible harmful
ecological side effects monitored.
4.15     Forest Inventory and Planning.  The project would include a forest
resource study based on recent satellite imagery which is considered
necessary for the management and planning of Morocco's forests. It would
be carried out during the first project year and would complement the
National Forest Inventory (para 2.12). In addition, DEFCS's capacity in
photo interpretation and physical planning in the "Division du domaine
forestier" would also be strengthened by providing and training 4
additional staff.
4.16     Technical Assistance.  The project would provide a total of 68
man-months of short-term technical assistance. In addition, two man-years
for long-term consultants would be required to assist in the initial
implementation of the grazing component (para 5.06). Short-term technical
assistance would be made for up to 29 man-months of specialist
consultancies in various areas relating to applied research, nursery
techniques, silvicultural practices and forest management including
preparation and evaluation of bidding documents for the destumping program
(para 4.20), on a needs basis agreed between the Government and the Bank.



- 23 -
In addition the project would provide 39 man-months of consulting services
to assist the project and DEFCS to carry out studies in relation to forest
management plan of the project area (8 man-months) (para 4.13), forest
inventory and planning (8 man-months) (para 4.15), financing and cost
recovery of the sector (6 man-months) (para 7.05), technical manpower and
training requirements of the sector (17 man-nonths) (paras 4.17/18). Draft
terms of references for technical assistance consultants and activities are
given in the project file. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that DEFCS would be responsible for preparing detailed terms of reference
and that all consultants would be employed on terms and conditions and with
experience and qualifications acceptable to the Bank.
4.17     Training.  There is an important need for improving the training
capability of the sector, but a detailed study of training requirements is
needed to devise an effective in-service training program for DEFCS and for
the training of forestry workers and people engaged in small scale wood
iprocessing industries. This study should lead to the formulation of a
subproject which would establish vocational training centers for forest
workers and other related wood production activities for which interest has
already been shown by some donor countries. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that a study on technical manpower and training requirements
covering the scope and detail acceptable to the Bank would be completed no
later than June 30, 1983 and that, after consultation with the Bank, the
findings and recommendations of the study--including particularly the
organization and responsibilities of in-service training for DEFCS--
would be implemented no later than December 31, 1983. Provision has been
made under the project for 28 man months training fellowships for forestry
officers to be utilized in line with the present priorities and the
recommendations to be made by the proposed study.
4.18     The forest economy and research divisions of DEFCS would carry out
a study which would investigate various ways to improve the efficiency of
current harvesting practices and charcoal-making. The study would mainly
rely on the results obtained from monitoring the operations of 2 or 3
groups of forest workers who would be employed by DEFCS under force account
to cut and log some wood lots using improved techniques, undertake the
mechanical splitting of eucalyptus stumps and test the output and
efficiency of some modern charcoal kilns to be introduced by the project.
Although a few forest exploitation and loggiig cooperatives exist in
Morocco they are not yet very efficient and there are none in the project
area. The study would therefore also determine appropriate steps to
establish a forest exploitation and logging cooperative among forest
workers in the region which would include its organization, activities and
financing. If findings of this study are positive one or two pilot logging
cooperatives would be established with the assistance of DEFCS (Division
economique), which has already developed several cooperatives in other
parts of Morocco. This would allow the forestry workers, members of a
cooperative to secure value added through wood product marketing currently
only accruing to their usual employers who a:re predominantly merchants and
money lenders. The establishment of these cooperatives could however only



- 24 -
be promoted realistically once DEFCb has established its capability to
train forest workers in technical and organizational matters. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the study would be completed by December
31, 1983 and sent for review to the bank. After taking into account the
Bank's comments the recommendations of the study will be implemented.
4.19     Administrative and Logistical Support.  The Project would provide
offices at TIFLET and 13 houses for project personnel. In addition 23
light vehicles, seven 5-ton trucks and one grader for forest tracks'
maintenance would be purchased.
C. Project Start-up Activities
4.20     Several project activities would be carried out by the DEFCS prior
to project effectiveness: destumping, raising of seedlings and planting of
the destumped area. Provision has been made for up to US$1.5 million of
retroactive financing for the destumping activities which would take place
between October 1981 and June 1982. Since experience in large scale
mechanized destumping contract operations is lacking, about 1,850 ha of a
total of 20,000 ha will be mechanically destumped in 1981/82 in relatively
small bid packages of 200 ha each so that contractors can demonstrate
mechanized destumping techniques. The written approval for destumping and
plantation reestablishment has been secured for concerned collectivities.
It would also provide the project with more accurate cost estimates of the
different operational approaches and would help to develop more appropriate
technical specifications and contract standards for future international
tenders. The monitoring of these operations will be carried out by the
project manager who is already in place (para 2.29).
D. Project Cost Estimates
4.21     Total estimated project costs during the five-year development
period are estimated at DH 345.0 million (US$65.1 million) of which
DR 145.5 million (U6$27.5 million), or 42% would be foreign exchange. Cost
estimates include an estimated DH 123.6 million of taxes and duties. Base
cost estimates are based on prices obtained during appraisal, updated to
end 1981 prices. Physical contingencies included in the project cost
estimates are 15% for civil works and 10% for equipment and operating
costs. The allowance for expected price increases has been calculated on
both local and foreign base costs plus physical contingencies. Estimated
price increases for local cost are 11% for 1981, 10% for 1982, 9% for 1983
and thereafter and for foreign costs of 9% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% for
1983/85 and 6% for 1986. Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing
basis are estimated at 30% of total costs, or 44% of baseline costs. The
average costs of consultant services are estimated at US$10,000 per
man-month (including travel and subsistence). Details of projects costs
are presented in Annex 1, Table 1 and summarized below:

years, including a 4-year grace period, at the interest rate prevailing at
the time of board presentation. Retroactive financing in an aggregate
amount not exceeding Ub$1.5 million would be authorized for the destumping

4.25     Disbursements for Categories I to III would be made after receipt
of full documentation. No disbursements would be made for nursery
establishment, pastoral improvements and research or for tree planting and
road maintenance which is mainly carried out by small private contractors
or on force account. An estimated schedule of disbursements is summarized
below and detailed in Annex 1, Table 2. The schedule of disbursements is
based on actual disbursements of Bank projects in Morocco.

Cumulative            3.5      7,8    13.0    18.5    25.5   27.5
G. Procurement
4.26     Procurement would be carried out by DEFCS under the direction of
the project manager. In accordance with Moroccan administrative
procedures, final procurement choices would be approved by DEFCS for
contracts up to DH 500,000 (approx. US$100,000), whereas contracts
exceeding DH 500,000 would be referred to the Minister of MARA for
approval. Project works would be undertaken by private contractors for
mechanical destumping, tree planting, road development and other civil
works. Nursery establishment, pastoral improvement, research including
improvements on wood utilization wouiu generally bc undertaken by DEFCS
itself by force account.
4.27     The largest contracts would be those related to mechanical
destumping amounting to a total of US$32 million and road development
valued at a total of Ub$5 million.  Except :or the 1,850 ha of destumping
carried out in 1981 (para 4.20), destumping contracts would be made on the
basis of international competitive bidding CICB) in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Since experience has shown on existing Bank-financed projects
that small road construction contracts do not attract foreign road
contractors, due to the competitiveness of Local road contractors and high
mobilization costs for foreign road contracl:ors in respect to the
relatively small size of contracts, road construction would be carried out
by local competitive bidding (LCB) for contiracts below US$2.0 million, in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. However, foreign
contractors are not precluded from LCB bidding. Contracts for roads over
US$2.0 million, would be awarded on the basis of ICB. It is expected that
only one contract may exceed US$2.0 million. The others would be less
because of the scattered location of the wo:rks. Construction of houses and
buildings, which are scattered throughout the project area, valued at
US$1.2 million would be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures. Sufficient
number of construction firms both local and foreign are established in
Morocco to assure competitive prices for civil works. Other project
works; nursery establishment, planting operations and maintenance
including road maintenance, fire protection, research and pastoral
activities, would be individually small, with works scattered throughout
the project area and generally not suitable for ICB. All these works for
which the Bank is making no disbursements, valued at US$17.7 million would
involve a large number of contracts, each not exceeding US$150,000 which
would be handled by LCB or on force account arrangements depending on local
conditions and type of work involved.
4.28     Procurement of vehicles and equipment valued at US$2.0 million
would be on the basis of LCB. However, wheniever practical, procurement



- 28 -
will be grouped to form bid packages exceeding US$150,000, in which case
award of contract will be made under ICB.
4.29     Contracts for 92 man months of technical assistance by consultants
with a total value of US$1.0 million would be awarded in accordance with
procedures for international recruitment acceptable to the Bank (Bank
guidelines of August 1981) and employed on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank. The remaining project costs valued at US$5.7 mainly
consisting of operating cost and local staff and fellowship, would not lend
themselves to bidding procedures and would be committed in accordance with
prudent established practice.
4.30     Contract Review.  All bidding packages for civil works estimated
to cost over US$500,000 equivalent and bidding packages for goods over
US$150,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation resulting in a coverage of about 80% of the total
estimated value of work and goods contracts. The balance of contracts
would be subject to random post review by the bank after contract award.
H. Accounts, Audit and keports
Accounts and Audits
4.31     The accounting system presently in use within DEFCS is adequate.
The Project Management Unit (PMU) will keep separate accounts for the
Project, maintained in accordance with acceptable accounting principles, to
reflect the operations and financial position of the Project. The staff of
the PMJ would include an accountant to maintain the Project accounts, under
the direct supervision of DEFCS chief accountant. The Project's internal
accounting and control system would provide for the recording and reporting
of project-related financial transactions and for compilation and control
of supporting documents for disbursement requests against Bank Loan.
4.32     The existing system of financial control and audit of governmental
bodies is satisfactory. Although ministries and other public institutions
have a substantial autonomy in the physical implementation of their
programs, the Ministry of Finance tightly controls their financial
commitments, transactions and accounts. Two officials of the Ministry of
Finance - an account officer and a financial controller - are responsible
to oversee the financial operations undertaken by a particular Government
Service Department. The financial controller reviews all proposed
contracts and must countersign them before they can take effect. The
account officer maintains records of financial operations of the Service
Department and prepares monthly reports. He also prepares end-of-year
financial statements which are certified by a senior Finance Ministry
Controller. These arrangements would be adopted for the Project.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that separate accounts for project
works would be maintained by PMU and would be audited by the Ministry of
Finance. A detailed report of such audit would be submitted to the Bank
within six months after the end of each fiscal year.

I.  Environmenta> Impact
4.33     The project plantations would have a beneficial environmental
impact in that they would maintain areas under forest cover, thereby
preserving an important watershed, minimize soil erosion and provide a
secure environment for the protection of wild life in the project area.
The forests would also provide a recreational outlet for both urban and
rural populations. In addition the project would improve the area's
ecosystem by integrating forest plantations with livestock grazing.
V. Project Implementation
A. Organization and Management
5.01     MARA, through its Forestry Directorate (DEFCS) would have the
primary responsibility for the overall execution of the Project (Chart).
The management and the supervision of technical operations of the project
would be carried out by a Project Management Unit (PMU) which would be
established in Rabat and directly responsible to the director of DEFCS.
Physical implementation of the plantation and pasture development programs
would be carried out by provincial forestry staff (para 5.05). Draft terms
of reference for the PMU are in the project file. During negotiations the
bank was informed that the PMU was established. In addition, 4 key staff
members of the PMU, the project manager, the deputy project manager, and
the two project accountants were appointed. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the PMU will continue to be staffed at all times by a
project manager, deputy project manager and accountant, with qualifications
and experience acceptable to the bank. To assist in the smooth running of
the project's technical operations, a Technical Coordinating Committee
would be convened regularly consisting of the existing five departmental
heads oi DEFCb, the two Provincial Forestry Officers (Khemisset and
K6nitra) and Head of the Rural Affairs Division of MOI. The director of
DEFCS would be the chairman, and the project manager the secretary of the
committee, which would meet quarterly. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.
5.02     MOI, as guardian of collective laads and tutor of the rural
communes would play a major role in organizing the participation of the
people in forestry and pastoral development and in helping develop the
administrative and legislative instruments of the forestry subsector.
MOI's assistance in this would be secured through its participation in the
project's Technical Committee and existing forestry Councils. Assistance
in project coordination and arbitration, particularly in respect to
improved forest legislation, would also be sought through the existing
National Forestry Council (para 2.20) which meets at least once a year and
is already responsible for coordinating programs and budgets relating to
forestry and pastoral development and for defining forest policy. The
Director of DEFCb provides permanent secre:arial services for this Council.



- 30 -
5.03     At the provincial level (Kenitra and Khemisset), assistance in
project coordination would be carried out by the existing Provincial
Forestry Council (para 2.20) under the chairmanship of the Governor. The
Council meets when necessary, but at least twice a year, in March and
September. The Council would be particularly useful for the project in
rationalizing and regulating the people's participation including the
commune's budgets concerning the project plantation and pastoral
activities, and in testing the practicality of proposals to be made in the
study discussed in para 7.05.
5.04     Equally important, particularly for the grazing aspects affecting
the state land plantations, would be at local level the Communal Council
(para 2.20). The Communal Council plays an important role in representing
the communes in the forest exploitation committees, which are directed by
DEFCS and responsible for the sale by auction of the woodlots on State or
collective land. In addition, the Council plays a major role in assisting
DEFCS in the organization of forest range improvement programs.
5.05     Plantation Management.  The Provincial forestry services of DEFCS
(para 2.21) in Kenitra and Khemisset would implement the plantation
program. PMU would coordinate and plan through the Provincial forestry
officer all the project's plantation operations and planting material
requirements, but the actual implementation and daily supervision would be
carried out through provincial forestry staff in the project area. The
staff in the project area is divided into five forestry subdivisions (4 in
K6nitra and 1 in Khemisset) which are headed by forest officers. Each
subdivision is further divided in districts and subdistricts which are
staffed by junior forestry staff. After the annual plantation program is
jointly agreed by PMU and senior Provincial forestry officers, it would be
the responsibility of the deputy project manager to monitor the project
plantation program. In addition he would be responsible for improving the
technical standards of silvicultural practices in the project area by
providing on the job training to forestry staff.
5.06     Pastoral Management.  Existing legislation provides the necessary
framework for the implementation of pastoral improvements to be made under
the project. The Dahir of 1917 recognizes the tribal grazing rights on
State land and the right of DEFCS to limit the stocking rate to the grazing
capacity of the forest range. Implementation decrees provide for the
creation of local commissions composed of representatives of the technical
services, the local authorities and the tribes concerned to identify
rightholders, fix stocking rates and adopt plans for pastoral
improvements. A newly proposed law ("relative a la creation de perimetres
d'amelioration pastorale dans les forats domaniales") sets out in detail
the rights and duties of the Government and the beneficiaries including
subsidies and cost recovery arrangements is now before the Parliament for
approval. When adopted it will apply to the project. In the meantime the
project will follow cost recovery procedures outlined in para 7.06.
Pastoral improvements including the organization of grazing associations
which would plan and control the use of the improved pasture land would be
subject to a preceding socioeconomic study of the area.



- 31 -
5.07     kange improvement activities, primarily based on the findings of
the UINDP/FAO project (para 3.12), would be carried out by DEFCS under the
project. An experienced range management Dfficer would be employed for 2
years to plan and supervise the operations of a small team (5) of forestry
field staff and to carry out on the job training of Moroccan forestry
staff. The range improvement team would work closely with the Communal
Council (para 5.04) and the Collectivities involved and would be
responsible for organizing the local commissions (para 5.06) and grazing
associations to be established under the project. Funds have been included
in the project for equipment and operating costs of the team, including
funds for international recruitment of the range management officer (para
4.11) since Morocco has only a few people trained at technical and
professional levels in range-management.
b. Staffing
5.08     Apart from the small number of project staff to be recruited for
PMU, some additional forestry staff at Provincial level would also have to
be recruited. Presently there are about 8 senior and junior forestry
officers, and 58 junior forestry technicians working in the project area.
The additional Provincial forestry staff required to carry out the proposed
program would require 1 senior and 3 junior forestry officers and about 10
junior forestry technicians. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
the range management specialist (para 5.07) would be appointed no later
than January 31, 1983 and the additional provincial forestry staff would be
in position as and when required.
C. Monitoring and EvaLuation (M&E)
5.09     h&E of the physical targets related to plantation development
would continue to be the responsibility of DEFCS but would be assited by
PMU. Specifically, parameters for the mechanical destumping operations and
numerous manual and mechanized plantation operations, including growth rate
and yield, would be monitored both by project staff and DEFCS research
unit. This should greatly benefit the plarning and implementation of the
additional large scale forest plantation programs elsewhere in the
country. M&E of project's pastoral activities would be carried out by PMU
in conjunction with the "Division du domairne forestier" of DEFCS which is
responsible for pastoral improvements.
5.10     Monitoring of the fiscal matters relating to forest exploitation
in the forestry sector would continue to bE the responsibility of the
Division d'economie forestiere of DEFCS. M&E of the project's pilot wood
exploitation and utilization study (para. 4.19) would be a combined effort
between this Division, DEFCS research department and PMU.
5.11     Semi-annual evaluation and progress reporting of project
activities would be the responsibility of EMU. The reports would be
submitted to the National Forestry Council and to the Bank at the latest
two months after each semester end. DEFCS would prepare a project



- 32 -
completion report within six months of the closing of the Loan. Details of
the contents of these reports including specific performance indicators to
be submitted to the Bank along with formats for presenting information,
would be discussed and reviewed during early Bank supervision missions.
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
VI. Production, Marketing and Prices
A. Production
6.01     Wood production from the plantations would begin following the
project investment period according to rotation lengths and yields given in
para 4.08. The estimated wood production with and without project over
project's 35 year life is as follow;

B. Market Prospects
6.02     Domestic demand for all categories of wood products other than
wood pulp, considerably exceeds Morocco's production potential and no
difficulty is foreseen in marketing the project's output of utility and
industrial timber and fuelwood aimed at domestic consumption (para 2.10).
6.03     In respect to the project's main output - pulpwood for the
production of bleached hardwood sulfate pulp (blHwSa) - this will be
totally absorbed by the pulpmill at Sidi Yahia. The marketing of the
mill's production of pulp on domestic and international markets is also
foreseen to present no difficulty. According to FAO estimates, Morocco
paper and paperboard consumption is projected to increase at an average
rate of 5.5% p.a., reaching 260,000 tons in 1990 and 440,000 tons in 2000.
Domestic demand for paper products will create a strong derived demand for
the mill's woodpulp production by domestic paper manufacturers. Prospects
for exports are also favorable. The mill is well established in European
markets (Germany, England and France) where it has long-term contracts with



- 33 -
buyers for about 65% of its exported production, the remaining 35% being
sold on the spot market. According to FAO forecasts, world's paper and
paperboard consumption will increase from 171 million tons in 1979 up to
337 million tons in 1994. Consumption in Europe is projected to increase
from 45 million tons up to 73 million tons during the same period, a 3.5%
p.a. rate of growth. As a consequence, world consumption of white chemical
pulp is expected to increase from 52 million tons in 1980 up to 67 million
in 1990 - an average rate of increase of 2.8% p.a. -, of which that of
blHwSa (the type produced by the mill) from 17 million tons up to 25
million tons, an increase of 4% p.a.
6.04     The Western European paper and paperboard industry is expected to
rely increasingly on outside sources of white pulp: a minimum of 3.5
million tons of net imports by Western Europe /1 are foreseen in 1990
compared with 3 million tons in 1980. Being already established in the
European market and having transport cost advantage over other main
non-European exporters of BlHwSa (USA, Brazil), Moroccan incremental
production (17,000 ADT/year) should be easily absorbed by the European
paper industry. Moreover, if the establishment of proposed new pulping
capacities elsewhere in the world is considerably delayed, as is the case
in Latin America, a global deficit might develop in wood white pulp markets
by 1990. Thus, no problems are foreseen in marketing the mill's output.
C. Price:3
6.05     Auction price of tree stands.  DEFCS sells tree stands of
specified standing wood volume at public auctions (para 2.13). Auction
prices depend on the prices of end-wood products, and on whether the stand
is to be clearfelled or also to be destumped. In 1981, average auction
prices in Morocco and in the project's area were DH 45/m3 o.b. for
eucalyptus/2 stands to be clearfelled, DH 30/m3 o.b. for eucalyptus
stands to be clearfelled and destumped, Dli 125/m3 o.b. for pine
stands/3 and DH 150/m3 ob for acacia stands. On the basis of the
projected evolution of wood products' prices (see below), future auction
prices of eucalyptus stands are expected *:o increase at 1% p.a. in real
terms until 1990, then remain constant; that of pine stands to grow at 3%
p.a. in real terms until 1990 then remain constant; and that of acacia
stands to remain constant in real terms during the entire project period.
6.06     Eucalyptus Pulpwood.  The Sidi Yahia mill is the only buyer of
pulpwood in Morocco. By a convention signed with the Government in 1973,
the DEFCS guaranteed the mill annual deliveries of 345,000 m3 u.b. of wood
/1 Including Scandinavian countries and Portugal.
/2 Eucalyptus Camaldulensis
/3 Pinus Pinaster (thinnings)



- 34 -
to reach the production capacity of 100,000 ADT/year of pulp. The pulpwood
price is indexed to that of European prices of bleached hardwood sulfate
pulp and revised in October every year. In October 1980, the average
millgate pulpwood price for the 1980/81 campaign was set at DH 75/m3
u.b. Li In October 1981, based on average European pulp prices of
US$530/ADT over the last year and also because of the appreciation of the
US dollar vis a vis the Moroccan dirham, the average mill gate price of
eucalyptus pulpwood is expected to reach around DH 129/m3 u.b. Average
prices in the following years have been assumed to follow the evolution of
European pulp prices and to increase in real terms by 0.5% annually until
1990, to DH 131/m3 u.b. in 1985 and DH 134/m3 u.b. in 1990.
6.07     Wood pulp.  In 1980, average CIF Europe price for the Sidi Yahia
eucalyptus pulp was US$ 500/ADT, selling at a US$ 35/ADT discount
relatively to premium Bleached Softwood Sulfate pulp. In June 1981, it was
US$530/ADT. In the long-term, woodpulp prices are projected to rise at .25
to .50% p.a. in real terms. The price of Bleached Softwood Sulfate pulp in
international markets is projected to be in the range of US$ 555-570/ADT in
1985 and of US$ 560-585/ADT in 1990 (in 1980 US$). Moroccan Bleached
Hardwood Sulfate pulp has been projected to sell for US$ 520/ADT and US$
530/ADT (1980 US$) in 1985 and 1990 respectively. In the short-term,
market imbalances between demand and supply due to business cycle
fluctuations and discrete jumps in production capacity are expected to
induce, as in the past, substantial international price fluctuations. The
domestic price of pulp is regulated and set annually by the government. In
1981, it was DH 2,460/ADT, identical to the export (F.O.B.) price of US$465
(DH 2,465) per ADT. It is expected that this price will remain constant in
real terms.
6.08     Poles.  Eucalyptus and acacia pole production of the Project's
region is the most important in the country. In 1981, average wholesale
prices were around DH 180/m3 u.b., up from DH 70/m3 u.b. in 1974 (a 16%
p.a. rate of increase). However, the demand for poles is fairly inelastic
and the increased Project production would moderate price increases.
Future pole prices have been assumed to remain constant in real terms.
6.09     Pine Timber.  In spite of import tariffs of around 10% and other
import restrictions (para 2.03), Morocco imports more than 80% of its
requirements in coniferous sawlogs, sawnwood, poles and pit-prop and
domestic prices closely follow international prices. Because of depressed
conditions in housing industries in major developing countries, forecasts
for real price of coniferous products call for a stagnation in 1981,
followed by a moderate increase of 2% p.a. until 1990 as major countries'
economies recover. Over the recent years, CIF values increase more than
FOB values, reflecting increasing freight rates. This trend is likely to
/3 Based on European hardwood sulfate pulp prices of about US$390/ADT and
an exchange rate of US$1 = DH 4.2.



- 35 -
continue. Therefore, real prices of coniferous wood products in Morocco
have been projected to remain constant in 1981, grow at 3% p.a. until 1990
then remain constant.
6.10     Fuelwood.  Most fuelwood from legaL cuttings is transformed
on-site into charcoal to be sold in Morocco's main urban centers. The
rural population hardly buys any fuelwood but cuts for itself what is
necessary for domestic consumption. Therefore prices are mostly determined
by demand-supply interactions in the urban areas.  Since 1977, average
wholesale prices of charcoal have increased at 14% p.a. in current terms
(5% in real terms) reaching DR 70/quintal ia 1981. Future prices of
fuelwood have been assumed to increase at the same rate as that projected
for petroleum products; 3.5% p.a. in real terms until 1990, then remain
constant.
VII. Financial Arnalysis
A. Cost Recovery and Financing of the Sector
7.01     At current unit auction prices and plantations yields, sales
revenues of plantations to be established under the project would cover
about 60% of plantations' establishment and maintenance costs. It is
Government's objective to increase this low recovery rate and possibly
achieve full recovery of plantations' replacement costs (para 7.02). In
addition, only a small percentage of forest revenues are at present being
reinvested in reforestation and the bulk of reforestation programs has to
be financed through budgetary allocation (Fara 7.04). Accordingly an other
major Government's objective is to establish appropriate institutional
mechanisms to ensure a higher level of sector self-financing. Both these
issues will be addressed by the project.
7.02     kecovery of Plantation Establishment and Maintenance Costs for
Project Plantations. Auction revenues, plantation establishment and
maintenance costs and cost recovery coefficients were calculated for the
various types of plantations to be undertaken under the Project.   Cost
recovery coefficients are summarized below;

because of increases in real unit prices and an expected increase in forest
plantation productivity through increased yields (from 5 to 12 m3
o.b./ha) and quality (through introduction of improved stand management and
harvesting techniques), revenues from plantations established under the
project are expected to increase substantially. At a 10% discount rate,
overall recovery of total plantation costs is estimated to improve from a
current 60 to 97%. This discount rate, however, does not take into account
non-quantifiable positive externalities of reforestation. Because of the
existing competition among the project area's 350 loggers participating in
woodlot auctions it is estimated that the expected auction prices would be
close to the maximum which can be collected by DEFCS and that the projected
97% plantation cost recovery therefore approximates maximum achievable
recovery percentage under the project. Auction prices and cost recovery
would be closely monitored by DEFCS on the basis of stumpage values of the
different species. Since these values have yet never been systematically
assessed (para 2.17), the Government would review in consultation with the
bank before June 30, 1983 the present stumpage rates of its wood resources
for the monitoring of base prices at woodlots auctioning. On this basis
woodlots fetching too low bid prices would be taken out of the auction.
This information would also be used for the study on forestry subsector
financing (para 7.05). Assurances to this effect were obtained at
negotiations.

Beneficiaries of Sales Proceeds and Government's Cost Recovery
7.03     Of the 30,000 ha plantations to be established under the Project,
19,000 ha would be on state land and 11,000 ha would be on collective
land. In both cases, cost of plantation establishment and maintenance is
borne by the Government, through FNF for plantations on collective lands
and through budgetary allocations for those on state land
(paras 2.18-2.19). however, sales revenues from plantations on collective
land are shared between Government and collectivities. Plantation cost
recovery procedures by Government are explained in para 2.16.  At a 10%
discount rate, although Government's estinmated cost recovery from
plantations on collective land is relatively low at 58%., plantation
establishment and maintenance costs on state land are expected to be
recovered at more than 95% (assuming that total Government recovery is
comprised of both central and local communal Government, as communal forest
revenues are substituting Government's payments to local Government
budgets). For the project as a whole, it has been estimated that
Government would recover nearly 80% of tot:al project plantation costs.

7.05     To increase the level of sector automatic self-financing, several
options can be envisaged among which (i) an increase of FNF ad valorem tax;
(ii) an increase in the percentage of the forest revenues communes are
required to reinvest in the subsector; (iii) the imposition of an interest
rate on FNF advances for forest establishment on collective and private
land; (iv) the recovery by FNF of establishment and maintenance costs for
plantation established on state land; and (v) a tax on wood imports whose
proceeds would accrue to FNF. For example, an increase of FNF tax from 10
to 20% of forest products' basic auction price would nearly double the Fund
revenues and therefore the size of plantation programs it finances. For
plantations established under the project, it would increase the proportion
of funds recovered by the Government which are automatically earmarked for
reinvestment in the Forestry subsector (para. 7.04) from 34% to 40% at a
10% discount rate. Feasibility and financial, legal and social
implications of these alternatives will be the object of the study on

Mlorocco's forestry subsector financing tLs be undertaker. by the Proieci:
(para 4.17). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that DEFCS would
undertake a study regarding Morocco's future forestry subsector financing,
according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and to be
completed by December 31, 1983, which would study the forest revenues
sharing between FNF, communes and collectivities and make proposals for
future policy and forest legislation which would more adequately bring
about automatic self-financing of the sector. After consultation with the
bank, the findings and recommendations of the study would be implemented no
later than June 30, 1984.
7.06     Cost kecovery of Pastoral Improvements.  Existing legislation
requires the payment of a tax for the use of state-owned forest rangeland
(Decree of January 15, 1921). Herds required for family subsistence are
exempt. The numbers of tax-exempted animals per family and the amount of
the tax are fixed each year by the DEFCS. At present such taxes are not
systematically collected in the project area mainly because of weak
administrative and technical support. Under the Project, this will not be
the case with all the supporting services provided (para 5.07). The local
commission (para 5.06) would determine the stocking rates, based on the
potential of the range and the size of herd needed for family subsistence
exempt from taxes. On the basis of that information, DEFCS would determine
the annual grazing fee required from the taxable flock to recover all
operation and maintenance costs and as much of the investments as possible
taking into account the ability of the beneiiciaries to repay. DEFCS would
furthermore ensure that grazing associations and sylvopastoral development
plans would be set up by the end of 1985 in accordance with a time-schedule
acceptable to the bank so as to cover the entire forest range to be
improved under the project. Assurances to t:hat effect were obtained at
negotiations.
B. Financial Assessment of Plantation Investments

The Net Present Value (at 10% discount rate) of benefits received by
collectivities for one hectare of eucalyptus plantation is about DH 3,700,
i.e., an average annual net revenue of (1981) DH 370/ha. The only possible
alternative use of the land would be as rangeland. Under the region's
climatic conditions, (400 to 600 mm of rainfall) fodder production of
rangeland would be about 200 Feed Units per ha, corresponding to a maximum
net benefit from livestock of about DH 100/ha/1.
VIII. Benefits and Justification
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
8.01     The direct quantifiable benefits of the proposed project would
arise from an increase in the production of pulpwood, other industrial wood
and fuelwood. The project would allow the pulpmill at Sidi Yahia to work
at full capacity, increasing its annual output from 83,000 ADT up to
100,000 ADT of pulp, which would help to earn an estimated (1981) US$190
million of foreign exchange in export earnings over a 30 year period
(Ub$i6.3 million per year). It would provide about 470,000 m3 of
industrial coniferous wood, substituting for imports and representing about
(1981) Ub$55 million in foreign exchange over the same period. The
production of tanning bark would also substitute for Morocco's imports.
Finally, the Project would produce about 2,600,000 m3 of fuelwood, an
average of 72,000 m3 per year. This average annual fuelwood production,
transformed into charcoal, is equivalent to 3,500 tons of Liquified
Petroleum Gas for household use which would cost Morocco about US$1.4
million in imports (1981 prices). It is also equivalent to about 1% of the
country's estimated annual consumption of fuelwood.
8.02     Over the five-year implementation period, the project is expected
to generate about 7,100 man-years of direct employment for unskilled labor
and about 1,000 man-years of skilled and semi-skilled labor. A large part
of the employment created would therefore provide unskilled job
opportunities and would benefit the poorer workers in the region. Over the
life of the project and with present practices and techniques, the logging
of project incremental wood production would provide about 14,000 man-years
of labor and its charcoaling another 10,400 man-years to local forestry
workers, most of whom are underemployed and have annual incomes around or
below the country's absolute poverty level of US$270 per capita (1980). In
addition, loading and hauling of incremental wood production would generate
about 3,700 man-years of employment.
8.03     The project would also increase the forest revenues of
collectivities and communes within its boundaries. The research, and
technical assistance components would make an important contribution to the
Government's institution building effort. In particular, the study of
legal and financial aspects of the sector would allow the Government to
adopt and implement policies to promote more effectively the development of
the forestry subsector. Finally, the pasture improvement component would

livestock management.



- 41 -
compensate local population for fodder lost through reforestation of tracts
of lands they used for grazing. It would aLso introduce rational methods
of range management.
B. Economic AnaLysis
8.04     The overall economic rate of retura (ERk) of the project is
estimated at 20% /1. benefits have been measured as the incremental
value of wood production, valued at economi- price.  Costs include
investment and incremental operating costs, also valued at economic
prices. Economic prices revalue those outputs or inputs tradable on world
markets at border prices adjusted for transport, handling and processing in
Morocco. Outputs and inputs that are not tradable on world markets have
been valued at their marginal economic valuas for project purposes.
Unskilled labor was priced at its estimated opportunity cost (66% of market
wages) and skilled labor at full domestic wages, adjusted to border prices
through the Standard Conversion Factor for aon-traded goods (.71).
Separate ERRs have been calculated for each type of plantation to be
undertaken and are given below.
Economic Rates of Return (%)

Total Plantations                                             22
The high ERK  on plantations established under the project in comparison
with the financial rate of return para (7.07) are due to the high tax
component included in domestic prices of equipment and machinery (50% of
base price) used for project operations (particularly mechanical
destumping), and the importance of unskilled labor costs in total
plantation maintenance and protection costs. For eucalyptus plantations
established after destumping this difference is compounded by the fact that
the economic cost of destumping (around DH 4,400/ha) is more than offset by
the high economic value of stumps recovered and used as fuelwood (DH
4,600/ha). ERR's of the project and the various types of plantations were
computed (i) for an economic value of fueluood at 50% of its estimated
value; and (ii) without including the economic value of stumps in the
project benefits streams. They are given below:
/1 This includes all project costs. However, some unquantifiable benefits
(research, training, soil protection, cther environmental benefits) are
not included in this calculation.

8.05     The project's high Economic kate of Return suggested a possible
mutually exclusive alternative to the project. Because of the nature of
the region's soils, the only alternative use of the land would be as
rangeland. An alternative to the project would be to clearfell and destump
the 20,000 ha of old eucalyptus plantations as envisaged in the project,
then use them as rangeland. The ERR of the difference between net benefit
streams of the two alternatives is 12% in favor of the proposed forestry
project. However, the only alternative to the Project likely to be
implemented by the Government (on financial rather than economic grounds)
would to be to clearfell the 20,000 ha and use them as rangeland without
recovering the stumps (the estimated financial cost of destumping is about
DH 5,500/ha and the current sales value of stumps of DH 1,000/ha). In this
case, the ERk of the difference between the net benefit streams of the two
alternatives is even greater (22%) in favor of the proposed forestry
project.
C. Project Risks and Sensitivity Tests
8.06     No major or unusual technical risks threaten the success of the
proposed project. Normal risks of fire in the semi-arid zone plantations,
and of pathogens, have been adequatly dealt with in project design and
provisions have been made to assure adequate protection. The plantation
establishment technologies proposed have been used in several Mediterranean
and other countries with success under similar semi-arid conditions.
8.07     Delays in implementation, cost overruns and lower than expected
production are the most likely risks to achieving the Project's objectives
and ERR. Switching values for project's critical variables are given below:

The most critical variable is the yield to be achieved per hectare of
plantation. A 30% decrease, other things remaining as expected, would
reduce the Project' Economic Rate of Return Lo 10%. However, such a
decrease in yields is unlikely, as projected yields are conservative and
already take into account foreseeable technical and managerial constraints
to plantation establishment and maintenance.
8.08     Sensitivity tests were performed to assess the impact of these
critical variables on the project's outcome;
(i)  for the Project as a whole, a 10% decrease in benefits would
reduce the economic rate of return to 17%, a 20% decrease to 13%.
A two-year delay to 12%, a 20% increase in plantation
establishment and maintenance costs to 14%; and
(ii) for different types of plantations, the same sensitivity tests as
above for critical variables will affect to a lesser extent the
eucalyptus plantations (whose ERR w.uld remain above 13% in all
cases) and acacia plantations (none below 14X). For pine
plantations the ERk is estimated to fall to 11% for a 20% increase
in establishment and maintenance costs, to 10% for a 20% decrease
in benefits and to 9% for a 2-year lelay in benefits.
For all types of plantations, a most critical variable is a delay in
expected benefits. A two year delay is equivalent to a 20% drop in
iexpected benefits. This underlines the importance of strong project
management to coordinate project's activities and minimize delays between
felling, destumping and planting operations.
IX. Nlajor Agreements reached at Negotiations
9.01     During negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(i)   A forest management plan would be introduced in the project area
as discussed in para 4.13;
(ii)   a study on technical manpower and training requirements in scope
and detail acceptable to the Bank would be submitted to the Bank
no later than June 30, 1983 and the findings and recommendations
including proposals regarding organization and responsibilities of
in-service training for DEFC6 would be implemented not later than
December 31, 1983 (para 4.17);
(iii)   a study would be made to improve harvesting techniques and
charcoal making and determine the appropriate steps to be taken to
establish a forest exploitation and logging cooperative among
forest workers which would be submitted to the Bank not later than
December 31, 1983. The recommendations of the study would be
implemented after taking account the comments of the Bank (para
4.18);
(iv)   to assist PMU in the coordination of the project's technical
operations, a technical coordinating committee would regularly
convene at least quarterly (para 5.01);



- 44 -
(v)   the forest range specialist would have been appointed no later
than January 31, 1983 and additional provincial project staff
required for the project would be in position as and when required
(para 5.08);
(iv)   Government would review, in consultation with the Bank before June
30, 1983, the present stumpage rates of its wood resources as
discussed in para 7.02;
(vii)   DEFCS would complete a study regarding the subsector's future
financing mechanisms before December 31, 1983 and that after
consultation and exchange of views with the Bank the
recommendations will be implemented not later than June 30, 1984
as discussed in para 7.05; and
(viii)   DEFCb would adopt grazing charges for forest range, establish
grazing associations and prepare sylvopastoral plans according to
an agreed time schedule as discussed in para 7.06.
9.02     With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$27.5 million.
