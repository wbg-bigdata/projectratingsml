INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A RICE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$6.9 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a project for Rice Development.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Association has previously made two credits to Mali, both for
transport. A summary statement regarding these credits to Mali is given in
Annex 1.
3.        The $9.1 million credit of 1966 (95-MLI) was for railway rehabil-
itation. The original project is now completed. However, the Association
has agreed that savings of $530,000 under the credit be used for an exten-
sion of the project by track renewal on an additional 26 km. The closing
date, originally June 30, 1970, was first postponed to December 31, 1971
and, in view of the extension of the project, has now been postponed to
December 31, 1972. Performance under the Credit has not been fully satis-
factory. In particular, the Railway's financial situation has remained
precarious. Most of the forward:[ng business on the Railway is handled by
two private agencies who often are not paid regularly by their clients (pre-
dominantly public enterprises) with resulting defaults on the agencies'
payments to the Railway. Furthermore, the Government has not reimbursed
the Railway for past deficits and has not provided funds to ensure repayment
on debts to the Senegal Railway as originally agreed. However, action
is now being taken to settle debts and improve the financial situation.
The $7.7 million credit of 1970 (197-MLI) for a Highway Maintenance project
is being implemented in cooperation, for the first time, with the International
Labor Organization (ILO). Execution of this project is proceeding satisfac-
torily, except for a two-month delay in the highway preinvestment studies.
A number of measures have now been taken to strengthen the consultant team
so as to overcome the present difficulties.
4.        The proposed credit, which would be the first Bank Group assistance
for agriculture in Mali, is also the first of two operations due to be pre-
sented to the Executive Directors during this fiscal year. The second proj-
ect would be a small telecommunications project. Project preparation is
underway in various fields. In particular, projects for livestock, railways
and highway rehabilitation may be ready for consideration in FY1973.



PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        A report on "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Mali"
(AW-30a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 6, 1971
(R71-265). A Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex 2.
6.        Mali is a large land-locked country, extending from the center of
the Sahara in the north into the savannah-type open forest regions along its
southern border. Nearly 40 percent of its total area is desert; another 40
percent is usable for extensive livestock production leaving only 20 percent
suitable for rainfed agriculture and for irrigated agriculture along the
Niger River. With a per capita GDP of only about $55, Mali is one of the
poorest countries in Africa. It has no known mineral resources that are
economically exploitable, while development of manufacturing industries
is limited by the small local market, absence of raw materials and the unfavor-
able geographic location. Thus agriculture and livestock, accounting for
90 percent of total employment and 50 percent of GDP, is Mali's main source
of economic growth and foreign exchange earnings.
7.        Following independence in 1960, Mali embarked on an ambitious pro-
gram to modernize and develop its economy along socialist lines. A consid-
erable number of state enterprises, mostly in manufacturing, trade, and
transport were established, while at the same time the activities of pri-
vate merchants were severely limited and comprehensive price controls in-
troduced. Despite heavy investments, production showed little response as
price incentives were inadequate. Excessive central bank financing covering
large public sector deficits combined with poor rural production to create
large balance of payments deficits. In face of these problems the Government
devalued the Mali franc by 50 percent in March 1968. At the same time Mali
rejoined the French monetary zone, under which France guarantees the converti-
bility of the Mali franc and covers most of the current budget deficits as
well as providing considerable capital assistance.
8.        After the November 1968 militarv take-over, several measures were
taken to redress the economic situation: key farm prices were increased and
private trade was liberalized. Moreover, a new investment code was adopted
to attract foreign capital and a comprehensive review of state enterprises
was initiated to improve their financial situation and reduce their technical
and managerial difficulties. These measures were fully endorsed by the 1969
Bank mission which also identified the need for further liberalization of
prices and marketing, reduction of the balance of payments deficit, balanc-
ing of the current budget, rescheduling of external debt, and more thorough
measures to improve the efficiency of state enterprises.
9.         Over the last three years, the Government has made considerable pro-
gress towards reducing the balance of payments deficit from 6-7 percent of GDP
in 1968 and 1969 to little over 1 percent in 1970. This was achieved partially
through an increase in exports stimulated by more attractive producer prices
for groundnuts and cotton and by increased availability of imported goods as



- 3 -
a result of trade liberalization. Even more important, however, was the sub-
stantial improvement in private capital flows as a result of rising confid-
ence in the stability of the Malian economy and the more liberal orientation
of government policies, which prompted a sizeable repatriation of capital.
For the first time in many years, the balance of payments for 1970 registered
a substantial net inflow of private capital and transfers exceeding 4 percent
of GDP. This trend can be expected to continue, albeit at a somewhat lower
level.
10.       Conversely, the public finance situation has improved only little
over the last three years. Continuous rapid expansion of the civil service
has resulted in a sharp increase in the government wage bill, far above the
growth of budget revenues and of the economy. As a result, the current budg-
et still shows a sizeable deficit. Although revenues have increased somewhat
faster than current expenditures in 1970, it is unlikely that the current
budget can be balanced within the next few years, thus leaving the Govern-
ment dependent, in diminishing amounts, on French budget subsidies.
11.       The difficult financial situation of most state enterprises adds
to the serious drain on public resources. Partly as a result of unsatisfac-
tory management but primarily because of Government's pricing policies, these
enterprises are operating at a substantial deficit, which has to be covered
by treasury advances and short term borrowing from the Central Bank. The
Government's recent decision to allow these companies to increase retail
prices of several basic consumption goods is an improvement, but might not
be sufficient to achieve satisfactory financial returns.
12.       The virtual absence of public savings, together with limited ab-
sorptive capacity, are the key constraints in implementing the 1970-72 Reha-
bilitation Program. Contrary to past investment patterns, the Rehabilitation
Program gives high priority to the rural sector in order to reduce the food
deficit and increase exports. In addition to cotton and groundnuts, major
emphasis is put on rice cultivation along the Niger River.
13.        Among the three crops (cotton, groundnuts and rice) which receive
highest priority in the Rehabilitation Program (accounting together for over
80 percent of planned rural investments), the rice program is the most impor-
tant. As in many other West African countries, rice consumption has sharply
expanded during the last decade, while local production has hardly increased.
The country has therefore gradually changed from an important exporter to a
net importer of rice (10 percent of total consumption) in spite of its good
potential for irrigated rice production. These imports have become an in-
creasing burden on the balance of payments amounting to up to $3 million per
year. In an attempt to reverse this unsatisfactory trend, the Government is
making a special effort to develop rice production, and to this end, has suc-
cessfully solicited assistance from its major aid donors. The rice program
focuses on two operations: the IDA project around Mopti (in which the French
aid agency, FAC, is participating) and another project in the Segou area to
be financed by the European Communities (FED).



-4-
14.       The Rehabilitation Program concentrates on quick-yielding and
directly productive investments in the rural sector, combined with efforts
to improve the efficiency and financial position of the state enterprises.
In the longer ternm, however, a more sizeable and broader investment program,
including expansion of education and other infrastructure, will be necessary
to achieve continuous satisfactory economic growth. Higher public savings
are crucial to the implementation of such a plan. This hinges on a substan-
tial reduction in the growth of the government wage bill--which must fall
well below the increase in current revenues. Furthermore, the Government
will have to abandon its policy of having public enterprises sell import
products at subsidized prices to the urban population. This change in
prices might well create some difficult problems with civil servants and
trade unions. It can only be achieved gradually and might have to be ac-
companied by an increase in basic salaries.
15.       Little progress has been made in rescheduling Mali's high foreign
debt, two-thirds of which is held by the U.S.S.R. and the People's Republic
of China. Service payments amount to some 20 percent of government revenues
and 13 percent of export earnings but are projected to reach 50 percent of
both budgetary revenues and exports by 1976 unless substantial rescheduling
is obtained. However, while there have been no formal agreements on this
subject, Mali is already receiving and is lilcely to continue to receive a
de facto moratorium for the bulk of its foreign debt, since the U.S.S.R. and
China seem willing not to insist on timely servicing of their credits in case
of serious financial difficulties. In consequence, the real debt burden
might well turn out to be much lower than the above projections suggest, which
would considerably ease the balance of payments and budget problems.
16.       While implementation of the Rehabilitation Program should stimulate
economic growth and improve both public finances and the balance of trade,
Mali's financial position will remain basically weak for some years. Eco-
nomic growth over the next decade will continue to be modest, with GDP grow-
ing at best by 4-5 percent p.a. or some 3 percent per capita. Meanwhile, the
capacity for raising public savings will remain limited even assuming a con-
certed and successful effort by the Government to limit the growth in its wage
bill and abolish consumer subsidies by public enterprises. Thus, public in-
vestments will in the future have to be financed largely by external assis-
tance. Furthermore, considering the present weak situation of the budget, as
well as of the balance of payments, this assistance should to the maximum
extent possible be on concessionary terms and cover a high proportion of total
project costs, including local expenditures.
PART III - THE PROJECT
17.       The Project would improve conditions for rice irrigation in the
Mopti area of the Niger River flood plains. Through rehabilitation and
construction of polders, paddy acreage in the project area would increase
from about 22,000 ha. to about 31,000 ha., while yields would increase from



- 5 -
0.88 ton/ha. to an estimated 1.86 tons/ha. The increment in production, as
a result of the project, would be equivalent to a 30 percent increase in the
country's present rice production. About 7,300 farm families would each
cultivate an average plot of 4 ha. and would continue to grow subsistence
crops outside the project area. The Project would be implemented over a
6-year period under the overall responsibility of the Ministry of Production,
assisted by consultants. French bilateral aid (FAC) would finance all foreign
personnel cost. The Government will have FED assistance for a parallel pro-
ject in the Segou area with which the proposed project would be coordinated.
18.       The Project would comprise:
(a) construction of three polders, including land preparation,
with a rice cultivated area of 13,300 ha.;
(b) rehabilitation of five polders, including land preparation,
with a rice cultivated area of 13,200 ha.;
(c) land preparation on 2,000 ha. of an existing polder;
(d) construction of buildings for the project;
(e) establishment of a project authority, Operation Riz Mopti
(ORM), including provision of farm machinery and technical
assistance to ORM. The project authority will operate and
maintain the polders, allocate land in the new polders,
produce and distribute selected seeds, and provide credit
and extension services in all areas mentioned above, plus
in existing polders with a rice cultivated area of 2,700 ha.;
(f)  establishment and operation of an agricultural research
station; and
(g) preparation of a feasibility study for a second rice project
in the Mopti area.
Consultants would be engaged to assist the Rural Engineering Department of the
Ministry of Production in the supervision of construction, to advise ORM in its
activities, including training of Malian staff during the development period,
and to help prepare the feasibility study. They will be replaced by their
Malian deputies as soon as feasible. A Credit and Project Sumnary is given
in Annex 3.
19.       Works for the new polders include construction of embankments, intake
regulators, canals, farm roads and cattle crossings. The same applies for the
agricultural research station and the seed multiplication farm. Rehabilitation
of existing polders would involve strengthening embankments and raising their
heights to acceptable standards. Furthermore, a laterite-surfaced road would



be constructed on top of the embankments of the most frequently used sections,
and intake regulators would be improved. Existing canals that have become
silted would be cleared and new canals built to improve drainage and filling
conditions.
20.       Land Preparation (about 10,000 ha.) in polders mentioned above and
in the Sarantomo-Sine polder would require deep plowing to destroy existing
grass and light bush vegetation. Construction of buildings would include of-
fices, storage buildings and housing for ORM, the seed multiplication farm,
the research station and the feasibility studies. In addition, a combined
office and storage building would be erected in each of the three new polders
and in two existing polders not already supplied with one.
21.       Agricultural Research.    The present research station and the seed
multiplication farm at Ibetemi would be transferred to near the town of Mopti
where they would have better access to ORM headquarters and where experiments
could be carried out, not only on floating rice, but also on irrigated rice.
In addition, their program would be expanded to include research on fertilizer
and ox-drawn farm implements, as well as on performance of seed trials on
farms scattered throughout the project area.
22.       The feasibility study for a second rice project would include a
number of technical surveys, detailed engineering of an all-weather road be-
tween Ke-Macina and Tenenkou, a health survey of the project area, and an
analysis of markets, prices and economic benefits. The Rural Economics In-
stitute under the Ministry of Production would continue to coordinate those
studies carried out by specialized firms and would be responsible for the
final report.
23.       The cost of the Project, including taxes of $1.0 million, is esti-
mated at about $9.4 million equivalent, of which $5.6 million would be in
foreign exchange. The proposed IDA credit of $6.9 million equivalent would
finance 73 percent of total cost. It would cover an estimated $4.5 million
foreign exchange cost of civil works contracts, agricultural research, equip-
ment and studies for a second rice project. It would also cover $2.4 million
equivalent of local expenditures on civil works contracts, management and ex-
tension services, and the feasibility studies of the second project. FAC
would finance an estimated $0.7 million foreign exchange cost for foreign
personnel. The Government's contribution of $1.8 million equivalent would
finance all taxes on construction materials, equipment and services to be
paid under the project ($1.0 million), local procurement of farm implements
($0.5 million of which $0.4 million indirect foreign exchange cost), and
basic salaries of government employees working under the project ($0.2 mil-
lion).
24.       Recovery of project costs would be achieved through imposition of a
levy in kind on project farmers, which would be set at 60 kg. of paddy per
ha. in the first year and increase gradually to 180 kg. of paddy per ha. from
the tenth year onward. Revenue from the levy would be sufficient to recover
annual operation and maintenance costs and all direct investments, without
interest costs, over a period of about 35 years.



- 7 -
25.       Overall responsibility for the proposed project would rest with the
Ministry of Production whose Rural Engineering Department would be in charge
of polder construction and rehabilitation. The extension service of the Min-
istry of Production would be organized in two units: ORM, which would cover
the proposed project, and ORS (Operation Riz Segou), which would cover the
FED-financed project. To insure adequate coordination and to provide inte-
grated policy guidance for ORM and ORS, a National Rice Commission would be
set up within the Ministry of Production, chaired by the Minister or his
representative and comprising the Rural Engineering Department, ORM and ORS.
26.       ORM would be established by decree as a semi-autonomous project
authority, directly responsible to the Minister of Production. It would be
administered by a board of six members, including a representative of the Min-
istry of Production, the Director of Agriculture, the Director of Rural Engi-
neering and three experts appointed by the Minister. ORM would be managed by
a Project Manager appointed by the Minister.
27.       Assurances have been obtained by the Government that a special ac-
count for ORM's personnel expenditures will be established and that monthly
deposits will be made to this account in amounts required to maintain a bal-
ance adequate to cover basic salary requirements for three months.
28.       All civil works contracts, as well as procurement of machinery and
equipment, would be carried out through international competitive bidding.
29.       The major benefits of the project would be additional production of
rice to help reduce the increase in rice imports. It would result in foreign
exchange savings of about $2.6 million annually. Improved farm techniques and
increasing use of equipment would also benefit millet and sorghum production.
There would be a reduction of grazing areas during the dry period, caused by
draining part of existing lakes and ponds, but this would be largely compen-
sated by the increased production of rice straw. At full development of the
project in 1982, farmer's income is expected to reach about $300 equivalent
annually or about 2 1/2 times the present level. The economic rate of return
would be 14 percent with project life assumed at 35 years. The economic costs
exclude all taxes as well as subsidies on equipment and fertilizers.
PART IV - LECAL INSTRLMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Mali and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately. Conditions for effective-
ness of the Agreement would be the establishment of OPR, the establishment
of a special account for ORM personnel expenditures and the employment of
engineering consultants.



- 8 -
31.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
32.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
