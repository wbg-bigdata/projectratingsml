REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz, with the Guarantee of
the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, for the equivalent of US$57.5
million to help finance a second power project. The loan would have a term
of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 8.85 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects
of Algeria" (900-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors in November
1975. An updating economic mission visited Algeria in April 1976 and its
report is now in preparation. The mission's preliminary findings are
reflected in the following paragraphs. Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending
1980. These are: (i) to expand and organize the production base, enabling
the economy to reach, by about 1980, a stage of self-sustained growth with
full employment; (ii) to achieve economic independence, which implies that
the country would rely first on its own resources for development, although
international economic relations would be expanded and diversified; and
(iii) to improve income distribution, particularly among regions. These
objectives, and the strategy which has evolved towards their implementation,
take into account the country's physical and socio-economic potential; the
country's leadership is deeply committed to them.
4.        To attain the objectives defined in 1966, Algeria has adopted a
long-term strategy with four main aspects, The first is industrialization,
which is viewed as the principal means of achieving the long-term growth
and employment objectives, as the scope for expanding agriculture rapidly
is limited by physical and social constraints. Severa-l, essential functions
are assigned to-.industry in this perspective: to produce and process natural
resources, particularly the sizeable reserves of hydrocarbons (oil and gas),
for export to earn foreign exchange; to produce modern equipmet for use in
all economic sectors; and to provide essential consumer goods required to
raise the living standards of the population. The second aspect of Algeria's
long-term strategy is the introduction of structural institutional changes
to keep the economy in Algerian hands, as a means of imparting dynamism to
investment and production. The main structural reforms are the application
of central planning to the economy as a whole, the expansion of the role of
public enterprises in industry and services, the Agrarian Revolution involv-
ing land and livestock redistribution to poor farmers and the introduction

- 2 -
of cooperative management in agriculture, decentralization in favor of local
governments, and the participation of workers in the management of state
enterprises. The third element of Algeria's long-term strategy is the accel-
eration of training and education to meet the skilled manpower needs of the
economy, improve employment opportunities, and develop an authentic Algerian
culture. The fourth and final element of Algeria's strategy is austerity in
consumption, to generate national savings for investment and avoid excessive
recourse to external sources.
5.        In the seven years, 1967-73, which constituted the first phase of
implementing the development strategy, structural reforms and investment were
pushed with vigor. The Government acquired nearly complete control of econo-
mic activity through the systematic nationalization of foreign assets, includ-
ing those of foreign oil companies, and through the creation and expansion of
public enterprises.  Total investment increased from 15 percent of GDP in 1966
to nearly 40 percent in 1973. Public sector investment rose from 9 percent
to 36 percent of GDP with more than half going to industry. In agriculture,
farms left vacant by departing foreigners in 1962 (about 2 million hectares)
have been managed by their workers under central planning and control, and
since 1971 the private agricultural sector (about 5 million hectares of culti-
vated land and 20 million hectares of steppe pasture) has been progressively
brought under the provisions of the Agrarian Revolution. Education and train-
ing were rapidly expanded and improved. The school population rose from
1.5 million in 1966/67 to 2.9 million in 1973/74 while the education and
training systems were progressively modified to improve their efficiency,
their relevance to economic needs and their accessibility to the largest
number of Algerian children and workers.
6.        Algeria's strategy also yielded some less satisfactory results.
First, the real growth of output was below target (about 6 percent per year
as against a target of 9 percent) in the 1970-73 period, mainly because of
delays in implementing many projects or in bringing their output to design
capacity, and due to poor agricultural performance. Second, the sectoral
imbalance in investment caused bottlenecks in lagging sectors such as pon-
struction, transportation, communications and housing. Third, while the
unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors declined from 27 percent in
1966 to 15 percent in 1973, the number of emigrated workers increased to
about 440,000 in 1973, when emigration was officially stopped. In agricul-
ture, slow output growth was acccompanied by an increase in underemployment.
About 9 percent of the agricultural labor force was officially considered to
be seriously underemploymed in 1973, compared with 4 percent in 1966. Thus,
in 1973, providing jobs for unskilled labor continued to be a worrisome prob-
lem, while the shortage of skilled and experienced nationals was a primary
restraint on investment and efficient management. Fourth, due to sharp dif-
ferences in sectoral and regional development, disparities in income levels
and living standards have persisted; for instance, in 1973, per capita con-
sumption was estimated at $130 on average in rural areas compared to $450 in
urban areas. The impact of these differences is, however, smaller than in
most other developing countries at Algeria's level of development due to the
strong income and price controls and substantial free social services.



- 3 -
7.        The increase in oil prices during the last quarter of 1973 boosted
Algeria's receipts from its main export product, crude oil. Delpite produc-
tion difficulties in the last four months of 1974 which caused declines in
the quantities of crude oil output and exports, receipts from hydrocarbon
exports rose from $1.7 billion in 1973 to $4.3 billion in 1974, The addi-
tional $2.6 billion ($190 per capita) which Algeria derived from hydrocarbons
in 1974 greatly improved the balance of payments. Despite the rise in the
import bill due to sharp increases in import requirements (30 percent) and
prices (35 percent), Algeria was able to repay in advance a part of the com-
mercial bank Loans it had contracted in 1972 and 1973, and to increase its
foreign exchange reserves by about $550 million during the year. There was
a corresponding improvement in the domestic financial situation, partidularly
in the position of the Treasury, which captures most oil revenues. The impact
of import price rises and domestic demand pressures was felt only partly in
prices to the consumers, as the Government stepped up sharply consumer price
subsidies. Consumer price index rose only 6.5 percent in 1974. The financial
improvement was accompanied by slow GDP growth in 1974 due to the decline
experienced in crude oil output and little additional output from industrial
projects, and despite the recovery of agricultural production from the low
level of 1973. GDP growth is estimated to have been around 3 percent in real
terms, and 51 percent in current prices essentially because of the oil price
increase. For the non-oil sector there rates are estimated at 7 percent and
18 percent respectively. Private consumption growth was satisfactory but
restrained (about 5 percent in real terms), and national savings rose sharply.
8.        The improvement in Algeria's financial situation and prospects led
the Revolutionary Council to envisage an acceleration of the pace of economic
development and structural reform during the second Four-Year Plan (1974-77).
On the basis of the physical implementation capacity likely to be available,
the Plan estimates that total investment should reach at least DA 85 billion
($20.4 billion) in 1973 prices during the 1974-77 period, and thus be about
2.3 times larger than during the 1970-73 Plan. The Plan also specifies a
higher (maximum) investment target of DA 110 billion ($26.4 billion), with
supplementary projects to be undertaken if implementation capacity can be
raised above the estimated minimum level. The share of industry and hydro-
carbons in total investment would decline to 44 percent in 1974-77, from 54
percent in 1970-73, while the relative importance of other sectors would in-
crease. Based on the expected outputs from sectoral investment programs, the
Plan fixes a minimum (11.2 percent a year) and a maximum (12.5 percent a year)
GDP growth target. The projected growth of investment and output would, ac-
cording to the Plan, create enough new jobs to improve the employment situa-
tion substantially. The Plan estimates that the unemployment rate in non-
agricultural sectors would decline to 'around 4 percent in 1977, while there
would be a marked reduction of underemployment in agriculture.
9.        The Plan also provides for an acceleration of consumption growth
and a reduction of regional disparities. It estimates that private consump-
tion should rise by 11.3 percent a year over 1974-77, compared to a growth
rate barely equal to that of population (3.3 percent) in 1970-73. On a per
capita basis, the growth rate of private consumption would be higher in rural



- 4 -
areas (9.6 percent a year) than in urban areas (5.5 percent a year) as a result
of increases in expenditures on rural development and social services. While
the Plan projects import requirements to rise at constant prices by 21 percent
a year in response to the rapidly rising demand for investment and consumption,
it expects export receipts to be large enough to leave a small surplus on
goods and non-factor services for the 1974-77 period as a whole. Thus, the
Plan does not anticipate any foreign exchange constraint, nor any difficulties
in domestic Einancing. However, it does foresee that the resource balance
would deteriorate after 1974 and turn into deficit by 1977.
10.       From the viewpoint of physical implementation capacity, the minimum
target for investment appears to be within reach. The orientation of the in-
vestment strategy in favor of lagging sectors and regions is highly desirable
for industry. However, the estimate of implementation capacity on which the
Plan's investment target is based implies that short-cuts will continue to
be taken in the preparation of many projects with adverse consequences for
implementing and bringing them to planned output. In part for this reason,
but also because of the high proportion of projects with long gestation pe-
riods in the investment program (e.g. hydrocarbon production, petrochemicals,
and heavy metal, mechanical and electrical industries), the delay between
investment and the accrual of benefits is expected to lengthen temporarily.
Indeed, the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) implied by the Plan's
minimum projections of investment and output tends towards 5.0 by the end
of the Plan period compared to less than 4.0 on average in the 1967-73 period.
Further, while the employment situation will probably improve substantially
between 1973 and 1977, the investment cost per additional job is fairly high.
On the basis of Plan estimates in 1973 prices, it is about $38,000 in 1973
prices in the non-agricultural sectors, and around $25,000 in agriculture.
At the same time, and in spite of the large planned effort further to accele-
rate education and training, the supply of skilled nationals will continue to
be significantly short of projected needs at the high, and especially at the
middle levels of qualification. The Government is taking a number of measures
to alleviate the problems created by this situation, including the introduction
of improved financial and other procedures to bring about better operational
results on the part of enterprises, and the extensive use of international co-
operation to help in project implementation and carry out extensive on-the-
job training of nationals. It expects that the management of assets will
improve progressively after the current Plan period when the supply of skilled
nationals is expected to catch up with needs and the beneficial effects of
organizational improvements are increasingly felt.
11.       An unusually wide margin of uncertainty surrounded the prospects for
hydrocarbon export receipts which were to finance most of Algeria's import re-
quirements during the 1974-77 Plan period. This uncertainty concern the
strength of external demand for crude oil and natural gas, the policies that
Algeria and other OPEC countries would follow concerning the volume and prices
of oil production, and the technical problems encountered in oil production
and large-scale gas liquefaction for export. Whereas the 1974-77 Plan expected



that during the Plan period Algeria's crude output would rise by 4.7 percent
per year and the purchasing power of Algerian crude on international markets
would remain at the level reached at the end of 1973, these crucial assump-
tions have not been borne out by developments in 1974 and 1975. Due to
technical and economic factors, crude oil output declined to an annual rate
of 44 million tons in 1975 from 50 in 1973, and the realized price of crude
exports also declined from an average $13 per barrel in early 1974 to less
than $12 in 1975. Receipts from hydrocarbon exports declined to $4.0 billion
in 1975, from $4.3 billion in 1974. While the growth of receipts should
resume in 1976 and later years, particularly with the expected recovery of
crude oil output and new exports of natural gas, such growth is likely to be
significantly less rapid than anticipated in the 1974-77 Plan.
12.       Meanwhile, in 1975, Algeria implemented the ambitious investment
strategy of the Plan, causing a rapid increase in import requirements, and
the appearance of sizeable external borrowing requirements. The current ac-
count of the balance of payments, which experienced a surplus of about $160
million in 1974, showed a deficit estimated at $1,560 million in 1975. To
finance this deficit and keep reserves at the level needed for confidence
and liquidity, Algeria borrowed on a commitment basis some $3.3 billion
from external sources in 1975.
13.       In 1976 and later years, the investment effort that Algeria can
undertake will depend mainly on the level of hydrocarbon export receipts--
the country's main source of investible funds. It will also depend more im-
portantly on the efficiency of domestic production for import substitution
and exports. And there will be a continuing need for austerity in consumption
policies. In the light of export prospects and other factors, the Government
has decided that in 1976 public investment appropriations by the budget and
annual plan would be kept at the same level as they were in 1975 (i.e., DA 26
billion or approximately $6.3 billion). This decision will probably result
in a small decline in real investment in 1976, which will ease the pressures
on the balance of payments that developed in the course of 1975. While
Algeria's economic and financial prospects are difficult to forecast beyond
1976, since they will depend on uncertain domestic and external factors, it
seems likely that Algeria will continue to have sizeable external borrowing
requirements until the early 1980's, when the large export projects concern-
ing gas and petrochemicals are expected to make a substantial contribution
to export receipts.
14.       Algeria's total external debt, outstanding and disbursed, was $3.3
billion ($6.0 billion including undisbursed) at the end of 1974. On the basis
of new commitments (para. 12) and assumed disbursements and repayments in 1975,
such debt is estimated to have risen further to $4.9 billion ($8.9 billion in-
cluding undisbursed) at the end of 1975. Debt service, however, has fallen in
relation to the substantially increased exports of goods and non-factor serv-
ices, from 15.1 percent in 1973 to 12.4 percent in 1975. Depending on the in-
vestment strategy which Algeria may choose and the level of hydrocarbon export
receipts, the ratio would rise to a level between 17 and 19 percent of exports
by the early 1980's. It would follow a gradually declining trend subsequently



- 6 -
as the large gas and petrochemical projects, presently underway or planned,
begin to generate increasing export revenues. Algeria's external borrowing
needs are large in the next few years, but can be accommodated in view of the
considerably enhanced capacity to carry debt which the country has acquired as
a result of the new relationship between the prices of hydrocarbons and other
commodities in world markets, and of the long-term prospects for gas and
petrochemical exports.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ALGERIA
15.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY73 and the Bank has since lent
$403.5 million in nine loans for transport, power, education, industry and
rural development. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as
of April 30, 1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. While the
physical execution of most projects is progressing well, effectiveness and
disbursements for some of them have been slow. Increasing familiarity with
Bank procedures is expected to lead to a better record on this account.
16.       The Bank's future lending to Algeria can only meet a small part of
its considerable external financial requirements, as detailed above, though,
with the approval of the project proposed in this report in FY 1976 it will
substantially exceed the relatively low FY 1975 level of $48 million which
resulted from delays in project preparation. At the end of 1975 the portion
of Algeria's total debt outstanding and disbursed owed to the Bank was about
one percent; this share will rise somewhat over the next years, but remain
below 5 percent at the end of the decade.
17.       The provision of technical assistance and institution building sup-
port in connection with lending operations remains a major objective in the
Bank's strategy in Algeria, to which the Government attaches special impor-
tance. The aim is to assist the Government to relieve bottlenecks in lagging
sectors, such as transportation, education and rural development, and to ex-
pand the contribution of institutions in these areas to national development.
Bank operations will also systematically attempt to introduce sounder criteria
for project preparation, appraisal and implementation, and to aid Algeria in
making more economic use of its resources. Finally, future lending will also
aim at reducing sectoral imbalances in support of the socio-economic trans-
formation of Algeria which the Government is undertaking, particularly in the
rural areas.
18.       In the past years, the level of awareness and understanding of the
Bank's methods of work and objectives varied considerably among government
agencies and the establishment of a program of Bank lending operations proved
a complex task. The increase in lending activities during the current fiscal
year has substantially improved the dialogue with the Government and is pro-
gressively leading to close cooperation in project preparation with the ex-
ecuting agencies. A project reconnaissance mission in February 1976 was
fruitful, and prospects for defining a sound future lending program are good.



19.       The loans made to Algeria over the past year were for the regional
industrial development program through the Banque Algerienne de Developpement,
technical assistance in rural development, the cement expansion project and
the second education project. With the addition of the project proposed in
this report the Bank will have supported a variety of projects in which a
substantial institution building effort is both needed and welcomed by the
Government. For subsequent years, further projects contemplated in education,
highways, ports, industry and agriculture including rural development, will
continue to stress objectives going beyond the mere transfer of resources.
As the pipeline of projects is strengthened, the lending program is expected
increasingly to include directly productive projects and those with a social
character.
20.       Most projects to be presented to the Executive Directors are expected
to have one or more technical assistance components. In addition, special
technical assistance activities have included a joint Bank-IMF mission which
visited Algqria in the spring of 1974 at the request of the Government, to
study the financial planning system. Acting on one of the mission's recom-
mendations, in late 1974 the Economic Development Institute held a course in
Algeria dealing with various aspects of financial planning at the central
government, banking and project levels. The authorities showed considerable
interest in this course. At their request, the EDI organized a project course,
with the Government bearing the cost, in April 1976, and may organize further
courses as well.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Power and Energy Resources
21.       Algeria's main natural energy resources are oil and gas.    Its proven
oil reserves are at least 1.9 billion cubic meters (12 billion barrels) and
the estimated 1975 output, including gas condensate, was 45 million tons or
0.9 million barrels per day. The main oil fields are in the central desert
area of Hassi Messaoud/Haoud el Hamra. The natural gas field of Haspi R'Mel
is one of the world's largest with provqn recoverable reserves (under present
techniques) of 3,000 billion m3. Eight other fields have total additional
proven reserves of 1,000 billion m3. Although annual oil production and
exports decireased 15 percent since 1974 compared with 1963, the share of
hydrocarbons in GNP rose from 19 percent in 1963 to more than 30 percent in
1974 and 1975, because of price increases. The main centers for processing
oil are the-refineries at Arzew and Algiers with a total capacity of 5 mil-
lion tons. In 1973, they covered almost all internal-needs and permitted
the export of 2.4 million tons of refined products. A new refinery at Skikda
(capacity 15 million tons) is due to be completed in 1978. Liquefied natural
gas (LNG) processed at Arzew (1.8 billion m3) and-Skikda (4.5 billion m3) is
now being exported. New LNG plants with a total capacity of 70 billion m3
are planned, including 12 billion m3 to be commissioned by 1977. A proj-
ect for the construction of the new LNG port of Bethioua, near Arzew, was



approved for Bank financing in 1974 (Loan 995-AL). Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development also
participated in the financing of this project.
22.       Coal reserves are small and mainly concentrated around Bechar
where, before Independence, about 300,000 tons were mined annually. The
mines are being modernized and production is to be increased to 600,000 tons
annually to be used mainly in coke-making for the steel plant at El Hadjar
near Annaba. Little coal is currently used for other purposes. Most of
Algeria's limited hydro-electric potential is already being exploited for
power (284 MW installed capacity, generating an average of about 480 GWh an-
nually), but effective capacity is restricted (184 MW) because of irrigation
requirements.
The Energy and Power Sector
23.       Tnree state enterprises are charged with the generation, transmis-
sion and distribution of energy: SONELGAZ (Societe Nationale de 1'Electricite
et du Gaz), SONATRACH (Societe Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le
Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialization des Hydrocarbures) and
SONAREM (Societe Nationale de Recherches et d'Exploitation Miniere). SONELGAZ
has the exclusive right to transmit and distribute power throughout the coun-
try. Its right to generate power is not exclusive. Factories requiring up
to 1,000 kVA may be self-producers, and any factory requiring process heat
may generate its own electricity for maximum economy. However, any excess
production of electricity must be sold to SONELGAZ. The company is also the
sole distributor of gas, which is purchased in bulk from SONATRACH. SONATRACH
has the exclusive right of exploration, development, processing and trading of
oil and gas, with the restriction that gas for national requirements must be
sold in bulk to SONELGAZ for distribution. SONAREM has the exclusive right
of exploration, development, processing and trading of mining products.
24.       Since 1966, the power sector has developed rapidly.     The total in-
stalled capacity of 1,247 MW in 1974 generated 2,898 GWh. Of this capacity
1,011 MW (81 percent) was owned by SONELGAZ, which generated 2,604 GWh (90
percent), and 236 MW (19 percent) was captive plant, generating 294 GWh (10
percent). Of the 236 MW installed in captive plant, about 138 MW pertains
to larger industries (petroleum and steel) and 98 MW to smaller industries.
Generation of the latter has declined steadily and now constitutes less than
1 percent of total national generation.
25.       The total length of the main transmission system, including 220-kV,
90-kV and 60-kV lines, is about 4,200 km. SONELGAZ' 220-kV system (about
1,700 km) will be operated at 150-kV until 1977-1978 when full conversion
to 220-kV should be completed. The medium voltage lines (5.5-30 kV) have
a length of about 17,500 km and low tension distribution lines and cables
(127/220 V and 220/380 V) about 10,200 km. The number of connections neared
the one million mark in 1974, serving about 6.4 percent of the population.
26.       Tariffs for electricity have not changed since 1965.     Their struc-
ture represents the marginal cost concept, but they have not been adjusted



- 9 -
for inflation and other economic changes in the country. High voltage service
has an annual charge per kW metered or subscribed plus kWh charges depending
on time of day, season and location. Low voltage service has an annual charge
per kVA plus charges per kWh and is uniform throughout the country. Special
rates apply to standby power for self-producers; additional charges apply to
industry for reactive power. A tariff study financed under the first Bank
loan for power is now in progress with the assistance of Electricite de
France, and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Its target
date for implementation is January 1, 1977.
SONELGAZ' De'velopment Program
27.       SONELGAZ' 1976-1980 construction program amounts to some DA 8,220
million (US$2,018 million equivalent). This program includes a power compo-
nent amounting to DA 6,949 million (84 percent of the total), a gas component
of DA 731 million (9 percent), and a general component of DA 540 million
(7 percent). A comparison of the power component of this program with that
assumed for Loan 997-AL shows that the investments as estimated now are on
average 180 percent higher in the period which is common to both programs
(1975-1978). The main reasons for this increase are: (a) higher equipment
prices (cost per kW increased during 1973-1975 on average over 90 percent for
steam plant and over 40 percent for gas-turbine plant); (b) the higher rate
of growth of electricity consumption requiring greater investment outlays
(consumption and generation for 1978 are 7.6 percent and 7.9 percent respec-
tively higher in the present program for all SONELGAZ and both are 12 percent
higher for the interconnected system); and (c) almost no investments were pro-
vided in the earlier program for power plants to be commissioned after 1978.
28.       A project providing about 230 MW in gas-turbine plant, financed by
the 1974 Bank loan, is now under construction in the Algiers area, and will
be completed in 1977/1978. A further three units totaling 90 MW will be in-
stalled by 1978/1979 in the western part of the country (Tiaret). Develop-
ments in the gas field at Hassi R'Mel (about 400 km south of Algiers) and in
the oil fields of Hassi Messaoud/Haoud el Hamra (about 500 km southeast of
Algiers) require the completion by 1977, of three gas-turbine stations with
a total installed capacity of 140 MW. SONELGAZ' investment program comprises
also a series of power plants which will be started but not completed during
the next five years. A continuing program of substation construction, which
is partly financed by the 1974 Bank loan, and line conversion to higher volt-
ages, in addition to expansion in distribution, would enable the increasing
demand to be met, particularly in industry. The Government would provide
the funds required for the execution of an exceptionally large rural elec-
trification plan, rising from DA 115 million (about US$28 million) in 1975
to DA 250 million (US$61 million) by 1980; by then, about 60 percent of
the population is expected to have access to electricity. A dispatch system,
comprising a main dispatch center in Algiers and district dispatch centers at
Algiers, Oran and Annaba, financed from Loan 997-AL, is scheduled for comple-
tion by 1977.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project would be the third power project financed by
the Bank in Algeria and the second since Independence in 1962; a first loan
of $10 million was made in 1955, prior to Independence. In 1974, a $38.5
million loan (Loan 997-AL) was made to SONELGAZ to finance the construction
of gas-turbine power plants, substations, a dispatching center and consulting
services for improvement of SONELGAZ' organization. Technical progress on the
project is satisfactory but delays have been encountered in the provision of
financial information essentially due to lack of experienced staff and organ-
izational changes. In addition, the foreign exchange cost of the project has
doubled.
30.       The project proposed in this report was identified by missions super-
vising the execution of the previous loan to SONELGAZ. The project was pre-
pared by SONELGAZ. It was appraised in November/December, 1975. Negotiations
were held in Washington in May, 1976. The Algerian delegation was led by Mr.
Hassam, Director General of the Ministry of Finance and Mr. Keramane, General
Manager of SONELGAZ. A detailed description of the project is given in the
report "Appraisal of the Second Power Project (SONELGAZ) -- Algeria" (Report
No. 1121-AL, dated June 8, 1976), which is being circulated separately. A
loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
The Investment Program of SONELGAZ and the Project
31.       The project would consist of the transmission component (including
substations) of SONELGAZ' power investment program for the period 1976 through
1980; it would also include studies to improve SONELGAZ organization and for
its overall development. The objectives of SONELGAZ' investment program are
to provide the most economical electricity supply to meet the forecast growth
in demand and to maintain required reliability of the power system. The pro-
gram comprises generation, transmission, and distribution investments. During
discussions prior to and during appraisal, the Bank indicated that it con-
sidered investments in transmission facilities to be the highest priority for
SONELGAZ, and the association of the Bank loan with this component of its in-
vestment program is thus particularly appropriate. The studies would espe-
cially focus on (a) the improvement and modernization of SONALGAZ' organiza-
tional structure and management methods; (b) on development and management in
the gas sector; and (c) on improvement of the management information system
and the development of computer applications.
32.       The following table summarizes the estimated expenditures for SONELGAZ'
1976-1980 investment program:



Local    Foreign      Total
------- US$ million --------
Generation                                  101.6     450.5       552.1
Transmission & substations                  144.4     255.9       400.3

Sub-total                              416.1     842.8    1,258.9
Physical contingencies                       41.6       84.3      125.9
Price contingencies                         171.4     230.8       402.2
TOTAL                                  629.1   1,157.9     1,787.0
33.       Including physical (10 percent) and price contingencies in accord-
ance with the latest Bank guidelines, the project would have a total cost
of $575 mil]ion, involving $217 million in local costs and $358 million in
foreign costs. The proposed Bank loan of $57.5 million would cover about 16
percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project. The remaining foreign
exchange costs are to be met partly by the Government and partly through
other foreign loans and supplier credits. The local costs would be financed
by internal cash generation, loans from the Treasury and Algerian banks, Gov-
ernment contributions to rural electrification, and consumers' contributions.
34.       SONELGAZ would be responsible for project execution.    Generally
making limited use of consultants as advisors, SONELGAZ assumes formal re-
sponsibility for carrying out works; in view of the level of competence of
its staff and the company's training program, this is acceptable. For its
substation and transmission lines, SONELGAZ prepares all designs and engages
consultants to review the final design and supervise the required testing;
this is an acceptable approach.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       All contracts to be financed from the proposed loan would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Although Algerian industry manufactures little of the
required equipment, in the evaluation of bids a preference of 15 percent or
the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, would be granted to Algerian
manufacturers who participate. The proceeds of the Bank loan would finance
the c.i.f. cost of imported materials and equipment, the ex-factory cost of
locally supplied goods awarded after international competitive bidding, and
the foreign exchange cost of related installation services and studies on the
development of SONELGAZ and the modernization of its organization. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on a list of subprojects to be financed
from the loan. This list comprises 310 km of transmission lines and 15 sub-
stations in the 220/60/30 kV range. The loan is expected to be fully dis-
bursed by the end of 1979.

Management and Organization of SONELGAZ
36.       Although legally SONELGAZ is an autonomous commercial entity, like
other major state-owned enterprises in Algeria, in practice it has little in-
dependence. Management is hampered by numerous Government controls. The
Ministry of Industry and Energy approves all organizational and personnel de-
cisions. The company's operating and construction budgets must be approved
by the State Secretariat for Planning and the Ministry of Finance. The
electricity and gas supply rates are also determined by Covernment.
37.       The management of SONELGAZ is satisfactory.    Its present general
manager, appointed by decree on the recommendation of the Minister of Indus-
try and Energy, has been in office since 1970. All executive personnel are
Algerian.
The Financial Position of SONELGAZ
38.       Under Loan 997-AL, SONELGAZ agreed to achieve, for its electricity
operations, an annual rate of return of seven percent on average net fixed
assets in operation starting in 1978; pending achievement of that target,
the company was to generate sufficient internal cash to cover 15 percent of
average construction requirements over the period 1975-1977. It also agreed
to achieve an annual debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 on its electricity
operations. The 15 percent target was met in 1975. However, with the sub-
stantial increase in the investment program for 1976, supplementary measures
would be needed to meet the cash generation target for 1976 and 1977. It was
agreed during negotiations, that this target would be retained under the pro-
posed loan, as well as the rate of return and the debt coverage ratios (Loan
Agreement, Sections 5.04 to 5.07, and Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.03).
To meet the cash generation target and the debt coverage ratio for 1976 and
1977, the Government informed the Bank that it has already initiated action to
(a) convert long-term Government loans amounting to $105 million into equity
in SONELGAZ; (b) defer payment of principal on long-term loans provided by
Algerian banks by a period of three years; (c) convert medium-term loans pro-
vided by such banks into long-term loans; and (d) assure that SONELGAZ other
activities would not pose a financial burden on the company's electricity
operations. However, the rate of return is projected to fall from an esti-
mated level of 4.4 percent in 1975, to less than 4 percent in 1976 and below
3 percent in 1977. Nevertheless, the Government and SONELGAZ agreed that the
same rate of return would be reached in 1977, as in 1975. Present Bank esti-
mates indicate that, to achieve this objective, an upward adjustment in elec-
tricity rates by 8 percent would be needed, in addition to the above-mentioned
actions. Bank estimates also indicate that this might need to be followed by
a substantial rate increase in 1978, besides a possible smaller increase in
1980, to attain the agreed upon 7 percent rate of return beginning in 1978.
Rate studies undertaken by the Algerian authorities are expected to be com-
pleted towards the end of 1976. The relevant level of rate adjustments would
be more appropriately determined by these studies and would be reviewed with
the Bank before implementation.



- 13 -
39.       SONELGAZ has had a serious problem with collection of receivables,
which represented over 160 days of sales at the end of 1975 as against 130
days at the end of 1973. Government agencies are particularly responsible
for this situation. During negotiations, the Government informed the Bank,
that legislation has already been enacted establishing a mechanism whereby
debts owed by agencies in the public sector could be settled within ninety
days and SONELGAZ has taken action to ensure settlement of dues under this
legislation. In addition, the Government agreed to make all necessary ar-
rangements to ensure the prompt settlement of SONELGAZ' arrears (Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.04).
40.       While SONELGAZ' accounts will continue to be audited by the Finance
Ministry's Commissaire aux Comptes under the arrangements agreed for the
previous loan, it was agreed during negotiations that responsibility for this
task may gradually be transferred to Societe Nationale de Comptabilite, a state
enterprise which is receiving technical assistance in auditing and financial
management under the SNMC Expansion Project (Loan 1185-AL).
Benefits and Justification
41.       The trend growth rate of electricity consumption since 1966 has
been 11.5 percent per year, and is projected to continue, over the 1974-1980
period at around 15.3 percent. The relatively high growth rate is in accord-
ance with the rapid industrial expansion planned by the Government.    The share
of sales to industry is expected to increase from about 45 percent in' 1974 to
57 percent in 1980.   In analyzing SONELGAZ' development program, the Bank re-
viewed two alternatives for 1978-1983:   installation of gas turbine plants
followed by steam plant, or all-steam development.   The equalizing discount
rate up to which the first alternative would constitute the least-cost devel-
opment program, was in excess of 20 percent at the time of appraisal of the
first loan to SONELGAZ; since the costs per kW for steam power have increased
at a higher rate than for gas turbine power, and no other reasonable solution
could meet the rapidly growing demand, the conclusion of the previous appraisal
remains justified.
42.       Since the project is an integral and essential part of SONELGAZ' in-
vestment program, in lieu of endeavoring to compute a rate of return on the
transmission system, the rate of return on the proposed program as a whole
was calculated. Based on present Bank estimates of tariff increases that
would be needed to meet the agreed 7 percent return on electricity assets,
the economic rate of return of the program would be slightly less than twenty
percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe Nationale de
l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ), the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of



- 14 -
the Committee provided for in ArtLcle III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
44.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 912-AL Highway Project; US$18.5 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Effective Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
The highway improvement works and procurement of project equipment
are progressing well. Due to the Government's reassessment of highway devel-
opment priorities, the preinvestment studies were delayed. However, the co-
ordinating consultants were appointed in June 1975 and four consulting firms
were contracted in September 1975 to carry out highway studies. Some changes
in the studies foreseen at appraisal are being made, with the Bank's concur-
rence.
Loan 913-AL Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Effective Date: October 26, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project has suffered initial delays, due to
ineffective liaison with the Bank. The Government has appointed a liaison
officer and communications have improved in recent months. Work is now pro-
gressing satisfactorily on the technician centers of the Algerian Petroleum
Institute, and measures are being taken to accelerate the planned extension
of the Institute of Agricultural Technology.
Loan 995-AL Port Project; US$70.0 million Loan of June 10, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Work is progressing satisfactorily and consultants are supervising
construction. Disbursements are somewhat behind schedule but are expected
to catch up in the near future. The project cost, based on contracts al-
ready received, may be slightly below the appraisal estimates.
Loan 996-AL Railway Project; US$49.0 million Loan of June 19, 1974;
Effective Date: November 11, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
The physical execution of the project is being carried out on time.
Maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock has still to be reorganized in
order to achieve agreed operating targets. Consulting studies financed under
the loan should help SNCA to improve the availability of locomotives and roll-
ing stock in the near future;
Loan 997-AL Power Project; US$38.5 million Loan of June 10, 1974;
Effective Date: December 20 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
The project comprises ten substations, two gas turbine stations,
despatch facilities, and consulting services for management and engineering

services. Technical progress of the project is satisfactory. All main con-
tracts have been awarded. Delays have been encountered in the provision of
financial information due to lack of experienced staff, interdepartmental
changes of personnel, and changeover to a new computer. The estimated for-
eign exchange cost of the project has doubled due to (a) increases in the
capacity of the gas turbine stations, (b) price increases, (c) increased
cost and expansion of studies, and (d) exchange rate changes. SONELGAZ pro-
posed and the Bank has agreed to withdraw one gas turbine station and five
substations from Bank financing, though they will remain part of the project.
Loan 1158-AL Development Finance Company Project; US$40 million Loan to
Banque Algerienne de Developpement of September 4, 1975;
Effective Date:  January 5, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
Final arrangements are being made for the secondment of Bank staff
to the project unit in BAD; one Bank staff member is already in the field.
Submission of subproject proposals is expected to begin soon.
Loan 1159-AL Technical Assistance (Rural Development) Project; US$8.0 million
Loan of September 4, 1975; Effective Date: January 5, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Recruitment of an advisor to the project coordinator is underway;
documents have been sent to consulting firm requesting proposals on the
planning, preparation, and execution of all sub-projects. Selection of firms
for some sub-projects is underway.
Loan 1185-AL SNMC Expansion Project: US$46 million Loan of January 7, 1976;
Effective Date: (to be added); Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
A contractor for the civil works necessary for the Saida cement
plant has been selected, and bidding is soon to begin for the railway link
to the plant. Cement prices were increased effective February 1, 1976.
Offers for the program of technical assistance to the Societe Nationale de
Comptabilite have been received, and a Bank mission assisted SNC on their
evaluation.
Loan 1209-AL Second Education Project; US$47 million Loan of March 9, 1976;
Effective Date: not yet effective; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The selection of the architects to prepare final designs for the
Institute of Electricity and Electronics at Tlemcen is under way. The con-
tract for the teaching staff which will be supplied by the Education Develop-
ment Center, a-consortium of US universities, is in the process of being
finalized. Discussions on the execution of-the other technical assistance
components are also under way.

three years, with interest at 8.85 percent per annum.
Project            The proposed project consists of the transmission
Description:       (including substation) component of the Borrower's
1976-1980 investment program plus studies for the
development of SONELGAZ and the modernization of
its organization.
Estimated Cost:    The cost of the SONELGAZ investment program, over the

Financing Plan:    The proposed Bank loan of $57.5 million would cover about
16 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project;
the remaining foreign costs are expected to be mec by the
Government, partly through on-lending of other foreign
loans and suppliers credits. The local costs would be
financed by internal cash generation, loans from the
Treasury and Algerian banks, Government contributions to
rural electrification, and consumers' contributions.
