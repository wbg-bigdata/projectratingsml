APPRAISAL OF
SECOND POWER PROJECT (SONELGAZ)
ALGERIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project comprising the transmission compo-
nent of SONELGAZ's investment program for the Algerian power sector in the
period 1976-1980 and studies for the improvement of SONELGAZ's organization
and its development, for which the Government has requested Bank financing.
The estimated cost of the Project is US$575 million equivalent (including a
contingency for future price increases) of which US$358 million would be for
foreign costs. A Bank loan of US$57.5 million (16% of the foreign cost) is
proposed. The proposed loan would be made to the Societe Nationale de
l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ), the Government-owned enterprise respons-
ible for electricity generation and transmission and for distribution of
electricity and gas throughout Algeria. Remaining foreign exchange require-
ments are expected to be met by the Ministry of Finance which will be respons-
ible for obtaining suppliers' credits and other external loans. The local
costs would be financed by internal cash generation, loans from the Treasury
and Algerian banks, and Government's and consumers' contributions.
ii.       The Bank has made two previous loans, totaling US$48.5 million, for
power development in Algeria. The first loan of US$10 million was made in
1955, prior to independence, to Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA), SONELGAZ's
predecessor, to finance part of EGA's expansion program (1955-1958) in genera-
tion, transmission and distribution. The second loan of US$38.5 million was
made in 1974 to SONELGAZ to finance the construction of gas-turbine power
plants, substations, a dispatching center and consulting services for improve-
ment of SONELGAZ's organization.
iii.       SONELGAZ has the exclusive right to transmit and distribute power
throughout the country. Its right to generate power is not exclusive. The
company is also the sole distributor of gas, including bottled gas (LPG).
SONELGAZ owns about 81% (1,011 MW in 1974) of Algeria's total installed capac-
ity. Its generation, which accounts for about 90% of the total electricity
production in the country, rose from about 1,100 GWh in 1966 to about 2,600
GWh in 1974 (11.2% p.a.). Production is projected to increase to about 6,110
GWh in 1980 and installed capacity to 2,065 MW.
iv.       The program, of which the Project is a part, includes facilities
under construction at January 1, 1976 or to be started prior to the end of
1980. These comprise 2,721 MW of generating capacity (1,624 MW of steam-
turbine plant, 1,062 MW of gas-turbine plant and 35 MW of diesel plant);
3,380 km of transmission lines; 4,225 MVA of substation capacity; the expan-
sion of existing distribution networks including rural electrification, and a
substantial program of training for engineers and technicians in foreign coun-
tries. SONELGAZ would be responsible for implementing the program.



- ii -
v.        Under Loan 997-AL, SONELGAZ agreed to achieve, for its electricity
operations, an annual rate of return of 7% on average net fixed assets in
operation starting in 1978; pending achievement of that target, the company
was to generate sufficient internal cash to cover 15% of average construction
requirements over the period 1975-1977. SONELGAZ has met this covenant, its
cash generation having been 20% of average construction requirements in 1975
and is expected to be 16% in 1976. Government and SONELGAZ have also agreed
to this covenant being extended to the proposed loan. Government has further
agreed to take all measures necessary to enable SONELGAZ to earn in 1977 at
least the same rate of return as in 1975. In order to achieve the agreed
financial objectives in 1977 and 1978, SONELGAZ would have to raise its elec-
tricity rates an average 8% effective January 1, 1977 and an average 30%
effective January 1, 1978.
vi.       All contracts for transmission lines and substations to be financed
from the proposed loan would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding, consistent with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The proceeds
of the Bank loan would finance the c.i.f. cost of imported materials and equip-
ment, the ex-factory cost of locally supplied goods awarded after international
competitive bidding, and the foreign exchange cost of related installation
services and studies. Agreement has been reached on a list of subprojects
(transmission lines, substations and studies) to be financed from the loan.
Although execution of the transmission program has begun, no retroactive
financing is proposed.
vii.      The 1976-80 development program, of which the Project forms part,
is the least-cost means of meeting the projected growth of demand. The
economic rate of return on the development program is at least 5.4% valuing
benefits using rates in effect March 1976; with the rate increase of 30% in
1978, which would not be expected to affect demand, the rate of return would
be 19.3%.
viii.      In view of the agreements reached as set forth in Section 7, the
Project would be suitable for a Bank loan to SONELGAZ of US$57.5 million
equivalent, for a term of 15 years including three years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
SECOND POWER PROJECT (SONELGAZ)
ALGERIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a Project comprising the transmission compo-
nent of SONELGAZ's investment program for the Algerian power sector in the
period 1976-1980, for which the Government of Algeria has requested Bank
financing. The program includes generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities under construction as of January 1, 1976 or to be started prior to
the end of 1980. A loan of US$57.5 million is proposed to finance part
(16%) of the foreign exchange cost of the Project.
1.02      There have been two previous Bank loans for the power industry in
Algeria, totaling US$48.5 million. The first loan (131-FR) of US$10 million
was made in 1955, prior to independence, to Electricite de Gaz d'Algerie
(EGA), SONELGAZ's predecessor, under guarantee of the French Government, to
finance part of EGA's 1955-1958 expansion program in generation, transmission
and distribution. The second loan of US$38.5 million (997-AL) was made in
1974 to SONELGAZ to finance the construction of gas-turbine power plants,
substations, a dispatch system and consulting services for improvement of
SONELGAZ's organization; this Project is expected to be completed in 1980.
1.03      This appraisal report was prepared by Messrs. V. Antonescu (Engineer)
and J. Turcot (Financial Analyst). It is based on information which they ob-
tained during a mission to Algeria in November/December 1975.
II. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
A. The Country and the Economy
2.01      The Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, on the southwest
coast of the Mediterranean, has an area of about 2.3 million km2 (885,000
square miles) and a population estimated at 15 million. Most of its inhabit-
ants live in the fertile coastal area, which covers about 20% of the country
and is separated by the Atlas mountains from the almost desert area in the
south.
2.02      The fundamental objectives of Algeria's economic policy, defined
in 1966, are:
-    expansion and organization of the productive base, in order
to eliminate unemployment by 1980;



- 2 -
achievement of economic independence and simultaneous develop-
ment of international economic relations, on the basis of
mutual interests;
improvement of territorial distribution of revenues, by giving
equal chances to poorer regions to develop their productive
capacities.
2.03      The four-year plan 1974-1977 is considered as the second stage of
Algeria's process of industrialization, which would permit the attainment
in 1980 of the objectives established in 1966. This plan provides about
44% of investments for industrial development, of which almost half will
be spent in the gas and oil industry.
B. Energy Resources
2.04      Algeria's main natural energy resources are oil and gas.  Its
proven oil reserves are at least 1.9xlO9m3 (2 billion barrels) and the esti-
mated 1975 output, including gas condensate, was 46 million tons or 0.9 mil-
lion barrels per day. The main oil fields are in the central desert area of
Hassi Messaoud/Haoud el Hamra. The natural gas field of Hassi R'Mel is one
of the world's largest with proven recoverable reserves (under present tech-
niques) of 3,000xlO9m3. Eight other fields have total additional proven re-
serves of 1,000x1O9m3; although annual oil production and exports decreased
15% since 1974 compared with 1963, the share of hydrocarbons in the GNP rose
from 19% in 1963 to more than 30% in 1974 and 1975, because of price increases.
The main centers for processing oil are the refineries at Arzew and Algiers
with a total capacity of 5 million tons. In 1973 they covered almost all
internal needs and permitted the export of 2.4 million tons of refined pro-
ducts. A new refinery at Skikda (capacity 15 million tons) is due to be com-
pleted in 1978. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) processed at Camel (1.8x109m3)
and Skikda (4.5x1O9m3) is now being exported from Arzew and Skikda. New LNG
plants with a total capacity of 70xlO9m3 are planned, including 12xlO9m3
to be commissioned by 1977. A project for the construction of the new LNG
port of Bethioua, near Arzew, is being financed from a Bank loan (Loan 995-AL).
2.05      Coal reserves are small, and mainly concentrated around Bechar where,
before independence, about 300,000 tons were mined annually. The mines are being
modernized and production is to be increased to 600,000 tons annually to be used
mainly in coke-making for the steel works at El Hadjar near Annaba. Little coal
is currently used for other purposes.



2.06      Most of Algeria's limited hydro potential is already being ex-
ploited for power (284 MW installed capacity, generating an average of
about 480 GWh annually), but effective capacity is restricted (184 MW) be-
cause releases for irrigation take priority over power generation.
C. Organization of the Sector
2.07      Development of Algeria's energy resources is entrusted to  three
companies: SONELGAZ, SONATRACH and SONAREM under the Ministry for Industry
and Energy. An outline of the sector organization, established in 1969
is shown in Annex 1.
2.08      The Societe Nationale de 1'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ) has
the exclusive right to transmit and distribute electric power throughout the
country. Its right to generate power is not exclusive. Factories requiring
up to 1,000 kVA may be auto-producers, and any factory requiring process heat
may generate its own electricity for maximum economy. However, any excess
production of electricity must be sold by the auto-producers to SONELGAZ. The
company is also the sole distributor of natural gas which is purchased in bulk
from the Societe Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le Transport, la
Transformation et la Commercialization des Hydrocarbures (SONATRACH). SONELGAZ
will also gradually take over distribution of bottled gas (LPG).
2.09      SONATRACH has the exclusive right of exploration, development, pro-
cessing and trading of oil and gas, with the exception that gas for national
requirements must be sold in bulk to SONELGAZ for distribution.
2.10      The Societe Nationale de Recherches et d'Exploitation Miniere
(SONAREM) has the exclusive right of exploration, development, processing
and trading of mining exports, including coal.
2.11      It has been the Government's policy to substitute supplies from
SONELGAZ for individual or isolated power supplies in order to ensure op-
timum use of existing power facilities and to reap the benefits of scale.
Consequently the role of independent and isolated plant has gradually de-
clined, and all main industrial consumers are now connected to SONELGAZ's
network, which is expected to meet most of the future power requirements.
2.12      After stagnating during 1963-1966, the power sector has developed
rapidly. Power sector data for 1963-1974 are shown in Annex 2. The total
installed capacity of 1,247 MW in 1974 generated 2,898 GWh. Of this capacity
1,011 MW (81%) was owned by SONELGAZ, which generated 2,624 GWh (90%), and 236
MW (19%) by auto-producers, generating 294 GWh (10%).
2.13      Of the 236 MW of independent plant, about 138 MW pertains to larger
industries (petroleum and steel) and 98 MW to smaller industries. Generation
of the latter has declined steadily and now constitutes less than 1% of total
national generation.



-4-
2.14      The total length of the main transmission system, including 220-kV,
90-kV and 60-kV lines, is about 4,200 km. SONELGAZ's 220-kV system (about
1,700 km) will be operated at 150-kV until 1977-1978 when full conversion to
220-kV should be completed. The medium voltage lines (5.5-30 kV) have a
length of about 17,500 km and low tension distribution lines and cables
(127/220 V and 220/380 V) about 10,200 km.
2.15      Total installed capacity in SONELGAZ's interconnected system amounted
at the end of 1975 to 998 MW.  The major thermal plants are located in:
Algiers:   Steam 120 MW, gas turbine 40 MW
Oran:       Steam 189 MW, gas turbine 44 MW
Annaba:    Steam 184 MW
Skikda:    Steam 274 MW (the first 137-MW unit was completed
in 1975, the second unit is due for completion in
1976)
Of the total 284 MW installed capacity in hydro plants 200 MW is concentrated
in the area between the Tunisian border and Algiers; 84 MW in smaller hydro
plant is spread along the lower Atlas mountains, near the coast. In isolated
systems, gas-turbine capacity was about 130 MW, mainly catering for oil and
gas fields, and diesel capacity was about 30 MW.
Tariffs
2.16      Electricity tariff structures have not changed since 1965.  They
represent the marginal cost concept, but have not been adjusted with economic
indicators. High voltage service has an annual charge per kW metered or
subscribed plus kWh charges depending on time of day, season and location.
Low voltage service has an annual charge per kVA plus charges per kWh and is
uniform throughout the country. Special rates apply to stand-by power for
auto-producers; additional charges may apply to industry for reactive power.
2.17      (a)  The typical industrial rates (high voltage including 10 kV) for
Algiers are:
Demand charge: DA 45/kW year
Energy charge, in cDA/kWh:
60 kV  30 kV  10 kV
Peak hours (Nov., Dec., Jan.)             12.53  14.39  16.35
Winter (Oct., Mar., incl.)
Normal hours (6-12h, 14-22h)           7.49   8.30   9.83
Off hours (22-6h, 12-14h)               2.35   2.68   2.94
Summer (Apr.-Sept., incl.)
Normal hours (6-12h, 14-22h)           3.61   4.80   5.63

DA/year    cDA/kWh
0.5 kVA                             6         35
1 or 2 kVA                            35         28
The average revenue over the years, in cDA/kWh was:
1969   1972   1975
High voltage (10 kV incl.)    8.9    9.5    9.1

(USi/kWh)                     (4.17) (4.22) (3.88)
2.18      The continuous decrease of average revenues from electricity sales
is due to the relatively fast increase of high voltage (industrial) consump-
tion and to the disparity between high voltage and low voltage rates. This
disparity is not justified both for social and financial considerations. In
order to reach the financial targets agreed upon under the first Bank loan to
SONELGAZ, which were retained under the proposed second loan, rate increases
would be required, as shown in Section 5. These rate increases would be
established on the base of a tariff study financed by the first Bank loan for
power which is now in progress with the assistance of Electricite de France,
and is expected to be completed by the end of September, 1976. Its target
date for implementation is January 1, 1977.
D.  Development Program
2.19      SONELGAZ's 1976-1980 construction program, which reflects the Na-
tional Development Program, was twice reduced by SONELGAZ itself during and
after the mission's visit in Algeria, to reflect changes in the industrial
development program (see 2.20). It amounts to some DA 8,220 million (US$2,019
million equivalent). This program (see Annex 3) includes a power component
amounting to DA 6,949 million (84% of the total), a gas component of DA 731
million (9%), and a general component of DA 540 million (7%). A comparison of
the power component of this program with that assumed for Loan 997-AL shows
that the investments as estimated now are on average 180% higher in the period
which is common to both programs (1975-1978). The main reasons for this
increase are:
(a)  higher equipment prices (cost per kW increased during
i973-1975 on average over 90% for steam plant and over
40% for gas-turbine plant) compared with the 1973 base
costs used in the first appraisal;



- 6 -
(b)  higher rate of growth of electricity consumption requiring
greater investment outlays (consumption and generation for
1978 are 7.6% and 7.9% respectively higher in the present
program for all SONELGAZ and 12% each higher for the inter-
connected system), and
(c)  almost no investments were provided in the earlier program for
power plants to be commissioned after 1978 since the additional
expansion and related programs were then unknown.
2.20      SONELGAZ's long-term planning, which is carried out by its own engi-
neers, is in broad outlines only.  Although it reflects the National Develop-
ment Program, it has not yet achieved a satisfactory degree of flexibility in
adjusting the plan to the frequent changes which occur in implementation of
industrial objectives. Until recently, investment decisions were based on
financial and technical rather than economic considerations. The company has
initiated the use of discounted cash flow methods for comparison of alterna-
tive major components within its program, particularly developments in genera-
tion. SONELGAZ, however does not take into account the fact that for evalua-
tion of alternatives the relevant cost is the cost to the economy (e.g. fuel
costs like natural gas are taken at the low price paid by SONELGAZ to SONATRACH,
not the pre-liquefaction price reflecting the international market price, or
future replacement cost) (see para 6.04).
2.21      To meet the forecast consumption and maximum demand, which are pro-
jected to double from 1975 to 1980, the least cost solution for new generating
capacity as appraised under the first power project proved to be a program
comprising a gas-turbine component of 250-300 MW in 1978-1979, followed by
steam plant. This solution resulted from the comparison of the mixed gas-
turbine and steam power program with an all-steam development in connection
with the appraisal of the first SONELGAZ power project. Since in the meantime
the specific construction cost of steam power plant has increased relatively
more than the specific cost of gas-turbine plant, and no other reasonable
solutions could meet the rapidly growing demand, the conclusion of the 1974
appraisal with regard to the least cost solution is still valid.
2.22      The program includes the completion in 1976 of the 274-MW steam
power plant at Skikda, of which the first 137-MW unit was commissioned in
1975. In accordance with the proposed program, 230 MW in gas-turbine plant,
financed by the 1974 Bank loan, is now under construction in the Algiers area
and will be completed in 1977/1978. A further three units totaling 90 MW will
be installed by 1978/1979 in the western part of the country (Tiaret). Develop-
ments in the gas field at Hassi R'Mel (about 400 km south of Algiers) and in
the oil fields of Hassi Messaoud/ Haoud el Hamra (about 500 km southeast of
Algiers) require the completion by 1977, of three gas-turbine stations with a
total installed capacity of 140 MW.
2.23      In addition to the above-mentioned generation capacities to be com-
pleted in 1976-1980, the program also includes power plants which will be
started but not completed by the end of 1980. The program includes in this



- 7 -
category a 600-MW (4x150 MW) steam station at Djidjelli, of which the
first two units are due to be commissioned in 1981, and a 750-MW (5x150 MW)
steam station in the Oran region (Marsat-Mostaganem) of which the first stage
(2x150 MW) is planned for 1982-1983. Although the location of these two power
stations in the eastern and western part of the country is intended to reinsti-
tute an appropriate balance between regional generation capacities, they are
mainly intended to supply two new steel plants each requiring a maximum demand
of about 350 MW. A gas-turbine station with a total installed capacity of 600
MW, of which 200 MW to be commissioned by 1980, is provided for the power re-
quirements of an aluminum plant at M'Sila (200 km southeast of Algiers), which
the Government is planning to construct by 1981. This program, although large,
is reasonable and consistent with programs in other sectors of Algeria's eco-
nomy, especially in industry. It corresponds to the envisaged acceleration
of economic development during the second Four-Year Plan (1974-1977) which
provides about 2.3 times higher total investment (in comparable prices) than
the 1970-1973 plan. SONELGAZ will not have any problem implementing a program
of such magnitude since for the major investments included in the program
SONELGAZ will use assistance of consultants, and the training program for
engineers will meet the needs after 1980 when the new major power plants
will come into operation.
2.24      A continuing program of substation construction, which is partly
financed by the 1974 Bank loan, and line conversion to higher voltages, in
addition to expansion in distribution, is planned to enable the increasing
demand to be met, particularly in industry. The Government would provide the
funds required for the execution of an exceptionally large village electrifi-
cation plan, rising from DA 115 million (about US$28 million) in 1975 to DA
250 million (US$61 million) by 1980. This plan is aimed at raising the part
of Algeria's population which has access to electricity from less than 50% in
1975 to about 60% in 1980.
2.25      A dispatch system, comprising a main dispatch center in Algiers and
district dispatch centers at Algiers, Oran and Annaba, financed from the 1974
Bank loan, is scheduled for completion by 1977.
2.26      Algeria supplies, by means of a 90-kV line from its 150/90-kV sub-
station El Aouinet, some power to the town of Tadjerouine in Tunisia. Simi-
larly it receives in the Annaba area some power from the Fernana hydro station
in Tunisia. In 1973, SONELGAZ and Office National de l'Electricite (ONE) of
Morocco, on the basis of a study financed by the African Development Bank,
reached agreement on a 220-kV interconnection between Oran and Oujda in
Morocco for mutual support and reserve. The link was completed in 1975 but
is not being operated.



III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The Project is the transmission component (substations, transmission
lines and dispatching) of SONELGAZ's investment program for power for the
period 1976-1980, and includes studies concerning the company's organization
and its development. The planned transmission components are intended to
balance the power surplus of the central part of the country with the defi-
cits in the eastern and western parts; to supply new industrial consumers
(Tiaret, Sidi Bel Abbes, Zahana, Tlemcen etc) and to transmit the generated
power from the future power plants (Djidjelli and Marsat-Mostaganem). A list
of transmission lines and substations to be financed from the Loan, which has
been agreed upon during negotiations, is given in Annex 4.
B. Description
3.02      The Project includes facilities under construction by January 1,
1976 or to be started prior to the end of 1980 and comprises the following:
1,440 km of 220-kV transmission lines
1,380 km of 90 and 60-kV transmission lines
560 km of 30-kV lines
1,100 MVA of 220/60-kV substations
3,125 MVA of 60/30-kV substations
a dispatch system comprising one main dispatch center and
three district dispatch centers, and related studies.
The program also includes about 1,720 MW of generating capacity, distribution
works, and training of engineers and technicians in foreign universities.
C. Status of Engineering
3.03      Although using limited assistance from consultants with satisfac-
tory qualifications, experience and conditions of employment, as advisors in
project execution, SONELGAZ generally assumes formal responsibility for carry-
ing out the works in its program. This is acceptable in view of the compe-
tence of SONELGAZ's staff. Consulting engineers are engaged to a greater
extent for projects with high technical complexity (steam power plants, dis-
patch system). For its substation and transmission lines, SONELGAZ prepares
all designs and engages consultants to review the final design and supervise
the required testing. This policy of limited consultant services would also



- 9 -
apply to the substations and transmission lines to be financed under the pro-
posed loan, and is acceptable. A contract with a foreign consultant (Motor-
Columbus, Switzerland) for technical assistance in the development of the
transmission system has been agred upon by SONELGAZ, but has not yet been
approved by the competent Government authorities.
D. Cost Estimate
3.04      The estimated construction expenditures for the 1976-1980 power
program are set out in Annex 5 and summarized below:

- 10 -
3.05      The cost of the Project, which includes the transmission component
of the 1976-1980 power program and studies, would be US$574.6 million equiva-
lent, comprising US$216.8 million local costs and US$357.8 million in foreign
costs. Estimates for equipment are based on late-1975 international and local
prices; estimates for civil construction works are based on the cost of works
of a similar nature which have been completed recently. Physical contingen-
cies have been estimated at 10% on average. Price contingencies were calcu-
lated by compounding at annual rates of increase of 13% (1976), 12% (1977-
1979) and 10% (1980) for local costs, and of 9% (1976), 8% (1977-1979) and 7%
(1980) for foreign expenditures.
3.06      The capital cost estimates for steam power plant (gas) is about
DA 2,600/kW (US$639/kW) for 2x150 MW and DA 2,000/kW (US$491/kW) for every
additional 150 MW. For gas-turbine plant the cost estimates range from
US$270/kW to US$230/kW depending on the unit size. Costs of single-circuit
transmission lines are about US$75,000/km for 220-kV lines and US$20,000/km
for 60-kV lines. The specific investment for substations is about US$15,000-
20,000/MVA. The costs are considered to be reasonable.
E. Financing
3.07      The proposed loan of US$57.5 million equivalent would cover about
5% of the foreign exchange costs of the 1976-1980 development program and
would be used by SONELGAZ for the construction of substations and transmission
lines. Remaining foreign exchange costs are expected to be met by the Minis-
try of Finance which will be responsible for other external loans. The local
costs would be financed by internal cash generation, loans from Treasury and
Algerian banks, Government contribution to rural electrification and consumers'
contributions. The loan would be granted to SONELGAZ. No retroactive fi-
nancing is proposed for installations and equipment, since any payments for
such items previous to loan approval would be covered by SONELGAZ.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
3.08      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance the c.i.f. cost
of imported materials and equipment and the foreign exchange cost of related
installation services and foreign exchange cost of studies.  All contracts for
equipment and installation services to be financed from the proposed loan would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, consistent with
Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. Since Algerian industry manufactures
little of the required equipment it is assumed that the proceeds of the Bank
loan would be used entirely to finance imports; however, a preference of 15%
or applicable duties, whichever is the lesser, would be granted to Algerian
manufactures who do participate. The expected disbursements from the proposed
loan are shown in Annex 6. Any savings would be cancelled.
3.09      Procurement is expected to be completed at the end of 1979, and the
bank-financed element of the Project should be completed by December 31, 1980.



- 11 -
G. Environmental Impact
3.10      The environmental impact of the program is negligible, since both
the gas-turbine plants and the steam power plants will be located outside
population centers and operate on natural gas, which ensures a minimum of
noxious and visible fumes. Sea water would be used for cooling purposes in
the new steam power plants, and no problems are expected with regard to
thermal pollution of water. The substations and transmission lines will
be located in sparsely populated areas where amenity considerations are
minimal.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
4.01      SONELGAZ is the successor to Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA),
which was created in 1947 when all electricity and gas companies in Algeria
were nationalized by the French Government. In 1969, the Algerian Govern-
ment dissolved EGA and created SONELGAZ, vesting all former rights and ob-
ligations of EGA in the new company. Details on the legal background are
given in Annex 7.
B. Management and Organization
4.02      The company's management is satisfactory.  Its Chief Executive
is the General Manager, who is appointed by government decree upon the re-
commendation of the Minister of Industry and Energy. The present General
Manager was appointed in 1970. The ordinance of July 1969, which created
SONELGAZ, stipulated that the company was to be controlled by a Committee
(Comite d'Orientation et de Controle) of 12 members comprising a President,
the General Manager, representatives of various ministries, the party (Front
de la Liberation Nationale) and employees. This committee, however, was
not instituted because of the changed policy with respect to management of
socialistic organizations requiring workers' participation in management.
The committee's prerogatives are now vested in a Management Committee (Comite
de Direction) comprising the General Manager and the five directors and nine
chiefs of the various divisions, departments, and advisory services.
4.03      SONELGAZ has two major departments and three divisions, each headed
by a Director: Personnel, Financial, Planning and System Operation and the
newly created division of New Works comprising three services for equipment,
construction and regional branches. Contributory services are provided by
different departments coordinated by the divisions. All executive officers
are Algerian.



- 12 -
4.04      SONELGAZ's present organization appears to be adequate for the
fulfilment of the company's tasks up to 1977-1978, when the construction of
the major power plants included in the development program would be started.
However, in view of SONELGAZ's rapid growth, a study has been initiated under
the previous Bank loan for the reorganization of the company and the moderni-
zation of its administrative procedures. The aim of this reorganization is to
enable SONELGAZ to face the problems arising from its large development pro-
gram. The study was started in 1973 but one year later, because of unsatis-
factory progress, a new consultant S.E.M.A. (France), was assigned for the
continuation of the study on a broader basis. The Bank and SONELGAZ have
agreed to review the conclusions of the study, which is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of 1976.
C. Staffing
4.05      At the end of 1974, SONELGAZ employed 7,273 regular staff of whom
5,508 (76%) were for electric power activities. Their numbers have increased
since 1968 by an average of 4.2% p.a. The total number of staff is reasonable.
Combined energy sales of electricity and gas (both expressed in calorific value)
per employee rose from 0.55x106 thermies in 1968 to 0.85x106 thermies in 1974.
Assuming that all gas consumers are also electricity consumers (235,830 gas
consumers and 977,840 electricity consumers in 1974), the ratio of consumers to
employees rose from 117:1 in 1968 to 134:1 in 1974, which is reasonable.
D. Training
4.06      SONELGAZ has excellent training programs and facilities for techni-
cians in Blida and Ben Aknoun, where up to 250 students can be trained for
periods of several months up to two years in basic technical courses, or
follow refresher courses. There are also many training centers for adminis-
tration in Algeria, and full use is made of these centers to train adminis-
trative staff.
4.07      SONELGAZ will need considerable additional professional engineers
to implement the planned substantial development of the power sector and to
operate and maintain it with optimum efficiency. At present, SONELGAZ has
72 professional level engineers in management and technical posts. In
addition, from time to time, for special purposes, consultants--both nationals
and expatriates--are hired on short-term assignments. The total needs of
SONELGAZ for professional power engineers in 1980 are estimated at 450. At
present, only one institution--the Ecole Polytechnique, with a total output
of 120-130 engineers/year--is training professional engineers in the special-
ities of main interest to SONELGAZ, to meet the needs of the whole economy.
The new University of Algiers II and the Technological Institute of Electricity
and Electronics at Tlemcen (which is being financed by the Bank under Loan 1209-
AL) will not be fully operative before 1980.



- 13 -
4.08      Since the local sources cannot meet the short-term demands, SONELGAZ
has contracted with one Belgian and seven French universities to train some
420 engineers and 200 technicians in the period 1975-1982. The university
program includes the electrical, mechanical, electronics, telecommunications,
automation, system analysis, civil and computer fields of specialization.
Trainees for the engineering degree course will be Algerian University gradu-
ates in Science and/or Mathematics and will attend a four-month orientation or
upgrading course before entering the engineering schools to graduate in a
two-year program. The technician program will also be of two-year duration
but for technical school baccalaureates. The cost of the total program is
estimated at about US$15 million( about US$12,000/ trainee a year), which is
high. However, in view of the high cost and the improving situation in regard
to local supply sources in 1981, it is expected that the Government and
SONELGAZ will review the program in 1978 and reformulate it in accordance with
the findings of the study which is financed by the Bank under the Second Edu-
cation Project Loan. The contracts allow for modification by either party
with one year notice given of proposed changes.
4.09      SONELGAZ has highly qualified personnel and is quite canable of
fulfilling, with its existing staff, its obligations for the immediate future.
The huge training program which is now in progress will allow the company to
achieve its long-range tasks, resulting from its development program.
E. Operations
4.10      SONELGAZ's facilities are well run and operation is generally satis-
factory. Annex 8 provides some statistics and company indicators for 1968-1974.
V. FINANCE
A. Financial Highlights
5.01      The financial highlights of SONELGAZ are as follows:
(a)  Government has taken steps to restructure the capitalization
of SONELGAZ and to reschedule its debts with a view to easing
its debt service burdens (para. 5.06);
(b)  collection of receivables, especially those due by Government
departments and public bodies being very slow, Government has
instituted special collection procedures in late 1975 where-
by claims would be determined by special tribunals and payments
enforced within 90 days (para. 5.12), and



- 14 -
(c) SONELGAZ operates with electricity rates that have not changed
since 1965, and natural gas rates which were reduced in 1968
and have remained unchanged since. In spite of the low (con-
trolled) cost of fuel,-operating expenses are now increasing
faster than revenues. As under Loan 997-AL, SONELGAZ would
achieve a self-financing level of 15% of construction require-
ments in 1976-1977 and a rate of return of at least 7% from
1978 onwards (paras. 5.18 & 5.19).
B. SONELGAZ's Relations with Government
5.02      Although SONELGAZ is an autonomous commercial entity, in practice
it has little financial independence. Management is hampered by nunlerous
Government controls. The Ministry of Industry and Energy supervises
SONELGAZ's activities and approves all decisions on organization and person-
nel. SONELGAZ's operation and construction budgets must be approved by the
Ministries of Planning and Finance, which arrange external financing for proj-
ects once they are included in the National Development Plan. Tariffs are
also subject to Government approval.
C. Accounting and Reporting Systems
5.03      SONELGAZ prepares only consolidated accounts for all its operations,
viz., electricity, natural gas and bottled gas, but breakdowns by activities
are available for fixed assets, depreciation and revenues. In September of
each year, SONELGAZ prepares an operation and construction budget for the cur-
rent year and the following year, which is sent to the Government for approval.
In June, SONELGAZ prepares a detailed annual report on the previous year's
accounts. At year-end, analyses are made showing allocation of costs relat-
ing to common services, and comparison of actuals with budget allocations.
Apart from these however, SONELGAZ does not have a regular reporting system
for management purposes.
5.04      In order to be able to monitor performance in respect of the elec-
tricity operations for the purpose of the loan covenants with the Bank, com-
mencing with the statements for 1975 SONELGAZ will submit to the Bank with
its annual report, a specific breakdown of the balance sheet, income state-
ment, and sources and applications of funds statement, showing separately
the operating results of the electricity operations.
5.05      Implementation of computerized systems, and reorganization for
which studies financed by Loan 997-AL are now in progress, are expected to
facilitate introduction of separate accounting and reporting systems for the
major activities of SONELGAZ.

D. Past Performance and Present Position
Electricity
5.06      Under Loan 997-AL (1974) SONELGAZ was required to achieve from its
electricity operations a net cash generation equivalent to 15% of average
construction requirements of the previous and current years for 1975-1977,
and for 1978 a rate of return of at least 7% on average net fixed assets
less consumers' contributions. Because of the greatly increased construc-
tion program, SONELGAZ's cash requirements have also increased correspond-
ingly especially from 1976. Therefore with a view to easing SONELGAZ's debt
service burdens and strengthening its financial condition Government has
taken the following measures to restructure SONELGAZ's capitalization and
to reschedule its debts:
(a) Treasury and other long-term loans amounting to DA 431 mil-
lion were converted into equity as from 1975;
(b) principal repayments to a local bank of long-term loans fall-
ing due in 1975-1977 amounting to DA 102 million would be
deferred, the period of deferral to be determined by 1977
at the latest; and
(c) annual instalments on medium-term loans (total at 1975-end:
DA 174 million) falling due at the rate of about DA 40 mil-
lion a year would be converted into long-term loans as they
become due.
5.07      In 1975 SONELGAZ's estimated cash generation was about 20% of con-
struction requirements as defined as against the required 15%. In 1976 it is
estimated to be 16% of construction requirements. Annex 9 gives SONELGAZ's
income statements for electricity operations for 1974-1976.
5.08      SONELGAZ's estimated debt equity ratio at the end of 1975 was 42/58
as against 50/50 at the end of 1974; the increase in equity vis-a-vis debt
was due largely to increased Government contributions and the above conver-
sion of debts into equity (para. 5.06). The working capital at end of 1975
included large amounts of receivables due by Government departments and
agencies including public sector industries amounting to 45% of annual rev-
enues, reflecting an unsatisfactory condition (para. 5.11). Annex 10 gives
SONELGAZ's balance sheets as of December 31, 1974-1976 for electricity opera-
tions.
5.09      Work in progress figures as a large part of total investment on ac-
count of: (i) slow import clearance procedures; (ii) frequent delays in de-
liveries; (iii) transportation problems due to the extended area over which
construction is carried out simultaneously; and (iv) accounting delays in
transfer of work progress to completed works account. Introduction of effi-
cient methods, e.g., computerized inventory control and better accounting will



- 16 -
improve this situation in time, but the problem will remain at least for the
short term. From about 30% of gross fixed assets in service at end of 1975,
work in progress is estimated to rise to about 50% of gross fixed assets in
service at end of 1980. This is mainly because at end of 1980, the Djidjelli
thermal station, SONELGAZ's largest, with an ultimate capacity of 600 MW will
still be under construction as will the M'Sila thermal station (600 MW).
Gas and Other Activities
5.10      Under Loan 997-AL SONELGAZ agreed to set prices and charges for its
operations other than the sale of electricity and gas at levels sufficient to
ensure that revenues from these operations would at least cover costs includ-
ing reasonably allocated overhead and general charges. However, despite this
agreement, earnings from electricity operations have continued to subsidize
the unprofitable gas and miscellaneous activities. In 1975 SONELGAZ's losses
on natural gas operations were estimated at about DA 8.7 million and on
bottled gas operations at about DA 7.2 million. SONELGAZ has agreed to ex-
tend the covenant under Loan 997-AL to the proposed loan. The financial fore-
casts assume that in line with this agreement and beginning with 1976, the
gas and other activities will cover their losses through rate increases or
subsidy so that they will not be a burden on electricity operations. Govern-
ment has also agreed to take measures to ensure that SONELGAZ's results of
electricity operations are not adversely affected by the results of the other
operations.
Collection of Receivables
5.11      SONELGAZ's collection of receivables for its various services is
very slow. Receivables at the end of 1975 for all activities amounted to
about DA 279 million representing over 160 days of sales; the situation has
been deteriorating steadily since 1973 (130 days). The problem is partic-
ularly acute in the case of government, public bodies and large industrial
customers (mainly Government) accounting for 72% of the amounts. No break-
down of these receivables under electricity, natural gas and other opera-
tions is available.
5.12      Under Loan 997-AL, the Government informed the Bank that it was
considering a program of settlement of debts owed to and by Government agen-
cies and public enterprises and that it expected that the full settlement of
such debts would be accomplished by December 31, 1976. In order to ensure
expeditious collections relating to Government and public bodies, which is a
national problem, Government instituted special procedures in late 1975
whereby "ad hoc" tribunals, after examining claims pronounce judgements which
become executory within 90 days. Under a further decree issued by the Minis-
try of Finance, March 26, 1976, the Treasury itself will settle the claims
that prove uncollectible within the prescribed periods. These arrangements
will allow SONELGAZ to recover its overdue accounts, and action is now being
taken under the new system. Substantial improvement in SONELGAZ's receivables



- 17 -
is expected before the end of 1976. As for future collections, a system
at present under study would allow SONELGAZ to have its bankers collect on
its behalf from central budget appropriations allocated to its customers
under the  Government's control up to 80% of their estimated annual bill at
the beginning of the year. A decision in this respect is expected in 1977.
Government also has agreed to make all arrangements necessary to enable
SONELGAZ to collect promptly its electricity supply bills.
E. Financing Plan for Electricity Operations
5.13      SONELGAZ is now undertaking an ambitious expansion program for
all its operations, electricity being by far the largest; its gross
assets will almost treble over the 1975-80 period as illustrated below:
(DA millions)                              Assets at
1980-end as

5.14      The following table is a summary of the sources and applications for
funds of SONELGAZ for its electricity operations in 1976-1980, the Project
period, assuming the tariff actions and financial measures mentioned in
para. 5.17 and escalation of the program costs (para. 3.05). Annex 11 gives
the sources and applications of funds for electricity operations for 1976-80.

5.15      Assuming adherence to the proposed financial covenant (para. 5.19)
SONELGAZ's net cash generation over the period would amount to 20% of capital
requirements, which is reasonable considering that SONELGAZ is undertaking a
large expansion program from a small base.
5.16      The proposed IBRD loan is assumed to be for US$57.5 million at 8.85%
rate of interest for a term of 15 years including a 3-year grace period and
will meet about 3% of the total requirements. Apart from a modest 2% which
will be financed by consumers contributions, 3% expected to be financed
through suppliers' credits, and a further 2% to be financed by the balance of
Loan 997-AL, all the remaining requirements will be met by Government (13%)
and by loans from national banks (57%). Government has agreed that to the
extent funds available to SONELGAZ are inadequate to complete the Project,
Government would provide funds to insure implementation of the Project.



- 19 -
F. Future Performance - Electricity
5.17      During 1976 SONELGAZ is expected to achieve a self-financing level
of 16% of its construction requirements as defined (para. 5.07), as against
the covenanted 15%, without any rate increase. In order that SONELGAZ may
achieve as agreed (para. 5.18) a rate of return for its electricity activity
not less than the one in 1975 (now estimated at 4.4%) an average rate increase
of 8% would be necessary effective January 1, 1977. For 1978, in order to
achieve the agreed rate of return of 7% (paras. 5.18-5.19), an average rate
increase of about 30% effective January 1, 1978 would be required. This
assumes that SONELGAZ, whose thermal power stations since 1974 have been
substantially converted to natural gas-firing, continues to pay only DA
0.007/m3 or about US4 4.4/106 Btu for natural gas. Total cost per kWh
generated would reduce from DAJ 0.386/kWh (US mil 0.95/kWh) in 1975 to
DA4 0.303/kWh (US mil 0.784/kWh) by 1980; thermal generation would then
amount to 5,925 GWh (92.4% of total generation, of which gas turbines would
generate 1,570 GWh (26.5%) of thermal generation). Assuming the injection of
substantial equity contributions from Government resulting in a three-fold
increase in the total contributions over the Project period (DA 526.9 million
at 1975-end to DA 1,476.9 million at 1980-end) the equity component of SONELGAZ's
capital is expected to range from 54 to 42% during the period, which is satis-
factory. The current ratio is expected to remain at the acceptable level of
1.4:1 throughout this period. The assumptions underlying the financial
statements for electricity operations are given in Annex 12.
G.  Proposed Financial Covenant
5.18      Under Loan 997-AL, SONELGAZ is required to take all steps as shall
be necessary to:
(i)  provide by 1978 a rate of return of not less than 7% on the
average net fixed electricity assets in operation; the rate
of return shall be calculated by taking into accont net
income and operating expenses for electricity, including a
reasonable proportion of other charges for overhead and
general purposes; electricity assets would exclude assets
financed by consumers, but would include a reasonable
portion of headquarter facilities and other assets common
to all SONELGAZ's activities; and
(ii)  until the 7% rate of return has been reached, achieve a
surplus for the electricity activity (before charging
depreciation but after deducting all operating expenses
related to this activity, including a reasonable allocation
of general expenses) not less than 15% of the average cost
of the construction program for electricity (including a
reasonable portion of general construction) for the current



- 20 -
and preceding years; and, except as the Bank shall other-
wise agree, any funds remaining after the contribution to
the Government shall be initially applied to meet the
requirements for electricity operations.
5.19      Government and SONELGAZ have agreed to extend the above covenant
to the proposed loan. For 1977, Government has further agreed to take all
measures necessary to enable SONELGAZ to earn at least the same rate of
return as in 1975. It is estimated that average rate increases of about 8%
effective January 1, 1977 and about 30% effective January 1, 1978 would be
required to meet the objectives during 1977-1978. SONELGAZ is aware of the
significance of revaluation in the context of the rate of return covenant.
However until the practice is implemented through the National Accounting
Plan under Government orders, no isolated action is contemplated at present.
The Plan is still being developed with a high priority to the build-up of
reliable national statistics.
5.20      The existing covenant also requires that, beginning with 1975,
SONELGAZ will provide to the Bank, prior to November 30 of each year, sep-
arate financing plans, approved by the Government, covering the current and
the following years, showing the proposals for:
(i) meeting for the electricity activity the targets for rate
of return, the coverage of the construction program, and
ratio of net revenue to debt service; and
(ii) meeting the operating deficit, if any, for the gas activity,
and the financing gap, if any, for the construction program
for gas.
SONELGAZ has agreed to a similar covenant under the proposed loan under which
SONELGAZ will provide to the Bank, prior to November 30 of each year, separate
financing plans for the electricity and other activities, approved by the
Government, showing the proposals for the following two years for:
(a) achieving the agreed rate of return;
(b) meeting its projected capital expenditures for its
electricity activities; and
(c) meeting the financing gap, if any, for the construction
program for its gas and other activities.
H. Proposed Debt Service Covenant
5.21      Under Loan 997-AL, Government is required to take, not later than
December 31 of each year, starting with 1975, all steps necessary to ensure
that the ratio of SONELGAZ's net revenues for electricity operations for



- 21 -
the current year to the average debt service requirements on loans allocated
to electricity operations for the previous and current years is not less than
1.5 to 1. Government has agreed to extend this covenant to the proposed loan.
I. Audit
5.22      According to the law creating SONELGAZ, a Commissaire aux Comptes
exercises financial controls on behalf of the Government and prepares an
audit of the Company's accounts. This Commissaire aux Comptes is appointed
by the Minister of Finance from the staff of the Government's Financial
Control Department. He is entirely independent of SONELGAZ and reports to
Government. Under Loan 997-AL, the Bank accepted the Commissaire aux Comptes
appointed by Government to be independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Government and the Bank also agreed to consult with each other, at the re-
quest of either of them, on the conditions under which such audit is per-
formed. Government further indicated that it will cause the Commissaire aux
Comptes to perform his audit in such time that the audit report will be re-
ceived in the Bank not later than September of each year. These arrangements
would be extended to the proposed loan as agreed with Government and SONELGAZ.
5.23      Despite the requirement under Loan 997-Al for submission of audited
financial statements to the Bank within a period of nine months after the
close of the year, long delays have been experienced in the past in submit-
ting audited accounts. The above audit arrangements may therefore have to be
changed and responsibility for the audit transferred to Societe Nationale de
Comptabilite (SNC), a state enterprise which is receiving technical assistance
in auditing and financial management under the SNMC Expansion Project (Loan
1185-AL, 1975), when its training program has progressed sufficiently. The
Bank has agreed to exchange views with the Government and SONELGAZ on the
possibility of such a transfer of audit responsibility to SNC including its
timing.
J. Insurance
5.24      SONELGAZ insures its major assets against the usual hazards (fire,
transport, third party, electrical or mechanical damage to machinery, etc.)
through two nationalized companies which reinsure through the world insurance
market. Electrical or mechanical damage to transmission line and substations,
which are the most frequent, are however not covered. A growing proportion
of risks is not not covered either by external insurance or self-insurance.
For example, in 1972 the insurance premium amounted to DA 6 million against a
total net fixed assets value of DA 2,875 million (0.2%); in 1974 the estimated
premium was DA 4.5 million against a total estimated net fixed assets value of
DA 3,027 million (0.15%). The present situation is the result of a reassess-
ment of risks by SONELGAZ in the face of sharply rising costs and the need
for securing maximum protection at an acceptable cost. Given the general



- 22 -
trend of providing greater protection for installations and the higher level
of training and experience among staff resulting in better operational stand-
ards, SONELGAZ's insurance practice is acceptable. The insurance arrangements
will however be kept under review by the Bank during the course of supervision
and the matter dealt with as the situation warrants. Although Government
considers that SONELGAZ should evaluate and assume its own risks, SONELGAZ's
financial dependence on Government implies Government intervention and finan-
cial support should the occasion arise.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Growth
6.01      The trend growth rate of electricity consumption since 1966, when
sales started improving after a stagnant period, has been 11.5% p.a. Various
projections of the future trend have been made by SONELGAZ using different
methods, as described in Annex 13. Power requirements in the southern iso-
lated systems were studied separately, since their interconnection with the
main system is not planned in the next ten years.
6.02      The forecast adopted for system planning purposes leads to a consump-
tion of 5,800 GWh in 1980 (2,312 GWh in 1974), including 300 GWh for the plan-
ned aluminum factory at M'Sila. Since some of the new industrial plants
planned for 1980, including the aluminum factory, have been recently postponed
by about a year, the total consumption assumed for 1980 has been reduced to
5,460 GWh and the total capacity to be installed in that year has been ad-
justed accordingly. The corresponding average growth of total sales for
1974-1980 would be 15.3% without this new consumer. The relatively high
growth rate is in accordance with the rapid industrial expansion planned by
the Government, which is reflected by the growth of SONELGAZ's electricity
sales in 1975 (18.3%). The increase in relative importance of sales to
industry, particularly to the oil and gas industry, is shown in Annex 13,
Attachment 1. The increase in sales is summarized as folows:

B. Least-Cost Development Program
6.03      To meet the forecast power requirements, SONELGAZ is undertaking
a program described in Section 2, which comprises some 2,720 MW of power
plants under construction at the beginning of 1976 or to be started by 1980,
of which steam power plants totalling 137 MW and gas-turbine plants totalling
662 MW are due to be commissioned during 1976-1980. Existing plant, and plant
to be installed during 1976-1980, as well as fuel requirements and cost for
each type of plant, are shown in Annex 16, Attachments 2 and 3.
6.04      The program adopted by SONELGAZ is in accordance with the conclu-
sions of the Bank mission which appraised the Project under the first Bank
Loan to SONELGAZ (Loan 997-AL). Two alternatives for 1978-1983 had been
examined:
(a) Installation of gas turbine plant (320 MW) followed
by steam plant (660 MW)
(b) All-steam development (990 MW)
The equalizing discount rate up to which alternative (a) would constitute the
least-cost development program, was in excess of 20% as of the time of appraisal
(1974). No basic changes have occurred in the meantime with regard to the as-
sumptions used for the comparison. Since the costs per kW for steam power have
increased at a higher rate than for gas turbine, and no other reasonable solu-
tions could meet the rapidly growing demand, the conclusion of the previous
appraisal report with regard to the least-cost solution is still valid. Al-
though present cost to SONELGAZ for gas fuel is about USJ 4/million Btu, in
developing the original program,its sensitivity to fuel prices was tested by
determining an economic price for gas of about USJ 6/million Btu representing
the replacement value of gas fuel at the end of the life of the gas reserves.
The program was found to be insensitive to variations in fuel price.
C. Return on Investment
6.05      Since the Project is an integral and essential part of the invest-
ment program, the return on the proposed program for the period 1976-1980 was
estimated by calculating the discount rate which equalizes the present values
of the costs and benefits streams attributable over time to the program. The
costs are the attributable financial costs (for generation, transmission and
distribution), adjusted for taxes and internal transfers. The benefits com-
prise the revenues from incremental power sales attributable to the program.
The estimated rate of return, which may be extended to the Project, at present
rates for electricity is 5.4% (see Annex 16, Attachment 4). Although this
rate of return calculation is of little significance as a measure of the
economic worth of the program, the low rate of return does indicate that, on



- 24 -
the average, the prices charged for electricity are less than incremental
costs. This reflects the high rate of inflation, and the fact that SONELGAZ's
electricity tariffs have not been changed since 1965. To the extent that
there is any demand elasticity, such a pricing policy might tend to encourage
wasteful consumption of electricity and overinvestment in the sector. However,
a systematic analysis of both tariff levels and structure, which is being made
by SONELGAZ, would be needed for a firm conclusion on this.
6.06      Assuming a 30% rate increase for electricity, the rate of return
would be about 10.5%, and with the rate increases suggested by the mission (8%
in 1977, 30% in 1978 and 5% in 1980) in order to allow SONELGAZ to achieve the
financial performances agreed upon, as shown in Section 5, the rate of return
would be about 19.3%. These rate increases would not be expected to affect
demand significantly. Sensitivity tests showed that with the suggested rate
increases, the rate of return would be about 2% percentage points lower if
foreign exchange is valued 15% higher, which is equivalent to about 10% higher
capital costs. A combination of the suggested rate increases and 10% higher
capital costs and operation and maintenance cost would lead to a rate of
return of 16.9%.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Government will:
(a)  take measures to ensure that SONELGAZ's results of elec-
tricity operations are not adversely affected by the results
of its other operations (para. 5.10);
-(b) make all arrangements necessary to enable SONELGAZ to collect
promptly its electricity supply bills (para. 5.12);
(c)  to the extent funds available to SONELGAZ are inadequate
to complete the Project, provide funds to ensure implementa-
tion of the Project (para. 5.16);
(d)  extend to the proposed loan the covenants under Loan 997-AL
regarding the financial targets for SONELGAZ for 1976 and
thereafter and take all measures including tariff measures
necessary to enable SONELGAZ to achieve these targets
(paras. 5.18-5.19), and
(e) extend to the proposed loan the covenant under Loan 997-AL
in regard to SONELGAZ's debt service requirements (para. 5.21).
7.02      SONELGAZ will extend to the proposed loan the covenant under Loan
997-AL in regard to:



- 25 -
(a) setting up prices and charges for operations other than the
sale of electricity and gas (para. 5.10);
(b) earnings (para. 5.19);
(c) submission of separate financing plans for electricity, and
other activities (para. 5.20); and
(d) audit of SONELGAZ's financial statements (para. 5.22).
7.03      The Bank has agreed to exchange views with Government and SONELGAZ
on the possibility of transfer of responsibility for audit of SONELGAZ's
accounts to SNC including the timing of such transfer.
7.04      Subject to the above, a Bank loan of US$57.5 million equivalent to
SONELGAZ is recommended for a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace.  The
loan could be effective within three months of signing of the Loan Agreement.

ALGERIA
Legal Background Information
1.        Before nationalization, supply of electricity in Algeria was
provided by more than 20 private companies under their respective conces-
sions. Following the nationalization in France (by Decree 46-628 of
April 18, 1946, as modified by Decree 46-2298 of October 21, 1946), Decree
47-1002 of June 5, 1947 (as modified by Decree (without number) of
September 17, 1947) applied nationalization for Algeria creating at the
same time l'Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA) as the sole public entity
to serve the sectors.
2.        Subsequent to Algerian independence, EGA was dissolved and Societe
National de l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ) was created by Ordinance 59-
59 of July 28, 1969, which transferred all assets, rights and obligations
to the new company. SONELGAZ's statutes are annexed to this ordinance.
3.        Regulations for the employment of personnel (Statut National du
Personnel des Industries Electriques et Gazieres), which date from 1946
(French Decree 46-1541 of June 22, 1946, declared applicable to Algeria
on June 5, 1947, and promulgated on July 10, 1947), are still applicable,
except that basic remuneration schedules were revised on June 6, 1963, and
that many special allowances have been added of general (13th month, employ-
ment allowance) and particular (productivity, travel distance, location of
employment, training, settlement, etc.) nature.
4.        SONELGAZ's regulations for its concession and operations, defining
its rights and duties and those of its customers, as well as its tariffs,
are laid down in two "Cahier des Charges", one covering the 60-kV supply,
and one covering 30 kV and lower tensions, in the form of an agreement
between the Minister of Industry and Energy and EGA, dating from March 3,
1965.
5.        In accordance with Decree 63.201 of June 1963 and the Ordinance
of May 27, 1966, SONELGAZ insures its assets and other risks with the
Caisse Algerienne d'Assurances et de Reassurances and the Societe Algerienne
d'Assurances.

APPRAISAL OF
SECOND POWER PROJECT (SONELGAZ)
ALGERIA
Assumptions Underlying Financial Statements for Electricity Operations
General
SONELGAZ has three principal operations; (1) generation and
distribution of electricity; (2) distribution of natural gas, and
(3) distribution of bottled (liquefied petroleum) gas. For purposes
of these financial statements, electricity is treated as a separate
entity. Costs of common facilities (capital and operating costs) have
been allocated to the three operations on an equitable basis. Accord-
ingly Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Sources and Applications of
Funds have been prepared separately for electricity operations.
A. Income Statements
Sales
Rate of growth of electricity sales is estimated as follows:
1975       1976        1977        1978       1979        1980
18%        20%         14%         14%        14%         13%
Revenue
The report assumes rate increases averaging: 8% effective
January 1, 1977, 30% effective January 1, 1978 and 5% effective
January 1, 1980.
Common Services
Common services comprise mainly buildings and yards, motor vehicles,
net sale of appliances, services to consumers and salvage. These costs are
allocated to the three different operations based on past experience of the
use of common services by the different facilities.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs are based on the following existing prices which are
Government-controlled:
Natural gas         -         0.072 cDA/therm
Puel oil            -         0.47
Gas - oil           -         1.17



ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 2
Inflation
All cash operating costs except fuel and salaries have been
increased to reflect inflation at the following estimated rates. Fuel
costs which are determined by Government in accordance with its pricing
policies may not reflect the impact of inflation; salaries which were
increased 24% in 1974 are assumed to continue without further increases
through 1980 except for a 10% increase in 1978.
1975      1976       1977      1978       1979      1980
(Base)
100     110.2     118.1      128.2      139.4     151.5
Depreciation
The straight-line method is applied. The overall rate of 3.46%
in 1975 is estimated to rise to 4% in 1980 reflecting the shorter service
life assigned to new facilities.
Income Taxes
SONELGAZ is liable for income taxes at 20% of net income after
interest.
B. Balance Sheets
General
The construction program is specific by divisions; common
facilities are allocated in accordance with the estimated use of these
by each division.
Interest During Construction
Interest during construction is capitalized at a rate approximating
the average cost of borrowed funds. The amount capitalized each year reflects
the very high proportion of work in progress throughout the entire period on
account of supply problems, and the extensive area over which construction
activities are carried out.
Long-Term Debt
In line with the Government policy, the following assumptions
are made: all long-term borrowings except Loan 997-AL and the proposed
Bank loan are on terms now prevailing in Algeria for long-term loans viz
19 years including 3 years of grace and interest at 5.5% p.a. Suppliers'
credits assumed to be at a rate of interest of 8% average.
The proposed Bank loan amounting to US$57.5 million equivalent
(DA 234 million) would be at 8.85% for 15 years including 3 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT (SONELGAZ)
ALGERIA
Justification of Project
Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.   The 1976-1979 program is designed to meet the continued growth of
demand on the power system 4n  Algeria.   The trend growth rate of
sales since 1966 has been 11.5% p.a. For forecasting purposes,
SONELGAZ has taken the following approaches:
(a) Analogy with the past by extrapolation of statistical data for
1966-1974. From this analysis, three projections were derived,
representing high, low and median forecasts of electricity
consumption.   The median forecast based on this method implies
an average growth of 11.7% in 1975-1985. This growth rate
appears low in comparison with the past trend in other countries
with a similar development statistics for 1960-1970 of the uN
Economic Commission for Europe for countries with per capita
consumptions not exceeding 500 kWh (which is the case of Algeria
till at least 1980) show average growth rates of over 12%, and in
some cases even 15-16% (Bulgaria, Greece and Romania).
(b) A regression model based on the relationship between electricity
consumption and gross domestic product over time. This method
implies a growth rate for electricity consumption of 13.4% for
the period to 1980, assuming a 11% growth rate of the gross domestic
product.
(c) Analysis of the 17 sectors of the economy, as divided for statis-
tical purposes, and separate consideration of domestic consumption
and power requirements of major new industrial consumers, in
accordance with the national plan., This method resulted in
forecast consumption for 1980 of about 7,500 GWh (22% average
growth), including 300 GWh for the planned aluminum factory at
M'Sila which has not yet been approved by the Government.
2.        The reselts of the above methods were discussed vith S(WKLGAZ
during appraisal and the mission agreed on adopting for system planning
purposes a total consumption of 5,800 GWh for 1980 (16.6% average growth),
including the aluminum factory at M'Sila. In the meantime some of the new
industrial plants, including the aluminum factory, have been postponed by about
one year. Accordingly the estimated total consumption has been reduced to 5,460
GWh, which corresponds to an average annual growth of total sales for 1973-1980
of 15.3%. This relatively high growth rate is in accordance with the rapid
industrial expansion planned by the Government, which is reflected by the growth
of SONELGAZ's total electricity sales in 1975 (18.3X) and the high growth of



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 4
electricity consumption in industry, particularly in the oil and gas industry
(39.5% for 1966-1974 and 36% estimated for 1974-1980).
Least-Cost Development Program
3.        After the completion in 1976 of the 2x137 MW steam power plant at
Skikda only gas-turbine plants are provided in the interconnected system
till 1980, comprising 230 MW in the Algiers area (financed by the 1974 Bank
loan) and 90 MW in the western part of the country (Tiaret).   The next steam
power plant provided in SONELGAZ's investment program is the 4x150 MW plant
at Djidjelli, of which the first two units are due to be commissioned in
1981. Another steam power plant is planned in the Oran region (final capacity
5x150 MW), of which the first stage (2x150 MW) would be commissioned in 1982-
1983.
4.   The structure of the proposed program is basically the same as it was
assumed in 1974 in the Project under the first Bank loan to SONELGAZ (Loan
997-AL). The comparison with an all-steam development which has been made
under the previous loan for the period 1978-1983 showed that the proposed
solution was more advantageous, the equalizing discount rate up to which it
would constitute the least-cost development program being in excess of 20%
as of the time of appraisal. No changes in the basic assumptions have
occurred since 1974 which would modify the order of economical merit of the
possible alternatives for generating plant. The specific cost of steam plant
has increased since 1974 at a higher rate than the specific cost of gas
turbines. It is estimated that for the considered unit size (150 MW) and fuel
(natural gas) the specificcost of steam plant has almost doubled from about
DA 1,200/kW to about DA 2,300, whereas the specific cost of gas-turbine plant,
which is little sensitive to unit size, has increased in average by some
40% from about DA 875/kW to about DA 1220/kW. This favors the adopted
program.
5.        Although SOKICAZ presently pays about  USo4/million Btu for 8a
fuel, In order to test the sensitivity of the program to fuel "est, an eeenwfe
cost was derived by determining the value of gas on the date at which foreign
exchange cost would be incurred due to the use of gas for power. This is
not the date (or dates) on which the gas would actually be used, but the
date on which--as a result of this usage--the gas would not be available for
export. Assuming for liquefied gas a range of US$1.50-2/million Btu f.o.b.
Algerian port, and  US30/million Btufor transporting the gas to the
liquefaction plant and the costs of liquefaction, the well-head value for
natural gas would be US$1.20-1.70/million Btu. If the rate of gas exploitation
for current-uses and exports (excluding the proposed power program) remains
at the assumed 1980 level (54 billion m3) the run-out date would be 2030.
On this basis, it was estimated that the current marginal cost of natural
gas supplied for power generation would be the equivalent of about US6/million
Btu. Since it seems likely that extraction costs will rise over time, it
has been assumed that this cost rises at 1% per annum over the life of the
power plants included in SONELGAZ's development program. For the economic
evaluation of the power program in the previous appraisal, it was assumed
that the rate of exploitation may be higher, reducing the life of the gas
reserve by about half, which would result in a run-out date after about
25 years.  Since the total amount of gas required for power generation is
not high in relation to the rate of exploitation, the effect of this usage
is to reduce exports by this amount in the year 2000. Each considered



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 4
alternative of power plant was debited in that year, therefore, with the
foreign exchange cost (at US$1.70/million Btu) of its cumulative gas con-
sumption to that date.   The rate of exchange used for the basic evaluation
was of about DA 4 to the US$ and the effect of 50% higher rate also was
tested. The conclusion was that the choice of program was not sensitive
to fuel costs within these assumptions.
6.        The development of the transmission system is practically not
influenced by the differences between alternatives for generating plant, since
the location and size of the power plants are imposed by the location of new
concentrated consumers (steel plants at Djidjelli and Marsat-Mostaganem,
aluminum plant at M'Sila).
Return on Investment
7.        The return on the whole proposed power program for the period 1976-
1980 was estimated by calculating the discount rate which equalizes the
present values of the cost and benefit streams attributable over time to
the program.   Since the Project is an essential and integral part of this
program, it is not possible to calculate a separate rate of return, but by
inference this is the return of the program. The costs are the attributable
financial costs of the program (for generation, transmission and distribution),
adjusted for taxes and internal transfers.   The costs of SONELGAZ's development
program for 1976-1980 are shown in Annex 5. Subtracted from these costs
were the cost of the expansion program for gas and the cost of facilities to
be completed after 1980. Also excluded were import duties and taxes assumed to
average 8% of total construction cost because this constitutes only an internal
transfer to the economy, as well as price contingencies. Personnel costs for
the electricity activity were reduced by 4% for the tax on salaries for which
SONELGAZ is liable. Fuel costs were assumed in accordance with Attachment 3
of this annex. The increment in power sales (rising from a base of 2,735 GWh
in 1975 to 5,460 GWh by 1980) and assumed to remain constant from 1981 onward
provide the incremental revenue derived from the execution of the expansion
program to meet the incremental growth of sales.   Sales taxes of 8% charged
to consumers were added, as they are a demonstration of the willingness of
consumers to pay for electricity.
8.        As shown in Attachment 4 of this annex, the estimated rate of return
on the development program is 5.1%.   The relatively low rate of return reflects
the high increase of prices since 1973, and the fact that SONELGAZ's electricity
tariffs have not been changed since their Implementation in 1965.   To the
extent that there is any demand elasticity, such a pricing policy might tend
to encourage wateful consumption of electricity and overinvestment in the sector.
A systematic analysis of both tariff levels and structure, which is being made
by SONELGAZ (With EdF as a Consultant) under the first Bank Loan, would be
needed for a firm conclusion on this.
9.        Assuming that present rates for electricity are at least 30% below
marginal cost, the rate of return would be about 10.5% and with the rate increases
assumed by the mission (8% in 1977, 30% in 1978 and 5% in 1980) in order to
allow SONELGAZ to achieve the financial performance agreed upon, the rate of
return would be about 19.3%. These rate increases would not be expected to affect



ANNEX 13
Page 4 of 4
demand significantly.   The rate of return, on less or more favorable assumptions
would vary as follows:
Without Rate Increase                    Rate of Return
(%)
(a)  Base case                                                 5.4
(b)  10% higher capital cost                                   4.5
(c)  10% higher 0 & M cost                                     5.0
(d)  Combination of b and c                                    3.9
With Rate Increase
(e)  30% rate increase                                        10.5
(f) Rate increases assumed by the mission
(8% in 1977, 30% in 1978, 5% in 1980)                    19.3
(g)  Combination of e and b                                   17.3
(h)  Combination of e and c                                   18.8
(i)  Combination of e and d                                   16.9
All combinations of the assumed rate increases (f) and other more or less
favorable assumptions which can be foreseen, lead to a rate of return not lower
than 18%. The rate of return is not sensitive to increased cost of fuel,
because of its relatively insignificant share in the total costs.
Since the rate increases assumed to be necessary for SONELGAZ to fulfill
the financial covenant were established taking into account assumed increases
in cost up to the date of implementation, a 30% rate increase for the calculation
of the rate of return on SONELGAZ's power program at 1976 prices would be a
more realistic assumption.   Consequently, the rate of return is expected to
range from 10% to 15%.
