F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective was to assist the Government in enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro
Manila residents by improving the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system, with better
opportunities for access to public transport and non-motorized transport, the dominant transport modes of low-
income residents.

Revised Project Development Objective (as approved by original approving authority)

There was no revision of the Project Development Objective.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Global Environment Objective of the Non-Motorized Transport Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant
supported component was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of zero-emission bicycle and
pedestrian transport in the City of Marikina as an alternative to greenhouse gas-emitting motorized transport. A
second objective was to demonstrate and publicize the benefits and viability of bicycles as an alternate transport
mode to encourage replication of this pilot program in other parts of Metro Manila, elsewhere in the Philippines,
and in other countries.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background. Among the priorities of the Medium-term Philippine Development
Plan (MTPDP), the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) highlights the following strategic
objectives for Metro Manila: (i) strengthen metropolitan governance; (ii) improve effectiveness of public
transport; (iii) promote a sustainable strategy for future commuter rail; and (iv) integrate environmental
objectives into urban and transport sectors. To develop a long-term strategy, the Government undertook
in 1999 the Metro Manila Urban Transport Integration Study (MMUTIS), which defined a Master Plan
to 2015 and a Medium-Term Transport Development Plan (MTTDP) from 1999 to 2004. The Metro
Manila Urban Transport Integration Project (MMURTRIP) is one of the projects recommended in the
MTTDP.

Urban transport congestion, with its related impacts, is one of the most pressing problems in the
Philippines. The key area for concern is Metro Manila, a massive urban area that accommodated 10.2
million people in 1997, and has by now grown to more than 11.5 million. Metro Manila produces over
one-third of national Gross Domestic Product, and contains 17 local government units (LGUs)--16 cities
and one municipality. Economic prosperity has accelerated motorization over the last years with a
growth of around 6%1of registered vehicles per year.

At appraisal, the urban transport and development in Metro Manila were characterized by five
challenges: (i) poor traffic management, (ii) lack of access from outer areas; (iii) an underdeveloped
road network hierarchy; (v) air pollution; and (vi) lack of an urban transport strategy in Metro Manila.
To address these issues, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) focused its strategies on improving
transport infrastructures by providing necessary transport access to fast growing outer areas, particularly
to the low income population that depends on public transport modes.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Government requested Bank assistance for a transport project to
help address the transport problems in Metro Manila and demonstrate the role of Government and the
importance of complementary investments in enhancing the full potential of public or private
investments. The MMURTRIP therefore proposed the following: (i) traffic management by improving
jeepney, bus, and light rail transit interchange on the Light Rail Transit (LRT) Lines and South Super
Highway; (ii) access from outer areas by implementing a series of projects on the key accesses to the
Marikina Valley; (iii) improve the road network hierarchy by investing in strategic secondary roads; (iv)
reducing air pollution by means of a non-motorized transport (NMT) component; and (v)
implementation of an urban transport strategy by developing the capacity of the Metropolitan Manila
Development Authority (MMDA) 2 in the area of traffic and civil works contract management.
Furthermore, the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank recommended in its Country
Assistance Review that the World Bank remain active in the transport sector because of the sector's

important strategic role, institutional weaknesses, and the need for public investment, as well as the
considerable experience of the World Bank in transport. MMURTRIP was seen therefore as a key
vehicle for sustaining the Bank’s involvement in the country’s urban transport and development
program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective of the MMURTRIP was to assist the Government of Philippines in
enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila residents by improving the
operational efficiency and safety of the transport system with better opportunities for access to public
transport and non-motorized transport, the dominant transport modes of low-income residents.

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) outlined in the main text of the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD, page 3) are not fully consistent with those indicated in the Project Design Summary (page 30,
Annex 1), which are more detailed. The original KPIs in the main text are:
(a) Reduced travel time experienced by public transport users on the project corridors;
(b) Sustained proportion of public transport use;
(c) Improved satisfaction of public transport users;
(d) Effective coordination mechanism in place between the key agencies and LGUs; and
(e) Effective traffic management (TM) and enforcement measures planned and designed by the relevant
    agencies.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The main global environment objective of the Non-motorized Transport (NMT) component, supported by
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of
zero-emission bicycle and pedestrian transport in the City of Marikina as an alternative to greenhouse
gas-emitting motorized transport. A second objective is to demonstrate and publicize the benefits and
viability of bicycles as an alternative transport mode to encourage replication of this pilot program in other
parts of Metro Manila, elsewhere in the Philippines, and in other countries.

The PAD provided two GEO indicators: (i) increase in non-motorized transport mode share for trips
within Marikina; and (ii) increase in nonmotorized-public transport (NMT-PT) combined mode share for
trips originating in Marikina.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO remains unchanged. There was also no formal revision of the key indicators. A new indicator
on safety (reduced number of reported pedestrian and motor vehicle accidents in the project corridors)
was added in 2009 through the Aide Memoire agreed by the Task Team and the implementing agencies.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target groups of the project are the following:
Public transport users. The project was mainly targeted at public transport users, many of whom belong
to the lower income groups. Although almost all households use public transport in some form, the
lower-income groups primarily use buses and jeepneys. A 1997 Traffic Survey indicated that 62% of
the middle and upper classes use their own vehicle for commuting to work and only 38% use public
transportation.

Pedestrians. Space for pedestrians made it possible for people to switch short-distance trips to walking
trips, potentially reducing motorized congestion, and allowed safe access to employment and other
facilities for the large percentage of the poor who walk.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

The Project had five components:
(a) Traffic Management Improvements (Original cost US$13.5M - IBRD US$9.7M and GOP
    US$3.8M) on the LRT Line 2 corridor; the EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue)-LRT Line 3
    corridor; and the Bicutan and Alabang interchange on the southern corridor.
(b) Marikina, Rizal, Pasig (MARIPAS) Access Improvements (Original cost US$48.2M - IBRD
    US$29.5M and GOP US$18.7M) in the Marikina Valley, including the Marikina Bridge and Access
    Road component and the Marcos Highway and Ortigas Avenue Extension.
(c) Secondary Roads Program (Original cost US$32.7M - IBRD US$19.2M and GOP US$13.5M) for
    15 road sections, including pavement rehabilitation, drainage and sidewalk improvements, traffic
    management, and construction of missing links for comprehensive corridor treatment so that
    secondary roads can fulfill their function on the road hierarchy.
(d) Non-motorized Transport (Original cost US$1.5M - GEF US$1.3M and Marikina City US$0.2M)
    in the City of Marikina in Metro Manila under Global Environment Facility funding.
(e) Institution Building/Technical Assistance (Original cost US$1.1M - IBRD US$1.0M and GOP
    US$0.1M) to establish and strengthen institutions responsible for future urban transport management
    in Metro Manila.

Components a, b and c included the installation of traffic signals. A total of 75 intersections were to
receive new signals or an upgraded system which would link into the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive
Traffic System (SCATS)3.

1.8 Revised Components

Several project components were dropped or transferred, representing about 43% of the original project
cost.




3
  SCATS is a traffic signal system developed in Sydney, Australia which uses traffic cameras or induction loops installed
within the road pavement to count vehicles at each intersection, and adapts the timing of traffic signals in the network
through a centralized data center.

   The National Roads Improvement and Management Project (NRIMP) aims to ensure the preservation of an improved
 national roads system (NRS) in an environmentally, socially and financially sustainable manner. This project is funded by
 the Bank and includes three phases: design (NRIMP-1), initiation (NRIMP-2) and operation (NRIMP-3).

1.9 Other significant changes

Loan Extensions. The closing date had to be extended twice. The first extension was a 2-year extension
from March 31, 2007 to March 31, 2009, to allow the completion of major components of the project
(e.g., traffic management measures in EDSA, drainage works along the completed Marikina Bridge and
access road, and construction of secondary roads). The second extension was to March 31, 2010, which
was requested to complete the remaining subprojects that were on-going at that time and other activities
that were perceived to slip beyond the March 31, 2009 loan closing date. A 9-month extension of the
GEF grant (April 1 to December 31, 2007) was requested to conduct publicity campaigns for the
bikeway program in order to replicate the bikeway network in neighboring townships.

Reallocation of Loan Proceeds. The massive cost overruns and the canceling of project components
required a major reallocation of loan proceeds to Category 1 (works). This was done on August 27,
2009 with a simple exchange of letters between the Country Director and the Government.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated quality at entry as Satisfactory.

The background analysis for project preparation was relatively sound. The PAD properly identified
the major problems facing the region’s transport system at that time, and the Government’s strategic
objectives and proposed actions on the identified urban transport issues. The MMUTIS was instrumental
in providing the background analysis for the Project. The MMDA was the lead agency tasked to
coordinate and monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the MMUTIS.

Lessons learned from previous and/or ongoing similar projects, such as the Urban Transport Project in
Vietnam, were incorporated in the Project design: a) effective traffic management interventions can
substantially improve urban congestion, b) modernizing urban transportation requires not total
motorization but the appropriate integration of walking, non-motorized transport, and motorized
transport, and c) problems associated with resettlement and land acquisition in Metro Manila--The
components of this Project therefore sought to minimize the need for resettlement. However, conflict
over land valuation, incentives for encroachments on right of way, and enforcement of tenure rights
were issues to be addressed, and essential for real improvements in urban transport congestion.

Sufficient attention was not given in relating the Project to the larger systemic issues in
Metropolitan Manila such as the urban growth, the spatial location of people, the impact of urban
planning and regulations on the transport system, and the projected investment needs. Sector policy
analysis was not part of project preparation.

The Results Framework is inadequate for meaningful assessment of the outcomes. The PAD does
not provide measurable indicators to assess for example enhanced economic productivity and quality of
life of Metro Manila residents, or improvement in the transport safety.

Project components were reasonable but with a relatively short implementation schedule. While
components identified under the Project were reasonable in relation to achieving the PDO, the original
                                                   5
implementation period of 5 years was too short. It is apparent that it was unrealistic to expect the
implementing agencies (IAs) to implement, within 5 years, civil works for more than 21 roads, one
major bridge, and 66 kilometers of bikeways; with two road components involving land acquisition and
with broadly defined institutional building activities, and in an environment where the IAs are relatively
weak, in an urban setting and in a typhoon-prone region. The implementation arrangements were
complex. It involved multiple agencies with limited experience, if at all, in urban transport. And in the
case of the MMDA, little experience in implementation of civil works contracts. It also involved the
difficult task of coordination among these agencies, and by these agencies with other key stakeholders,
such as the cities and municipalities where the secondary roads were to be improved.

Inadequate attention was given to capacity of implementing agencies. There was an apparent
mismatch between the design needs and the implementation capacity of the DPWH, MMDA and the
City of Marikina. The project required these entities to carry out a variety of activities, many of which
had never been tried by them. Implementation could have benefited from activities designed to allow
capacity build up while the agencies started to implement the activities.

Strong Government commitment to the project at preparation dissipated during implementation.
Numerous workshops and consultations among the IAs, key oversight agencies (NEDA, DOF, DBM,
etc.), Metro Manila LGUs, and the private sector yielded an agreed list of investments and activities to
be supported by MMURTRIP. The city government of Marikina demonstrated exceptionally strong
commitment to the NMT component of the project, funding on its own preliminary diagnostic work and
focus group discussions with stakeholders. These processes were not carried through during
implementation including forming LGU counterpart teams for the Project. The IAs also failed to set-up
the Resettlement Implementation Committee and Grievance Redress Committee.

Safeguards requirements at appraisal were substantially met. A well crafted Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) was prepared to deal with two components that involved resettlement and land acquisition,
and a policy framework for any potential resettlement and land acquisition issues.

Given the Project would enhance the urban environment for pedestrians and public transport users and
improve public transport services and air quality, no adverse environmental impacts were envisioned at
the time of appraisal. All project components complied with all environmental clearance requirements of
the GOP and the World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.

Risks were identified but mitigation measures not adequately provided. The PAD identified the
relevant risks but sufficient and effective mitigation strategies were not provided. The timely availability
of counterpart funds is an example. The mitigation measure was that counterpart funding is part of the
multi-year program discussions of the DPWH (and presumably the other IAs) and the Government in
their annual review and consultations. But broad discussions on the budget did not translate into assured
budget allocations even for agreed activities. Another risk that should have been addressed at appraisal
is the capacity of the implementing agencies. Careful planning and sequencing of activities, and
prioritizing pre-implementation preparatory work, could have mitigated the risk to components being
carried out by inexperienced units. Workshops to familiarize project staff of design parameters,
fiduciary requirements, plan for the resettlement activities, etc. should have been made integral to the
design of the project.

2.2 Implementation

The Project has helped to improve access from the periphery, increase travel speeds in project corridors
and improve safety to public transport users, and demonstrated how transport projects can transform the
urban landscape and encourage walking in highly trafficked corridors.

While there was no formal restructuring of the project, there have been quite a few changes within the
project components: several project components were dropped entirely and one major component was
transferred to another project mainly due to cost overruns.

Overall, implementation can be characterized by lengthy delays, substantial cost overruns, coordination
difficulties, a constant battle for budget support, lack of continuity in project management and staffing,
inability of the agencies to muster broad support to the Technical Assistance (TA) component, and the
failure of the project to adjust to implementation problems.

Delayed start and implementation of many activities due largely to the following:

(a) Indecision at the MMDA on the design of its project components. In June 2002, the new
    MMDA management initiated a review in the design of the Traffic Management Improvements
    component. The review went on for over five years, before the main contract for the LRT Line 3 was
    signed in November of 2007. The MMDA project restructuring aimed to expand the improvements
    in EDSA Line 3 corridor and enhance the design standard for the Bicutan Interchange. To finance
    the additional works required in these project corridors, the LRT Line 2 Corridor and Alabang
    Interchange components and four Secondary Roads subcomponents under MMDA were dropped
    from the project and the scope of the traffic signalization component was reduced. Traffic
    engineering works and equipment estimated at around US$11 million at appraisal were almost
    completely dropped from the project.

   Design changes that were introduced attempted to reinforce both the primary through-traffic function
   of EDSA and facilitate pedestrian access by replacing signalized controls at intersections with
   staggering U-turn slots and providing pedestrian over-bridges and other facilities. The changes made
   in the design and the process by which these were carried out have caused significant delays in
   implementation of this component.

   In addition, the conduct of the Parcellary Surveys of LRT Line 2 and Line 3 (EDSA) to serve as
   basis to reclaim right-of-way to allow widening of sidewalks caused considerable delays in project
   implementation. It took almost five years before MMDA was able to get a consultant on board to
   carry out the survey, which finally started in July of 2006 and went on until December of 2008.

(b) Changes in engineering designs. The design of several components had to be revised to take into
    account the actual physical conditions of the sites and project needs. The Pasong Tamo secondary
    road was delayed due to the inclusion of drainage improvement in the works as requested by the City
    Government of Makati. In addition, the MMDA proposed additional work on EDSA to address the
    pedestrian and modal interchange needs. While design cannot completely foresee future site
    conditions, there are requirements that could have been possibly addressed at the development stage.
    These include the drainage and pedestrian needs in several road components.

                                                    7
(c) Procurement problems. Delayed procurement of civil works for the MMDA components was due
    to the restructuring of its components which resulted in revisions of detailed designs, bid documents
    and costs. Moreover, the delays in the selection of consultants for the planned studies (MMDA
    Institutional Restructuring, Urban Transport Survey and Development of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
    for Metro Manila) were due to instructions from the National Economic and Development Authority
    (NEDA) to prioritize the Urban Transport Survey. All studies were eventually dropped as the
    Department of Budget and Management (DBM) did not release any funds. Of the components
    implemented and procured by the DPWH, two were not completed: (i) Marcos Highway5 - the Bank
    objected to the award of contract because the winning bid had come in at 36% over the estimates;
    and (ii) DMMA Extension Project 6 - the Bank objected to the Bid Evaluation Report (BER) as
    DPWH did not follow some agreed procurement steps. The discussions on the harmonization of the
    Borrower’s and the Bank’s procurement guidelines also contributed to the delay as it confused the
    IAs as to the procedures to be followed7.

(d) Acquisition of right-of-way. The procurement process for the Marikina Bridge and Access Roads
    took some three years from Board approval, and when the contract was finally signed in June of
    2004 the contractor was not able to start construction because implementation of the RAP was not
    yet completed due to the complex resettlement and expropriation environment in the Philippines.
    The resettlement involved around 470 informal settlers and 35 registered land owners in Marikina
    and Quezon cities. The delays were primarily due to the length of negotiation and expropriation
    proceedings, the difficulty of finding in-city relocation, lags in the completion of documentation by
    the project affected persons (PAPs), and the processing of the DPWH and the DBM of payments to
    compensate the PAPs’ replacement costs. The Task Team with the DPWH creatively addressed the
    slow pace of resettlement implementation by dividing the project into three segments and issued
    Notices to Proceed (NTP) per segment as resettlement was completed or reached a certain agreed
    threshold. The Bank finally issued the NTP for the bridge section (segment B) in December of 2004.
    The NTP for the other two sections was eventually given and construction of the component was
    completed in May 2007.

(e) Significant cost overruns. The assumptions made at appraisal for the design and cost of the civil
    works components were outdated by the time the actual works were executed between 2003 and
    2010. The detailed design had to take into account further road deteriorations and unit costs had
    increased substantially. A report commissioned by the Bank in June 2008 estimated the total cost
    overrun of selected project components (those completed by the time of the report) at US$32 million
    or 89% of appraisal cost estimates. The reasons for these cost increases can be summarized as
    follows: (i) cost increases between the PAD cost and Detailed Design (DD) cost due to the lack of


5
    The Marcos Highway project was subsequently dropped from the project and the implementation is transferred to NRIMP 2.

6
  Another tender for the Don Mariano Marcos Avenue (DMMA) Extension project was discussed but the timing was not
feasible (the Loan was to close within three months at that time). DPWH decided to proceed with the award using own funds.

7
  Because many government procedures are now acceptable to the Bank (as reflected in the bid documents), the IAs in many
instances thought that they could follow the government’s procurement rules. The result is that they carried out steps that
were not acceptable to the Bank, thus requiring another round of tendering.


                                                             8
   proper preliminary design in the feasibility study, which did not identify the necessary engineering
   work required for the project, resulting in a gross underestimation of costs in the PAD (accounting
   for about 65% of total cost overruns); (ii) price difference between the detailed design estimate and
   the actual contract price because the DD cost estimate did not reflect the market prices especially
   when the bidding process started long after the DD was completed (about 15%); and (iii) the cost
   overrun incurred by work variations during the implementation of the contracts due to inadequate
   investigation during the detailed design stage of the sub-soil conditions and deterioration of the road
   conditions as well as the adoption of new regulations/standards issued by MMDA (about 20%).

(f) Coordination difficulties between the implementing agencies, LGUs and other
    government/private agencies.        Carrying out works and other project activities required
    coordination at various levels: DPWH needed to seek permits from the MMDA to construct on
    project corridors. Implementation of the secondary roads also entailed working closely with a
    number of LGUs. At times, political alignments get in the way of timely implementation of certain
    road improvement activities (as support by local executives is necessary to ensure smooth
    implementation of contracts, as well as in the acquisition of rights of way, if needed). Requests from
    the LGUs for additional works and relocation and removal of affected utilities, posts, other affected
    structures and obstructions (owned or maintained by private firms or households in the right-of-way)
    caused significant delays in implementation (i.e., secondary roads component). The lack of a
    functioning steering committee did not help the situation.

(g) Lack of timely releases in Government budget allocations for the Project. DPWH and MMDA
    especially had to contend with severe budget constraints that adversely affected the execution of the
    project. While DPWH, owing to its large portfolio, generally managed to secure its annual budget
    needs (albeit mostly released late), MMDA had to constantly justify its annual needs. The
    unpredictability of budget releases made planning and budget programming difficult. All remaining
    project activities under MMDA during the second loan extension were eventually dropped because
    the DBM did not release the required counterpart funding to MMDA.

(h) Lack of continuity in Implementing Agency management and staffing. Frequent changes in
    management at DPWH and MMDA also affected project implementation. During the entire 9 years
    of implementation, DPWH saw the following changes in leadership: 4 Secretaries, an equal number
    of Undersecretaries, and 7 Project Directors, and in MMDA: 4 Chairmen, 3 General Managers, and
    3 Project Directors. This also resulted in lack of continuity in staff in the Project Management
    Offices (PMOs) – new staff had to be recruited and needed to familiarize themselves with the project
    and also caused some changes in design.

(i) Failure to implement the TA component. Project designers conceived the component to address
    the general lack of systematic thinking on urban transport needs of Metro Manila. The component
    was thus kept as an allocation, with activities to be specifically identified during implementation.
    But there was lack of consensus on which activities to be carried out. During the second extension
    period, MMDA proposed long-term planning for Metro Manila, pre-investment studies for mass
    transport (BRT) and alternative access road (tunnel) along a major corridor, and to update demand
    surveys. However, it was unable to muster support from the oversight agencies for most of the
    activities and only managed to carry out a couple of exposure trips to learn about mass transport
    experiences in other countries.

                                                    9
(j) Failure to adjust despite the implementation problems. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) was carried
    out but missed the opportunity to assess how the Project fared in terms of achieving its PDO and to
    complete the proposed restructuring of MMURTRIP. The MTR in March 2005 was conducted
    mainly to discuss the project restructuring proposal of MMDA and address issues of slow
    implementation and disbursement, and project cost overruns, with a view to upgrading the project
    implementation status from Unsatisfactory. These efforts were apparently successful, as the project
    implementation was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory and then to Satisfactory within a year. The
    MTR however did not succeed in providing an adequate assessment of the Project’s performance as
    a whole, specifically in terms of achieving its PDO. The focus was on the traffic impacts of the
    proposed improvements under the MMDA restructuring proposal for its Traffic Management
    component and how to measure these impacts to ensure that the proposed restructuring would meet
    the development objective of the Project. This approach, however, led to the Task Team missing out
    on opportunities to review the Results Framework, which at that time lacked baseline, progress-to-
    date and end-of-project target values. While there was an attempt by the IAs to formally restructure
    the loan given the significant reduction of the project scope (largely due to cost overruns), the
    process of preparing the request and review of documents for the loan restructuring took some time,
    i.e., almost two years. The proposed restructuring of the project was not completed since the Bank
    did not receive any formal request from the Government. The timing became inappropriate given the
    project was nearing its closing date.

No QAG assessment was undertaken on the quality of project supervision.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The PDO definition of “enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila
residents? was too broad and aimed at a higher level objective. This shortcoming was not a rare case
since at the time of project appraisal it was common to define PDOs in rather general terms. Moreover,
the PAD failed to provide adequate measures to track the PDO. The PAD did not provide an indicator to
measure changes in the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila residents. In addition,
the proxy indicators selected (i.e., reduced travel time, sustained proportion of public transport use and
improved satisfaction of public transport users) lacked baseline data and end-of-project target values.
Surveys to collect data on public opinion and public transport usage were to be conducted at project
inception and one year after works completion on project corridors. There was no survey at inception
and the survey at project completion was shelved because DBM did not release the required counterpart
funding to MMDA. Therefore, there are no data to measure this indicator.

The lack of both baseline and target values make the assessment of outcome virtually impossible.
However, it was only in the supervision mission of September 2009 that the issue was seriously
approached. The Task Team and the IAs agreed to revise the Results Framework adopting the
indicators as outlined in the PAD, and adding an indicator for road safety (i.e., reduced number of
reported pedestrian and motor vehicle accidents in the project corridors). The inclusion of the new
indicator on road safety however was not done formally and the target value for this indicator was not
specified. The agreed indicator is a refinement to the results framework that supported the same project
objective and targeted the same beneficiaries as originally approved by the Board.




                                                   10
Furthermore, the IAs initiated the setting up of an M&E system but this was limited only to information
generation on travel time and speed, making it difficult to have an effective results framework that could
be readily updated. Data on other key indicators (e.g., production capacity, level of satisfaction, level of
service of walkways, etc.) were not given attention and thus not collected.

In summary, while physical progress of project implementation was adequately monitored, progress in
achieving the PDO was not.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards: The Project complied with the Bank’s safeguards policies set forth in OP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment). Overall, the Project has not resulted in any significant adverse impact
on the environment during construction. MMURTRIP has generally brought about direct and indirect
environmental benefits to the pedestrians and public transport users with the improved urban
environment, public transport service ancillary facilities, and landscaping and greening programs.

Social Safeguards: A comprehensive policy framework for land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation was developed by the DPWH for MMURTRIP in April 2001. Only two project
components involved resettlement and land acquisition, i.e., Marikina Bridge and Access Roads and
Don Mariano Marcos Avenue Extension. The latter was eventually dropped from the loan. A RAP for
each road component was prepared in accordance with the Bank’s policies set forth in OP 4.12
(Involuntary Resettlement). Social safeguards were rated as Satisfactory throughout the project. While
land acquisition and resettlement took an inordinate amount of time, eventually most of the claims were
settled and the project affected persons received just compensation. The DPWH however still has
accounts payable and will need more money for ongoing expropriation cases as the courts make their
final judgments. A final and very detailed report on resettlement has been submitted by the External
Monitoring Agent for the Marikina Bridge and Access Roads construction.

Financial Management (FM): The Project generally complied with the financial covenants8. Project
Management Reports were prepared by each IA and submitted quarterly to the Bank. During
implementation, Financial Management was mostly rated as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory.
Only at the end of 2002 the financial management rating for both the Urban Roads Project Office
(URPO) and MMDA was briefly changed to Unsatisfactory, when several issues surfaced with respect
to proper reporting in the Project Management Reports, notably the reconciliation of figures and
statements did not match and there was no adequate FM staffing, in particular in MMDA. After Bank
regular follow-ups and discussions with both agencies, all irregularities were eliminated.

Procurement: The MMURTRIP generally complied with specified procurement procedures but with
delays. Procurement ratings for MMURTRIP were satisfactory until October of 2003 when they were
downgraded to Unsatisfactory, due to the delays in procurement and decision making and delays in
awarding of contracts. The Unsatisfactory status was maintained until June of 2005, more because of
the slow procurement process rather than particular procurement issues.

 Findings are consistent with the Country Report on the Thematic Fiduciary Supervision Assessment for Road Sector in
Philippines which was prepared in February 2009.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The September 2009 supervision mission voiced some concern that there was only a very modest budget
allocated for the maintenance of the MMURTRIP road projects and the newly constructed bridge. The
mission also noted that in certain cases, maintenance has been assumed by LGUs and that the newly-
created assets are not given adequate maintenance attention.

MMDA has turned over the responsibility for the Pasong Tamo Secondary Roads component to the City
of Makati. Similar arrangements will be made for the three secondary roads of the EDSA LRT Line 3
corridor. Some of the facilities installed under the Bicutan Interchange component will likewise be
turned over to the LGU concerned. However, the footbridge will remain under the responsibility of
MMDA as will the facilities for the EDSA LRT Line 3 corridor. MMDA asserts that it has adequate in-
house capacity and personnel who, on a regular basis, monitor the condition of the facilities. In addition
MMDA has its own fabrication unit that can replace damaged facilities. MMDA has its own internal
sources of revenue to fund the cost of maintaining the facilities.

DPWH has stated that these are new investments and the budget for their maintenance would have to
compete for funding support from the limited maintenance budget envelope. As many other roads are in
dire need of repair and maintenance the completed MMURTRIP projects would be expected to be given
a low budget allocation priority. Nevertheless, DPWH provided a table, which shows that the Marikina
Bridge would receive an annual maintenance budget of about US$5,300 and the 12 km Quirino highway
about US$14,600. This amount appears to be adequate as it is for routine maintenance only.

Marikina City has implemented the bikeways program with such enthusiasm that there appears little
danger that it will let decay the newly created assets. The new mayor of Marikina City is committed to
continue the bikeways program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

While the PDO (enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila residents)
aimed too high, the stated means of “improving the operational efficiency and safety of the transport
system in Metro Manila? was set at the right level and is still highly relevant to the current country and
Bank assistance strategy. The PDO remains also consistent with the updated 2004-10 MTPDP which
supports sustained investments in infrastructure, particularly in continuing integration of the transport
system. The CAS for 2010-2012 includes in its indicative financing plan an urban transport project for
Metro Manila and other cities under the objective to assist the Government to improve the investment
climate. With an annual growth of about 5.4 % of registered vehicles within the National Capital
Region and of about 6% in all regions combined, the need for continued investments in transport
infrastructure is obvious.

Likewise, the GEO remains valid today. The project design and objectives are in line with the MTPDP
goal to sustainably manage the environment and natural resources to safeguard livelihoods as well as
with the Bank’s CAS strategy to reduce green house gas emissions through expansion of mitigation
programs in key sectors such as transport, power and waste management sectors.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PDO stated in the PAD is too broad and aimed at a higher level. The achievement of which maybe
difficult to directly attribute to the project. No attempt was made to assess impact on economic
productivity and quality of life of residents in Metro Manila. Moreover, the lack of baseline data and
targets for several project KPIs makes it difficult to provide a firm assessment of the performance of the
project in achieving the PDO and GEO. Therefore, the review endeavored to judge on the basis of the
key performance indicators which are proxy indicators for assessing achievement in improving the
operational efficiency and safety of the transport system in Metro Manila.

Despite implementation problems faced by the project, MMURTRIP produced significant results
particularly with respect to mobility and safety, with the construction of key infrastructure and
geometric improvements in the major corridors of Metro Manila. These include the bridge and access
roads (with a total length of 3 km) that eased congestion affecting access of the eastern part of the region
to Metro Manila, upgrading of 13 important primary and secondary roads (with a total length of 76 km),
and improving access to and safety of public transport users of mass transport systems with the
construction and rehabilitation of 7 footbridges along some major corridors (with a total length of 1,285
linear meters) and improvement of sidewalks for pedestrians (9,385 square meters of concrete
pavement), see Annex 2.

Improved mobility and safety for public transport users and are very important especially in the context
of Metro Manila where 89% percent of all motorized trips are through public transport, and most public
transport users belong to the lower income groups. There are over 11 million pedestrians and road users
residing in Metro Manila, over 4 million (37%) of whom were poor9. MMURTRIP was also successful
in piloting a bikeways project in the country with the implementation of the NMT component in
Marikina City, leveraging grant resources to construct some 52 kilometers of bikeways in that city.

The project achievements in relation to the PDO include the following:

(a) Reduced travel time experienced by public transport users on the project corridors. Travel time along
    EDSA (Metro Manila’s main corridor) decreased by almost 10 minutes (from 60 to 50 min). In the
    MARIPAS corridors, the average travel time for trips from LRT Santolan to C-5/Libis substantially
    decreased by 16 minutes (from 18 to 3 min) and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave. Extension) by 14
    minutes (from 34 to 20 min). The reduction in travel time in secondary roads was recorded at 6
    minutes (or 22% from the baseline) on average.
(b) Sustained proportion of public transport use on the project corridors (achieved at 89% of all
    transport use). This figure however is at the regional level (i.e., Metro Manila) and not specifically
    applicable to project corridors. The computed value nonetheless represents a good sample of the

    demand for public transport for the project since it includes EDSA, the most important highway of
    the metropolis. EDSA carries an average of 323,000 vehicles per day10.
(c) Improved level of service of pedestrian overpass. The 43% increase in average pedestrian volume
    count in the pedestrian overpasses or footbridges covered by the project has improved pedestrian
    access to these facilities. This also contributes to the reduction of pedestrian and vehicle conflict by
    removing about 530,418 pedestrians daily from the roadway through the construction of footbridges.
(d) Decrease in average travel cost for trips from and to Marikina Valley. The average travel cost for
    trips from LRT Santolan to C-5/Libis decreased by 55% and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave.
    Extension) by 42%.
(e) Reduced number of reported pedestrian and motor vehicle accidents in the project corridors (a safety
    indicator added in 2009). Along EDSA, the number of reported motor vehicle accidents decreased
    by 14% while pedestrian accidents decreased by 47% from 2005 to 2009. In the Bicutan
    Interchange, the number of motor vehicle accidents increased from 3 to 13 while the pedestrian
    accident remained at 1 (non-fatal). This could be partially attributed to the increased number of
    motor vehicles plying by the corridor and therefore higher probabilities for vehicular conflicts or
    accidents. There was however no data on safety indicators gathered for other project corridors.

Another important outcome is the high economic returns to investments made under the project. The
EIRRs remained high (post implementation) because of the higher actual traffic growth of vehicles, road
users and pedestrians (relative to the projected traffic at the time of the study) which more than
compensated the increase in investment costs. Along EDSA, most of project gains are derived from time
savings brought about by footbridge construction and sidewalk improvements, from a reduction in
carriageway infringement and the improved traffic speeds in the intersections. The project resulted to a
40% reduction in waiting time for the road users and almost zero waiting time for the pedestrians using
the footbridges along the EDSA corridor intersections. The Marikina Bridge users now enjoy time and
cost savings because of the shorter trip distance the new route offers. Transport users of secondary roads
similarly benefit from time and operating cost savings as a result of the increased travel speed, increased
road capacity and improved pavement surface. Other benefits which are difficult to quantify include
improved urban environment and accident cost savings as a result of improved safety for road users and
pedestrians in the project corridors.

While the Project fell short in achieving its desired outcomes under the Institutional Component, there
were significant contributions made as a result of the project. MMURTRIP introduced to the IAs new
concepts for urban roads development. Whereas before they focused only on geometric improvements,
MMURTRIP encouraged combining these geometric improvements with other features such as
pedestrian facilities, urban landscaping, etc., integrating safeguards measures (traffic management
during construction, planning and implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, and
coordinating implementation of road infrastructure with local plans). There is now greater recognition of
putting priority to public transport use in the choice of investment decisions, to pedestrian safety in the
design of road and road improvement projects, and to the principle of “movement of people? rather than
“movement of vehicles? in addressing congestion.

Overall achievement of PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Achievement of Global Environment Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The primary Global Environment Objective has been fully met with the completion of the 52 km
bikeways network. The modal share of bicycle ridership in Marikina city increased from 4.2% in 2001
to 7.9% in 2010, exceeding its target by 3.4%. However, the Project fell short in achieving its second
GEO indicator. Instead of an increase in the nonmotorized transport-public transport (NMT-PT)
combined mode share for trips originating in Marikina, the recent survey showed a slight decrease in
NMT-PT mode share by 1%. This could be attributed to the significant decrease in public transport for
bus trips and huge increase in motorcycle trips from 2000 to 2010. The gradual construction and
operation of the bikeways system has seen positive results in terms of the increasing modal share of
bicycles particularly in areas where low income communities are located. The city continues to construct
additional bikelanes. This component is being promoted by the World Health Organization as
“environmentally healthy and sustainable transport? and the Marikina Bikeways Project is considered
worth emulating by other LGUs in the Philippines and in other countries. To encourage replication of
this project to other cities in the Philippines, the Marikina City Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidebook was published to assist local planners and engineers to design and construct adequate bicycle
facilities for their own localities. The City of Marikina continues to disseminate the benefits and
viability of bicycles as an alternative transport mode to encourage replication of this pilot program in
other cities.

Overall achievement of the GEO is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

This section presents the economic analysis after implementation following the methodology used in the
PAD.

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was not calculated for the entire project, but rather on
specific components (i.e., Traffic management improvements, MARIPAS Access Improvements, and
Secondary Roads) as it is rather impractical to do so in the other two components (NMT and institution
building). This is made more appropriate for the post-implementation analysis given the significant
change in project scope (i.e., major project components were dropped), the increase in costs of some
components and delays in the completion of certain project activities. Furthermore, the traffic situation
significantly changed over time in the project corridors.

The economic evaluation is based on the conventional cost-benefit analysis where benefits are mainly
derived from the savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and the value of time (VOT). To be
conservative in the economic analysis of the traffic management improvement component (i.e., Bicutan
and EDSA LRT 3 corridors), only the benefits from the VOT for the pedestrians were considered. The
VOC and VOT of the vehicles were excluded since these benefits are not entirely attributable to the
project (especially in the case of the EDSA LRT 3 corridor).

The following table shows the summary of the economic analysis for the various sub-projects.

 *The computation for the actual EIRR for the Traffic Management Improvement only covers the value of
 time for the pedestrians. The analysis was done in three major intersections in EDSA, namely: Taft
 Avenue, Ortigas Center, and Quezon Boulevard.

 The table shows that the EIRRs remained generally high. A high EIRR is typical in traffic management
 projects with high economic benefits for the road users and pedestrians relative to the project investment.
 For EDSA LRT 3 corridor, the EIRR remained high when subjected to sensitivity analysis (see Annex
 3) given a relatively high pedestrian traffic. The Bicutan and Ortigas Avenue Extension components
 also showed good results. The improvements in the secondary roads also produced very high returns,
 particularly for D. Romualdez, Legarda, Quezon and Quirino Highway. There is some deterioration,
 particularly with respect to VOC numbers, for SLEX West and Pasong Tamo as actual traffic volumes
 were lower than the projected traffic at the time of the study. However, the economic returns are
 relatively satisfactory for SLEX West and Pasong Tamo components using both VOT and savings in
 VOC for the road users.

 3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 The PDO and GEO are still highly relevant to the current country strategy and Bank assistance strategy.
 The project set out to improve the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system in Metro
 Manila and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of zero-emission bicycle and
 pedestrian transport in Marikina City. Based on figures on key associated outcome targets, efficiency
 gains were achieved, namely in terms of increased travel speed (thereby in savings in travel time and
 vehicle operating costs). Investments in pedestrian bridges, waiting bays, sidewalk improvements, etc.
 helped improve safety of pedestrians and public transport users. Access from the eastern part of the
 metropolis was greatly enhanced with the construction of a major bridge. The reduced travel time and
 cost experienced by public transport users in the project corridors generated high economic rates of
                                                     16
return, even exceeding some of those forecasted in the PAD. The high EIRR of the projects
implemented also shows that in general the use of resources was efficient. The introduction of new
concepts for urban roads development (i.e., pedestrian facilities, urban landscaping, noise-pollution
control, among others) is recognized as a major contribution of the project to DPWH and MMDA
operations. The project also successfully demonstrated NMT as environment-friendly, cost effective
means of transport. Several components (mostly from the secondary road program) were dropped due to
cost-overruns and the Project did experience implementation problems. The achievement of overall
outcome therefore is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project was not designed to cover poverty impact, gender aspects or social development. However,
because of its wide target population, the project outcome has benefited the poor by reducing the time
and money they spend on transport. In terms of time savings, the economic analysis concluded that
substantial reduction in travel time is observed in several components, such as those in the MARIPAS
area (where the Marikina Bridge and access road were constructed), namely LRT Santolan to C-5/Libis
(decrease of 84%), and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave. Extension (40%). The time saved can be used
by commuters for other productive purposes. For vehicle users, the reduction in VOC can be substantial
as a result of the improvements in some project corridors. For example, the average travel cost for LRT
Santolan to C-5/Libis decreased by 55% and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave. Extension) by 42%.
Savings in VOC is based on the VOC of equivalent additional length of good/fair road of completed
project if the vehicle would have travelled during the “before project? scenario.

The project was also assessed in April 2010 through another review process in the Bank, i.e., a Gender
and Development Assessment. The review concluded that the implementation of the project is gender-
sensitive. The MMURTRIP addressed gender issues in project management, monitoring and evaluation.
The Committee on Gender and Development, the group responsible for promoting gender equality in the
agency, has competent members and has mobilized resources to support strategies that address gender
issues or constraints to women and men’s participation during project implementation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project allocated resources for institutional strengthening. Implementation of the component did not
yield the desired outputs (and therefore did not contribute to the institutional goals of the project).
However, there are significant contributions made as a result of the project.

(i) There is now greater recognition of putting priority to public transport use in the choice of
     investment decisions, to pedestrian safety in the design of road and road improvement projects, , and
     to the principle of “movement of people? rather than “movement of vehicles? in addressing
     congestion.
(ii) There is greater attention given to safeguards in the design and implementation of urban roads and
     transport improvement projects. The introduction of noise-pollution control and better traffic
     management during construction are recognized as major contributions of the project to DPWH and
     MMDA operations.


                                                   17
(iii) The MMDA reports that the experience it acquired through the Project helped in its implementation
      of its other infrastructure projects, such as the C-5 Interchange Project and Commonwealth Avenue
      Development Project.
(iv) Construction supervision skills of DPWH were improved by allowing DPWH PMO to carry out
      supervision of two secondary road components (SLEX/East and West Service Road and Quirino
      Highway).
(v) To some extent, the project also facilitated better coordination (and helped formalize the working
      arrangements) between DPWH and other entities (e.g., LGUs and private utility companies) in the
      construction of geometric and landscaping of urban roads. It also facilitated cost-sharing between
      LGUs and DPWH for construction and maintenance of roads.
(vi) The learning-by-doing approach adopted in the implementation of the NMT component allowed the
      City Government of Marikina to build its capacity to plan, develop and implement the bikeways
      program in the city.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The Project has generated jobs during construction. For MMDA components alone, a total of 800 jobs
were created during the construction of the project components.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

The risk to the development outcome is Significant for the following reasons:
(a) As long as there is no urban transport master plan and MMDA does not take a lead role in
    coordinating investments in Metro Manila, urban transport investments will continue in a piecemeal
    approach, with a prevalence of mega-projects coming as unsolicited proposals from the private
    sector.
(b) Inadequate budget releases to fully implement the components dropped or deferred as well as for
    the cost of maintaining the assets provided or improved by the project can impinge on the ability of
    the project to create desired impacts on urban development.
(c) With the number of registered vehicles growing at close to 6% per year, there is a danger that the
    increasing traffic will again lead to congestion, negating the time and travel cost savings achieved
    under the project.

An appropriate follow-up project could mitigate the above risks to some extent by insisting on an
adequate development framework, by strengthening MMDA (as it should have been done under the
present project), and by further promoting public transport (e.g., Bus Rapid Transit).

The risk to the global environment outcome is Significant given that the motorbike registration in the
Philippines has been growing at close to 10% per year, crowding out the use of non-motorized bicycles.

The new government of Marikina City nonetheless reinstated the Marikina Bikeways Office (MBO,
which ceased operation in March 2008 after the GEF grant ended in December 2007). The MBO is now

                                                  18
carrying out information dissemination activities, promotion and enforcement of bicycle safety,
operational maintenance of bikeways facilities, among others, and is initiating scale up of the program,
including providing advice to other cities that are planning to build bikeways.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The July 2001 Quality at Entry Assessment, carried out by the Bank’s QAG, concluded that the project’s
quality at entry was Satisfactory, but on a four point scale rather than on the six point scale now in use.
The PDO definition of “enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila
residents? was too broad and aimed at a higher level objective which is beyond the project interventions.
This approach was not a rare case since at the time of project appraisal it was common to define PDOs
in rather general terms.

The ICR rating slightly differs on account of what it considers features in design that impacted
implementation performance: (a) the weak monitoring and evaluation arrangements. There were no
proper baseline data and target value and no indicator on safety; and (b) inadequate attention given to
the capacity of MMDA to implement an urban transport project (as urban road improvements before
MMURTRIP implementation were addressed by the DPWH). An analysis of the MMDA capacity
would have been useful in developing a technical assistance to help the agency carry out the components
assigned to it.

While recognizing these limitations, MMURTRIP’s overall development objective was clearly aligned
with both Government and World Bank strategies on improving the urban transport condition in Metro
Manila. The relatively sound background analysis for project preparation helped in this alignment of
objectives and identification of reasonable components for the project. The strong Government
commitment to the project at preparation (though dissipated during implementation) helped in the
establishment of workable implementation arrangements among the IAs. This has facilitated IAs in the
implementation of their project components without compromising environmental and social safeguards
as well as fiduciary concerns. The Project however experienced delays in the completion of these
components.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

During the nine years of project implementation, there were some 15 formal supervision missions. In
addition, there were audio and teleconferences between Washington and Manila to discuss issues as
soon as they surfaced. However, the frequent change of Task Team Leaders (4 changes) may have
negatively impacted project implementation. The skills mix of the Task Team was adequate, with social,
environmental, procurement and financial management specialists participating at most supervision
missions. Aide memoires and Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) are well written and candid, but the
PDO and Implementation Progress ratings were not always appropriate (overly optimistic).



                                                   19
It is also observed that:
(i) There was very little progress in the institutional development component. The Task Team should
       have exerted more effort to promote this component.
(ii) It was known early on that the results framework was vague and lacked target values, but only at
       the very end of the project did the Task Team make an effort to correct the situation but still
       without formal revision. The PAD had specified surveys at project inception to establish baseline
       data, but these were never carried out.
(iii) Letting MMDA go on for almost five years to redesign the MMDA project components, without
       intervening more forcefully.
(iv) The cancellation of the traffic signals component in exchange for some U-turn facilities. The team
       does not appear to have argued at least for a thorough analysis of the suitability of the U-turn
       schemes and overall impact not only to the corridors where these are introduced but also to traffic
       flows in their immediate environs. A comparative analysis (between the adoption of U-turn
       schemes and signalization) would have been useful for better traffic management planning and in
       making related investment decisions.
(v) Failure to address emerging key issues during Mid-term Review (e.g., strengthening of the Results
       Framework, and completion of the process of loan restructuring given the significant reduction in
       the scope of the project that time).
(vi) Lack of effort to urge MMDA to convene the Steering Committee after project preparation.

It should be noted however that supervision was difficult at the critical years of implementation (i.e.,
2003 when leadership in DPWH and MMDA changed and the then management of these agencies put
the project implementation on hold), Despite the constraints (e.g., delayed or even lack of budget
releases, lack of attention by agency heads during leadership transition, etc.), the supervision effort of
the Task Team is recognized, particularly that it was able to work with the PMOs in successfully
completing the big component of the project, i.e., the Marikina Bridge and Access Road. At that time,
the bridge was the only foreign-funded project of the DPWH to be implemented with relatively low cost
and time over-runs, despite resettlement delays.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating for Bank performance for quality at entry is Moderately Satisfactory while the rating for
supervision is Moderately Unsatisfactory. Since the overall project outcome is in the satisfactory range,
the ICR Guidelines indicate that the Bank’s overall performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Government had shown strong commitment to the Project during preparation and appraisal. During
implementation, the Government sustained its efforts to improve the urban transport condition in Metro
Manila and remained committed to its MTPDP goal of continuing integration of the transport system to
improve investment climate. It supported the Project but the lack of sufficient counterpart funding,
which is a common problem affecting all foreign-assisted projects, significantly impinged on the ability
of MMDA to implement the remaining project activities during the last year of implementation,

                                                   20
resulting in the cancellation of these activities. The budget problem was borne by the seeming lack of
commitment to the Project when it was most needed. In spite of MMDA’s persistent follow-ups for the
necessary counterpart funding from the DBM, the Government did not provide the requested budget nor
was a formal response issued to that matter until loan closure. While no formal reasons were provided,
the overall tight budget situation then and the seeming difficulty of the MMDA leadership to muster
support of the oversight agencies to the project are seen as major factors in this regard.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

DPWH performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The DPWH showed a strong commitment to
achieving the PDO during project appraisal and implementation. DPWH performance in terms of ability
to implement and sustain the supported investments, and compliance with project requirements,
including fiduciary and safeguards requirements is considered Satisfactory. Despite the delays in the
procurement process and land acquisition, DPWH’s procurement performance was relatively
satisfactory and the civil works under its responsibility were of good quality. In addition, the agency was
able to satisfactorily supervise the works of its two secondary road components as validated by an
Independent Technical Audit report commissioned by the DPWH. The DPWH however fell short in
assuming its role as the lead agency, especially in terms of coordinating the project activities among
agencies and consolidating the reports from the other implementing agencies (i.e., environment
monitoring reports, among others) for submission to the Bank.

MMDA performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The quality of the MMDA components
carried out under the project is satisfactory, but there is no justification for the fact that it took MMDA
more than six years from Board approval to the start of construction for the main civil works contract
(EDSA LRT Line 3). MMDA failed to play its role as coordinator and Chair of the inter-agency
Steering Committee. The transfer of the traffic management function to MMDA has improved the
capacity of the agency in this respect. In addition, the MMDA gained extensive experience and training
in the implementation and monitoring of road infrastructure projects funded by the Bank.

Marikina City performance is rated Satisfactory. The City Government of Marikina implemented the
GEF financed project components with enthusiasm and drive, after some initial difficulties in the
project’s design stage and after taking a deliberate experimental approach to see which design would be
best for local conditions. The bikeways project required a nine month extension only, rather than the
three years for the main project. The City Government provided around US$1.8 million as counterpart to
the GEF grant, which is 10 times as much as what was originally required from the city at appraisal.
Marikina remains committed for the maintenance and expansion of the bikeways network, the latest of
which is the completion of additional 400 meters of bikelanes in Park 23, Barangay Marikina Heights.
The City also continues to carry out dissemination activities to promote and replicate the program in
other cities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating for Government performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory while the rating for implementing
agencies performance is Moderately Satisfactory. Since the overall project outcome is in the satisfactory

                                                    21
range, the ICR Guidelines indicate that the Borrower’s overall performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Future urban transport projects in Metro Manila and other urban centers in the country can benefit from
the following lessons from the nine years of MMURTRIP implementation:

(a) Implementation arrangements should match institutional capacity. A realistic assessment of the
    resources available, skills and commitment of the IAs could have led to better project
    implementation structure. Where IAs have no experience in implementing similar projects, project
    design should be simple and institutional arrangements straightforward. Components should be
    assigned to agencies that are best equipped or positioned to implement them (e.g., DPWH for those
    involving complex designs, LGUs for secondary roads, MMDA for footbridges and simple works,
    etc.). Activities selected should require less coordination work, and if coordination is unavoidable,
    coordination arrangements should be formalized. Components can also be so designed that will
    allow agencies to increase capacities while implementing these components. In an environment
    where several agencies are involved in implementation, project components are more likely to be
    successfully carried out if defined specifically in project documents. The TA component of
    MMURTRIP intended to address institutional strengthening and policy advocacy of MMDA. But
    because the component was broadly defined, consensus on specific activities to be supported was
    difficult to obtain (and were therefore not carried out). This was a missed opportunity in terms of
    generating analyses for projects that could help address institutional, policy and investment needs for
    urban transport development in the country.

(b) Clearly defined OM is important to guide implementation. The problems experienced by the
    Project underscores the need for an Operations Manual (OM) that can serve as a guide in the
    implementation of a complex project such as MMURTRIP. The OM should clearly specify the roles
    and responsibilities of the implementing agencies. It can also ensure consistency in the application of
    procedures, consolidation of required outputs, and continuity in the event of management and
    personnel changes during project implementation. The manual can also instruct how to develop
    maintenance and budget plans and other maintenance activities.

(c) Fiduciary and safeguards requirements should be established, understood and agreed prior to
    implementation. Ideally spelled out in the OM, these requirements should be clearly identified prior
    to project start up. Extensive training of project personnel on procurement, financial management,
    social and environmental policies and procedures to be followed is critical. Procurement plans
    should be realistic and closely monitored by the Task Team to ensure timely completion of tenders
    (MMURTRIP encountered lengthy and even unsuccessful procurement). The Project experienced
    considerable delays in the implementation of the Environmental Management Plans and RAPs,
    which resulted in the delayed completion of some project components. Guidance from the Task
    Team on how these safeguards documents are developed and implemented would be extremely
    helpful.

(d) Targets and performance indicators should be defined and agreed at appraisal. MMURTRIP
    was developed way before the current results framework regime came into force. The PAD thus
    lacks the rigor and clarity a meaningful results framework can provide. This explains the difficulties

                                                    22
   experienced in the assessment of the project outcomes. In the absence of such a results framework,
   the IAs seemed to have lacked the seriousness in collecting data, let alone strive to complete project
   activities to achieve some development outcomes. At appraisal, it is important that the indicators be
   well defined and understood by the project stakeholders and that the baseline data are established.
   The OM can also be instructive on how the data is to be collected, by whom, and how often. The
   indicators should be few, attributable to the project and the data is easy to collect.

(e) Credible cost and schedule estimates are essential. MMURTRIP experienced significant cost and
    time overruns mainly due to underestimation during project appraisal and detailed design stage of
    construction costs and overly optimistic project schedules. As a result, several project components
    representing about 43% of the original total project cost were dropped or transferred to another
    project. An adequate preliminary design should be included in the feasibility study, which would
    reflect the appropriate estimation of costs in the PAD. In addition, the detailed design cost estimate
    should be updated to reflect market prices especially when the bidding process starts long after the
    detailed design was completed. An adequate investigation during the detailed design stage for the
    sub-soil condition and deterioration of the road conditions should also be undertaken to minimize
    cost overruns incurred by work variations during the implementation of the contracts. Thus, it is due
    diligence on part of the Bank to carefully review cost estimates and require an updated FS, if
    necessary, before loan finalization. Global experience even suggests that completing the Detailed
    Engineering Design before loan finalization would be ideal. Moreover, projects experiencing high
    cost overruns should be formally restructured at mid-term review.

(f) Right-of-way (ROW) issues deserve careful attention and decisive resolution. While RAPs and a
    Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy Framework were prepared for the project,
    these did not facilitate the ROW acquisition and resettlement process as expected. The condition for
    the completion of resettlement, including compensation, prior to the issuance of bidding documents
    proved to be unrealistic because of the project context (highly urbanized) and the type of assets
    affected (residential cum commercial buildings). The policy framework also did not anticipate the
    filing of expropriation cases and therefore, was silent on a procedure for handling them. A more
    thorough stakeholder analysis and participative planning prior to decision on whether to include
    components requiring ROW acquisition could have produced innovative solutions. MMURTRIP did
    provide useful lessons in this regard: In the case of the Marikina Bridge and Access Roads, the Task
    Team and the DPWH addressed the slow pace of resettlement implementation by dividing the civil
    works project into three segments and issued notices to proceed per segment (i.e., when agreed
    milestones in the resettlement process were reached).

(g) Agility, resolve and responsiveness are key to effective supervision. Frequent changes in
    component design, in leadership and management of the implementing agencies (resulting in
    changing priorities) call for creativity on the part of Task Team to offer options to achieve the
    project objectives even with changing conditions. In MMURTRIP’s case, the Bank mostly waited
    too long for the client to decide on whether to continue with project components. While being
    flexible, the Bank ought to show resolve in timely resolution of issues. For example, if certain
    technical or design solutions are being changed, the Bank should exercise due diligence and agree
    only to the extent that these do not compromise the desired outcomes. It also calls for very close
    monitoring of agreed actions during supervision missions. The timely conduct of midterm reviews
    can be very useful as it allows for early resolution of implementation bottlenecks and the opportunity

                                                   23
   to review the relevance of the project design, components, objectives, and determine the likelihood
   of timely completion of activities within the project life. Had this been the case for MMURTRIP, a
   formal restructuring of the project could have been carried out and mitigated the costly delays
   encountered.

(h) Participation of beneficiaries and stakeholders (e.g., road user groups) in project design,
    implementation, and monitoring and evaluation can help ensure successful implementation. A
    seeming shortcoming in the entire project cycle is the lack of formal participation of key
    stakeholders in design and implementation. While the Project developed a plan for stakeholder
    consultation during appraisal, the execution of this plan has been inadequate. Most of the committees
    or teams envisioned in the plan were not organized or were non-functional. These committees could
    otherwise have been useful in resolving implementation issues, particularly concerning resettlement
    and ROW problems. In addition, enlisting organizations that are major stakeholders is also helpful,
    e.g., chambers of commerce as many commercial establishments are impacted by, say, reclamation
    of sidewalks; LGUs whose support to pedestrianization objectives is critical; multi-stakeholder
    groups such as the Road Watch that is involved in monitoring the performance of the DPWH in the
    delivery of quality national road services; etc. These groups can be effective lobby parties that can
    prompt timely decision by government of questions such as budget allocation for the project
    components.

                                   Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Summary of project outputs which reflect the linkages between the intermediate outcome
   indicators per component (referred as output indicators in the PAD) and the PDO outcomes


Component A: Traffic Management Improvements. Moderately Satisfactory. The Project achieved
two of four indicators,: i) the level of service of corridors measured by average travel speed of all-
through vehicles along the EDSA and Bicutan Interchange has increased by 57% and 28%, respectively;
and ii) the level of service of pedestrian overpass has also improved with the reduction of pedestrian and
vehicle conflict by removing about 439,761 pedestrians daily from the roadway through the construction
of footbridges. However, there was no data provided for the indicators “improved level of service of
public transport queuing areas? and “improved level of service for buses and jeepneys along the
corridors measured in terms of productive capacity average of bus and jeepneys?. This is on account of
the dropping LRT Line 2 and the Alabang Interchange components (and using freed-up resources to
finance the additional works required in EDSA LRT Line 3 and Bicutan Interchange components).

Component B: MARIPAS Access Improvements. Moderately Satisfactory. The two performance
indicators (i.e., reduction in travel time and travel costs) were achieved. This component supported a by-
pass road with bridge structure to relieve the Marikina Bridge, Aurora Blvd.-Katipunan Avenue
intersection. The construction of the bridge and access roads carried large volume of traffic resulting in
substantial reduction in travel time as well as travel costs. The reduction in average travel time for trips
from and to Marikina Valley across modes (i.e., travel time from LRT Santolan to C-5 Libis and C-5 to
Tikling (Ortigas Ave. Extension) decreased by 84% and 40%, respectively) and the reduction in average
travel cost for trips (i.e., travel cost from LRT Santolan to C-5 Libis and C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave.
Extension) decreased by 55% and 42%, respectively) have contributed to the attainment of improved
operational efficiency in the covered area.

Component C: Efficient Organization of the Secondary Roads in a Hierarchy. Moderately
Unsatisfactory. One of the two performance indicators was achieved. The level of service of the
secondary roads has generally improved with the increase in travel speed (i.e., average increase of 31%)
of all-through vehicles along these road components. No data was provided for the indicator “increased
capacity at intersections between project corridors and secondary roads?. Out of the 15 road components
identified at appraisal (61.1 km), only seven were implemented, but these seven road improvement
projects accounted for 45.6 km, or 66% of the total length of secondary roads planned for rehabilitation.

Component D: Development of Non-Motorized Transport Facility/GEO. Moderately Satisfactory.
The primary GEO indicator was achieved. The modal share of bicycle ridership in Marikina city has
increased from 4.2% in 2001 to 7.9% in 2010. The second GEO indicator however was not achieved. A
decrease in NMT-PT mode share by almost 1% was recorded during the survey conducted by the City
Government of Marikina in October 2010. This could be attributed to the significant decrease in public
transport for bus trips and increase in private transport for motorcycle trips from 2000 to 2010. The
Project supported a 52 km bikeways network, which was 80% of the target length of 66 kilometers for


                                                    28
the city. Ninety percent (or 47 km bikeways) was developed connecting residential areas to the city’s
major trip attractors such as markets, schools and employment centers. The increased NMT modal share
was the result of various bicycle promotion programs, such as Bike-to-Work and Bike-to-School
campaigns, and Marikina Bicycle Loan Program initiated by the Marikina City Bikeways Office.

Component E: Institution Building/Technical Assistance. Unsatisfactory. There were two indicators
defined at appraisal, i.e., effective coordination mechanism in place between the key agencies and LGUs,
and effective traffic management and enforcement measures planned and designed by the relevant
agencies. However, no baseline and target values were specified. Few (minor) activities were carried out
under this component (e.g., a study tour and a parcellary survey). Certainly, it allowed MMDA to gain
some experience in implementing major civil works contracts. Yet, after 9 years, there is yet no
comprehensive development framework and the 20-year Metro Manila Physical Framework Plan,
completed in 1996 was never updated.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The detailed economic analysis is done on the following sub-project components: (a) Traffic
management improvements (pedestrian overpass) over a 5-year period, (b) MARIPAS Access
Improvements (interchange improvement, new bridges and improvement in road links) over a 20- year
period, and (c) Secondary Roads over a five (5) year period. Excluded in the economic analysis are the
Non-motorized Transport (NMT) component and the institution building component of the project.

Methodology

The economic viability is determined by calculating the economic internal rate of returns (EIRR) for
each of the project components. Under government guidelines, a project is economically viable if the
project’s EIRR is more than 15%.

In evaluating transport projects, the following economic benefits are included:
(a) Vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings accruing to road users as a result of increase in travel speed
    between intersections and reduced delays at the intersection;
(b) Value of time (VOT) savings to road users and pedestrians arising from the faster travel time. The
    VOT savings include the proper valuation of travel time for both work and leisure.

The above savings have been quantified as economic benefits (net of taxes, duties and other transfer
costs) and as inputs in calculating for the EIRR of the project. There are other benefits but are difficult to
quantify such as improved urban environment and accident cost savings as a result of increased safety of
the road users and pedestrians.

Economic costs include the initial construction costs, right-of-way acquisition costs and future operating
and maintenance costs. In economic analysis, the shadow prices of labor, the foreign exchange rate and
the exclusion of taxes are considered in adjusting the financial costs to economic costs.

Assumptions

Vehicle operating cost savings have been estimated using a model developed by DPWH. The model
generates the costs per vehicle kilometer given the speed of travel and quality of road surface which
affect the operating costs like fuel and oil. Savings in maintenance expenditure are likewise estimated.

Wage rates are used as a basis for computing the savings in the VOT for both road users and pedestrians.
Assumptions are made on the valuation of non-working time such as leisure time which is based on the
wages rates. Specific vehicle occupancy factors are likewise assumed.

  Based on the feasibility studies, the economic analysis for the project showed high EIRR, typical in
  traffic management projects with high economic benefits relative to the project investment. In certain
  sub-projects, the EIRRs remained high because of the higher actual traffic growth of vehicles, road users
  and pedestrians (relative to the projected traffic at the time of the study) which more than compensated
  the increase in investment costs.

  The following is a summary of the economic benefits for each project component.

  (a) Traffic Management Improvements

  In pedestrian bridges, benefits are determined by the reduced waiting time of all pedestrian crossings in
  the vicinity of the sub-project component. Benefits from the improvements to bus stops and off-road
  jeepney and FX waiting areas are also considered. A conservative economic analysis is carried out for
  the traffic management improvement component (i.e. Bicutan and EDSA LRT 3 corridors) - only the
  benefits from the VOT for the pedestrians were considered. The VOC and VOT of the vehicles were
  excluded since these benefits were not entirely attributable to the project (especially in the case of the
  EDSA LRT 3 corridor sub-project). The computation for the actual EIRR for the Traffic Management
  Improvement only covers the VOT for the pedestrians. The analysis was done in three major
  intersections in EDSA, namely: Taft Avenue, Ortigas Center, and Quezon Boulevard.

                       Pedestrian traffic                       5% per year

                       EDSA-Quezon Blvd                           85,438
                       EDSA-Ortigas                              101,155

In the main road corridors like EDSA, benefits are derived from sidewalk improvements, from a
reduction in carriageway infringement and the improved traffic speeds in the intersection. The
improvement in the EDSA corridor includes the construction of public transport passenger facilities to
improve the waiting conditions for passengers in the terminals. Economic benefits are calculated based
on the total number of passenger and the estimated value per passenger.

For EDSA corridor, the analysis was carried out in three major intersections, namely, Taft Avenue,
Ortigas Center, and Quezon Boulevard. The computation for the actual EIRR only covers the value of
time for the pedestrians. The estimates were then subjected to sensitivity analyses, as follows: (i) 20%
decrease in pedestrian volume; and (ii) 20% increase in waiting time of pedestrian and 20% decrease in
pedestrian volume. Apparently, the project remains viable given the adverse changes in the assumptions,
with EIRRs exceeding the social discount rate of 15%.

                                                                    pedestrian volume

(b) MARIPAS Access Improvements

In general, economic benefits in new road infrastructure are estimated based on the reduced travel time
and operating costs for the road users of the route compared with to the most direct alternative route.


                                                   36
Indirect benefits such as reduced congestion and travel time also accrue for those road users who remain
on the alternative routes.

In the case of the Marikina Bridge, benefits are derived from savings in time and operating cost savings
for those who divert to the new route (via Marikina Bridge) due to shorter distance as compared to the
travel time in the old route (via Aurora Blvd- C5). Indirect benefits such as time and operating cost
savings for vehicles remaining on Marcos Highway are not included in the computation of the EIRR
since this route also experience traffic growth and congestion.

For this specific component, the methodology used in the economic analysis is as follow:
1. Obtain traffic count at Marikina Bridge – The estimated daily total was determined from the peak
   hour count and the ratio of peak hour volume based on past traffic counts done by the Traffic
   Engineering Center and MMDA.
2. Convert vehicle traffic count to passenger car units (PCU)
3. Estimate the computed speed based on the model using the observed speeds and computed Volume-
   Speed (V/C) curve in 2007.

4. Compute for the savings in travel time. The savings in travel time is a function of the computed
   speed. The number of persons per day on board different vehicle types which have direct benefits of
   having savings in travel time. This is based on average occupancy of each vehicle type.

6. Compute for the EIRR by comparing the benefits (VOT and savings in VOC) and investment costs
   in economic values.

In the improvement of Ortigas Avenue extension, the same methodology was used. Benefits are derived
from the time and operating cost savings to those users currently using the road because of higher speed,
increased road capacity and improved pavement surface. Savings in travel time is a function of the
reduced travel time of the users in the improved roadway compared to travel time when the road is not
yet improved. Savings in vehicle operating cost, on the other hand, is based on the VOC of equivalent
additional length of good/fair road of completed project if the vehicle would have travelled during the
“before project? scenario.

(c) Secondary Roads

In upgrading of existing roads, the same methodology was used where savings in VOC and VOT were
computed and compared with the investment cost. Incremental benefits come from both increased speed
and reduced vehicle operating costs as a result of reduced surface roughness. In most cases, economic
analysis for each secondary road segment is done. Detailed economic analysis is presented in the
Project Completion Report (PCR).

Economic analysis is presented with the benefits derived from VOC alone and with the benefits derived
from both VOC and VOT. For this particular set of secondary roads, economic benefits are derived
from savings in time and relatively fewer economic benefits tend to accrue from VOC savings. The
VOC savings can be significant where existing road condition is poor.

(d) Development of Non-Motorized Transport Facility

For the NMT component, the incremental benefits include increase in modal share of non-motorized
traffic and the decrease in emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants as a result of the project.
Data shows that the modal share in non-motorized transport facility within Marikina increased by 7.89%.
Economic analysis is not done on this project component because of the difficulty in quantifying the
indicators such as the decrease in gas emissions.

The project development objective of the Metro Manila Urban Transport Integration Project
(MMURTRIP) is to assist the government in enhancing the economic productivity and quality of life of
the Metro Manila residents by improving the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system
with better opportunities to use public and non-motorized transport, the dominant transport modes of
low-income residents. The project has five components namely: (1) traffic management improvements;
(2) MARIPAS access improvements; (3) secondary roads program; (4) non-motorized transport; and (5)
institution building.

MMURTRIP’s aim of improving the operational efficiency of the transport system was realized with the
increased travel speed experienced by public transport users on the project corridors, thereby reducing
their travel time. In addition, safety of the transport system in Metro Manila has significantly affected
the lives of the Manileños and residents from the nearby provinces by enhancing pedestrian safety and
reducing pedestrian/vehicle conflicts thru the construction of footbridges, installation of pedestrian
barriers, application of pavement markings, provision for lighting facilities, among others. These
improvements have reinforced appreciation of the end-users. Further, gas emission level was reduced
due to road efficiency as a result of the road improvement works undertaken under the project.

PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

(1) Traffic Management Improvements

To attain the above objective, the Project has implemented traffic management schemes toward
improving the operational efficiency of the transport system thru access to light rail transit stations and
transfer opportunities between road-based public transport modes, pedestrian traffic circulation and road
frontage controls. These were done by constructing footbridges, i.e., Taft Avenue Footbridge connecting
LRT Line 2 and EDSA MRT 3 station, and loading/unloading bays strategically located near MRT
stations, road, drainage and sidewalk improvements), the design of which prevented frontage parking of
vehicles on areas without sufficient space for the purpose, and installation of pedestrian barriers, gantries
and traffic signages.

With the improvements in traffic management along EDSA and Bicutan Interchange, the level of service
in these two (2) corridors has greatly improved. The effect of the project is manifested thru the
following: (a) reduced travel time experienced by public transport users on the project corridors due to
the introduction of various improvements. Along EDSA, travel time of 59.92 minutes (2003) was
reduced to 49.4 minutes (2010) while travel time at Bicutan Interchange has improved from 8.67
minutes (2005) to 6.87 minutes (2010); (b) increased travel speed from 23.11 km/hr in 2003 to 36.24
km/hr to 36.34 km/hr in 2009 along EDSA corridor; and (c) enhanced pedestrian safety and reduced
pedestrian/vehicle conflicts thru the construction of 7 footbridges which resulted to eliminating 530,418
of pedestrians crossing EDSA and Bicutan.

As a result of the above, the public transport users along EDSA have experienced reduction in travel
time and vehicular accidents by 17.5% and 14%, respectively.




                                                     44
(2) MARIPAS Access Improvements

This project component aims to provide new access roads for the eastern part of Metro Manila with the
construction of the Marikina Bridge and Access Road, which by-passes the circuitous route in the
Katipunan Avenue-Aurora Boulevard intersection thus relieving traffic from other minor road. The
project was implemented with slight changes to accelerate the works and to provide proper amenities for
safety and environmental concerns. This component also included the upgrading of the Ortigas Avenue
Extension Road, which strengthened the road capacity in terms of its life span viz-a-viz identification of
proper traffic lane for the motorists plying by this road.

The completion and opening to traffic of the Marikina Bridge and Access Road accommodate major
volume of vehicles resulting to significant reduction in travel time and travel cost. The average travel
time for trips from LRT Santolan to C-5/Libis decreased by 84% and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave.
Extension) by 40%. The decrease in travel time of vehicles in MARIPAS contributes to the economic
factor by reducing gas consumption. As a result, the average travel cost for trips from LRT Santolan to
C-5/Libis decreased by 55% and from C-5 to Tikling (Ortigas Ave. Extension) by 42%.

(3) Secondary Roads Program

Under the Secondary Roads Program, civil works will be carried out to provide comprehensive corridor
treatment on identified secondary roads to fulfill their function in the road hierarchy. The scope of
works are mostly pavement rehabilitation, asphalting works with some sub-base/base course removal
and replacement, drainage and sidewalk improvements (curb and gutters), provision for street lightings,
application of pavement markings and installation of studs, pedestrian barriers and traffic signs,
construction of waiting sheds and landscaping works. Completed works have resulted in the
achievement of the objectives of this component established at the start such as smooth flow of traffic in
the project areas, safety of the pedestrians and motorists and improved quality of life of those living in
the vicinity of the corridors. Several road components were dropped from the project as a result of cost
overruns experienced during project implementation. Dropped components may be done using local
funds. Of the seven (7) secondary road components completed under the Project, some experienced
changes in road lengths to suit actual field conditions. Nonetheless, increase in travel speed was noted in
all the completed secondary roads component under the Project.

(4) Non-motorized Transport (NMT) Component

Marikina has constructed 52 kilometers of bikeways which connects the city’s residential areas,
particularly the low income residential communities, to employment centers, markets, schools,
government service providers and the LRT2 Station along Marcos Highway. Of the existing 52 kms of
bikeways, the GEF grant financed 19 kms with a total funding of US$1.143 M, while Marikina’s total
investment in the bikeways infrastructure was more than US$2.0 M.

The GEF objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of zero-emission bicycle
and pedestrian transport is being met with the completion of the bikeways in December 2007. The
traffic modal share of bicycle and non-motorized transport begun to increase from 4.2% in 1999-2000 to
7.8 % in 2005 to 7.9% in 2010. The continuing political commitment of the local government of
Marikina encouraged more people to use the bicycle as alternative mode of transport. Although the

                                                    45
modal share of motorcycle traffic continues to rise, the bicycle traffic is relatively steady at 7 % share.
A Bicycle Loan Program for Marikina low income employees was implemented using the grants from
the GEF (for city government employees) and the World Health Organization (non-government
employees). The bicycle loan was interest free and payable in easy instalment term and thru salary
deduction. More than 250 employees in the city availed the bicycle loan.

Marikina continuously expands the city’s bikeways network with the completion of the 400-meter
bikelane in Barangay Marikina Heights in early 2010. Bikelane maintenance and repair is now part of
the Marikina City Engineering Unit’s regular undertaking including the fabrication, repair and
installation of more bicycle parking racks and bicycle stations. The Marikina City Bikeways and
Planning and Design Guidebook was put together to give salient information about the bikeways project,
particularly the experience of the Marikina City, for better understanding and appreciation of its target
readers.

(5) Institution Building

A portion of the loan proceeds was earmarked for strengthening the capacity of the MMDA in project
implementation, coordination of transport development plans and programs and management of traffic
in the metropolis. Since activities to be undertaken were not identified during the loan negotiation,
projects were proposed during the implementation of the project namely Study Tour, MMDA
Institutional Restructuring, Urban Transport Survey and Development of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for
Metro Manila. All these activities were approved by the Bank and procurement process started.

A study tour in South America and United States was conducted and participated in by officials of the
DPWH, MMDA, Marikina City (implementing agencies of the project) and other Metro Manila local
government units which enabled the participants to learn from the various models of urban
transportation systems that have worked elsewhere and gather new insights on infrastructure
development and planning.

From the insights and lessons learned during the study tour, the need to pursue the implementation of the
feasibility study on the Development of BRT for Metro Manila was recommended by the group.
Contract negotiation with the winning consultant was conducted and the contract was short of award
when the second loan extension was in process. The shortlist on the Urban Transport Study and MMDA
Institutional Restructuring Study were likewise already approved by the Bank during this time. The
NEDA-ICC disapproved the Institutional Restructuring Study in the second loan extension. However,
MMDA was not able to pursue the other studies due to non-issuance of budget from the Department of
Budget and Management (DBM).

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION

(1) Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA)

Just like any other project, MMURTRIP has its share of issues and concerns that greatly affected the
implementation of the project. Among others, the following problems were encountered: (a) Insufficient
or no budget allocation particularly during the second extension/last year of the project; (b) Changes in
MMDA leadership/management with different priorities and thrust which resulted to revision of plans

                                                    46
and deletion of some project components; (c) Underground utilities problem; (d) Right-of-way/sidewalk
obstructions.

The Project, being the first foreign assisted infrastructure project implemented by the Authority is a
learning experience for MMDA, particularly the staff of the MMURTRIP Project Preparation and
Implementation Office under the Office of the Assistant General Manager for Planning (OAGMP).
With the knowledge and experience acquired by the engineers of the OAGMP, thru the project, they
have implemented a number of infrastructure projects funded locally such as the C-5 Interchange Project
(Elevated U-turns) and Commonwealth Development Project, among others.

Coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and other national
government agencies concerned, local government units, particularly their engineering offices, and
different utility companies was likewise built and strengthened. The same is true with coordination with
affected stakeholders.

The MMDA was not able to complete the works to be undertaken during the second extension due to
non-availability of budget, both loan proceeds and GOP counterpart fund. It is suggested that this
should be brought to the attention of DBM and firm commitment on their part be sought as early as loan
negotiation stage.

(i)    Factors at Project Preparation and Design
       a. Evaluation of implementing agency’s (IA) project readiness conducted by the Bank is a
          helpful tool in determining areas for further improvement/development.
       b. MMDA’s commitment to the objectives of the Project and in carrying out the works with due
          diligence and efficiency was manifested thru a Project Agreement entered into between the
          International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Authority.
       c. To ensure completion of the Project, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Republic of
          the Philippines represented by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the Chairman
          of the MMDA was entered into prior to commencement of activities to ensure the grant of
          the proceeds of the loan to MMDA. However, this did not guarantee allocation of funds for
          MMDA.
       d. An Inter-Agency Steering Committee to monitor the progress of the Project and resolve
          policy issues was created, however, was active only during the first few months of the project.
          Maybe MMDA’s problem on budget should have been resolved thru the Steering Committee
          since DBM is one of the members of the Committee.
       e. The early start of the detailed engineering design consultant should have been a factor for the
          early start of implementation of the project. However, as far as the first component
          implemented by the Authority is concern, delay in commencement was due to inclusion of
          drainage improvement in the works, as requested by the City of Makati, which should have
          been recommended by the design consultant during their investigation stage.
       f. Implementing agencies to take an active role during the design stage to ensure that thorough
          surveys and planning was done and all designs include underground and aboveground
          utilities, as-built plans, etc., to minimize variation orders/change orders and additional works.




                                                   47
(ii)   Factors at Project Implementation
       a. Delayed activities in the procurement of civil works due to the restructuring of the MMDA
          components which resulted to revisions of designs, bid documents and cost.
       b. Problems encountered during construction such as design revisions due to design errors,
          based on actual site conditions and due to the length of time from design preparation to actual
          implementation, underground utilities not reflected on plans, removal and/or relocation of
          posts and other affected structures/ encroachments and stakeholders resistance which caused
          delays in implementation.
       c. Close coordination with utility companies and local and national government agencies
          concerned at an early stage to ensure success of any project.
       d. Changes in MMDA leadership/management with different priorities and thrust which
          resulted to revision of plans and deletion of some project components and changes in the
          staffing/counterpart staff of the project management office also somehow caused delay in
          project implementation.
       e. Insufficient or no budget allocation particularly during the second extension/last year of the
          project.
       f. Delayed payments of claims of contractors particularly the GOP counterpart fund due to non-
          release/slow release of cash allocation by the DBM.
       g. Proper identification of activities to be undertaken for projects with technical assistance
          components should be made during the negotiation stage of the loan.

(2) Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)

(i)    Factors at Project Preparation and Design
       a. In the Results Framework, there are indicators which were not clearly defined, i.e., the
          increased capacity at intersection between secondary roads and project corridors, and the
          productive capacity average of bus and jeepneys. Thus, the IA was not properly guided on
          what data should be generated for these indicators.

(ii)   Factors at Project Implementation
       a. The original loan duration of 5 years was extended by 4 years in view of the delays in project
          implementation as a result of changes in IA’s prioritization, political issues and other factors.
          The changes in IA’s ruling as well as priorities of the Government contributed considerable
          delays in project implementation.
       b. In the case of Marikina Bridge and Access Road, implementation delays were mainly
          attributed to right-of-way (ROW) problems, some of which even involved expropriation
          cases. This has resulted to partial issuance of No Objection by the Bank for a particular road
          segment which has resolved ROW concern and deemed clear and workable area.
       a. Work stoppage due to relocation and removal of affected utilities and obstructions. The delay
          in the relocation of utility companies’ facilities owing to the time to secure permits from
          concerned agencies and to allocate funds for relocation works affected the project
          implementation.
       b. Difficulty in complying with certain Bank requirements related to preconstruction stage
          (bidding process, documents, etc.).
       c. Delayed procurement of civil works contractors due to changes in engineering designs,
          mainly as a result of inclusion of items which were not incorporated in the feasibility stage

                                                   48
         (landscaping, barriers, plant box, additional works for drainage system, etc). Revisions in the
         technical designs contributed a lot in the delays of implementing the project. The IA should
         be more diligent and serious in the conduct of the detailed engineering design to avoid
         further changes in the construction implementation, thus saving the Government time and
         resources.
      d. Delays in relation to the inclusion of traffic management program/plan as required by
         MMDA. Traffic re-routing plan has always to be approved first for each contract package
         considering that the projects were located in the heart of the Metropolis.
      e. The scope of work per the approved plan was not totally adhered to due to changes in
         existing field conditions as well as increases in cost of construction materials, hence, the
         necessity to issue Variation Orders/Supplemental Agreements.
      f. The lengthy discussion and exchanges of various communications between the Bank and the
         DPWH regarding design/supervision consultant and also the processing of the contracts by
         DPWH.

(3) City Government of Marikina

   (i) Factors at Project Preparation and Design
       a. One of the key factors that contributed to the successful implementation of the bikeways
          project is the creation of the Marikina City Bikeways Office. This office was responsible for
          the preparation of bikeway plans and construction design; procurement and project
          construction supervision; project impact monitoring such as the conduct of annual traffic
          counts; liaison and coordination works among the various stakeholders for bikeways
          promotion and awareness building. However, this office ceased its operation upon
          completion of the Bikeways Project in December 2007.
       b. During the planning stage, the Bikeways Project Officer had several discussions with the
          Marikina City engineers on the appropriate design on physical barriers to separate and
          protect the cyclists from motorized vehicles and intersection approach design particularly on
          busy streets. Interconnecting the existing bikeways with a new GEF funded bikelane
          traversing busy streets raised some protests from affected business establishments.
          Marikina’s streets are mostly narrow and heavily parked with motorized vehicles in certain
          sections. Although a Feasibility Study was prepared for the Marikina Bikeways, the local
          engineers’ acceptance and clearance of the bikeway construction plans was difficult to obtain.

   (ii) Factors at Project Implementation
        a. City Ordinance No.121 Series of 2003 was passed identifying the streets, avenues and
           highways interconnecting the bicycle lanes and declaring the same as No Parking area. This
           ordinance raised several protests from taxpaying commercial establishments situated along
           the bikeways claiming they were adversely affected by the restricted parking. City Ordinance
           No. 121 Series of 2003 was later repealed and/or modified by City Ordinance No. 56 Series
           of 2005 – Ordinance identifying the streets and avenues in the First District of Marikina and
           portion of Bayan-bayanan Avenue in the Second District that will interconnect the bicycle
           lanes and specifying traffic rules and bikeways routes thereon. Said ordinance was the result
           of a more comprehensive traffic study and focus group discussion (FGD) with local residents,
           businessmen and commuting cyclists.



                                                  49
       b. For the new interconnected bikeways system, after experimenting with various schemes to
          determine which would be most suitable for local conditions, Marikina City engineers started
          constructing a network that now also allows evaluation and adjustments as needed over time.
          Marikina City continues to build more complementary bicycle facilities, such as better
          bicycle traffic and informative signages, innovative designs on bicycle lane pavement
          markings, and more importantly, installing more bicycle parking and bicycle stations, to
          enhance the overall bicycle trip experience in the city.
       c. The City of Marikina has shown its political commitment to non-motorized transport and
          related environmental issues by its past administrations (Mayor Bayani Fernando, 1992-2001
          and Mayor Marides C. Fernando, 2001 – 2010). Present City Mayor Del de Guzman has
          verbally announced that he will continue in his administration all of the worthwhile projects
          and programs initiated by the previous administrations. One of these is the bikeways project.


CONCLUSION

The Project objective of improving the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system of
Metro Manila was achieved. Travel time of transport users decreased by 10 and 2 minutes along EDSA
(Metro Manila’s main corridor) and Bicutan Interchange, respectively. The access roads in Marikina
Pasig Rizal (MARIPAS) such as Marikina Bridge and Ortigas Avenue had greatly improved
accessibility of people, mostly students and workers coming from the Eastern side of Metro Manila. A
post economic evaluation was done to determine the economic efficiency of the MARIPAS section. The
analysis showed positive results and even surpassed the economic indicators done during the feasibility
study. On the Secondary Roads, the improvements of the roads, construction of other ancillary works
for the drainage, and installation of street lights contributed to a faster flow of traffic. With the improved
road conditions, there was also a decrease in the vehicle gas emission resulting to an improved
environment.

The construction of the steel pedestrian footbridges made a significant impact to the project as it not
only enhanced pedestrian safety by removing pedestrians from the roadway but also improved the
operational efficiency of the intersection. The footbridges contributed in the reduction of pedestrian
accidents in the project corridors due to the segregation of pedestrians to vehicle movement at identified
intersections particularly along EDSA. Thus, there was improvement of operational efficiency in terms
of having better and faster movement of vehicles resulting to reduced travel time as well as waiting time
in any given intersection. The showcase of which is the pedestrian overpass at SLEX-Bicutan
intersection wherein a significant volume of pedestrians (average of 180,000 pedestrians a day) uses the
overpass.

The GEF project, which is the Bikeways Project in Marikina, has also achieved its objective reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of zero-emission bicycle and pedestrian transport. The
modal share of bicycle rider ship in Marikina city increased from 4.2% in 2001 to 7.9% in 2010. To date,
bike users, who are mostly low income residents, are enjoying the 52 km bikeways constructed in most
strategic streets in the city (from initial 10 km bikeways). One of the most important bikeways is the one
connecting to LRT 2 station, which connects the Eastern and Western part of Metro Manila. An ample
parking space for bike in the light rail transit station was also constructed. The City of Marikina is


                                                     50
currently coordinating with the DPWH to include a bikeways component for the ongoing Marcos
Highway Improvement project under NRIMP 2.

Currently promoted by World Health Organization (WHO) as Environmentally Healthy and Sustainable
Transport (ESHUT), the Marikina Bikeways is considered one project worth emulating by other local
government units in the Philippines and in other countries. To encourage replication of this project to
other cities in the Philippines, the Marikina City Bikeways Planning and Design Guidebook was
published to assist local planners and engineers to design and construct adequate bicycle facilities for
their own localities.

The Marikina Bikeways Project is relatively successful. It won the Philippines’ Galing Pook Award in
2005 and the World Health Organization’s Healthy Cities Alliance in 2008 held in Japan.

Overall, the Implementing Agencies assessed that they were able to implement the Project efficiently
and in a very satisfactory manner taking into consideration all the factors that affected its
implementation such as changes and delays. Thus, it may be concluded that the Project has greatly
contributed in the improvement of the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system in Metro
Manila, thereby, has achieved the development objective of assisting the government in enhancing the
economic productivity and quality of life of the Metro Manila residents.

LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATION

(1) MMDA

   (a) Technical Capability/Competence in Project Implementation
           (i) Coordination and comprehensive planning is necessary to minimize project delays. It is
                important to anticipate future setbacks such as presence of underground utilities, removal
                and/or relocation of obstructions and existing facilities, political interventions and
                changes in implementing agency’s leadership.
           (ii) Implementing agencies to take an active role during the design stage to ensure that all
                designs include underground and aboveground utilities, as-built plans, etc.
           (iii)Detailing of activities to be undertaken for projects with technical assistance components
                should be made during the negotiation stage of the loan.

   (b) Linkages with other Government Agencies and Private Entities
           (i) Institutionalize linkages with utility companies, national government agencies and local
                government units concerned from project preparation to ensure success of any project.
           (ii) Issuance of Forward Obligation Authority (FOA) and inclusion of the project in the
                approved budget is not an assurance of budget allocation and expeditious release of cash,
                respectively. Firm commitment by the Department of Budget Management on the
                provision of budget and cash allocation for foreign assisted projects.

   (c) Technology Transfer. Transfer of knowledge/technology transfer will be fully attained with the
      implementing agency providing counterpart staff on a full-time basis working hand-in- hand with
      the construction supervision consultant.
(2) DPWH

                                                   51
   (a) Acquisition of Right-Of-Way should be completed before any bidding is conducted, however if
         the area to be acquired is only on some portion of the project, construction implementation
         schedule could be modified to hinge with the right-of-way schedule with the optimum
         forecasting when the right-of-way related matters will be resolved.
   (b)   Exact location of utilities such as water lines, drainage lines and telecommunication lines should
         be made available particularly if they are installed after the design and before construction. This
         will assist the implementing agency/entity, in case of obstruction, in informing the respective
         owners so that proper actions may be taken.
   (c)   Sustainability Plans concerning periodic maintenance and provision for budget should be well
         defined.
   (d)   Proper coordination with concerned local government units (LGU) and other government/private
         agencies should be undertaken so that appropriate actions may be taken.
   (e)   Integration of policies is a must to be considered. Lending Institution and the GOP should define
         common guidelines in the project procurement to avoid delays that affect the total project’s
         program. Flowchart with time frame for future programs should be prepared and agreed by the
         parties.
   (f)   NEDA, DPWH, and other agencies that will be involved in any project should be coordinated for
         the timely resolution of any problem that may arise.
   (g)   On the environmental aspect, a more detailed program should be added, like noise pollution
         monitoring, and to consider other factors to mitigate any effect on the worldwide problem on
         climate change. It would be necessary to magnify/introduce tree planting and proper landscaping
         works throughout the defined project towards a balanced nature.

(3) Marikina City

   (a) There should be a City Bikeways Office beyond the GEF closing date in December 2007. The
       continuing bicycle education and advocacy aspect lost its strength for replication elsewhere in
       the Philippines. To date, only the NGO Firefly Brigade is committed to do the bicycle promotion
       annually.
   (b) While the bicycle modal share in Marikina maintain its 7% to 8 % share from 2008 to 2010, the
       rise of motorcycle traffic, which also utilize illegally the NMT lane, is alarming. A Bicycle
       Patrol was created in 2010 under the supervision of the City Transport Management and
       Development Office (CTMDO) to mitigate illegal parking on bicycle lanes and look after the
       cyclists’ safety.

COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT ICR

In its letter dated 1 March 2011, the Bank sent a copy of the draft ICR (Draft No. 15) to the IAs with a
request to provide comments on the draft report. Below are the comments the Bank received from the
IAs.

(1) DPWH

The draft ICR is in order. The DPWH has no more comments on the draft report (per DPWH letter to
the Bank dated March 10, 2011).

(2) Marikina City

Given the re-establishment of the Marikina Bikeways Office in February 2011, the following inputs
were provided by the City Government of Marikina (via email dated March 9) to replace the write-up in
Lessons Learned and Recommendation under Annex 7 (Summary of PCR):

   (a) The continuing bicycle education and advocacy aspect of the Marikina Bikeways Program lost
       its strength with the closure of the City Bikeways Office in December 2007.
   (b) While the bicycle modal share in Marikina maintains its 7% to 8% from 2008 to 2010, the rise of
       motorcycle traffic which also utilizes illegally the NMT lane is alarming. A Bicycle Patrol was
       created in 2010 under the supervision of the City Transport Management and Development
       Office (CTMDO) to mitigate illegal parking on bicycle lanes and look after the cyclists' safety.
   (c) On February 23, 2011 Mayor Del de Guzman, thru Executive Order 005-11, ordered the revival
       of the Marikina Bikeways Office (MBO) as framework to the city's thrust of revitalizing the 52-
       kilometer bikeways network. MBO shall perform the tasks of instilling the importance of cycling
       through educating the public about biking, proper utilization of the city's bikeways as precious
       resource; marketing strategies that would not only put the bikeways on the map but also provide
       assistance for maintenance of such infrastructure; and managing the bikeways itself. The city
       government will be able to introduce a more practical and environmental approach to
       transportation with the bikeways revitalization.

(3) MMDA

As of this writing, no comments were received from MMDA even if they provided inputs in the
preparation of the PCR and the ICR.
