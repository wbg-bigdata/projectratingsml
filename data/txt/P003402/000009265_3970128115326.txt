CHINA
NATURE RESERVES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.         Background. China, rich in biological diversity, contains about ten percent of the world's
plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. However, over the past few decades, increasing
population pressures and development activities have eroded China's biodiversity resources. The
combination of a large population (estimated at 1.185 billion people in 1993 with an annual growth rate
of 1.2 percent) and limited land resources has led to extensive loss of habitats to agricultural production,
logging, fuelwood collection, and livestock grazing. The Chinese Academy of Sciences reports that about
200 plant species are believed to have become extinct and an estimated 5,000 species endangered in recent
years due to human activity.
2.         In recognition of these problems, the Government has significantly strengthened the policy
framework for environmental protection in general and biodiversity conservation in particular. New
Environmental Protection and Wildlife Conservation Laws were promulgated in 1989, which facilitated
development of a comprehensive system of nature reserves and rationalized categories of protection for
endangered wildlife. China has also become increasingly visible in international efforts, with the
ratification of the RAMSAR (Wetland) Convention in 1992 and the Convention on Biological Diversity
in 1993. These policy changes have been accompanied by increased emphasis on sector planning and
management. A national nature conservation strategy was produced in 1987. A National Environment
Protection Action Plan (NEAP) was recently approved that includes a chapter on objectives and priorities
in biodiversity. Finally, the government recently completed a Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan
(BAP), with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Pre-Investment Facility (PRIF), that
was approved by the State Commission on Environmental Protection in early-1994. The BAP reviews
the present status of biological diversity and conservation efforts in China and sets out a comprehensive
program of investment, policy reform, and technical assistance requirements to strengthen national
biodiversity management and conservation. All of the project activities proposed under the GEF project
have been reviewed and identified as priority measures in the BAP and NEAP.
3.         As in many other countries, biodiversity protection in China has focused on the
establishment of nature reserves. There has been a dramatic expansion of protected areas over the past
four years and more than 700 nature reserves are now established, with a total area of approximately 56
million hectares covering some 5.5 percent of the country. The Ministry of Forestry (MFO) has
jurisdiction over two-thirds of the reserves. Despite a strong commitment to biodiversity conservation,
MFO's staff levels, management budgets, and training and performance standards have not kept pace with
reserve expansion. Few areas are protected or managed effectively, and if current trends continue,
biological diversity in many critical reserves will diminish dramatically. The main constraints include
a weak guard force, excessive emphasis on capital-intensive infrastructure development, inadequate
recurrent budgetary support, and an inadequately structured management system.
4.         The proposed Nature Reserves Management Project (NRMP) is associated with the World
Bank Forest Resource Development and Protection Project (FRDPP). FRDPP was approved by the
Executive Directors in June 1994, with a total project cost (excluding NRMP) of $333 million and IDA
financing equivalent to $200 million. NRMP was not approved at that time as the GEF I replenishment
was not yet effective. The combined FRDPP/NRMP project is designed to introduce a new sectoral
approach to sustainable resource planning and management in forestry. For the first time in China, the



-2 -
combined project addresses resource use in all four of the main forest types in China (timber plantations,
watershed protection forests, natural forests, and nature reserves) and presents an integrated package of
investment, policy reform, and technical assistance requirements designed to improve the efficiency and
productivity of the sector as a whole. This comprehensive sectoral focus not only capitalizes on the
critical economic and environmental linkages among different forest areas and land uses but also
integrates national and global benefits into sector planning and management. This approach is an
important step away from the Government's current ad hoc and unprioritized investment program in
forestry. The FRDPP/NRMP project is a direct outgrowth of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
scheduled for presentation to the Board in June 1995, as it supports income enhancement and sustainable
environmental development in poor, remote areas across China.
5.         Lessons Learned. Since the proposed project would be the first Bank Group or GEF
investment in biodiversity in China, it draws on project experience from other countries under the GEF
Pilot Phase and from NGOs in China. The key lessons include: (a) the importance of a national strategic
framework for biodiversity investments; (b) the need to build in financial sustainability and long-term
commitment from the government; (c) the need to involve local people in design and implementation; and
(d) the key role of macroeconomic and sector policies in establishing an appropriate incentive framework
for resource conservation. It also draws on the implementation experience of the GEF PRIF in China
over the past two years, particularly the importance of twinning domestic and international technical
assistance to ensure effective transfer of new ideas and technologies. Similarly, the project draws on
related lessons from the 1991 Board paper on forestry, the 1991 Operations Evaluation Department report
on forestry, and the 1994 Board paper on forestry project implementation: (a) the importance of
integrating the management of protected and unprotected natural forest areas into regional forest
management plans; (b) the importance of developing restructuring programs for inefficient state forestry
enterprises; and (c) the need to expand the protected area system and improve management technologies
for forests with high biodiversity and environmental services values. Finally, the community participation
program supported under the project incorporates lessons learned from several on-going pilot activities
in China managed by NGOs and the government, particularly (a) the importance of integrating local
villagers into the assessment of community needs through participatory rural appraisal techniques; and
(b) the need to establish clear, mutually agreed contracts that identify the respective rights and
responsibilities of reserve staff and local communities in resource use within reserves.
6.         Rationale for GEF Financing. The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria and
program priorities agreed at the recent Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological
Diversity, as follows. The project strengthens conservation, management, and sustainable use of ecosys-
tems and habitats that have been identified as national priorities by the government in the BAP and
NEAP; increases the involvement of local communities in the planning and management of nature
reserves, addressing in particular the social and economic requirements of poor households in poverty
areas; introduces a new, innovative economic incentive program to reduce biodiversity land-use conflicts
in critical habitats that involves enterprise restructuring and job redeployment; builds institutional capacity
for preparation of conservation plans and implementation of sustainable land-use programs; develops new
research mechanisms and priorities to encourage scientific excellence and facilitate international exchange;
expands the role of local and international NGOs in sector planning and management; and promotes
conservation of endemic species, such as the Giant Panda and other plants and animals unique to China.
GEF involvement in the development of FRDPP/NRMP has made possible a combined approach to
resource use in the four main forest types in China that integrates national and global benefits into sector
planning and management. Without GEF funding, MFO would continue to maintain a minimum level
of reserve protection and management, with little community involvement, on the basis of ad hoc,
unprioritized investment programs in the forestry sector.



- 3 -
7.         Project Objectives. The main objective is to enhance biodiversity conservation through
innovative approaches to organization, planning, skills development, information management, and the
integration of local communities into reserve management. The main focus will be on developing skills,
human resources, and systems for improving protection and management at the field level.
8.         Project Description. The proposed project would comprise five components.
9.         The Nature Reserves Component (34 percent of total costs) would develop more effective
management and protection systems in five pilot reserve areas of international significance that have been
identified as top biodiversity priorities in the BAP: Xishuangbanna, a cluster of five sub-reserves in
southwest Yunnan Province; Poyang Lake, China's most important wetland site in Jiangxi Province;
Wuyishan, the highest and richest peak in southeast China straddling the borders of Fujian and Jiangxi
Provinces; Qinling mountains of Shaanxi Province, consisting of four reserves (Foping, Niubeiliang,
Zhouzhi, and Taibaishan) and their surrounding natural forest areas where healthy populations of giant
pandas still reside; and Shennongiia, an area of very rich pristine forest in Hubei Province. The key
investment activities include: (a) preparation and implementation of new management plans; (b)
strengthening of field-level protection through financing of guard posts, new communications systems,
field kits and other miscellaneous equipment: and (c) expanding the role of local communities living
within and adjacent to nature reserve sites in the planning and management of reserves.
10.        The sub-component on community involvement, which will create new incentive structures
for long-term sustainable use of biodiversity resources, will support four activities. First, project officials
will review the objectives and design of the project with the stakeholders, raise awareness about the scope
for co-management, and solicit community interest in participation. Second, the project will provide
training in participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques and other participatory and advocacy skills to
local communities. Third, stakeholder committees will be formed at each reserve to work with project
officials in conducting PRAs, collecting and analyzing data on resource use, and identifying and ranking
community problems and needs. Fourth, stakeholder committees and project officials will prepare
Community Resource Management Plans and Co-Management Contracts that identify the respective roles
and responsibilities in resource use in reserves. The project will support the implementation of these
plans and contracts through: (a) establishment of a new community investment grants program to support
non-consumptive economic activities consistent with sustainable resource use; (b) development of new
education programs to strengthen public awareness and environmental education; (c) introduction of a
variety of community outreach programs such as summer nature camps; and (d) detailed monitoring and
evaluation to ensure equitable and effective implementation and to facilitate adjustments over the life of
the project .
11.        The Enterprise Restructuring Component (34 percent of total costs) would introduce a
pilot program for resolving biodiversity land-use conflicts adjacent to the Qinling Reserve Group. Two
state-owned forest farms under the Changqing Forestry Bureau have aggressively harvested timber outside
the reserve boundaries over the past two decades, which has significantly reduced the forest cover and
degraded a small but important corridor for the movement of Giant Pandas. The component would
introduce more sustainable management of this area through development of a restructuring program for
the enterprise based on a significant reduction in harvesting and the transfer of workers to more
environmentally sustainable employment. This program -- the first of its kind in China -- is expected to
establish a model for sustainable land-use management and enterprise restructuring that would be
disseminated to other protected areas in China.



- 4 -
12.        The following policy reforms and investment requirements would be supported. First, the
entire area would be legally designated as a national level nature reserve, with a core zone of 11,000 ha
and an experimental zone of 19,000 ha. The core zone would comprise the main panda habitat and all
harvesting, road construction, and other human interventions would be prohibited there (the government
has already stopped all these activities as of December 1, 1993 in preparation of the project). The project
would support a variety of protection activities for the core zone. The experimental zone would be
managed on a sustainable basis. The farms would still be permitted to harvest timber in this area, but
the following new conditions would apply: (a) the annual cut would not exceed the mean annual growth
of the forest; and (b) new silvicultural management practices would be introduced to maintain biodiversity
values. The project would support improved management of the experimental zone through preparation
of a management plan, reforestation of degraded areas, and training and technical assistance in improved
silvicultural management techniques. Second, the labor force of the forest farms would be restructured
in line with the revised cutting program, with the 1,193 redundant workers redeployed to more conserva-
tion-oriented economic activities in the project area or terminated with a relocation package. The project
would finance (a) sub-loans to develop employment opportunities for 1,043 redundant workers at existing
and new enterprises; and (b) relocation packages for 150 redundant workers that would comprise specific
expenditures related to worker and family relocation costs, worker retraining and placement costs, and
livelihood development.
13.        The Capacity Building Component (20 percent of total costs) would strengthen technical
and managerial skills in biodiversity through development of a national training team that would provide
about 900 person months of training at the national, provincial, and reserve levels. It would also enhance
the organizational capacity of the Division of Nature Reserves (DNR) in MFO through: (a) preparation
of a national conservation plan; (b) financing of computers, office equipment, and related TA; and (c)
preparation of a series of policy studies related to biodiversity conservation. Finally, it would strengthen
the Office of Nature Reserves (ONR) of the Forestry Department in Yunnan Province (YPFD), which
contains the largest diversity of species in China, through preparation of a provincial conservation plan
and development of a provincial geographic information system. The Management Information System
Component (8 percent of total costs) would support improved management decision making through: (a)
investment in computers, software, climatic recording equipment, and other scientific and office
equipment; (b) TA in database structure, data analysis and information management; and (c) development
of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program for NRMP. The Research Component (4
percent of total costs) would strengthen existing national research initiatives through: (a) financing of
research infrastructure and equipment in the five reserve areas; and (b) establishment of a new national
small-scale competitive research grants program.
14.        The project cost is estimated at $23.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of $6.8
million (29 percent of total costs). The Global Environment Trust Fund grant would finance $17.9
million in incremental costs (76 percent of total costs). To facilitate early start-up activities of the
project, retroactive financing of up to $500,000 equivalent is proposed for expenditures made after Sep-
tember 1, 1994 for priority planning and training requirements. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement amounts, and the disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
15.        Project Implementation. The proposed project would be implemented by MFO on the basis
of Project Implementation Rules (PIR) to be agreed with the Bank Group. A ministerial-level Leading
Group would set principles and policies, approve the overall implementation plan, and coordinate inter-
ministerial discussions. The actual day-to-day management would be jointly carried out by the DNR and



- 5 -
the World Bank Project Loan Management Center (PMC) in MFO, which coordinates all Bank-assisted
forestry projects in China. DNR would be responsible for all technical management, including
management plans, monitoring and evaluation, and training and TA. The PMC would handle financing,
procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing, and administrative activities. The same division of
responsibilities would occur at all project provincial forestry departments, where existing project
management offices (PMO), under PMC, would work closely with the Offices of Nature Reserves
(ONR), under DNR. Many of the tasks done at the provincial level would devolve to the nature reserves
at the end of the second year of the project, when nature reserve staff have had sufficient training and
their capacity has been strengthened. Local communities will participate in project implementation
through stakeholder committees and co-management contracts, which will permit a wide range of options
for community involvement that reflect the specific conditions of each nature reserve area.
16.        Community and NGO Involvement. The project has provided for extensive involvement
of local communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in preparation and implementation.
Group and household interviews were conducted in each of the nature reserve areas as part of
preparation, which provided detailed information on local needs, natural resource use and conflicts, and
economic activities. Socio-economic profiles of the communities were prepared that formed the basis for
the co-management program. Similarly, representatives from a variety of local and international NGOs
participated in the design and preparation of the project. Their continued involvement in the project will
be ensured through a bi-annual meeting designed to enhance cooperation and coordination among the
many NGOs and international donors involved in biodiversity conservation in China.
17.        Project Sustainability. Institutional sustainability is addressed through the strong emphasis
on capacity building in the project, particularly the development of: (a) improved organizational
management structures at the national and reserve levels; (b) a new national in-service training program;
and (c) a new management information system. Financial sustainability is addressed through: (a) a high
level of cost-sharing, including increasing recurrent budgetary allocations from county and provincial
governments for project activities during the life of the project; (b) policy studies that will review the
appropriate level of visitor fees and charges at reserves; and (c) government assurance to continue
meeting all recurrent operating costs after the project.
18.        Agreed Actions. The following are the main assurances obtained at negotiations: (a) nature
reserve management plans, incorporating time-bound implementation schedules, descriptions of any civil
works required, and environmental assessments carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to
the Bank Group, will be prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for comment for the Shennongjia
Nature Reserve and the five Qinling Nature Reserves by December 31, 1996, and for Wuyishan, Poyang
Lake, and Xishuangbanna Nature Reserves by December 31, 1997; and thereafter implemented taking
into account the comments of the Bank Group; (b) the Community Investment Grant Program and Small
Grants Research Program will operate in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group; (c)
any involuntary resettlement of persons arising under the project would be carried out in accordance with
procedures and principles satisfactory to the Bank Group; (d) sub-loans under the Changqing
Restructuring Component will be made only to enterprises that generate a financial rate of return of at
least 10 percent, are demonstrated to be technically feasible on the basis of a feasibility study approved
by the Bank Group, and are shown to have no adverse environmental impact on the basis of an environ-
mental assessment carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group; (e) sub-loans
will be extended for a maturity of not more than twelve years, including not more than four years of
grace, and accrue interest at 4 percent per year; (f) the relocation package under the Changqing
Restructuring Component will only finance costs from a list of expenditure items acceptable to the Bank



-6 -
Group; and (g) a baseline survey to determine the cost and composition of each relocation package will
be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to the Bank Group.
19.        The issuance of PIR acceptable to the Bank Group and the provision of written acceptances
of the PIR from all project provinces would be a condition of effectiveness. The project would also
include the following conditions of disbursement: (a) if any resettlement is expected as a result of the
corridor development in Wuyishan, the completion of a resettlement action plan satisfactory to the Bank
Group will be a condition of disbursement for the corridor development; (b) State Council designation
of the Changqing forestry area as a national-level nature reserve, and the completion of a relocation
report acceptable to the Bank Group will be conditions of disbursement for the relocation program under
the Changqing Restructuring Component; and (c) State Council designation of the Changqing forestry area
as a national-level nature reserve, and the provision of sub-loans in accordance with the agreed
procedures and terms and conditions will be conditions of disbursement for the job creation program
under the Changqing Restructuring Component.
20.        Environmental Aspects. The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact
through the improved management and protection of approximately 625,000 hectares within the five pilot
reserve sites, and the introduction of new land use and conservation measures on an additional 100,000
ha of contiguous biodiversity landscapes. However, the project may support some activities with
potentially adverse minor impacts, such as small-scale civil works construction in nature reserves and
development of new enterprises as part of the Changqing restructuring program. Therefore, individual
environmental assessments (EA) carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group
will be prepared under the project for all nature reserve management plans and for all enterprise
investments under the Enterprise Restructuring Component.
21.        Social Aspects. The project may involve the resettlement of 25-35 households as part of
the program to establish a protected corridor linking two core areas within Wuyishan. However, the
specific number of resettled households, if any, will not be known until the exact size and shape of the
corridor is determined during the preparation of the nature reserve management plan, which will be
carried out in the second year of the project. As reviewed in para. 19, the completion of a resettlement
plan acceptable to the Bank Group will be a condition of disbursement for the corridor development in
Wuyishan. No other involuntary resettlement is expected under the project; the EAs for the Changqing
enterprises will confirm that no land acquisition will be involved in the development of new enterprises.
22.        Since a few of the project areas contain important historical or religious sites, the EAs for
nature reserves will pay particular attention to the impact of project activities on cultural property and
the development of sound mitigation measures to ensure adequate protection. In addition, the project will
closely monitor the needs of ethnic minorities living within or adjacent to project areas (notably in
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province). In particular, the terms-of-reference for EAs, nature reserve
management plans, and tourism development plans will require detailed review of minority issues to
ensure that they are not adversely affected by project activities and that the social and economic benefits
they receive are consistent with their cultural preferences. Minorities will participate directly in the
design and implementation of project activities through stakeholders committees, Community Resource
Management Plans, and Co-Management Contracts.
23.        Proiect Benefits. The project would generate the following benefits: (a) a wide variety of
environmental benefits, including increased protection of rare biodiversity, improved water catchment
protection (all five reserve areas drain into major river systems), and increased carbon sequestration from
afforestation activities; (b) employment opportunities for low-income households involved in community



- 7 -
management of reserves and the Changqing restructuring program (the incidence of absolute rural poverty
is much greater in project areas than throughout the rest of the provinces as a result of limited access to
productive land and limited off-farm income near nature reserves); and (c) strengthening of human
resources and sector institutions, which would raise the overall productivity of resource use in the sector.
Most importantly, the project would provide new models for improved nature reserve management,
human resource development, and resolution of land-use conflicts that could be disseminated to other
parts of China facing similar threats to biodiversity conservation.
24.        Risks.  There are few technical risks, in view of the government's commitment to
biodiversity conservation and excellent track record in managing complicated World Bank investment
programs in forestry. The main risks include: (a) weak institutional capacity in DNR, which has been
addressed by a comprehensive capacity building program comprising appointment of additional staff, new
training programs, and TA; (b) delays in the recruitment of key experts under the TA program in the
areas of management planning and community development, which has been addressed through agreement
of a time-bound TA plan and advanced preparation of terms of reference; (c) inadequate participation of
local communities in reserve management, which will be closely reviewed under the project's monitoring
and evaluation program and supervised by Bank missions; and (d) inadequate provision of local

NATURE RESERVES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND

Chinese Academy of Sciences identify areas in
China that were appropriate as nature reserves.
China's first nature reserve was established in Guangdong Province. Over the next nine years eighteen
more reserves were added, bringing the total area protected to 650,000 ha. The pace slowed from 1966
to 1976, during the Cultural Revolution period. However, the passing of a revised Environment
Protection Law (in 1989, after initial enactment in 1979) and a revised Forest Law (in 1985, after initial
enactment in 1979) paved the way for a more comprehensive system of protected areas. Since then the
pace of expansion has increased rapidly, with nearly 100 new reserves being established each year at the
national, provincial and county levels. More than 700 nature reserves are now established, with a total
area of approximately 56 million hectares covering some 5.5 percent of the country. The plan is to
extend the system to 800 reserves totalling 6 percent of the country by the year 2000.
1.3         Within this nature reserve system, forty reserves or regions of very high biodiversity value
have been assigned a priority rating of "A," signifying a site of global significanceY  These 40 sites are

ranking used criteria such as biodiversity value (based on endemism, species richness, diversity of habitat, presence
of valuable species, size of the area, and uniqueness in protected area system), ecological viability, and potential
for management success. Forty reserves of international significance and 100 of national importance were identified
and a meeting, attended by nature reserve staff of all the provinces, was held in February 1992 to endorse the list.

well distributed to cover the greatest possible spectrum of ecosystems in the country. However, the
richest biological sites are concentrated in the tropical and sub-tropical zones in the south and southwest
of China. The project focuses on five reserve areas in this region, which are all of international
significance and identified as top biodiversity priorities in the BAP: Xishuangbanna, a cluster of five sub-
reserves in southwest Yunnan Province; Poyang Lake, China's most important wetland site in Jiangxi
Province; Wuyishan, the highest and richest peak in southeast China straddling the borders of Fujian and
Jiangxi Provinces; Qinling mountains of Shaanxi Province, consisting of four reserves (Foping,
Niubeiliang, Zhouzhi, and Taibaishan) and their surrounding natural forest areas where healthy
populations of giant pandas still reside; and Shennongiia, an area of very rich pristine forest in Hubei
Province.
B. Nature Reserves in China
1.4        The nature reserve system in China permits several different types of land use, each
involving different degrees of protection. Nature reserves are typically divided into a core zone area,
which contains the most important biological diversity and is protected by comprehensive restrictions on
human activity, and an experimental zone area, where people are allowed to reside and carry-out
economic activities. Since local communities existed within the boundaries of most nature reserves prior
to their establishment, the use of experimental zones allows villagers to continue to use reserve land as
long as they do not undermine the biological diversity in the core zone. While a few nature reserves have
developed buffer zones as a mechanism for strengthening protection outside reserve boundaries, the
government has not generally relied on buffer zones in the national system. China does not follow the
standard IUCN categories of protected land, such as natural parks, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.
1.5        Several different agencies are responsible for establishment and management of China's
nature reserves: MFO manages about two-thirds of them, and the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA), the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Oceanography Administration, CAS, local
governments, and other agencies administer the remainder.
1.6        Despite a strong commitment to biodiversity conservation, MFO's staff levels, management
budgets, and training and performance standards have not kept pace with reserve expansion. Few areas
are protected or managed effectively, and if current trends continue, biological diversity in many critical
reserves will diminish dramatically. The main constraints include a weak guard force, excessive emphasis
on capital-intensive infrastructure development, inadequate recurrent budgetary support, and an
inadequately structured management system.
1.7        The guard force is generally ineffective because forest police seldom go into the forest and
have no job security and limited allegiance. Guards who do go into the forest lack enforcement powers
and incentives to apprehend law breakers. They often become unpopular in their villages if they become
effective in their work. Monitoring and evaluation of the guards' work is inconsistent and ineffective.
Guards who patrol rarely keep notes on what they observe; as a result, this information is not passed on
to management divisions who need the information. Furthermore, guards lack the training, equipment,
and transport to do their jobs; and guard stations are often located too far from the reserves for effective
management.
1.8        Many nature reserves are based on a large degree of infrastructure development, relatively
large staff levels, and centralized bureau locations. This results in less funds available for recurrent
operating expenses for protection at the field level. Bureaus are located far from the reserves, usually



in towns, which improves access of staff to job related health care, education, and subsidized housing,
but decreases access of the staff to the reserve.
1.9        Moreover, a number of management problems constrain the more efficient use of human
and financial resources and contribute to unclear lines of authority. These include:
*     lack of long-term strategic plans on biodiversity conservation within the reserves and at the
provincial levels;
*     insufficient staff with unclear roles and limited financial support in the Department of Forest
Protection (especially the Division of Nature Reserves [DNR]) in MFO;
*     a poorly designed information system that is inconsistent at different locations, reflecting
the lack of common principles and guidelines in conservation management;
*     poor communication between levels of institutions and among institutions actively involved
in conservation issues;
*     ineffective management systems for operational planning, strategic planning, accounting and
financial reporting, management information, and staff accountability; and
*     employee incentive structures that do not reward people for prosecuting law breakers,
implementing improved management systems, developing innovative research ideas, or
coordinating conservation/development activities among different agencies.
C. Associated World Bank Project
1.10       The proposed Nature Reserves Management Project (NRMP) is associated with the World
Bank Forest Resource Development and Protection Project (FRDPP). FRDPP was approved by the
Executive Directors in June 1994, with a total project cost (excluding NRMP) of $333 million and IDA
financing equivalent to $200 million. NRMP was not approved at that time as the GEF I replenishment
was not yet effective. The combined FRDPP/NRMP project is designed to introduce a new sectoral
approach to sustainable resource planning and management in forestry. For the first time in China, the
combined project addresses resource use in all four of the main forest types in China (timber plantations,
watershed protection forests, natural forests, and nature reserves) and presents an integrated package of
investment, policy reform, and technical assistance requirements designed to improve the efficiency and
productivity of the sector as a whole. This comprehensive sectoral focus not only capitalizes on the
critical economic and environmental linkages among different forest areas and land uses but also
integrates national and global benefits into sector planning and management. This approach is an
important step away from the Government's current ad hoc and unprioritized investment program in
forestry. The FRDPP/NRMP project is a direct outgrowth of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
scheduled for presentation to the Board in June 1995, as it supports income enhancement and sustainable
environmental development in poor, remote areas across China.
1.11       The FRDPP/NRMP would comprise the following five components, in addition to the nature
reserves program. The Intensively Managed Plantation Component would establish 620,000 hectares
of plantations for timber, pulpwood, and pit props on barren or degraded land in sixteen provinces as the
second phase of the improved plantation program initiated under the National Afforestation Project (NAP)
(68 percent of total costs). The Multiple-Use Protection Forest Component would establish 280,000



- 4 -
hectares of watershed protection forests in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin in
Sichuan and Hubei Provinces based on new silvicultural models and improved land-use planning (13
percent of total costs). The Planting Stock Development and Nursery Management Component would
raise the quality of planting materials through introduction of improved genetic material and nursery
management technologies, and support the production of the 2.1 billion seedlings required under the
project (12 percent of total costs). The Research and Technology Transfer Component would streng-
then the operational focus of research and extension through provision of technical assistance and
operating support for eleven priority research programs, demonstration plantations, and extension activi-
ties (1 percent of total costs). Finally, the Institutional Capacity Building Component would strengthen
the capacity of forestry institutions through support for training and technical assistance, development of
information management systems, development of a new private sector investment promotion agency, im-
proved natural forest management, and policy studies (I percent of total costs).
D. Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Group Involvement
1.12       Since the proposed project would be the first Bank Group or GEF investment in biodiversity
in China, it draws on project experience from other countries under the GEF Pilot Phase and from NGOs
in China. The key lessons include: (a) the importance of a national strategic framework for biodiversity
investments; (b) the need to build in financial sustainability and long-term commitment from the
government; (c) the need to involve local people in design and implementation; and (d) the key role of
macroeconomic and sector policies in establishing an appropriate incentive framework for resource
conservation. It also draws on the implementation experience of the GEF PRIF in China over the past
two years, particularly the importance of twinning domestic and international technical assistance to
ensure effective transfer of new ideas and technologies. Similarly, the project draws on related lessons
from the 1991 Board paper on forestry, the 1991 Operations Evaluation Department report on forestry,
and the 1994 Board paper on forestry project implementation: (a) the importance of integrating the
management of protected and unprotected natural forest areas into regional forest management plans; (b)
the importance of developing restructuring programs for inefficient state forestry enterprises; and (c) the
need to expand the protected area system and improve management technologies for forests with high
biodiversity and environmental services values. Finally, the community participation program supported
under the project incorporates lessons learned from several on-going pilot activities in China managed
by NGOs and the government, particularly (a) the importance of integrating local villagers into the
assessment of community needs through participatory rural appraisal techniques, and (b) the need to
establish clear, mutually agreed contracts that identify the respective rights and responsibilities of reserve
staff and local communities in resource use within reserves.

CHAPTER 2: 7WE PROJECT AREA
A. Shennonglia Nature Reserve Project Area
2.1        Biophysical Characteristics. The project area in western Hubei Province consists of the
70,000 ha national nature reserve and about 100,000 ha of forested area outside of the nature reserve in
the townships of Bancang, Changfang, Songluo and Chaoyang (a map of the project area is included in
the back). The Shennongjia Nature Reserve comprises two blocks-one on the western and one on the
eastern side of the Yichang to Muyuping road. Both the Shennongjia Nature Reserve and the larger
Biodiversity Landscape Area of 100,000 ha are located within the Shennongjia Forestry District (about
325,000 ha). The entire forest cover of the Shennongjia Forestry District is 160,818 ha or 49 percent
of the land area. The forest proportion in Shennongjia Nature Reserve is slightly higher at 53 percent
and the adjacent Biodiversity Landscape Area is much higher at approximately 75 percent.
2.2        Biodiversity Importance. The mixed mesophytic forests of the Yangtze River valley contain
biodiversity of great richness and global significance. These forest formations are far richer in species
than any other temperate forest systems. For example, while the North American mixed mesophytic
forests comprise 25 main species of 16 genera with a further 14 genera as occasional associates, the
mixed mesophytic forests of China are much richer with 67 tree genera and some hundreds of species.
These rich forests, however, have mostly been destroyed and only a few precious remnants remain.
2.3         The Shennongjia area is one of the largest surviving remnants of such forests. The high
proportion of primitive and relict plants indicate that the area survived as a Pleistocene refuge during the
temperate Ice Ages. Preliminary investigations record a total of 53 tree genera in this forest type or 80
percent of the generic richness of the Chinese mesophytic forests. Shennongjia has 53 out of China's 67
genera, while the United States has only 27 out of those 67 and only 3 genera not found in China. The
reserve itself is also very rich in medicinal and useful plants and contains 32 nationally endangered plants
as well as several local endemic species. The richest forests in Shennongjia are found at lowest altitude.
However, this zone accounts for less than ten percent of the reserve area boundaries and continues to face
heavy pressure from agriculture. The reserve contains 54 protected animals, including five of category
I and 49 of category II. The most important animal in the reserve is the golden monkey, for which this
reserve constitutes the extreme eastern limits of its range. Two butterflies Bhutanitis mansfieldi and
Leuhdorfia chinensis are valuable rarities with potential for commercial rearing.
2.4         The area has a complete range of vegetation types. Sub-tropical mixed deciduous and
evergreen forests occur below 800 m and deciduous warm temperate broadleaf forests between 800 and
1800 m. The lower parts of this range are composed of rich mixed mesophytic formations, and the
higher elevations are of a colder temperate type with increasing proportions of conifers. Between 1800
and 2300 m, the forests are largely white pine (P. annandi) mixed with oaks, beech, maple, birch and
poplar. From 2300-2600 m, the forests are largely fir (Abiesfargesii) mixed with pines and birch and
with an understory dominated by arrow bamboo (Sinarundinaria nitida). The highest elevations are
almost pure fir with an understory of rhododendron and arrow bamboo; however, in many areas, cutting
of fir followed by fire has given rise to sub-alpine meadows of grasses (Arundinella hirta) and dense
thickets of the arrow bamboo.
2.5        The fauna is comparatively less rich than the flora and comprises a slightly impoverished
extension of the Himalayan/Sichuan highland fauna, with a few elements characteristic of Central China.



- 6 -
Thus the area shares tiger, leopard, black bear, golden monkey, serow, goral, muskdeer, wolf and most
birds with the Sichuan highlands but has lost giant panda, red panda, takin, sambar deer, eared pheasants,
monal, blood pheasant and several other species. The presence of Reeve's Pheasant is an example of the
small element of Central Chinese species in the area.
2.6         Villagers are allowed to farm land in the experimental zones of the reserve, located in the
two northern valleys and southern valley of the larger western block and the southern valley of the eastern
block. The nature reserve was logged as a production forest between 1970 and 1982, which has left an
extensive network of forestry roads reaching almost all parts of the reserve. Most of the reserve has been
seriously damaged by logging except some of the inaccessible and steep rugged areas of karst landscape.
Vegetation recovery in the lower parts of the reserve is good and it appears that almost all plant species
have survived and the forest is regenerating well. With reasonable protection from further cutting, these
forests will retain almost all their original biodiversity.

density of bamboo thickets prevents tree regeneration and occasional fires destroy all young tree
seedlings. Restoration of this zone to its original condition will require an active program of reforestation
over a long time period. Table 2.1 provides land-use data for the reserve.
2.8         Socioeconomic Setting. The Shennongjia Forestry District has a resident population of
77,274 people in 21 towns, including 8,203 people in 17 villages residing within the reserve and 34,892
people living in 100,000 ha of the "biodiversity landscape area" adjacent to the reserve. Table 2.2
illustrates the population distribution and agricultural land use in the reserve.
2.9         Most households residing within the reserve are agrarian. They cultivate corn, potatoes,
and beans and supplement these food crops with the sale of honey and some medicinal herbs (such as
Eucommia uimodes and Grynostemma pentaphyllum). Many keep a few animals, mostly pigs. Land for
food production is scarce. Table 2.2 indicates that each person is allocated about 2 mu for food
production. In the eastern section of the nature reserve, households appear to have, on the average, less
land per capita. Each household also is allocated, by the village, an area for collecting and cutting
fuelwood. Use rights for both the agricultural and forest areas are contracted with the village, generally
for five years. However, the contracts have few limitations on the use of the resources and monitoring
rarely occurs. In the eastern section of the reserve, firewood cannot be cut from the reserve's forests and
households must now purchase their firewood. Some households have purchased locally made fuel-saving
stoves in an effort to reduce their household consumption of firewood.

2.10          The Shennongjia Forestry District and township governments provide limited incentives for
sustainable resource use to villagers residing inside the reserve. For example, the township government
grants households tax subsidies in return for their cooperation in adhering to certain regulations, such as
the restriction on the cutting of firewood. Similarly, extension staff from the Shennongjia Forestry
District and the townships periodically visit villages, but these staff lack skills in community needs
assessment or community organization.
2.11          Resource Degradation. The following adverse impacts have occurred since Shennongjia was
established in 1982:
*      selective cutting of the lowland broadleaf forests, resulting in few  remaining large
specimens;
*      the virtual removal of all fir forests in the higher altitudes;
*      burning of the open ridges, resulting in a change from  forest ecosystem  to an alpine
grassland ecosystem in association with dense bamboo stands;
*      collection of plants and fuelwood;
*      reduced water holding capacity that increases downstream  runoff and the prevalence of
flooding; and



- 8 -
agricultural encroachment in the northwest region of the reserve.
2.12         Increasing pressure on land and forest resources is due to increasing populations, low
agricultural productivity and incomes, and unavailable alternative fuel sources to fuelwood. Population
growth rates have not been precisely determined from township level data, but interviews conducted in
villages during preparation suggest an annual rate of increase of 1.5 percent. Per capita incomes are very
low, at 150 to 250 yuan per annum. Access to land will become an increasing issue for agricultural
households. Already, fields are being cultivated on 30 percent to 40 percent slopes in the eastern portion
of the reserve, with yields estimated as low as 75 kg/mu for parcels on the hills, due to poor soils and
management practices.
2.13         Local communities have benefitted little from the establishment of the reserve, apart from
road access, tax subsidies, and some increased telecommunication service. They have had limited input
into reserve planning. Poaching does occur due to the limited income-generating activities in the area,
the lack of an effective protection system, and the limited incentives to guards to catch poachers.

2.15       Biophysical Conditions. The Foping Nature Reserve is quite small but encompasses a wide
range of altitudinal zones of the southern face of the Qinling mountains. The highest ridges 2200-2904
m are rocky with light cover of fir trees and grassy meadows of Arundinella hirta. These are the summer
feeding area of the takin, Budorcas taxicolor. These forests have not been officially designated as logging
areas but nonetheless appear to have lost some trees. Between 1400 and 2200 m there is a zone of
broadleaf deciduous forest dominated by oaks and chestnuts with pines and birch colonizers. This zone
has been cut over by local farmers over the past century but is presently well stocked and regenerating
well. The central valley still has a few farms, but the two outer rivers have no human settlements and
the forest there is more undisturbed. Most Rhus trees have been tapped heavily for the valuable
turpentine resin and many pine trees have also been overtapped for lac resin. In the main valley, the
forests are mixed with many oaks, chestnuts and other warm temperate broadleaf trees, with two species
of pine and opened areas being colonized by birch, aspen and willows. Below 1400 m down to the
lowest part of the reserve at 980 m, the reserve becomes botanically richer with very mixed formations
including several sub-tropical semi-evergreen species such as Lindera, Litsea, Cyclobalanopsis,
Cinnamomum, Castanopsis, and Dalbergia. The bamboo understory is extensive, with seven species in
the reserve dominated by Fargesia nitida above 2000 m and Bashaniafargesii below that altitude. These
species are the main food of the giant panda that uses the Fargesia zone between June and September and
the Bashania zone for the rest of the year. Both species showed some flowering and death in the 1980's
but large areas of healthy bamboo remain. The flowering has caused a temporary disconnection of the
Foping panda population from the neighboring Changqing population to the west but this is not a serious
problem. The Foping panda population is estimated at about 60 animals.
2.16       The lowest altitude of the Niubeiliang Nature Reserve is about 1100 m and highest peaks
are at 2571 and 2802 m. The lower slopes are well forested but the highest ridges are mostly covered
in grass and scrub of birch, roses and willows. Upper valleys are clothed in forests of silver birch, red
birch and pines with a few remaining firs, and lower slopes are dominated by oak (Quercus variabilis).
The land contours are extremely steep and the scenery is spectacular. No one lives inside the reserve and
there are only eight villages within 10 km of the boundary. Officials indicate that villagers are well
educated about conservation and that there is little poaching. The extreme west end of the reserve, a
large part of the south-east of the reserve, and the main ridge crest are said to be primary forests. The
northern and southern flanks have been lightly logged but over twenty years ago. They appear in good
condition and should support good wildlife populations. The main species of interest in the reserve is
the golden takin (Budorcas taxicolor) of which there are estimated to be more than one hundred. A
faunal inventory was conducted in 1981, but no species lists have yet been produced. However, it is
clear that this area supports most of the rare fauna and flora of the high Qinling mountains.
2.17       The Niubeiliang Nature Reserve was only established in 1987 and has only eight staff. The
total area is 16,500 ha divided among the three counties of Zuoshui, Changan and Ningshaan. The staff
currently occupy temporary offices in the town of Zashuixian about 30 km from the reserve. Marker
posts, boards and signs have been placed along 88 kilometers of reserve boundary.
2.18       Zhouzhi Nature Reserve. Zhouzhi Nature Reserve was established as a national level
reserve for the protection of golden monkeys. It is located between 1070 33'^108 02' longitude and 330
33'-33 56' latitude, in the mid-section of the Qinling mountains, adjacent to Foping Reserve to the South.
It stretches to Xinglongling peak and links up with Taibai Nature Reserve to the west, with a total area
of 50,599 ha. and a forest cover of 90.5 percent, containing mainly warm temperature mixed coniferous
and broadleaf forests dominated by the flora elements of central China and Northern China.



- 10 -
2.19       The reserve possesses 535 species of angiosperms falling into 100 Families, 8 species of
gymnosperms falling into 3 Families and 76 species of pteridophytes falling into 16 Families. There are
22 species that have been listed under the national protection. There are also 199 species of vertebrates
of 23 orders and 59 Families, which include 59 species of mammals, 111 species of birds, 5 species of
fish, 7 species of amphibians and 17 species of reptiles. There are about 1,540 golden monkeys, making
it one of the most concentrated areas for this species in the country. It is also believed that there are 15
giant pandas and about 500 golden takins within the reserve. The Reserve Bureau is set up in Erqu town,
Zhouzhi county and presently staffed with 35 people.
2.20       It is proposed that a 2 km-wide and 60 km-length wildlife corridor linking Nuibeiliang and
Zhouzhi be established to rationalize the fragmented protection areas. At the Nuibeiliang end of the
corridor, the main road from Xian to Shagou crosses the ridge with little impact but a side road leads off
to the west up a steep hill to a television relay station that could deter wildlife. Regeneration of these
slopes appears moderate and conditions for wild animals are good as the area is steep and rocky and
difficult for human penetration. Forests to the north of the corridor were logged lightly many years ago
but appear to be in excellent condition. The corridor should be made as wide as possible, especially at
the east end where the roads weaken the habitat link. It is recommended that by using gradient criteria,
all adjacent slopes above the prohibited cutting slope be identified and mapped into the protected corridor.
2.21        Taibaishan Nature Reserve is a famous sacred mountain with some 28 temples of Dao and
Buddhist origin scattered along the main trail up and over the peak of the mountain (3767 meters). It is
also known as one of the four important Chinese medicinal mountains. Twenty-four species of the 30
Class II medicinal plants approved by the State Administrative Bureau of Medicine and 14 species of the
34 species considered the most important in China are found in Taibai. Representative of these plants
are Fritillaria taibaiensis, Paphne spp., Gymnadenia conopses, and Eucommia uimodes. Other plants
with potential economic value include 79 species of fiber plants, 119 species of starches, 231 oil plants
and 90 tannin plants. The forests range from oak forests through a birch forest zone, to coniferous
forests on the highest altitudes with bare open alpine meadows and rock screes above the treeline at about
3000 meters. The general condition of the forest appears to be good and there are only two households
living in the reserve. In addition to the scenic, botanical and religious interests of the reserve, there are
some special geological interests in the form of glacial remains and a glacier lake near the summit of the
mountain. There is a major protection post at the entrance to the reserve at Hoapingzi where 14 staff
are stationed and a small economic tree garden is established, but the main bureau has been moved further
away from the reserve to the county town of Meixian.
2.22       Nipponia Nature Station is not designated as full-scale nature reserve but as a small
protection post for Nipponia nippon (Crested Ibis). The crested ibises live in some large old oak trees
in a cemetery nearby a farming village. A station has also been established to try to promote captive
breeding. At present only 30 crested ibis inhabit the area. Protection of the nest trees and ensuring
farmers do not disturb or kill feeding birds are the key steps for building the population of crested ibis.
2.23       Socioeconomic Setting of the Qinling Nature Reserves Group. All of the reserves except
Niubeiliang face pressure from contiguous communities. Zhouzhi, Foping, and Nipponia have resident
populations within their boundaries, but Taibaishan and Nuibeiliang are sparsely inhabited. Officially,
Taibaishan only has two households living within the reserve. However, each of the Tao or Buddhist
temples located within the reserves have one or two people at each who are responsible for maintaining
and protecting its cultural and spiritual aspects. Table 2.5 shows the population resident in and outside
of each of the reserves and the population densities within the reserves.

2.24          Resource Degradation. The main threat to biodiversity comes from the operations of two
forest farms under the Changqing Forestry Bureau, which is located at the mid-section of the Qinling
Mountain's southern slope, to the west of the Foping Nature Reserve. The Bureau was established in
1968 to manage about 30,000 ha of mature natural forests, located adjacent to the reserves, that contain



- 12 -
about four million cubic meters of standing volume. The two forest farms have pursued an aggressive
harvesting program over the past two decades, with a total offtake of 470,000 cubic meters of sawlogs
between 1968 and 1992, equivalent to an average cut of 19,000 cubic meters per year. Annual harvest
levels over the past three years have been even greater, approaching almost 30,000 cubic meters per year.
These levels have significantly exceeded the mean annual growth of the forest; consequently, the forest
cover has shrunk and the standing volume of the natural forest has declined to about three million cubic
meters. The Bank estimates that the forest farms would completely cut out the entire forest within thirty
years if this rate of extraction continues.
2.25       This harvesting program has created significant stress on several endangered species,
particularly the giant panda population in Foping Nature Reserve, which periodically cross into the
natural forest area managed by the Bureau to forage for food. Panda sightings in this area have greatly
declined over the past few years, particularly after the Bureau constructed a logging road in a pristine
forest area and damaged some bamboo sites favored by the pandas. The National Conservation
Management Plan for the Giant Panda (the "Panda Master Plan"), which was prepared jointly by the
MFO and the World Wide Fund for Nature, lists the improved management of the Changqing habitat as
one of the most pressing investment priorities in the national strategy to protect pandas.
2.26       All levels of government, from the County Forestry Bureau to MFO agree on the
importance of reducing harvesting levels at Changqing in line with sustainable forest yields and protection
of the panda habitat. However, restructuring efforts have been hampered by the extremely complicated
social and economic issues involved in state enterprise reform. As reviewed in the 1993 World Bank
Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 11932-CHA), enterprises in China are burdened with large
social costs related to the provision of subsidized housing, social security, health care and other benefits.
Despite the strong commitment to enterprise reform, Chinese firms are not able to shed redundant labor
and must still provide "lifetime employment" to workers. In the case of Changqing, the reduction in
harvesting levels in line with sustainable yields would lead to a significant loss in the revenue base of the
two harvesting enterprises. As a result, they would have insufficient funds to meet its social welfare
responsibilities to its current labor force of 2,262 people, which includes 1,713 workers and 549 retirees.
Hence, the government has indicated that it would only be possible to reduce harvesting in Changqing
if alternative sources of employment can be found for the redundant workers.
2.27       In addition to the Changqing Forestry Bureau operations, the Qinling Reserve Group also
faces a number of other land use conflicts. The southern edge of the Foping Reserve is more densely
inhabited and threatened by human encroachment, wood cutting, and hunting. Fire is rare but can occur
in secondary forest areas during the driest times of year. Hunters often penetrate to the remotest parts
of the reserve to trap animals. The central valley of Foping has several small cleared farming areas,
similar to that at Sanguangmiao village. There has been a continuous occupation of the valleys since the
Qing Dynasty, when several hundred people lived in the valley. Carved stone slabs, parts of old bridges
and some granite buddhas remain in the valley. The present population of only 371 people is much
smaller than in the Qing Dynasty and appears to be decreasing through emigration. Farmers raise maize,
potatoes, soya beans, "wood ear" mushrooms, tree crops, as well as livestock and honey bees. The
impact of these activities on the total reserve is probably not serious and is limited to small areas in the
central valley. The main human impacts inside the core area of Foping are hunting, forest fires, dog dis-
turbances that affect giant pandas, cattle grazing, the cutting of trees on steep slopes for agricultural ex-
pansion and fuelwood, mushroom rearing on cut birch logs, and fuelwood cutting.
2.28       In the Taibaishan Nature Reserve, the main threats consist of agricultural encroachment
around the periphery of the reserve and uncontrolled levels of tourism, which are disturbing to wildlife,



- 13 -
damaging to forest, and disturbing to the religious temple masters. There are also six state timber
enterprises located in close proximity to the reserve.
2.29        At the Nipponia Nature Station, the bird population is growing as fast as natural
reproduction allows. Hunting and shortage of quiet nesting sites is probably to blame for the decline of
the species, rather than food supply or quality.

2.31        Biophysical Conditions. The biodiversity richness of Xishuangbanna is undisputed. It has
more species of almost every taxonomic group, more endangered species of all classes, and more
economical species than any other reserve in China; similarly, it has very high levels of local endemism.
Since the species lists for the reserve area are outdated, it is not possible to say how many species on the
lists are still found in the reserve area without a new inventory. The reserve comprises several types of
vegetation, notably tropical lowland rainforest (approximately 500 ha), tropical montane rainforest
(approximately 2,500 ha), tropical seasonal rainforest (13,919 ha), monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest
(179,831 ha), Mossy evergreen broadleaf forest (470 ha) and other types-including forest on
limestone-(43,680 ha). The very small area of Parashorea chinensis dipterocarp rainforest at Bubang
is very precious and unique. The less rich montane forests on Nangongshan are also very special.
Limestone forests are the most threatened. The fauna of the reserve is tropical moist forest with such
large animals as tiger, leopard, elephant and guar and sambar deer with monkeys, gibbons, monitor
lizards, civets and a wide range of tropical birds-hornbills, pheasants, peacock, parrots, sunbirds, and
broadbills. The fauna is very rich at all altitudes but faces heavy pressure from hunting.
2.32        Socioeconomic Setting Inside the Reserve. Yunnan Province is often called the land of the
minorities. Dai, Hani, Bulang, Lahu, Yao, Zhuang, and Jinuo minorities groups are resident in
Xishuangbanna reserve, with the Dai, Yao, and Hani representing the majority of groups in the reserve.
There are 28 administrative villages consisting of 99 sub-villages in the five sub-reserves. These villages
are located in 14 different townships in the three counties of Menghai, Mengla, and Jinghong.
Approximately 15,000 people reside inside of the reserves. Table 2.7 illustrates the population distribut-
ion figures inside the five sub-reserves.
2.33        Agriculture, forestry, animal production, fisheries, and small-scale commercial enterprises
provide the main economic activities and employment for those residing in the reserve. Approximately
50 percent of the total gross economic output for residents within the reserves comes from the rearing

of livestock. Approximately 10,000 head of cattle   Table 2.7: Population Data for Xishuangbanna

gross economic output.
2.34       Food production occurs on 3,790 ha
of reserve land. An additional 1,296 ha of land is in plantation production-cinnamon (593 ha), rubber
(376 ha), tea (269 ha), and fruit orchards (59 ha). Therefore, the total land under cultivation in the
reserves is 5,086 ha-about 2.1 percent of the total reserve land. Rice is the main crop and about 70
percent of the land in the reserves is in dryland rice production and the remaining 30 percent in wet
paddy. The average yield per hectare (in 1990) was estimated to be 2392 kg, with a per capita yield of
589 kg per annum. Agricultural output data for the
five sub-reserves is given in Table 2.8.
2.35        Slash and burn agriculture has been   Table 2.8: Economic Output Data for

in 1992 prohibited all rubber and tea plantations   Rubbr       I                     0.1
from expanding their land areas.
2.36       The volume of standing forest inside
the reserve was approximately 40 million m3 in 1990. Natural forest represents about 80 percent of this
total. Logging in the reserve is prohibited and the cutting of trees for fuelwood has consumed about 1
percent of the mean annual increment of the forests in the reserve. Hunting within the reserve was
prohibited about three years ago by the provincial government.
2.37       Socio-economic Setting of the Buffer Zone. Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve is contiguous
to three counties with 24 townships, 149 administrative villages and about 1200 sub-villages. This area,
officially classified as the buffer zone for the reserve, had a 1990 population of 354,000. Agriculture
is the dominant economic activity of households in the buffer areas. Approximately 58,000 ha of land
is in paddy and 33,000 ha in dryland field crops, leading to an average per capita land holding of about
0.20 ha. Plantations consist mostly of rubber (22,000 ha) and tea (7,300 ha), although fruits and herbal
medicines are grown on about 6,300 ha of land. In 1990, agriculture contributed a gross output of 154
million yuan (approximately $27 million), including 90 million yuan from food production, 11 million



- 15 -
yuan from sugarcane, 2.3 million yuan from fruit, 1.5 million yuan from tea, and approximately 1 million
yuan from herbal medicines (mostly from Amomum villosum). Seven national forest farms operate in the
buffer zone area, covering a total area of 79,000 ha, and produce timber and bamboo. In 1990, 18,400
m3 of timber and 3.11 million bamboo poles were produced.
2.38       Existing Tourism in Xishuangbanna. Increasing tourism at the Xishuangbanna Nature
Reserve is the major development objective of the prefecture government. Between 1986 and 1990,
23,000 international tourists visited Xishuangbanna Prefecture. During the current five year development
plan, the following key activities have been proposed:
*     Jinghong will be developed to handle increased levels of tourists with enhanced facilities,
such as a new international air routes and new hotel facilities; in addition, international
marketing will be improved with the opening of new offices in Bangkok and Hong Kong;
*     the Mekong River will be improved as a tourist route through the building of lodges along
the river and increasing and improving tourism boat traffic; and
*     22 scenic spots within the prefecture will be improved.
2.39        Current Management of the Reserve. The reserve is completing a large five-year investment
program in its physical infrastructure. About 15 million yuan (10 million yuan from central government
and 5 million yuan from provincial government) have been spent on this development, in addition to the
annual recurrent budgetary allocation of 1.2 million yuan. This level of investment is extremely large
for China, as it equals the entire amount of recurrent and development expenditure program for all other
forestry activities in the whole of Yunnan Province.
2.40        Each of the five sub-reserves has its own management division, although Shangyong has no
director's office. To coordinate activities among the reserves and the different levels of government,
there is a Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve Bureau situated in the prefectural capital of Jinghong.
This bureau is relatively large for its function, comprising 6,400 m2 of buildings and 55 staff; absorbs
a large share of the reserve budget (70 percent of development and 75 percent of recurrent); and is
located far the actual sub-reserves. At the sub-reserve level, it is evident that performance in some areas
is less than satisfactory as a result of weak supervision, lack of inspection, poor communications and lack
of clear instructions -- all of which are exacerbated by the distance of the coordinating bureau from the
five sub-reserves.
2.41       Resource Degradation. Principal threats to the biodiversity riches of Xishuangbanna are
continued shifting cultivation, the collection of firewood and construction timber, and hunting. All these
factors are exacerbated by a population growing by nearly 3 percent per year, the diverse ethnic make-up
of the population, and the different ethnic rights and traditions that depend on forest use. The location
of 90 villages in and around the reserve place direct pressures on the forests inside the reserve, which
are clearly still being degraded as a result of tree cutting, fires and hunting in many areas.
2.42       A major threat in the past has been the clearance of new forest for the planting of rubber.
This threat seems now to be reduced as a result of a provincial instruction to halt the further extension
of rubber plantations. The large quantities of fuel needed to process the existing production of rubber,
however, continues to create pressures on forest land use.



- 16 -
2.43       Generally, the core areas of the reserves are still in good condition and not facing immediate
pressure. However, this is due more to the fact that population has not reached these areas rather than
to good protection or stewardship. Resource degradation will no doubt increase as the local population
grows and places more demands on scarce land resources. Similarly, tourism is creating land-use
conflicts. On the one hand, it generates income for the region and can help finance reserve management
costs. On the other hand, large numbers of people are already creating deleterious effects on precious
areas of the reserve, through soil compaction, damage to vegetation, littering and spoiling the scenic and
natural values of the area.
D. Wuyishan Nature Reserve Project Area
2.44       Project Area. Wuyishan Nature Reserve encompasses a total area of 61,099 ha and
straddles two provinces, with the larger part located in Fujian Province and the smaller part in Jiangxi;
an additional 262,000 ha are classified as a buffer zone (a map of the project area is included in the
back). The reserve is located in the Wuyi Mountain range and rises to the peak of Mt. Huanggang, at
2158 m the highest peak in southeast China. Lowest elevations of the reserve are between 400 and 600
m and mean elevation is about 1200 m. The entire area consists of some 133 peaks above 1500 m and
intervening rolling hills and deep valleys. The Fujian part lies on the southeastern slopes of the range
and is drained by south-flowing tributaries of the Min river. The Jiangxi section lies on the northeast
facing side of the range and its single river Xin drains north, eventually reaching Poyang Lake and the
Changjiang river system.
2.45       Biophysical Condition.  Wuyishan, probably the richest and most complete remaining
example of south-east China subtropical evergreen forest ecosystem, has been consistently recognized by
Chinese scientists as a priority area for species conservation. The reserve was listed as a Man and
Biosphere (MAB) Reserve in September 1987 and has been paid much attention by the Chinese MAB
Committee and other institutes of the CAS as well as local universities. The flora and fauna have been
comparatively well documented. Lists of higher plants (1446 spp), lower plants (840), birds (256),
mammals (71), fish (40), amphibians (34) and insects (4557) all attest to the richness and importance of
the locality. An added interest is that this was one of the early collecting localities of the French
missionary and biologist Pere Armand David and is thus the type locality of about 100 species of animals.
Many of these are endemic to southeast China and as a result of the severe threat faced by original forests
in eastern China, the species lists contain a very high proportion of the nationally listed protected species.
Several of these species are listed as threatened or endangered in the International Red Data lists of
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and several are also listed as protected under
the appendices of CITES. The most important species include the South China Tiger (Panthera tigris),
the rare endemic pheasant (Tragopan caboti) and one of the rarest butterflies in the world (Taeniopalpus
aureus), for which the reserve is especially famous.
2.46       Socio-Economic Setting. According to 1990 statistics, there are 45 inhabited areas consisting
of 514 households of 2,519 people inside the reserve. Two inhabited areas with 8 households of 39
people are in the core area; 2 inhabited areas with 19 households of 110 people are in the buffer zone;
and 41 inhabited areas with 487 households of 2,370 people are in the experimental area. There are eight
townships with a population of 128,055 located outside the reserve. The growth rate of the population
between 1980 and 1990 was 2.2 percent.
2.47       In order to protect the biological resources and prevent the natural landscape from damage,
the economic activities of the residents in the reserve have been restricted mainly within the designated
production zones of the experimental area. The main operations are mao bamboo and tea cultivation



- 17 -
(with related small-scale processing activities), and thinning and sanitation cutting in some forest stands
to produce small amounts of timber. In 1991, the total income from the reserve areas reached about 10.3
million yuan, including 4.5
million  yuan from  forestry          Table 2.9: Economic Output Data for Wuyishan Reserve

2.48         Resource Degradation.  The most serious problem  threatening the biodiversity value of
Wuyishan is the rapid spread of mao bamboo. A large mosaic of bamboo monoculture has evolved as
a result of the active cutting of other trees that were formerly mixed in this zone and the annual clearing
of undergrowth. The resultant bamboo groves are poor for wildlife, providing almost no food or cover.
For example, while 62 bird species were identified in the reserve during field visits during project
preparation, only one species was seen in the bamboo groves. The result of this development is the loss
of some of the richest habitat areas in the reserve, particularly within the subtropical evergreen broadleaf
forests. This will lead to the reserve being cut in two and a break in the continuity of altitudinal wildlife
habitat, forcing many wintering species outside the reserve.
2.49         Other human disturbances include burning of grassland and collection of ferns, which has
led to stunted forest vegetation in the higher and more exposed peaks and ridges; some logging and wood
slides in the coniferous zone; and hunting both inside and outside the reserve. However, current hunting
pressure seems to be low, so populations should be able to recover.

E. Poyang Lake Migratory Bird National Nature Reserve Project Area
2.50       Project Area. This national nature reserve consists of nine lakes in the northwest corner
of the Poyang Lake between 115 55'-1 16 03'E by 29 05'-29 15'N (a map of the project area is included
in the back). Poyang reserve had a total area of 22,400 ha at the time of establishment, which was
expanded to 33,600 ha in 1993. In summer, all the lakes join the main Poyang lake and almost the entire
reserve is flooded. In winter, the water level drops and villagers cut the reeds and grass that grow on
the gradually exposed dry land. Villagers also graze buffalo on these lands. Some of the sub-lakes have
fish farm enterprises that manage commercial fish operations. This regime creates a mosaic of open
water, bare mud and short grassland and provides an attractive winter refuge for large numbers of
wetland birds migrating south from the tundra regions. The reserve bureau has been established at the
small town of Wucheng at the junction of the Gan and Xiu rivers. A rough road can be used only in the
driest months of the year. At other times, the reserve is accessible by road from Nanchang to Yongxiu
and then by boat to Wucheng.
2.51       Biophysical Conditions. The reserve has been consistently identified as China's most
important wetland site by both national and international reviews. It is possibly the most important
wetland site in all of East Asia. Although figures for the richness of plants and mammals are not high
(due to flooding for half of the year), the richness of fish (122 spp) and mollusks (56 spp) is high. More
important, however, is the variety and numbers of visiting winter waterfowl. A total of 284 bird species
have been recorded in the reserve. Many are only transient but about 150 species are regular winter
visitors. Some species are present in spectacular numbers, particularly Swan Geese. Poyang protects
about 95 percent of the entire world population of wintering Siberian cranes (Grus leucogeranus) and by
far the largest population of Swan Geese (Anser cygnoides). Other globally endangered species dependent
on the reserve include the white stork (Ciconia boyconia) and Japanese marsh warbler (Megaluruspryeri).
Other species occurring in the reserve and listed on China's category I protection list include hooded
crane, great bustrad, black stork, merganser and three eagles.
2.52       The exact reasons for the number of migratory birds using the Poyang Lake habitat are
unknown. It appears that the existing variety of land use in the Poyang Lake may provide a combined
water and terrestrial habitat attractive to the birds. Any attempts to manipulate this environment without
detailed data would no doubt decrease the attractiveness of the habitat.
2.53       Socioeconomic Setting and Resource
Degradation. The alteration of Poyang Lake has Table 2.11: Land Use in Poyang Lake
had very significant in terms of wetland impacts.  Area    Inside Reserve   Adjacent

Significant pollution is generated from local
manufacturing enterprises and the river-based
transport industry. This includes fuel spills, wave
motion and the resultant river bank erosion, the pollution of water systems from boat discharge, and non-
point pollution arising from associated land use. There is some indication of eutrophication, which could



- 19 -
be a threat to the lake system if the lake level is lowered. Table 2.11 provides data on land use within
and in the immediate vicinity of the reserve.
2.54       The population inside the reserve has grown from 14,454 in 1987 to 15,165 in 1990, an
annual increase of 1.7 percent. This is the same annual growth rate as outside of the reserve, which
reached 172,816 people in 1990. The total cultivated land area inside the reserve amounts to 1,443
hectares and this has not changed in the last four years largely because extra land is unavailable. Outside
the reserve, the demand for land continues to increase but at less than 1 percent per annum. Rice is the
main crop produced with increasing use of insecticides and herbicides. No comprehensive data exist on
the extent and impact of agrochemicals on the ecosystem.
2.55       Fishing is the main activity that impacts on the immediate environment for some of the fish
feeding waterfowl. The direct competition for fish and the methods of fishing in the smaller lakes, which
are drained to remove the fish, reduce the food supply and change the immediate habitat of waterfowl.
The lake drainage has a particularly adverse impact on the Siberian and White-Naped Cranes, as they will
not feed on dry mudflats and are likely to leave the protection of the reserve to find suitable feeding areas
where they will be more vulnerable to poaching. In addition, draining the lakes early for fish harvesting
reduces the feeding habitat for much of the winter, which is particularly damaging if the winter proves
to be dry. Total catches for Poyang Lake of 25,000 tons were recorded in 1989. During interviews
conducted as part of project preparation, households reported lower fish catches and agricultural yields
along with an increased level of effort to attain these yields. Although survey data do not exist, it appears
that the local fishery is under increasing pressure from over-fishing.
2.56       Other impacts from local communities include the planting of poplar and willows, which
could reduce water levels, and the continued hunting of birds outside, and to a limited degree, inside the
reserve. In addition, the grazing of buffalo on river banks and other productive activities has led to
limited soil erosion and increased siltation and sedimentation, which has been calculated to average 2 to
3 mm of siltation per annum. Water monitoring data indicate the presence of some copper, zinc, and
manganese contamination from upstream industry. Poorly enforced pollution regulations has enabled
industries to discharge directly into waterways.
2.57       The nature reserve has moved to take over control of the fish farms located within the
reserve boundaries as part of the overall management of the reserve. However, this activity has become
a financial liability for the reserve due to declining fish yields, e.g., 78,000 jin in 1992 compared to
113,000 jin in 1988. Income levels from the catches have also dropped, from 81,450 yuan in 1988 to
38,000 yuan in 1992. A winter fishing ban has been established by the reserve to protect the feeding
grounds of migratory birds. However, the use of these bans could be avoided by earlier draining of the
smaller lakes, which would have little or no impact on the migratory bird habitat.

CHAPTER 3: THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.1        The main objective is to enhance biodiversity conservation through testing of innovative
approaches to organization, planning, skills development, information management, and the integration
of local communities into reserve management. This will directly address major constraints in the sector,
such as inadequately defined and structured nature reserve management systems, ineffective field-level
guard force, and a resource allocation system that favors large infrastructure development and high
staffing levels at the expense of adequate operating budgets for protection at the field level. The project's
main focus will be on developing skills, human resources, and processes for improving protection and
management at the field level.
B. Detailed Project Description
3.2        The project will include the following five components.
Component One: Strengthening Management of Nature Reserves
3.3        The objective of this component is to strengthen protection, planning, organization, and
community participation in five pilot reserve areas of international significance that have been identified
as top biodiversity priorities in the BAP. As reviewed below, the key investment activities include: (a)
preparation and implementation of new management plans; (b) strengthening of field-level protection
through financing of guard posts, new communications systems, field kits and other miscellaneous
equipment; and (c) expanding the role of local communities living within and adjacent to nature reserve
sites in the planning and management of reserves.
Sub-component: (a) Enhancing Reserve Management
3.4        Current reserve management will be enhanced through the introduction of strategic planning,
more accountable organization management structures, and improved administration. The following
specific activities will be supported:
*    developing or revising management plans in the five reserve areas. Technical assistance
(TA) will be provided to assist in the preparation of specific management plans at
Shennongjia and Qinling nature reserves. TA will also be provided to train staff at the
other three reserves, the Office of Nature Reserves (ONR) of the Yunnan Provincial
Forestry Department (YPFD), and the DNR of MFO, who will subsequently revise or
develop their own management plans.
*    preparing reserve tourism plans that determine appropriate levels and types of tourism for
the specific biophysical conditions and overall objectives for each reserve; and
*    strengthening the organizational management of the reserves, especially at the field
protection level, by developing systems for accountability and responsibility, strengthening



- 21 -
incentive systems for job performance, and preparing guidelines for strategic and
operational planning.
3.5        One of the major goals of the project is to strengthen planning skills and structures at the
nature reserve level.  This will be accomplished by developing reserve management, land-use,
organizational management, and tourism development plans that, together, will form a strategic blueprint
for each of the reserves. The reserve management plans are the most critical planning documents for
establishing the framework in which long- and short-term decisions are made for land-use development
and management (a sample outline for a reserve management plan is included in Annex 1).
3.6        To ensure effective implementation of this sub-component, the following assurances were
obtained at negotiations: (a) nature reserve management plans, incorporating time-bound implementation
schedules, descriptions of any civil works required, and environmental assessments carried out in
accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group, will be prepared and furnished to the Bank
Group for comment for the Shennonglia Nature Reserve and the four Qinling Nature Reserves by
December 31, 1996, andfor Wuyishan, Poyang Lake, and Xishuangbanna Nature Reserves by December
31, 1997; and thereafter implemented taking into account the comments of the Bank Group; and (b) no
civil works construction in the nature reserves will commence until they have been provided for and
agreed in the nature reserve management plans.
Subcomponent (b): Improving Field Level Protection Systems
3.7        This subcomponent will strengthen the effectiveness of field-level protection based on the
recommendations developed from the reserve management plans. The five reserve areas will receive
support for appropriate equipment and infrastructure for guards, supervisors, researchers and management
staff to carry out their work. Support will be provided for:
*     guard posts, boundary markers, observation posts, and miscellaneous equipment for field
protection staff;
*     field kits for research and protection staff to facilitate the collection of field data; and
*     improved communications technology and equipment to improve reserve administration.
Subcomponent (c): Augmenting Community Participation
3.8        In areas where people reside within or adjacent to nature reserves, integrating communities
into reserve management is essential for effective protection and sustainable management of scarce natural
resources. However, in China, local communities do not play any direct role in the planning or
management of land in reserves and face limited incentives for biodiversity conservation. As a result,
the core zones of most reserves are encountering increasing pressure from agricultural encroachment,
hunting, fuelwood collection, livestock grazing, and other economic activities. Some reserves have
responded to these pressures by introducing some community involvement in monitoring resource
degradation in reserves. For example, Zhouzhi Nature Reserve in the Qinling Group has established a
local committee in the Banfangzi Township to protect the forest from fire, Poyang Lake has established
local committees to monitor birds, and Xishaungbanna and Taibaishan Reserves have made efforts to
address the special concerns of minority and religious groups in the use of resources. In addition, some
reserves have developed alternative income-generating activities for communities based on non-
consumptive, sustainable use of resources in the reserves. However, nature reserve staff lack skills and



- 22 -
training in community organization, conflict resolution, and extension. As a result, some of the
community development programs have evolved without a clear understanding of community needs and
without a mutually agreed program to redress resource management conflicts.
3.9        Under this subcomponent, a process will be developed for nature reserve staff, and other
appropriate extension staff, to plan with communities the use of natural resources within the experimental
zones of nature reserves (a detailed description of the co-management program is included in Annex 2).
This process, which will draw on the implementation experience available in China and in neighboring
countries, will be tested in a total of eight pilot communities in four reserves, in order to develop a model
for wider dissemination throughout China. It will lead to the development of community resource
management plans (CRMP) that will form the basis for Co-Management Contracts between the
communities and respective nature reserves. These contracts will identify the respective roles and
responsibilities in resource use in reserves. Support will be provided for:
*     developing and testing participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and group facilitation approaches
for assessing community needs, resource uses, and conflicts;
*     conducting extensive field-training in PRA as part of community organization efforts in
Shennongjia and Qinling Nature Reserves. Key staff from the five reserve areas, the DNR
and selected provinces will assist in the implementation of PRAs in these two reserves,
supported with technical assistance. They will then return to their own areas and carry out
PRAs in other communities based on the training and experience learned in the first two
reserves;
*     facilitating CRMPs that divide responsibilities between nature reserves and communities for
co-management of natural resources. These plans will be legitimized in detailed contracts
signed by the nature reserves and local communities, which will be approved by local
government and monitored by local multi-institutional leading groups;
*     implementing income-generating activities for the pilot communities through Community
Investment Grants (CIGs) that are based on the CRMPs; the CIGs will only support non-
consumptive economic activities consistent with sustainable resource use;
*     financing equipment and training for summer and winter camps for schoolchildren where
interactive conservation instruction is provided;
*     preparing displays within the reserves that demonstrate conservation issues;
*     financing equipment and training for conservation information centers, which demonstrate
the relationships among general biological processes, the specific ecological conditions of
the five nature reserves, and human interventions;
*     financing equipment and training for mobile conservation education workshops for members
of communities and local officials; and
*     providing technical expertise to assist in developing the co-management process and
supporting MFO monitoring and evaluation efforts.



- 23 -
3.10       Detailed operational guidelines for the CIG program have been agreed with government and
are summarized in Annex 3. The following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) the CIG
program will be established in a total of eight pilot commnunities in four nature reserves (Shennonglia,
Xishuangbanna, Poyang Lake, Qinling), (b) the CIG program will operate in accordance with guidelines
acceptable to the Bank Group, which will include the following provisions: grants will be used to finance
alternative income-generating investments that reduce the need for communities to harvest protectedflora
and fauna in nature reserves, grants will be approved by provincial ONRs, and each grant will be made
under a contract between the recipient and the nature reserve administration on the basis of a model
contract acceptable to the Bank Group; and (c) a report evaluating the experience of the CIG program
will be prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for comment by September 1, 1999. To ensure the
financial sustainability and replicability of the CIG program, the government will finance a higher share
of this activity (40 percent) than the other components (15 percent).
Subcomponent (d): Nature Reserves Investment
3.11       The project will also support a small amount of civil works, equipment, and vehicles
necessary to improve protection in the five reserve areas, in line with the different objectives and
management plans for each of the reserves, as reviewed below.
3.12       The objective for the Shennongjia Nature Reserve is to establish a model "Biodiversity
Landscape Area" where the dual aims of nature protection and economic development can be harmonized
within the Chinese context. This includes rehabilitation and upgrading of reserve facilities; developing
sustainable land-use programs to conserve biodiversity in 100,000 ha just outside the nature reserve; and
designing and executing a monitoring and evaluation program to meet land-use planning and management
needs and measure impacts of the project. The nature reserve management plan will determine the exact
investment requirements for Shennongjia. However, the likely areas of support will be: (a) guard posts,
equipment and infrastructure to expand the coverage of protection and develop a positive incentive system
tied to enforcement; (b) reforestation of the fir zone of the nature reserve; and (c) rationalization of land
use in the contiguous Biodiversity Landscape Area.
3.13       The objective for the Qinling Nature Reserve Group is the development of a coordinated
network of protection areas covering representative ecosystems of the Qinling Mountains. Key activities
include:
*     strengthening the protection of biological and religious values of the Taibaishan Nature
Reserve through integration of protection with religious authorities;
*     strengthening the protection and research capabilities in the Foping National Nature
Reserve;
*     strengthening technical capabilities of Nipponia protection staff;
*     planning and developing the nature reserves of Zhouzi and Niubeiliang with emphasis on
wildlife protection but including a capability to conduct management-related research on
important species; and
*     undertaking a regional land-use plan with adequate provisions for controlled tourist
development and socio-economic self-sufficiency of local villages.



- 24 -
3.14       The project will also finance the demarcation and revegetation of a 60 km wildlife corridor
between the Zhouzi and Niubeiliang Reserves. The corridor is presently uninhabited as a result of the
harsh and hilly terrain. For most of its length, a width of 2 kilometers will be adequate to allow animal
movements and exchange between the two reserves, but the width of the corridor will be widened at each
end where it is crossed by major highways and where habitat continuity is weakest. The exact method
of establishment - whether through natural regeneration or reforestation -- will be determined during
through the preparation of nature reserve management plan.
3.15       An important feature of the project will be increased sharing of resources across the different
reserve administrations, particularly with regards to research. The four reserves will no longer continue
to pursue separate research programs, and, instead, the provincial bureau will establish a single Qinling
research unit and assign staff from the various reserves to different research topics. For example, panda
research will be concentrated at Foping and Changqing; golden monkey research at Zhouzi; takin research
at Niubeiliang; and botanic research and studies of medicinal plants at Taibaishan.
3.16       The primary objective for Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserves is to develop
management approaches that integrate ethnic minorities in conservation, support ecotourism, and
coordinate research programs. Provisions would be made to:
*    develop ecotourism facilities that help pay for and justify protection activities without
endangering the biodiversity resource base;
*    develop processes for assisting villages in and around the reserve to reduce their
dependence on forest resources, strengthen their involvement in forest protection and
protect their ethnic rights and features;
*    conduct scientific research on tropical biodiversity resources, particularly the impact
of human interventions on flora and fauna; and
*    forge cooperative linkages with other institutions involved in agriculture, forestry,
tourism, and research in the area.
3.17       The project will provide limited investment in infrastructure to fill in gaps in the protection
system, particularly at the Mengyang and Shangyong reserves. Key requirements include vehicles,
computers, training, and a program of assistance to buffer zone villages that will build on existing
principles of the "longshan" or dragon hill concept already well developed among local Dai and other
minority groups in the region.
3.18       The objective for the Wuyishan Nature Reserves is to develop improved models to
integrate research, village development, and infrastructure development with biodiversity conservation.
Specific activities include:
*     strengthening protection on the Fujian side of the reserve;
*     developing the village extension and environmental education activities as models for
training of other village groups and reserve staff in China;
*     expanding the core area of the reserve by linking the existing two core areas with a
corridor; and



- 25 -
implementing a program to control the encroachment of mao bamboo on the natural forest.
3.19       Little additional infrastructure is required at Wuyishan, which already contains extensive
facilities. Four new guardposts are proposed: one in Jiangxi and three in Fujian. The construction of
more multi-purpose observation stations and permanent monitoring posts is not recommended, it is better
to leave monitoring points as undisturbed as possible. Reserve staff will visit only when necessary to
resurvey such areas and use tents if longer periods of work are needed. A limited number of vehicles,
radio equipment, computers, office equipment, binoculars, cameras, video equipment and field kits are
needed by the reserve to improve routine operation.
3.20       A model reserve database and data handling capability will be developed for Wuyishan that
builds on the existing nascent GIS (supported under Component Four). The data center will be able to
handle inventory, survey and census data, habitat monitoring, routine patrol data, and socioeconomic
data. Data management will evolve from the design and use of manual report forms and manual files to
the analysis of data on spreadsheets and database files and the integration of relevant data into a
computerized system. The emphasis of the database is to handle data that are needed for routine
management decisions in the reserve and ensure that information is presented in a useful format to those
who need it.
3.21       Wuyishan management has already been working with local villages on introducing
alternative income-generating activities to reduce pressures on the reserve. Mao bamboo trials and an
extension program have been supported by the reserve in order to intensify production on limited land
and maximize returns. Some additional activities in support of trials of high value crops within the
reserve will be supported. Similarly, funds will be provided to develop handicraft industries that fully
utilize the mao bamboo and other commercial crops. In addition, the project will support a variety of
community education and awareness programs for the reserve; one promising example is the on-going
effort of women's groups at Outou village to develop their own conservation awareness program.
3.22       One project activity in Wuyishan, however, may involve some resettlement. As noted
above, the project will develop a corridor linking two core areas within the reserve. This would promote
greater exchange of flora and fauna among the core areas, which would support the maintenance of a
viable gene pool for preservation of biodiversity. The exact size and shape of the corridor will be
reviewed and determined in the nature reserve management plan, which will be prepared in the second
year of the project. There are presently about 35 households located near the proposed corridor area who
are engaged in the cultivation of 600 ha of tea and bamboo. Depending on the final proposal for the size
of the corridor area, it is possible that some present land use may be restricted and some compensation
for lost agricultural production and resettlement of households required. It has been agreed that MFO
will provide the following materials to the Bank Group in the event that the creation of the corridor area
will involve any taking of agricultural land or resettlement: (a) a detailed map based on ground truthing
of the important habitats to be included in the corridor; (b) detailed information regarding present land
use in the corridor, including the location of households, the amount of land under agriculture, valuation
of current income generating activities, and the type and amount of infrastructure; and (c) a
comprehensive resettlement plan that conforms to the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30. An assurance
was obtained at negotiations that any involuntary resettlement of persons arising under the project would
be carried out in accordance with procedures and principles satisfactory to the Bank Group. To that end,
if any resettlement is expected as a result of the corridor development in Wuyishan, the completion of a
resettlement action plan satisfactory to the Bank Group will be a condition of disbursement for the
development of the blodiversity corridor in Wuyishan.



- 26 -
3.23       The objective for the Poyang Lake Migratory Bird National Nature Reserve is to
strengthen the protection of the wetland area without curtailing the large and varied economic activities
underway in and around the reserve. This will involve three tasks. First, a mobile protection system
to protect birds from hunting and poisoning will be developed. Second, on-going research efforts,
especially in the area of land-use and waterbird ecology, will be supported. Third, facilities for
education, awareness and visitor use will be developed to demonstrate the value of wild bird protection
and promote conservation awareness.
3.24       The following specific activities would be supported:
*     construction of a small amount of infrastructure: two small guardposts (equipped with wells
and small generators), two floating houseboat guardposts, a mobile boat quay, and a
dormitory to house researchers and bird watching volunteers.
*     financing of overseas bird enthusiasts on a volunteer basis to work for 2 to 4 months in the
reserve each winter to provide training in bird identification, construction of hides, and
monitoring to guard and research staff;
*     procurement of equipment: two fast motor patrol boats equipped with radio communication
equipment and searchlights, one transport boat, two houseboats to be used as mobile
protection stations, and equipment needed for routine protection such as radios, field kits,
and tents;
hiring of a small plane two times during project implementation to survey the entire Poyang
Lake area to get a better understanding of these other wintering sites and to extend
protection to key sites each winter; and
*     development of a database to store and analyze the bird count data, ringing data, and other
useful data. Database managers will receive training in data management and computer use
(supported under Component Three) and equipment and software will be supplied when a
manual data management system is functional.
Component Two: Restructuring Timber Harvesting Enterprises
3.25       This component would restructure the management of natural forests adjacent to the Qinling
Reserve Group as a pilot exercise to resolve biodiversity land use conflicts. As reviewed in para. 2.24 -
2.26, two forest farms under the Changqing Forestry Bureau have over-cut natural forest areas adjacent
to the Foping Nature Reserve, which has degraded a small but important corridor for the passage of Giant
Pandas outside of the reserve boundaries. The component would develop a restructuring program for the
two farms based on a significant reduction in harvesting activities and the transfer of workers to more
environmentally sustainable employment. This program -- the first of its kind in China -- is expected to
establish a model for sustainable land-use management and enterprise restructuring that would be
disseminated to other protected areas in China.  The following policy reforms and investment
requirements would be supported.
Subcomponent (a): Development of the Changqing National Nature Reserve
3.26       The natural forest area currently managed by the Changqing Forestry Bureau would be
legally designated as a national level nature reserve, with a core zone of 11,000 ha and an experimental



- 27 -
zone of 19,000 ha. The core zone would comprise the main panda habitat and all harvesting, road
construction, and other human interventions would be prohibited there. The government has already
stopped these activities as of December 1, 1993 in preparation of the project, and has been paying the
salaries of the idled labor force out of other income since then. The project would support the improved
management of the core zone through preparation of a management plan, development of biophysical and
socioeconomic inventories, establishment of guard posts with related equipment, and training of protection
staff. The experimental zone would be managed on a sustainable basis. The two forest farms would still
be permitted to harvest timber in this area, but the following new conditions would apply: (a) the annual
cut would not exceed the mean annual growth of the forest; and (b) new silvicultural management
practices would be introduced to maintain the biodiversity value of the zone, including selective cutting,
natural regeneration, and enrichment planting with appropriate broadleaf species. This new management
system will lead to a 60 percent reduction in the annual harvest amount, to 7,000 cubic meters of sawlogs
under the project. The project would support improved management of the experimental zone through
preparation of a management plan, establishment of a broadleaf species nursery, reforestation of harvested
areas, and training and technical assistance in improved silvicultural management techniques.
3.27       State Council approval of the designation of the Changqingforestry area as a national level
nature reserve will be a condition of disbursement for the job creation program and worker relocation
program in Changqing. In addition, the following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) the
nature reserve management plan, including a time-bound implementation schedule, description of any civil
works required, and environmental assessment carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to
the Bank Group, will be prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for comment by December 31, 1996;
and thereafter implemented taking into account the comments of the Bank Group; and (b) no civil works
construction in the nature reserve will commence until it has been providedfor and agreed in the nature
rleserve management plan.
Subcomponent (b): Enterprise Restructuring and Job Redeployment
3.28       The labor force of 1,713 workers in the two forest farms would be restructured in line with
the reduction in harvesting. The 1,314 workers involved in cutting and related activities (transportation,
storage, road construction, reforestation) would be reduced to 370 under the project; and the 399 workers
involved in management, administration, and services would be reduced to 150. This restructuring would
create 1,193 surplus workers, of which 1,043 would be redeployed to new, environmentally sustainable
employment under the Forestry Bureau and 150 would receive a relocation package and leave the
Changqing area. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the surplus workers would voluntarily
select which restructuring option they prefer; if there is excess demand for the relocation package,
selection would be on the basis of a lottery. Detailed operational guidelines for the job creation program
and the relocation program are included in Annex 4 and summarized below.
3.29       Job Creation Program.  The project would finance the civil works, machinery and
equipment, and technical assistance required to create new employment opportunities for redundant
workers at existing and new enterprises. The Changqing Forestry Bureau has already identified the
preliminary enterprises and investment requirements to support the establishment of the 1,043 new jobs.
These include an expansion of the mushroom production capacity at the Changqing Bio-Product Plant,
a rehabilitation of the herbal tonic beverage line in the Changing Healthy Food Plant, the development
of a building materials factory, and the development of a commercial trading company and tourist
accommodations. Detailed feasibility studies for these and other proposals will be prepared during the
first year of the project and reviewed by a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) convened by MFO. The
TAG will include provincial or national experts in forestry, engineering, environmental protection,



- 28 -
finance, and at least one representative from a non-governmental organization, such as a local wildlife
society or a university.
3.30       The project would only finance investments that meet the following specific technical,
financial, and environmental standards. Any investment receiving GEF funding would generate a
financial rate of return of at least 10 percent, be demonstrated to be technically feasible on the basis of
a feasibility study approved by the Bank Group, and be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts
on the basis of an environmental assessment (EA) carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable
to the Bank Group. The government has reported that none of the proposed investments involve any land
acquisition under the project; as noted in paras. 5.13-5.14, the status of the existing land-use will be
reviewed and confirmed during the EA. In addition, the project would only support firms with a
demonstrated commitment to enterprise reform. To this end, all enterprises receiving GEF funding would
be legal entities, be permitted to borrow funds under their charters, be managed on an independent basis,
and have separate financial statements and accounts subject to auditing by an independent auditor and
following the new accounting standards introduced in 1993.
3.31       All GEF funds provided to enterprises will be in the form of concessional loans in order
to enhance the sustainability of the job creation program and ensure efficient investment selection. Loans
Will be extended for a maturity of not more than twelve years, including not more than four years of
grace, accrue interest at 4 percent per year, and be denominated and payable in local currency, with the
foreign exchange risk borne by the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department.
3.32       The procedures for investment review have been agreed with the government. The sub-loan
package furnished to the Bank Group for approval would include the following documents: the feasibility
study, including the description of the enterprise and a breakdown of the expenditures proposed to be
financed by GEF; the proposed terms and conditions of the sub-loan; and the environmental assessment.
In addition, the standard Bank requirements for on-lending in financial intermediation projects have been
reviewed and agreed with the government. All sub-loans made by the Changqing Forestry Bureau would
require: (a) the enterprise to carry out and operate the sub-project with due diligence and efficiency and
in accordance with sound technical, financial, and managerial standards and to maintain adequate records;
(b) goods and services financed with GEF funds to be procured in accordance with project procurement
guidelines and to be used only for implementation of the agreed sub-projects; (c) the enterprise to take
out and maintain insurance against risks and in amounts consistent with sound business practices,
including hazards incident to the acquisition, transportation and delivery of goods financed with GEF
funding to the place of use; (d) the enterprise to allow the Bank Group to inspect the sub-project and to
provide information to the Bank Group about sub-project implementation; and (e) the suspension or
termination of the sub-loan in the event the enterprise fails to perform its obligations. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the criteria, terms and conditions for subloans, and procedures would be
as set out in paras. 3.30-3.32 above.
3.33       Relocation Program. The project would also finance relocation packages for 150 workers.
These people will either return to their home villages and develop household agricultural or commercial
activities, or move to towns outside of Changqing for employment in other enterprises. The relocation
package is designed to ensure that labor transfer occurs efficiently and equitably, based on the principle
that the redundant workers should not experience any long-term loss in their living standards as a result
of the enterprise restructuring. The package therefore includes measures that both redress the significant
barriers to labor mobility that exist in China and meet the economic development requirements of
redundant workers. Two recent Bank sector reports, Reports No. 10266-CHA and 11785-CHA, provide
extensive background on these labor market and enterprise reform issues.



- 29 -
3.34       The relocation package would include the following specific items: (a) worker and family
relocation costs, including transportation and moving costs, interim accommodation fee, new housing
construction costs, settling-in allowance, and registration fees; (b) worker retraining and placement
costs, including training costs, enterprise registration fees, and labor contract deposit; and (c) livelihood
development, including small-scale investment in agriculture, aquaculture, livestock, and off-farm
income-generating activities such as restaurants and shops.
3.35       The actual relocation package for a redundant worker would be tailored to fit the specific
situation of the worker. Therefore, the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department, under the supervision
of MFO, will conduct a baseline survey of the redundant workers' current living standards and relocation
plans in order to determine the appropriate basis for the amount of funds paid to each worker. The
results of the survey will be used to prepare an overall report that summarizes (a) the principles and
methodology used to calculate all the specific items in the relocation packages; (b) the exact composition
and cost of each relocation package; (c) disbursement arrangements; and (d) monitoring and evaluation
arrangements. A contract would then be signed between each redundant worker and the Changqing
Forestry Bureau specifying the terms and conditions of the relocation package. Preliminary survey work
completed as part of project preparation indicates that the average relocation package would amount to
about $8,000 per worker, which is in line with average unit costs paid for comparable activities in
resettlement programs in China supported under Bank projects.
3.36       To ensure effective implementation of the relocation program, thefollowing assurances were
obtained at negotiations: (a) the relocation package will only finance costs from a list of expenditure items
acceptable to the Bank Group; (b) the baseline survey will be carried out in accordance with terms of
reference and timing acceptable to the Bank Group; and (c) the terms and conditions of the relocation
package for each worker will be specified in a contract in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank
Group. In addition, the completion of an overall relocation report acceptable to the Bank Group will be
a condition of disbursement for the relocation program.
3.37       Sustainability.  The sub-component is designed to develop a model for enterprise
restructuring and includes several features that enhance sustainability and replicability. First, the
government will finance a higher share of this sub-component (40 percent) than the other components (15
percent), broken down as follows. It will finance 20 percent of the relocation program, 35 percent of the
job creation program, and all of the wages of the 1,193 redundant workers up until the restructuring
program is implemented. Second, a new revolving fund would be established from the debt service
repayments that would support comparable enterprise restructuring projects in the future. To this end,
the following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department will
use repayments of sub-loans to finance restructuring activities similar to the Changqing program in other
nature reserves and environmentally sensitive areas in Shaanxi Province; and (b) an implementation plan
for this activity will be furnished to the Bank Group for comment by January 1, 1999. Third, a
comprehensive evaluation and monitoring program for the sub-component has been agreed with
government, in order to support analysis of implementation experience and development of
recommendations for dissemination of sub-component activities to other protected areas in China. To
this end, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that MFO willfurnish an evaluation report, prepared
in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank Group, on the sub-component to the Bank
Group by September 1, 1999.
Component Three: Developing Institutional Capacity
Sub-component (a): Organizational Development



- 30 -
3.38       The project will provide support to DNR to develop a Nature Reserve Training Team
(NRTT) for the design, preparation, and delivery of an in-service training program for nature reserve
personnel, as reviewed below. Six trainers from provincial institutes will be seconded to DNR, plus one
existing training coordinator in DNR, to serve as the staff of the NRT1. They will be assisted by a long-
term resident advisor who will transfer skills in training needs assessment, course development, course
delivery, and evaluation. This on-the-job, in-country training will be supplemented by long-term overseas
training in protected area management, land-use and other planning, ecology, organizational management
(especially personnel relations, planning, and administration), database management and computer skills,
socio-economics and PRA, and public awareness and conservation education. One of the NR1T staff will
receive more training in teaching methods, compared to other technical specialist areas, and assume some
administrative and managerial functions. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the NR1TT will
be established in DNR by October 1, 199S, with functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank
Group, and with competent staff in adequate numbers.
3.39       The project will also support the preparation of an overall conservation plan for the national
nature reserve system. This plan will assess the role of the MFO and other relevant public and non-
governmental organizations in protected area management, review national needs and constraints in the
nature reserve system, and prepare a time-bound action plan to improve conservation (an outline for the
national plan is included in Annex 5). An assurance was obtained at negotiations that an overall
conservation planfor the national nature reserve system, including a time-bound implementation schedule,
will be prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for comment by December 31, 1998; and thereafter
implemented taking into account the comments of the Bank Group.
3.40       The project will also support a comprehensive policy studies program designed to address
the key policy issues that emerge out of the preparation of the various nature reserve management plans.
The main topics are likely to include:
*     a review of incentives and disincentives for sustainable use and management of natural
forests;
*     the level and impact of economic rents in logging and processing activities, and options for
redistributing some of rents to finance the adverse environmental impacts generated by these
activities;
*     opportunities to reduce the impact of selective logging on residual timber stands through
landscape planning;
*     options for strengthening enforcement and penalties for violation of logging regulations;
*     sustainable utilization of wetland vegetation for livestock and other uses;
*     the watershed protection value of biodiversity conservation in Qinling mountains;
*     the economic potential of non-timber forest products, and issues related to the
commercialization of valuable genetic material; and
*     the role of guards in property rights management, and the skills required to move away
from a narrow policing philosophy.

An assurance was obtained at negotiations that all policy studies will be carried out in accordance with
terms of reference and timing acceptable to the Bank Group, and will be furnished to the Bank Groupfor
comment.
3.41       The project will also strengthen institutional capacity for improved reserve planning and
management at the provincial level. Yunnan Province was selected as a pilot province, due to its rich
biodiversity resources and the large area of land under protection (a review of Yunnan's biodiversity is
included in Annex 6). The project would build capacity within the ONR of YPFD to coordinate and
supervise the protection of the thirty provincial-level nature reserves, which contain a high proportion
of the country's biodiversity. Funding would be provided to:
*     construct new office facilities and upgrade office equipment for ONR;
*     prepare management plans for five important Category "A" nature reserves, covering a wide
range of ecosystem diversity;
*     prepare a provincial nature reserve conservation plan, including an outline of the current
situation of conservation in Yunnan, an assessment of tourism potential and impact, and an
action plan for increased protection of biodiversity in the province;
*     conduct programs of education and awareness; and
*     develop a provincial nature reserve geographic information system.
3.42       This capacity building program will require additional human resources in ONR. The
province has therefore agreed to recruit an additional ten technical staff for ONR, including one chief of
the project management office, one deputy chief, and eight people responsible for the provincial nature
reserve management plan, protection activities (two people), community development, data collection and
analysis, public education and research, training, administration. To ensure effective implementation of
the Yunnan capacity building program, the following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) the
provincial nature reserve conservation plan, including a time-bound implementation schedule, will be
prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for comment by December 31, 1999; and thereafter
implemented takng into account the comments of the Bank Group; and (b) ten additional staff members
will be employed in ONR by January 1, 1996.
Sub-component (b): Training and Skills Development
3.43       The objective of this sub-
component is to develop and conduct             Table3.1: Course Output of NRTT

- 32 -
3.44       Approximately 900 person months of in-service training will be delivered to existing nature
reserve staff in the following course modules: guard training; nature reserve management, including
developing awareness and skills in organizational management; researchers course; data management;
socio-economics and public awareness; computer skills; planning course; and ecology. Table 3.1
illustrates the proposed schedule for course delivery by course type. In addition, the project will support
staff development through: six short courses in the Asia Region in various topics in protected areas
management; domestic study tours for sharing and disseminating information relevant to protected area
management; a one month training course in existing global, regional, and country databases; and the
provision of equipment and materials to implement the training program.  To ensure effective
implementation of this sub-component, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that all local and
overseas training and study tours would be carried out in accordance with a training program acceptable
to the Bank Group.
Sub-component (c): Project Management
3.45       The project will support supervision and management requirements to ensure effective
coordination and implementation of project activities. The GET grant will finance a small amount
incremental expenditures related to: (a) office equipment, such as fax machines, photocopying machines,
computers, typewriters; (b) recurrent operating support for the World Bank Loan Project Management
Center in MFO (PMC) and the project management offices in the provincial forestry departments related
to travel and subsistence for field work, communications expenses, and office consumables; and (c) 10
person months of short-term technical assistance in a variety of specialized areas. All other recurrent
operating costs, such as staff salaries and bonuses, will be financed by the government through local
counterpart funding.
Component Four: Developing Information Systems
Subcomponent (a): Data Management
3.46       The project will provide technical assistance, training, and equipment at the national,
provincial, and reserve levels to support the development of an information database for improved
biodiversity management. Data and application needs will be assessed, a consistent database structure
will be designed and introduced, data maintenance standards will be established, and mechanisms for data
sharing and acquisition will be established. Staff from the reserves, provinces, and the DNR will receive
training (under Component Three) in data collection, analysis, and maintenance and work with manual
data management systems prior to the installation of the computer systems. After establishing database
structures and maintenance procedures, computer systems will be installed in each of the reserve sites,
three key provincial nature reserve protection offices, and at the national DNR. Additionally, technical
assistance will be provided to design a biodiversity database structure (including socioeconomic and
organizational modules) and an integrated nature reserve management information system (NRMIS).
Finally, a geographic information systems (GIS) will be developed at Wuyishan, Yunnan ONR, and
DNR.
Subcomponent (b): Inventories and Monitoring Systems
3.47       Reserve managers require a comprehensive monitoring system in order to determine the
impacts of programs and actions on the resources of the reserves. This project promotes the concept of
monitoring as an integral and continuous activity that will be institutionalized in the nature reserve
system. Support is provided for:



- 33 -
*     conducting biophysical and socioeconomic baseline inventories and periodic monitoring in
the project reserve areas;
*     conducting aerial surveys of key areas, notably Poyang Lake, for use in planning and
monitoring; and
*     the acquisition of climatic recording equipment for data collection at the reserves.
3.48       Much of the biodiversity baseline data for the five reserve areas are out of date and not
evenly distributed across the project area. New biological and socioeconomic inventories will be needed
to determine the species contained in the reserves and in surrounding areas and provide baseline data for
future management. The emphasis of the biological inventory will be on the remapping of vegetation;
establishing of long-term monitoring plots in each vegetation type; correlation of bird faunal communities
to vegetation type in different seasons; reserve mammals including their distribution, densities, and
seasonal movements; the reinventory of fish, amphibians and reptiles; the continued collection of insects
and invertebrates; and the routine sampling of moths using standard moth traps.
Component Five: Supporting Nature Reserve Research
Subcomponent (a): Reserve Research Program
3.49       The project will build capacity for scientific research at the five reserve areas. The project
will finance specialized technical and scientific equipment for all five reserve areas; one small field
laboratory at both Shennongjia and Wuyishan (each 60 sm m in size); and four small research offices in
Qinling (each 100 sq m in size).
Subcomponent (b): Small Research Grants Program
3.50       A small research grants program will be established to provide data necessary for reserve
management; give nature reserve technical staff the experience (and the incentives) in running their own
projects; and give local reserve employees training (by doing) in simple data collection and research
methods. Priority would be given to research conducted on ecological and socioeconomic topics leading
to more effective management and protection of the reserves. The grants program will be open to (a)
staff from all nature reserves in China and (b) collaborative teams of nature reserve staff and external
researchers. It will be based on a competitive award process administered by a panel of experts,
including one representative from DNR, one representative from PMC, and three senior level experts
from local universities or institutes, such as the Chinese Academy of Forestry, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and a non-forestry university. Individual grants will not exceed US$5,000. Operating
guidelines for the program are included in Annex 8. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the
small grants research program will be carried out in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank
Group, with research carried out under contracts with competitively selected researchers.

CHAPTER 4: PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
4.1        Total project costs are estimated at $23.6 million, including incremental costs eligible for
GEF financing estimated at $17.9 million, or about 76 percent of total costs. These incremental costs
were calculated by: (a) identifying the "baseline" investment and recurrent expenditures that the
Government would have made in support of global biodiversity in the project area in the absence of a
GEF project ($5.7 million); (b) calculating the cost of implementing the new FRDPP/NRMP approach
to nature reserve management in the selected reserve areas ($23.6 million); and (c) subtracting the
baseline expenditures from the "global" project costs to isolate the GEF incremental costs ($17.9 million).
The baseline situation was developed in conjunction with MFO, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the
State Planning Commission and was derived from sectoral investment priorities set out in the BAP and
detailed budget projections included in the Eighth Five-Year Development Plan for 1991-95.
4.2        The total project costs include a foreign exchange component of $6.8 million or about 29
percent of total costs. Cost estimates are based on quantities derived from technical discussions during
preparation and appraisal missions, and unit prices currently prevailing for similar construction works
and materials in project areas and from actual price quotations provided by local tendering companies for
equipment. Price contingencies of $1.0 million are included. Price contingencies for costs expressed in
yuan are based on annual domestic escalation rates of 9 percent for 1995, 8 percent for 1996, 7.2 percent
for 1997, 6.5 percent for 1998-99, and 6 percent for 2000. Price contingencies for costs expressed in
US dollars are based on annual international escalation rates of 2.0 percent for 1995, 2.5 percent for
1996, 2.7 percent for 1997, 2.5 percent for 1998, 2.6 percent for 1999, and 2.7 percent for 2000.
Physical contingencies of $1.0 million are included, based on an average rate of 5 percent for goods and
services. Taxes and duties are not included in costs. Detailed project cost tables are given in Annex 9.
B. Financing
4.3        The financing plan is summarized in Table 4.1. The proposed GET grant of $17.9 million
would cover 76 percent of total project costs, including 100 percent of foreign exchange costs and 66
percent of local costs. Counterpart funding would finance the balance of project costs, including $2.4
million from the central government, $1.6 million from provincial governments, and $1.7 million from
county governments. All counterpart funding would come from budgetary revenues and would account
for less than one percent of the annual budgetary allocation for wildlife conservation.

C. Procurement
4.4        The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.2 and reviewed below. Civil
works worth $4.4 million would be required in the project, which amount to 19 percent of total project
costs and comprise nature reserve infrastructure ($1.3 million), reforestation and other works in nature
reserves ($0.5 million), and civil works related to the development of enterprises in Changqing ($2.6
million). These works are small and widely scattered, and, consequently, would not be suitable for
competitive contract bidding. All of the works in nature reserves will be carried out on force account
or by casual labor paid on a piece-work basis under the supervision of forestry bureau or nature reserve
staff. The civil works related to enterprise development will largely be carried out by existing staff of
the enterprises or the forestry bureau under force account ($0.5 million of these civil works are expected
to be for enterprises that do not meet the investment criteria reviewed in para. 3.30 and will therefore
be ineligible for GEF funding). The Bank Group reviewed these procedures at appraisal and found them
acceptable.
4.5         Goods worth $5.0 million would be required for the project, which amount to 21 percent
of total project costs and comprise vehicles ($1.3 million), office equipment ($0.6 million), field and
research equipment ($0.6 million), and machinery and equipment for the Changqing enterprises ($2.5
million). ICB procurement procedures would apply to all contracts for items or groups of items
estimated to cost $200,000 or more. This would include a portion of the vehicles (patrol cars, mini-
buses), a portion of office equipment (computers, printers), and some contracts for Changqing enterprises,
for a total of $1.7 million or 34 percent of all goods. A margin of preference equal to 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be
allowed to domestic manufacturers bidding under ICB procedures. National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank Group would apply to all contracts for items or
groups of items estimated to cost less than $200,000 and more than $75,000. This would include a
portion of the vehicles (pick-ups, mobile education units, education vehicle, motorbikes), a portion of
office equipment (photocopiers, typewriters, fax machines), a portion of field equipment (walkie talkies,
radios), and some contracts for Changqing enterprises, for a total amount of $1.4 million. Previous
project experience has shown that these items in small quantities are available locally at prices
significantly below those of the international market. Foreign bidders would therefore not be interested
in bidding for them, although they would be allowed to participate in the bidding process if desired.
Shopping procurement procedures would apply to all contracts for items or groups of items estimated
to cost $75,000 or less and $1.4 million in aggregate, since small quantities of diverse equipment are
required. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of comparisons of price quotations solicited from at
least three qualified suppliers, as described in Bank guidelines. $0.5 million of the machinery and
equipment are expected to be for enterprises in Changqing that do not meet the investment criteria
reviewed in para. 3.30 and will therefore be ineligible for GEF funding.
4.6         Services worth $8.8 million would be required for the project, which amount to 37 percent
of total project costs and comprise research services ($0.6 million), consulting services ($5.2 million),
and training services ($3.0 million). Consultants would be employed in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Local training, overseas training, study tours, and research
services would be procured by procedures acceptable to the Bank Group.
4.7         Other activities amount to $5.4 million, which account for 23 percent of total costs and
comprise recurrent operating expenditures ($4.1 million), the relocation packages in Changqing ($1.2
million), and the community investment grants program ($0.1 million). The GET grant would fund $0.44
million of incremental recurrent operating expenses over six years related to project staff travel and



- 36 -
subsistence for field work, communications expenses, and office consumables; these goods and services
will be procured by procedures acceptable to the Bank Group. The remaining $3.7 million in recurrent
expenses consists primarily of staff salaries and bonuses, which will be financed by the government on
force account. The GET grant would fund $0.96 million of the relocation packages and $0.072 million
of the community investment grants, based on guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group.
4.8        Bank Group Review. All contracts for goods would be grouped into bid packages whenever
possible to attract competition and permit bulk purchasing. Standard bidding documents approved by
Bank Group would be used. All contracts for goods in excess of $200,000 would be subject to prior
review by the Bank Group, which would cover about 50 percent of the total goods by value. All
contracts for consultants' services in excess of $100,000 for engagement of firms and $50,000 for
engagement of individuals would be subject to prior review by the Bank Group, which would cover about
75 percent of the total consultants' services by value. Other contracts for goods and services would be
subject to ex-post review by the Bank Group supervision missions. ICB procurement will be handled by
a central procurement section in the PMC, which will engage the China National Instrument Import and
Export Corporation as its procurement agent.
D. Disbursement
4.9         Funds from the grant would be disbursed on the following basis:
(1)   Civil Works
(a)  for biodiversity corridor in Wuyishan Nature Reserve ($0.350 million): 85%;
(b)   all other civil works ($1.449 million): 85%;
(2)   Goods ($2.442 million): 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost), and 75% of local expenditures for other items procured locally;
(3)   Community Investment Grants ($0.072 million): 60%;
(4)   Sub-Loans for Changqing Enterprises ($3.372 million): 100%;
(5)   Relocation Packages for Changqing Enterprises ($0.960 million): 80%;
(6)   Operating Costs ($0.439 million): 100%; and
(7)   Consultants' Services, Research Services, Training, and Study Tours ($8.818 million)
million): 100%.
4.10       Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs) for expenditures
relating to: (a) contracts for goods not exceeding $200,000 equivalent; (b) works; (c) sub-loans,
community investment grants, relocation packages, and operating costs; (d) research services, training
and study tours; and (e) contracts for individual consultants not exceeding $50,000 equivalent and for
consultants' services with firms not exceeding $100,000 equivalent. The supporting documents for SOEs
would be retained by the provincial project management offices and the central project management office
in MFO could retrieve them as required for supervision missions. In the case of contracts for goods and
services above these thresholds, disbursements would be made against the full documentation with the
contracts themselves and other supporting documents.



- 37 -
4.11       The project will include the following conditions of disbursement: (a) if any resettlement
is expected as a result of the corridor development in Wuyishan, the completion of a resettlement action
plan satisfactory to the Bank Group will be a condition of disbursement for the corridor development
(para. 3.22); (b) State Council designation of the Changqing forestry area as a national-level nature
reserve, and the completion of a relocation report acceptable to the Bank Group will be conditions of
disbursement for the relocation program under the Changqing enterprise restructuring component (paras.
3.27 and 3.36); and (c) State Council designation of the Changqing forestry area as a national-level nature
reserve, and the provision of sub-loans in accordance with the agreed procedures and terms and
conditions will be conditions of disbursement for the job creation program under the Changqing enterprise
restructuring component (paras. 3.27 and 3.30-3.32).
4.12       In order to disburse the grant proceeds efficiently, a special account would be opened by
MOF in US dollars in a bank acceptable to the Bank Group with an initial deposit of $1.25 million,
equivalent to the grant's financing of average expenditures for four months during the first three years
of the project. Applications for replenishment of this account will be submitted monthly, or whenever
the account is drawn down by 50 percent, whichever comes first. Retroactive financing of up to SDR
340,000 ($500,000 equivalent) would be provided against expenditures made between September 1, 1994
and the date of signing of the Grant Agreement for enterprise feasibility studies for the job creation
program in Changqing, the baseline survey for the relocation program in Changqing, training, and
technical assistance.
4.13       The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001 and the closing date would be
June 30, 2002. The estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 9. About 70 percent of all
disbursements will be made during the first three years, reflecting the large amount of technical
assistance, training, and planning required to build capacity and prepare improved management plans
during the early years of the project; relatively small amounts will be disbursed for specific investment
requirements during the final two years. The project disbursement schedule is consistent with the general
disbursement profile for Bank Group agricultural and forestry development projects in China.

CHAPTER 5: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organizational Structure and Responsibilities
5.1        The project would be implemented by MFO, five provincial forestry departments, and nine
nature reserves. Most of the project management structure is already operational, as it draws heavily on
the existing Department of Forest Protection in MFO and the organizational arrangements for the
associated project, the Forest Resource Development and Protection Project (FRDPP). As with most
projects in China, a leading group would be responsible for policy and strategic management issues at
the national level, and project management offices would be responsible for detailed planning,
management, and supervision of project activities. Detailed implementation arrangements at the national,
provincial, and reserve levels are reviewed below.
5.2        The national leading group is chaired by the Minister of Forestry and consists of two vice-
ministers; the director of the PMC, which coordinates all World Bank forestry projects in China; and the
directors of relevant departments and agencies in MFO. This group sets the principles and policies for
the project, approves the overall implementation plan, and coordinates inter-ministerial discussions with
the National Environmental Protection Agency, MOF, and other relevant agencies.
5.3        The actual day-to-day management would be jointly carried out by the PMC and the DNR
in the Department of Forest Protection. The PMC would handle work plans, financing, procurement,
disbursement, accounting, auditing, and administrative activities. The PMC, which manages the on-going
National Afforestation Project and the associated FRDPP, has a staff of 25 in the areas of silviculture,
environmental management, economics, procurement, accounting and finance, and information
management. PMC has demonstrated excellent institutional capacity for project management and is
viewed as one of the strongest implementing agencies in China. The DNR would be responsible for all
technical management, including management plans, monitoring and evaluation, and training and technical
assistance. While DNR has displayed good technical competency in managing its limited portfolio of
activities, it requires further staffing to implement the proposed project. Consequently, four additional
staff were appointed to DNR prior to negotiations in the areas of project management, research, data
management, and management plans, which provides a sufficient management team for implementation.
Detailed terms of reference for PMC and DNR are included in Annex 10 and the organizational structure
is summarized in Figure 5. 1.
5.4        The same division of responsibilities would occur at the provincial forestry department,
where the existing FRDPP project management offices (PMO), which report to the PMC, would work
closely with the ONR, which report to the DNR (see Figure 5.2). The institutional capacity at the
provincial level is good, though some capacity building is required in two areas. First, for Shaanxi
Province, where no FRDPP PMO exists, a small new PMO would be created within the ONR to manage
project activities. Second, as reviewed in para. 3.42, the ONR of the YPFD has insufficient staffing to
implement the pilot program of improved planning and management of provincial biodiversity resources
and will be strengthened under the project.
5.5        During the first two years of the project, the PMOs in each of the five provinces will work
closely with PMC and the nature reserves in managing project activities. It is expected that PMO staff
will divide their time between the provincial office and the nature reserve administrations, which will

Figure 5.1: Organizational Responsibilities of PMC and DNR
facilitate capacity building at the reserve level. Beginning in the third year, project management
responsibilities would be transferred to four of the five nature reserve sites. However, Shaanxi Province
would retain its PMO unit within ONR because of the need to coordinate the five reserves of the Qinling
Nature Reserve Group.

5.6        To clarify implementation arrangements, MFO will prepare Project Implementation Rules
(PIR) delineating the respective roles of the forestry agencies at the national, provincial, and nature
reserve levels in the technical and financial management of the project. The PIR would also specify the
standards and conditions under which the provincial forestry departments and nature reserves agree to
carry out the project. In particular, the PIR would identify the respective roles and responsibilities of
reserves and local communities in implementing the co-management program in the project. MFO would
issue the PIR to the provinces under cover of a document that would also include an acceptance letter to
be signed by each province. The acceptance letter would be specific for each province and would include
the amount of the grant, the project components, and an agreement to abide by the PIR in project
implementation. Detailed project implementation schedules are included in Annex 12.
5.7        To ensure effective implementation arrangements, the following assurance was obtained at
negotiations: the PMC in MFO, the PMOs in the provincial forestry departments, and the PMOs in the
reserves shall be maintained with functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank Group, with
competent staff in adequate numbers, and with appropriate arrangements for coordination with DNR at
the national level and ONRs at the provincial level. In addition, the issuance of PIR acceptable to the
Bank and the provision of written acceptances from all project provinces would be a condition of
effectiveness of the GET grant.
B. Technical Assistance
5.8        The project involves the introduction of many new conservation techniques and processes
that have never been utilized in China before. To ensure effective technology transfer, the project
includes 160 person months of short-term domestic and international experts, and two foreign resident
advisors for 44 person months in the critical areas of community development and training. In addition,
funds are provided to sub-contract policy studies, biophysical inventories, and socio-economic baseline
studies to local research institutes as needed. The TA program is designed to train and build institutional
capacity at the start of the project, with a heavy emphasis on in-service training and domestic experts,
in order to ensure effective and sustainable transfer of technical and managerial expertise. The two
resident advisors will transfer their skills during their assignments to local counterparts who have already
been identified, who will then assume full responsibility for managing community development and
training issues in the project. The implementation schedule for the TA program has been agreed with
the Bank Group and is summarized in Annex 13. The terms of reference for the key technical assistance
assignments are summarized in Annex 14.
C. Involvement of NGOs and Local Communities
5.9        NGOs in China consist mainly of professional, academic, and scientific organizations; unlike
NGOs in other countries, they have close administrative ties to government agencies. The China Wildlife
Conservation Society, with a membership of 30,000, has similar functions as conservation NGOs in other
countries and has branches in each province. Others include the Ecological, Zoological, Botanical,
Geological, Oceanographic, Meteorological, Geographical, Land, Soils Societies of China, the Soil and
Water Conservation Society, and the Ecological Environmental Protection for Agriculture Organization.
These NGOs appear to be involved mostly in academic, scientific, and technological exchanges and
increasing public awareness.
5.10       Several international NGOs have been involved in conservation in China. The World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF) has supported research on the giant panda at Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan,
assisted in the preparation of the Panda Master Plan, and provided technical assistance for the



- 42 -
development of conservation information centers and preparation of reserve management plans. Also of
relevance to this project is the training program supported by WWF. Between 1985 and 1992, WWF
held 14 courses in China, concentrating on training of guards, general and panda ecology, and wetlands
management. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has contributed to research on the panda and
currently is assisting with training and environmental education in Yunnan Province. The International
Crane Foundation (ICF) has assisted Poyang Lake Nature Reserve staff with bird identification and
research. The Ford Foundation supports training in Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) for community
forestry, both to field level foresters in Yunnan Province and to Beijing Forestry University. OXFAM
and CARE have rural poverty alleviation programs in Yunnan and elsewhere in China. The lessons
learned from NGO's implementation experience have been reflected in the design of the project,
particularly with regard to the co-management program.
5.11       NGOs are expected to be a valuable resource for the project. To ensure their effective
integration into project implementation, the project will convene a bi-annual meeting for NGOs and
donors to enhance coordination and cooperation. These meetings would discuss project progress, lessons
learned, and additional investment and technical requirements for supplemental activities.
5.12       During the preparation of the project, extensive consultations using group and household
interviews were conducted with communities in each of the project's five pilot nature reserve areas. The
interviews provided detailed information on needs, natural resources use and conflicts, and agricultural
and economic activities. Socio-economic profiles of the communities were prepared and used to develop
a process for including communities in the planning process and the management of the reserves. As
reviewed in para. 3.9, community involvement will be included in the project at each of the reserve sites
in the following ways during implementation:
*    Socio-economic baseline surveys will be developed for each of the reserves that will
describe their socio-economic and production situations, corroborate secondary township
level data, and monitor project impacts;
-    Reserve staff will conduct PRAs in pilot communities at four of the five nature reserve sites
in order to determine community needs, resource use and conflicts, and prepare community
and institutional profiles. In the other reserve, Wuyishan, a detailed management plan will
be developed jointly with the village of Tong Mu using PRA procedures;
*    Based on the results of the socio-economic surveys and the PRA profiles, staffs of the
reserves will negotiate community resource management plans (CRMPs) with the pilot
communities in order to co-manage the resources of the reserve that they use in common;
and
*    Community investment grants (CIGs) will be disbursed to the communities to finance
agreed-upon economic development activities proposed under the CRMP.
D. Environmental and Social Aspects
5.13       The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact through the improved
management and protection of approximately 625,000 hectares within the five pilot reserve sites, and the
introduction of new land use and conservation measures on an additional 100,000 ha of contiguous
biodiversity landscapes. However, the project may support some activities with potentially adverse minor
impacts, such as small-scale civil works construction in nature reserves and development of new
enterprises as part of the Changqing restructuring program.  Therefore, the project requires the



- 43 -
preparation of individual environmental assessments (EA) carried out in accordance with guidelines
acceptable to the Bank Group for the nine nature reserve management plans and for all Changqing
enterprises.
5.14       Since a few of the project areas contain important historical or religious sites, the EAs for
the nature reserves will pay particular attention to the impact of project activities on cultural property and
the development of sound mitigation measures to ensure adequate protection. Similarly, the project will
closely monitor the needs of ethnic minorities living within or adjacent to project areas (notably in
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province). In particular, the terms-of-reference for EAs, nature reserve
management plans, and tourism development plans will require detailed review of minority issues to
ensure that they are not adversely affected by project activities and that the social and economic benefits
they receive are consistent with their cultural preferences. As reviewed in para. 3.9, minorities will
participate directly in the design and implementation of project activities through stakeholders committees,
Community Resource Management Plans, and Co-Management Contracts. Finally, the EAs for the
Changqing enterprises will include a review of existing land-use in order to confirm that the development
of new enterprises involves no land acquisition; as reviewed in para. 3.22, any involuntary resettlement
of persons arising under the project would be carried out in accordance with procedures and principles
satisfactory to the Bank Group.
E. Financial Management
5.15       MOF will channel the GET grant through the PMC, which will in turn disburse the funds
to the various central agencies, provincial forestry departments, and nature reserves involved in
implementation. The central and provincial governments would be responsible for identifying and raising
local counterpart funds, which will all be provided in the form of grants. Provincial finance departments
would play no role in fund raising, disbursement or accounting. The Bank of China (BOC) and its
branches will serve as the project's channel for disbursing grant and counterpart funds. Each PMO will
open a project account at the local BOC branch, which will maintain sub-accounts for the different
financing sources.
5.16       No fees or charges will be added to the GEF grant as it passed from MOF to MFO to the
provincial forestry departments to the nature reserves, except for the job creation program at Changqing.
As reviewed in para. 3.31, in order to ensure the sustainability and replicability of the Changqing
component, all GEF funds provided to enterprises for job creation will be in the form of concessional
loans, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank Group. Loans will be extended for a maturity of
not more than twelve years, including not more than four years of grace, accrue interest at 4 percent per
year, and be denominated and payable in local currency, with the foreign exchange risk borne by the
Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department. As reviewed in para. 3.37, future debt service payments for
these activities would accrue to the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department, under the supervision of
MFO. These funds would be recycled in the future to comparable job restructuring projects designed to
reduce timber harvesting pressures in critical biodiversity areas.
5.17       The nature reserves, provincial PMOs, and the PMC would each maintain separate accounts
for project funds. The provincial audited accounts would be submitted to PMC within four months of
the end of the financial year. PMC would submit to the Bank Group within six months of the end of the
financial year a consolidated audit report by the State Audit Administration (or another independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank Group) containing a summary of the findings of the provincial audit reports
and a report on the accounts maintained by PMC. The audited accounts would include details of
withdrawals from the Special Account made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure, and the auditor's
opinion about whether these withdrawals were against expenditures eligible for reimbursement by the



- 44 -
Bank Group. The following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) consolidated accounts for all
components would be maintained for annual auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
Group; and (b) the consolidated project accounts together with the auditor's report would be submitted
to the Bank Group within six months of the close of each financial year.
F. Monitorng, Evaluation and RepoNing
5.18       The project will implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program (the overall
program is summarized in Annex 11, and additional details for co-management are found in Annex 2,
community investment grants in Annex 3, and the Changqing restructuring program in Annex 4). Each
nature reserve will monitor impacts of project activities, using the results of inventories, community
consultation, and applied research. The project monitoring process will be written into the individual
management and development plans of each reserve. Baseline biophysical and socio-economic inventories
will be conducted for the monitoring program. Data will be stored in the NRMIS and used by reserve,
provincial, and DNR staff for project tracking and impact assessment.
5.19       Each nature reserve management plan will include a section on monitoring and evaluation
requirements. In addition to the primary gathering of background information at each site during the
planning process, each plan will specify additional surveys or inventories that are needed to complete the
resource inventory to form the baseline data against which future project success and impact can be
measured. Indicator parameters will be identified for regular (at least annual) resampling and will form
the basis for monitoring trends in biotic and socio-economic factors and evaluating the effectiveness of
the management prescriptions being applied or tried in the project. Each management plan will be
required to identify its own specific goals and success indicators which can serve as targets against which
to measure project progress. In addition, each management plan will specify an annual review and
revision meeting and a final evaluation in the last year of implementation. These final evaluation reports
will be brought together to form the overall project evaluation report.
5.20        The data management systems that will be developed in each reserve will channel data on
vegetation cover and changes, species incidence and distribution, human impacts, socio-economic
developments, staff details, and budgetary matters to the national data center. This will further facilitate
close monitoring of the progress and performance of the project. In every case, comparison of vegetation
cover at the beginning and end of the project as revealed by remote sensing images will be made to
evaluate effectiveness of the project in terms of protecting natural vegetation. Trends inside reserves will
be compared against background trends in similar habitats outside the reserves and between different land-
use zones inside reserves.
5.21       The guard-force will be used to collect basic monitoring data. Management and training
will be organized so that the guard-force in its routine patrolling becomes the most regular and reliable
source of information on what is going on in each reserve. Guards will be required to make regular
patrols and fill out patrol report forms that will record data on three main subjects-condition of habitat,
signs and sightings of indicator wildlife, and levels of human activity. Each report form will be coded
for date and sector so that the results can be analyzed over time as well as by locality.
5.22       Periodic overall monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by PMC and DNR with
assistance from international experts. The project has provided 10 person-months for this activity. To
ensure effective monitoring and evaluation, the following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a)
adequate policies and procedures will be maintained to monitor and evaluate project implementation and
achievement of objectives on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory to the Bank



- 45 -
Group; and (b) a monitoring and evaluation plan will be prepared and furnished to the Bank Group for
conmment by April 1, 1996, and implemented thereafter taking into account the Bank Group's comments.
5.23       The PMC, in coordination with DNR, will be responsible for reporting progress according
to the agreed implementation timetables, which are summarized in Annex 12. Semi-annual reports will
be submitted to the Bank showing progress assessment of all activities against agreed annual work
programs and targets and will include a review of procurement activities. These reports will serve as a
basis for Bank supervision missions and for preparation of the next year's work program and budget.
To ensure effective reporting, thefollowing assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) progress reports
will be furnished to the Bank Group for review by July 1 and January I of each year, beginning with
January 1, 1996; and (b) an annual work plan and financing plan for project activities for the next
calendar year will befurnished to the Bank Groupfor review by November I of each year, beginning with
November 1, 1995.
5.24       The project will be supervised by the Bank twice a year. Supervision will be more
technically oriented, with a core team consisting of a task manager, a biodiversity specialist, and a social
scientist. As required, the core team will be supplemented by other specialists, in such areas as
institutional development, parks management, and management information systems. Whenever possible,
local professionals and non-governmental organizations will be recruited as short-term consultants to assist
Bank supervision missions. The first supervision mission is proposed for June 1995 to launch the project
and ensure the timely preparation of the work plan and budget for the following year. A mid-term review
of the project is planned by January 1, 1998. To ensure effective preparation of the mid-term review,
the=following assurances were obtained at negotiations: (a) a mid-term report that summarizes the results
of the monitoring and evaluation program, assesses progress achieved in project implementation, and
makes recommendations to ensure efficient implementation of the remainder of the project and
achievement ofproject objectives will be prepared andfurnished to the Bank Group by December 1, 1997;
and (b) the government will review the mid-term report with the Bank Group by January 1, 1998, and
thereafter take all measures required to ensure efficient completion of the project and achievement of
project objectives, taking into account the conclusions and recommendations of the mid-term report and
the Bank Group's comments on the report.

CHAPTER 6: BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, RISKS
A. Benefits
6.1        The project would generate the following benefits: (a) a wide variety of environmental
benefits, including increased protection of rare biodiversity, improved water catchment protection (all five
reserve areas drain into major river systems), and increased carbon sequestration from afforestation
activities; (b) employment opportunities for low-income households involved in community management
of reserves and the Changqing restructuring program (the incidence of absolute rural poverty is much
greater in project areas than throughout the rest of the provinces as a result of limited access to productive
land and limited off-farm income near nature reserves); and (c) strengthening of human resources and
sector institutions, which would raise the overall productivity of resource use in the sector. Most
importantly, the project would provide new models for improved nature reserve management, human
resource development, and resolution of land-use conflicts that could be disseminated to other parts of
China facing similar threats to biodiversity conservation.
B. Justification for GEF Involvement
6.2        The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria and program priorities agreed at the recent
Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, as follows. The project strengthens
conservation, management, and sustainable use of ecosystems and habitats that have been identified as
national priorities by the government in the BAP and NEAP; increases the involvement of local
communities in the planning and management of nature reserves, addressing in particular the social and
economic requirements of poor households in poverty areas; introduces a new, innovative economic
incentive program to reduce biodiversity land-use conflicts in critical habitats that involves enterprise
restructuring and job redeployment; builds institutional capacity for preparation of conservation plans and
implementation of sustainable land-use programs; develops new research mechanisms and priorities to
encourage scientific excellence and facilitate international exchange; expands the role of local and
international NGOs in sector planning and management; and promotes conservation of endemic species,
such as the Giant Panda and other plants and animals unique to China. GEF involvement in the
development of FRDPP/NRMP has made possible a combined approach to resource use in the four main
forest types in China that integrates national and global benefits into sector planning and management.
Without GEF funding, MFO would continue to maintain a minimum level of reserve protection and
management, with little community involvement, on the basis of ad hoc, unprioritized investment
programs in the forestry sector.
C. Risks
6.3        There are few technical risks, in view of the government's commitment to biodiversity
conservation and excellent track record in managing complicated World Bank investment programs in
forestry. The main risks include: (a) weak institutional capacity in DNR, which has been addressed by
a comprehensive capacity building program comprising appointment of additional staff, new training
programs, and TA; (b) delays in the recruitment of key TA for management planning and community
development, which has been addressed through agreement of a time-bound TA plan and advanced
preparation of terms of reference; (c) inadequate participation of local communities in reserve



- 47 -
management, which will be closely reviewed under the project's monitoring and evaluation program and
supervised by Bank missions; and (d) inadequate provision of local counterpart funding during
implementation, which has been addressed through an understanding that failure to provide local funds
on a timely basis would result in the exclusion of the nature reserve in continued involvement in the
project.



- 48 -

DESCRIPTION OF CO-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN NATURE RESERVES
A. Co-Management Program
A process for co-management of nature reserves will be developed for four nature reserves, which
outlines the sharing of responsibilities for management decision-making, implementation, and evaluation.
The development of this process will be flexible and iterative. It will be developed and monitored in
eight pilot communities and lessons learned will be used to refine the process for wider dissemination
throughout the nature reserve system in China.
A range of options exist for implementing co-management. Under the project, communities and
nature reserve bureau will explore some or all of the following options:
*    identify and assess constraints and opportunities for natural resource use;
*    develop community resource management plans;
*    design and implement environmental education programs;
=    develop land-use plans and regulations;
*    design tourism programs and activities; and
*    monitor and evaluate the impact of community development and conservation programs.
It is unrealistic to expect each of the demonstration communities to undertake all of these options,
in view of the varying levels of interest and expertise and the different development requirements in each
area.  The project approach will be to develop joint natural resource management plans for the
community that are well integrated with the overall biodiversity objectives of the nature reserve in which
they reside. However, opportunities for linking communities with applied research efforts within each
of the five reserves will be pursued under Component Five - Supporting Nature Reserve Research. Other
opportunities such as developing joint tourism plans and ventures will also be explored. Research efforts
that include communities will be promoted under the small research grants program.  Several
communities within Wuyishan Nature Reserve could be linked with research staff in exploring the impacts
of mao bamboo production of overall reserve levels of biodiversity. This type of interactive applied
research effort could also allow communities to become involved in monitoring their own resources.
Figure 1 illustrates the co-management process to be developed and tested in this project. Table
1 provides the preliminary steps anticipated for developing a co-management agreement. A preparatory
phase is required to introduce the concepts of co-management to local government and nature reserve
officials and staff. This is represented in Table 1 by activities 1 through 4. The co-management
development stage commences with activity 5 of the table, with the establishment of stakeholder
management committees.
In four of the reserves, the Leading Group, representing relevant local government institutions and
assisted by Co-Management Facilitators, will establish a Management Forum (MF), representing all
stakeholders from each of the demonstration communities and from the respective nature reserve bureau.
The members of the MF, as stakeholders, will conduct all participatory planning activities and make



-53 -Annex-2
Page 2 of 7
recommendations, in the form of a Community Resource Management Plan (CRMP), for sustainable
natural resource management at the community level. The Leading Groups will provide oversight for
the co-management process and provide guidelines for integrating the results of the co-management work
into the formal management plans for the reserves. Each MF will participate in the community PRA and
the development of a CRMP. This process will be facilitated by relevant rural extension staff who will
receive intensive training under the project. The data collected during the PRA will be used by the
community to develop a draft CRMP. The CRMP will review natural resources conflicts and
recommendations for alleviating these from the community's perspective.
Using the CRMP as a guide, the MF will draft contracts for the use of specific resources within
the reserve under the jurisdiction of the community. Since the legal basis for these contracts requires
further clarification, the project provides technical assistance from local legal experts to review the
relevant laws and regulations and identify the appropriate legal basis for the contracts. Initially, the MF,
and the facilitators, will concentrate on one resource under threat. The most relevant is fuelwood that
the community uses and it is expected that the MF will develop their initial contracts around the use of
fuelwood. Once drafted, the contracts will be reviewed and approved by the Leading Group, thereby
legitimatizing the process. Monitoring of the contracts will be conducted by the MF and the Leading
Group will have responsibility for resolving conflicts over the contracts. The community will receive
Community Investment Grants (CIGs) for support in adapting more sustainable management of natural
resources and in generating income from their use, as reviewed in Annex 3.
B. Co-Management Experience in China
Currently in China, there are several on-going pilot programs involving co-management. Some
reserves have introduced some community involvement in monitoring resource degradation in reserves.
For example, Zhouzhi Nature Reserve in the Qinling Group has established a local committee in the
Banfangzi Township to protect the forest from fire, Poyang Lake has established local committees to
monitor birds, and Xishaungbanna and Taibaishan Reserves have made efforts to address the special
concerns of minority and religious groups in the use of resources. In addition, some reserves have
developed alternative income-generating activities for communities based on non-consumptive, sustainable
use of resources in the reserves.
The Yangtze River Protection Forest Project aims at developing forest management systems as
partnerships with local government, forestry bureaus, and individual households. Under this project,
households are brought into the planning process through the use of adapted participatory data collection
methods, such as social soundness analysis and RRA. The project is attempting to move away from a
forest protection system based on compulsion or coercion (through fines and taxes) to one that provides
farmers with incentives to participate and benefits from joint management. The Yunnan Uplands
Management Project has similarly integrated communities into the management of upland areas. Staff
from the Yunnan Forestry Department, in conjunction with facilitators from the Yunnan Academy of
Social Sciences, have developed agro-forestry projects on the basis of contracts negotiated with the
communities and approved by the relevant levels of local government. This project has carried out
village level surveys, provided training to local communities, developed experimental land use projects,
and regularly monitored project impacts.
The results of these programs will be assessed by NRMP staff during the first year of
implementation. Lessons learned and successful models will be accumulated and examined as the first
step in further developing the proposed co-management approach.

Page 3 of 7
C. Training
Nature reserve bureaus and some local government staff will receive in-service and on-the-job
training in participatory extension and planning methods. First, they will apply these skills in facilitating
the co-management process in two of the reserves, Shennongjia and Qinling, and then in their own
reserves. Staff from Yunnan ONR will also participate in the co-management process in Shennongjia and
Qinling so that they can lead similar efforts in the reserves of their province. Community members will
receive appropriate training in planning, monitoring, and applied research, as relevant. In Shennongjia
and Qinling, training will be supplied initially by TA with experience in PRA and participatory planning.
Eventually, nature reserve staff should be able to transfer their skills to communities during the process
of developing a co-management plan.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
The programs in each of the nature reserves will be monitored to determine the impacts of project
interventions on the socioeconomic conditions of the pilot communities. Baseline information from other
communities, collected with the support of Component Four, will be used as a control and to evaluate
any future expansion of economic development and natural resources co-management planning activities.
Oversight of the co-management process, including assessing the impact of the CIGs, will be the
responsibility of the Leading Group, in coordination with DNR. The MF, with input from communities,
to the extent possible, will monitor the impacts of the co-management process on communities and their
nature resource base for the Leading Group. Lessons learned and impact assessment data will be
maintained in the nature reserve management information systems.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR
COMMUNITY INVESTMENT GRANTS PROGRAM
Purpose. The CIG program will provide small-scale grants to local communities to finance
environmentally sustainable economic activities that contribute to a reduction in land-use pressures and
in consumption of protected resources in nature reserves. The grants will generally support alternative
income-generating activities that reduce the need for communities to harvest protected flora and fauna for
income, particularly in the core zones of reserves. All activities supported by CIGs will be reviewed and
approved as priority requirements during preparation of the co-management program for the nature
reserves: they will be identified during the Rural Participatory Appraisal exercise, included in the list of
permissible community resource use in the Community Resource Management Plans, and approved on
terms and conditions spelled out in the Co-Management Contracts.  Indicative activities include
sustainable harvesting of medicinal herbs, production of fuel-saving stoves, aquaculture, production of
handicrafts, production of domesticated mushrooms and other non-timber forest products, and
development of household timber and fuelwood lots. The program will be implemented in a total of eight
communities that will be selected to participate in the overall co-management program in the four nature
reserves areas of Shennongjia, Qinling, Xishuangbanna, and Poyang Lake.
ApDlication and Review Procedures. Applications for CIGs will be prepared by individuals,
groups of individuals, or local institutions located within the eight pilot communities. The application
will include a detailed description of the proposed activity, implementation arrangements, project costs
and benefits, and environmental impact, particularly how the activity will contribute to a reduction in
resource degradation in the nature reserve. The application will be submitted to the village committee
or township government for review and approval; then submitted to the Nature Reserve Leading Group
for review and approval (the Leading Group is described in Annex 2 and includes representatives from
the nature reserve, local government, technical bureaus, and local communities); and then submitted to
the Office of Nature Reserves (ONR) in the provincial forestry department for final approval. ONR will
ensure that all CIG proposals meet the agreed criteria, particularly that they are environmental sustainable
and directly contribute to a reduction in land-use pressure in the reserve.
Implementation Procedures. After ONR approves a proposal, the nature reserve will sign a
contract with the relevant township government or village committee based on a model contract acceptable
to the Bank Group; they will in turn sign a comparable contract with the individual or group of
individuals who submitted the grant proposal. The contract will specify the amount, terms and conditions
of the grant, particularly the requirement that the funds are used only for the specified purposes. The
individuals or groups of individuals who submit the applications will have full responsibility for
implementation, under the guidance of the village committee or township government.
Financial Management. GEF will finance no more than 60 percent of any one CIG, up to a
maximum amount of $75,000 for the whole program; the remainder will be financed by local counterpart
funding from the government or the beneficiaries themselves.
Monitoring and Evaluation. The nature reserve will regularly supervise the implementation of the
CIGs and will provide semi-annual progress reports to the ONR, with copies to the Ministry of Forestry.
The ONR will be responsible for overall supervision of the CIG program and for verifying the accuracy
of the information included in the progress reports, under the guidance of MFO. MFO will provide an
evaluation report to Bank Group for review by September 1, 1999 that analyzes the implementation

experience of the overall CIG program and provides recommendations to support its dissemination to
other protected areas in China.

CHANGQING ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING COMPONENT
A. TIMBER HARVESTING ENTERPRISE
Worker Selection. The Changqing Forestry Bureau (CFB) will have the responsibility for selecting
the 520 workers who will remain employed at the Maoping and Huayang Forest Farms, as well as the
management staff of CFB, based on skills, work performance, and age of service, and the 1,193 workers
who will be terminated from its employment. However, the 1,193 terminated workers will voluntarily
select if they prefer to be transferred to a new enterprise within Changqing or receive a relocation
package.  If there is excess demand for either option, selection will be on the basis of a lottery
administered by the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department (SPFD).
Harvesting. The two forest farms will continue to voluntarily maintain the complete ban on all
harvesting, road construction, and other human interventions in the area that will be designated as the
core zone of the new Changqing National Nature Reserve until the State Council approves the
establishment of the new nature reserve; thereafter, the ban will be a legal requirement. In addition, the
farms will harvest no more than 7,000 m3 per year in the area designated as the experimental zone, in
order to ensure that the annual harvest does not exceed the mean annual growth of the forest.
B. JOB CREATION PROGRAM
Eligibility Criteria for Enterprise Investments
All enterprises proposed for GEF investment funds under the job creation program in Changqing
will meet the following criteria. Enterprises investments that are financed entirely by local counterpart
funds are not subject to these requirements; however, they must be consistent with the overall project
objectives and follow the standard government investment criteria.
Environmental Impact. All investments will be environmentally sound and sustainable, and
generate no diverse or significant environmental impacts, as demonstrated by a comprehensive
environmental assessment (EA) prepared by an institute certified by NEPA. The Eas will be carried out
in accordance with guidelines acceptable to Bank Group and will include the following components: (a)
a description of the project; (b) a review of the baseline biological and socio-economic conditions; (c) the
positive and negative environmental impacts likely to result from the project; (d) analysis of alternative
design options to minimize adverse impacts; (e) a time-bound action plan to mitigate adverse impacts;
(f) environmental management and training requirements; and (g) an environmental monitoring plan.
Financial Rate of Return. All investments will generate a financial rate of return of at least 10
percent determined in accordance with internationally accepted techniques of project appraisal.
Enterprise Reform. All enterprises will be legal entities, be permitted to borrow funds under their
charter, be managed on an independent basis, and have separate financial statements and accounts subject
to auditing by an independent auditor and following the new accounting standards introduced in 1993.
Feasibility Study. All investments will be technically feasible, as demonstrated by a comprehensive



-62-                                     Annex 4
Page 2 of 4
feasibility study prepared by a provincial level design institute, under the supervision of SPFD. The
feasibility study will pay particular attention to the current status of the enterprise, the choice of
technology, scale of development proposed, market analysis of principal products, availability of inputs
(raw materials, energy, packing materials), past and projected financial performance, working capital
requirements, management and staffing arrangements, commitment to enterprise reform, and the results
of the environmental assessment.
Review of Enterprse Investment Proposals
MFO will have primary responsibility to verify whether (a) the feasibility studies have been
properly carried out and (b) the proposed investments meet the criteria for GEF funding and counterpart
funding. It will convene a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to assist in the review of the technical
aspects of the feasibility studies. The TAG will include provincial or national experts in forestry,
engineering, environmental protection, finance, and at least one representative from a non-governmental
organization, such as a local wildlife society or a university. After MFO review and approval, the
following documents will be provided to Bank Group for review and approval: the feasibility study,
including the description of the enterprise and a breakdown of the expenditures proposed to be financed
by GEF; the proposed terms and conditions of the sub-loan; and the environmental assessment.
Financial Management
GEF will finance no more than 65 percent of the total cost of all enterprise investments, up to a
maximum amount of $3.4 million; the remainder will be financed by local counterpart funding from the
government or the enterprises. In addition, GEF will finance no more than 80 percent of the cost of any
one enterprise investment.
GEF funds for enterprise investment will be in the form of concessional loans. CFB will on-lend
the funds to the enterprises on terms and conditions acceptable to Bank Group. Funds will be on-lent in
local currency at an annual interest rate of 4 percent; there will be no grace period for interest payments.
The total loan repayment period and the grace period on loan repayments during start-up will be
determined on the basis of the estimated cash flow of the enterprise investments; however, the total loan
repayment period will not exceed twelve years (including the grace period) and the total grace period on
loan repayments will not exceed four years. The loans will be denominated and payable in local
currency, with the foreign exchange risk borne by Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department.
The interest and principal repayments on enterprise loans will accrue to SPFD, who will establish
a new revolving fund from these debt service payments to support comparable enterprise restructuring
projects in Shaanxi Province in the future. SPFD will provide a workplan and operational guidelines for
this revolving fund to Bank Group for review by January 1, 1999.
Loan Conditions
The loans will include the following standard Bank requirements for on-lending in financial
intermediation projects. All sub-loans made by CFB will include provisions that require: (a) the
enterprise to carry out and operate the sub-project with due diligence and efficiency and in accordance
with sound technical, financial, and managerial standards and to maintain adequate records; (b) goods and
services financed with GEF funds to be procured in accordance with project procurement guidelines and
to be used only for implementation of the agreed sub-projects; (c) the enterprise to take out and maintain

- 63 -                            Page 3 of 4
insurance against risks and in amounts consistent with sound business practices, including hazards incident
to the acquisition, transportation and delivery of goods financed with GEF funding to the place of use;
(d) the enterprise to allow the Bank Group to inspect the sub-project and to provide information to the
Bank Group about sub-project implementation; and (e) the suspension or termination of the sub-loan in
the event the enterprise fails to perform its obligations.
C. RELOCATION PROGRAM
Eligible Expenditures. The relocation package will pay for specific costs related to the termination
and transfer of redundant workers outside of Changqing. The following items will be eligible for GEF
financing: (a) worker and family relocation costs, including transportation and moving costs, interim
accommodation fee, new housing construction costs, settling-in allowance, and registration fees (such as
family planning card, identification card, temporary residential card, and provincial border card); (b)
worker retraining and placement costs, including training costs, enterprise registration fees, and labor
contract deposit; and (c) livelihood development, including smallscale investment in agriculture,
aquaculture, livestock, and off-farm income-generating activities such as restaurants and shops. The
actual severance package for a redundant worker would be tailored to fit the specific situation and specific
costs of the worker.
Financing Plan. GEF will finance no more than 80 percent of the cost of all relocation packages,
up to a maximum amount of $960,000; the remainder will be financed by local counterpart funding from
the government.
Baseline Survey. SPFD, under the supervision of MFO, will conduct a baseline survey for all the
redundant workers who choose to receive the relocation package. The survey will review their current
living standards (ie, wage and benefits level, years of service, housing quality, etc.) and relocation plans
(ie, returning to home village to farm or joining a new enterprise, needs new housing or not, needs job
training or not, etc.) in order to determine the detailed relocation requirements and the appropriate basis
for the amount of compensation paid to each worker. The baseline survey will be carried out in
accordance with terms-of-reference and timing acceptable to Bank Group.
Relocation Report. SPFD, under the supervision of MFO, will prepare a report based on the
baseline survey that summarizes (a) the principles and methodology used to calculate all the specific items
in the relocation packages; (b) the specific composition and cost of every relocation package; (c) the
timing and basis for disbursement; and (d) monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The final report will
be provided to Bank Group for review and Bank Group 's acceptance of the report will be a condition
of disbursement for the relocation program.
Contract. CFB, under the supervision of SPFD and MFO, will sign a contract in form and
substance acceptable to Bank Group with every worker receiving a relocation package. The contract will
specify the amount, terms and conditions of the relocation package, including the requirements that the
worker will leave the Changqing area upon receipt of the package and will use the funds for only the
specified purposes. Duly executed copies of the contracts will be made available to Bank Group.
Follow-Up Survey. MFO will complete an independent evaluation of the implementation of the
relocation program by September 1, 1999, based on terms-of-reference and consultants acceptable to Bank
Group. In particular, the evaluation will review if the workers used the relocation funds in line with the
agreed uses, if the workers experienced any short-term or medium-term declines in living standards as

a result of the enterprise restructuring, and what, if any, changes would be required in the operational
guidelines for broader dissemination of the program. The results of this report will be included in the
overall evaluation report of the component, which is described below.
D. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
CFB will provide semi-annual reports on the implementation of the component to SPFD, with
copies to the Ministry of Forestry and the World Bank. The progress report will include information on:
(a) preparation and implementation of the nature reserve management plan, (b) implementation of the
protection program for the core zone, (c) level of harvesting in the experimental zone, (d) implementation
of the new silvicultural management program for the experimental zone, (e) preparation and
implementation of the job creation program, and (f) preparation and implementation of the relocation
program. SPFD will be responsible for supervising the implementation of the component and verifying
the accuracy of the information included in the progress reports, under the guidance of MFO. MFO will
provide an evaluation report to Bank Group for review by September 1, 1999 that analyzes the
implementation experience of the overall component and provides recommendations to support its
dissemination to other protected areas in China.

OUTLINE OF CONSERVATION PLAN FOR NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE SYSTEM
Objective: Plan the national system of nature reserves to safeguard the conservation of China's unique
wealth of biodiversity, including geographic design of the provincial system as well as management,
staffing, training, equipment, data management, budgetary needs, identification of priorities and plan of
action. The plan will be designed to disseminate valuable lessons learned during the project into the
wider national context. The development of the plan will involve all ministries and agencies involved
in nature reserve management, including MFO, the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Oceanographic
Agency, the National Environmental Protection Agency, Chinese Academy of Science, etc.
Contents of Plan: The plan will have the following five parts.
Pait One: Description. This section will outline the biological richness of the country, including a map
of the various biogeographic units and different habitat types, pertinent details of numbers of species,
protected and endemic species, threatened species and species of special economic importance, and an
evaluation of this biotic wealth in both the national and global contexts.
Pail Two: Analysis and Conclusions. This section will analyze data on the rates of forest and other
ecosystem loss and resource utilization, other threats, and species demographic issues to assess the level
of threat faced by individual habitat types and particular species. The section will evaluate the current
coverage of nature reserves in respect to representational coverage of all major ecosystem (habitat) types
and the species of particular concern. It will identify particular gaps in that coverage and additional
constraints such as inter-sectoral conflicts, shortages of manpower, funds, equipment or other resources
or weaknesses in policy, regulations, law enforcement, management, organization, etc.
Part Three: Revised National Nature Reserve System Plan. This section should prescribe and clarify
what revisions are proposed to the national nature reserve system in terms of needs of new reserves,
reserve extensions, boundary revisions, reserve linkages and corridors, reserve zonation, policy for
development of buffer zones and identification of priorities in terms of urgency and importance for action.
The section will provide a brief overview of each province, followed by a short review of each reserve
within the province, with principal recommendations for improvement.
Part Four: Plan of Action. This section will lay out an action plan to strengthen the nature reserve
system in each province, including a timetable and costing of actions such as development of management
plans, reserve development, manpower development, training program, education awareness program,
research program, buffer-zone development program, and the related costs. The plan should clarify
where external agencies' support-both national and international-is needed. The plan should clearly
be integrated into the National Biodiversity Action Plan and not be a stand-alone sectoral plan. Particular
linkages with tourism, highways, catchment protection, population demography, and similar related
sectors would be developed.
Part Five: Annexes. This section will contain lists, maps, regulations, a bibliography, and so forth.

REVIEW OF BIODIVERSITY IN YUNNAN PROVINCE
Yunnan Province has a total area of 383,000 sq.km. and stretches from the extreme south of the country
in the tropical zone to areas of permanent glaciers above 6000 meters in the northwest of the province.
This wide range of natural conditions gives the province a great richness of natural habitats and wild
species of flora and fauna. Diversity is enhanced by the wedging effect of the convergence of three major
rivers-Salween (Nujiang), Mekong (Lancang) and Jinshajiang through the province, which has allowed
the free exchange of species into the region from hugely divergent downstream catchments.
In total Yunnan has approximately 60% of all living species in China. It has by far the longest lists of
rare, endangered, precious and protected species of any province.
The flora is estimated to exceed 14,000 species or 50% of the country's total, including 4 first class
protected species and 60 of the second class. Both species richness and endemism value based on the
endangered and protected plants of the country rank first of all provinces. Endemism ratio is also high.
Over 2100 species of ornamental flowering plants and 1000 timber and economically important trees are
found here.
The faunal richness also comes first of all Chinese provinces. The vertebrate fauna is estimated at 1638
species, including 145 reptiles, while insects amount to over 10000 species, both constitute to more than
60% of the country's total.
More than half the country's protected mammals are found here, including 25 species under the first class
list and 29 of the second. The birds, with 11 first class protected species and 96 of the second class make
up just less than half of the protected bird list.
The four first class protected plants in the province are Alsophila spinulosa, Davidia involucrata,
Parashorea chinensis and Taiwania flousiana. All four are of high scientific value due to their
primitiveness. T. flousiana has a narrow distribution in Yunnan, west Hunan and northern Burma while
P. chinensis is a high quality dipterocarp timber tree of the tropics only found here and in western
Guangxi.
The province is rich in endemic and primitive plants. Xishuangbanna alone has 153 species of endemic
plants including Manglietia microgyne, Cyathocalyx yunnanensis, Polyalthia cheliensis, Beilschmeidia
yunnanensis, Cinnamomum austo-yunnanensis, etc. Two species of the primitive Magnolia family,
Magnolia dawsoniana and M. wilsonii are endemic to China. Other endemic plants include the Dove tree
Davidia involucrata, Yunnan Cherry Prunus yunnanensis, and Consolida ajacis etc.
The Malay Bushbeech Gmelinaarborea and Siamese Senna Cassia siamea are two more valuable trees.
Numerous other species including Angelica sinensis, Gastrodia elata, Coptis chinensis are highly priced
for their medicinal values while others such as Xishuangbanna's Fragrant Cananga odorata, Dali's Bailan
Michelia alba and the widespread palm trees are exploited for their fragrant oils or fibers.
Of the 15 protected primate species, Yunnan has 10, all of which are under the first class list. The Black
Snub-nosed Monkey Rhinoptithecus bieti, for example, is confined to the Nujiang Lancang Gorges area
(biounit 39f) of NW Yunnan and the southern tip of Xizang, while almost all the others have an
indo-China distribution. Nonetheless, most of these have narrow distributions in China; the Pig-tail

Macaque Macaca nemestrina, Concolor Gibbon Hylobates concolor, Hoolock Gibbon H. hoolock and
White-handed Gibbon H. lar are restricted to Yunnan while the Slow Loris Nycticebus coucang is also
found in W. Guangxi in low numbers.
Other first class protected mammals that are not found elsewhere in China or also found rarely in SE
Xizang include the Lesser Mouse Deer Tragulus javanicus which is only recorded in Xishuangbanna,
Binturong Arctictis binturong, Malay Sun-bear Helarctos malayanus and Gaur Bos gaurus.
Of the II first class birds, many, though not endemic, have very restricted ranges in the country. These
include the Green Peafowl Pavo muticus and Sarus Crane Grus antigone which are not found elsewhere
in China, Grey Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron bicalcaratum which is only found in S. Yunnan and
Hainan, Indian White-back Vulture Gyps bengalensis in Yunnan and SE Xizang (biounits 39f and 10),
and Sclater's Monal Pheasant Lophophorus sclateri and Black-necked Bartail Pheasant Syrmaticus humiae
in N. Yunnan, S. Xizang and S. Sichuan. The Great Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis, Rufous-necked
Hornbill Aceros nipalensis and Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus, though only belonging
to the second class of the protected list, are in fact very rare and are restricted to the south and SW of
China, from S. Yunnan to SE Xizang. The latter species has also been recorded in Guangxi.
This richness of species is nominally well protected by a provincial system of 30 nature reserves
augmented by another 40 protected areas at county level. These reserves have a total area of 1.21 million
hectares.

REVIEW OF TRAINING NEEDS AND PROGRAMS IN NATURE RESERVE MANAGEMENT
Approximately 15,000 people are employed in all the nature reserves under the Ministry of Forestry, and
another 2,650 are employed in wildlife conservation or nature reserve management offices operated by
other agencies at the national, provincial, prefectural or county levels. The Ministry of Forestry's
preliminary figures show that at the nature reserve level 25% of the staff have completed middle or
technical school, and 6% are university graduates. At the national, provincial, prefectural, and county
levels between 95% and 100% have completed middle or technical school and between 70% and 80%
are university graduates. Most nature reserves are staffed at high levels, but many of the nature reserve
management offices at the national level and provincial level are understaffed.
While training is needed at all levels, the most urgent priority is for protection skills at the nature reserve
level. Guards need to be trained, but previous experience has shown that without changes in the
management and incentive structures, training will be ineffective. Identification and provision of such
incentives concurrently with the proposed training is thus an important part of this project. There is a
lack of knowledge of natural biological systems, principles of reserve management and rural socio-
economics among the reserve managers. Ideally this should be acquired in undergraduate or diploma
courses, but the present courses do not provide material sufficient to train staff in these topics.
There are three Forestry Universities (at Harbin, Beijing and Nanjing), eight Forestry Colleges (in Fujian
[Nanping], Zhejiang [Ningan], Inner Mongolia [Huhehot], Jilin, Shaanxi [Wugong], Hebei [Baoding],
Yunnan [Kunming] and Hunan [Zhongnan Forestry College, Zhuzhou]) and numerous Forest Technical
Schools.
Pre-service training for nature reserve management and research personnel is centered at North-East
Forestry University, in Harbin. Graduates from the four year Wildlife Management course at Harbin
(about 75 per year) are employed in reserves all over China. Nanjing Forestry University has a two year
certificate course (60 graduates per year) in Nature Reserve Management, and South West Forestry
College in Kunming has been including wildlife studies under its forestry degree course for some years,
and is about to begin a four year undergraduate course in Wildlife and Nature Reserve Management in
July 1993. This course will start with an intake of 30 students per year but will increase the intake
rapidly.  South West Forestry College already teaches 60 hours of wildlife and nature reserve
management (2 percent of the total) in the Forestry and Forestry Protection courses.
In recent years a number of short term training courses for reserve staff have been run in these and other
institutions, or in the field. North East Forestry University runs training courses for nature reserve
personnel on a two to three week residential basis during the University vacations in February and
August, and also some courses by correspondence. The University runs three forestry plantations, one
of them protecting some original Korean Pine forest, and uses two of them for teaching and research.
Six journals are published by the University in Chinese and one in English, and there is an extensive
library with many foreign and Chinese journals. One or more international conferences on Forestry or
Wildlife are held each year, and research and teaching exchange contacts are maintained with universities
and institutions from 12 countries. Several staff members have studied for short periods at overseas
universities and there are some collaborative wildlife research projects with U.S. universities and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
South West Forestry College has run annual 4-6 week training courses for reserve guards and managers
since 1988 in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature, and also ran a one year in-service

course for staff of Yunnan nature reserves in 1989, funded by the Yunnan Forest Bureau. They are keen
to run more courses if they can be funded, and are in a good position to do so, having just moved into
new premises (80,000 sq m) in Kunming, where there is ample accommodation and teaching space. They
are planning to expand from the present 840 students to 2000 students by 1997, and will maintain their
present levels of adult education in various subjects.
Among the facilities is a laboratory of remote sensing that does work on contract for government
departments or prefectures. Exchange visits have been arranged with a number of foreign universities,
including Kasetsart University, Bangkok, University of the Philippines, Los Banos and Gent University,
Belgium. The Ford Foundation, Winrock International, FAO and WWF-I have supported training
courses or overseas study for staff members.
Nanjing Forestry University has a two year diploma course in Nature Reserve Management (about 60
entrants a year), and the College of Adult Education has run three short training courses for nature
reserve staff in the college and some more in nearby nature reserves. There is dormitory space for 160
students, a library and a computer center, and about 100 of the 750 teachers in the University have been
involved in either the Diploma or the short training courses on Nature Reserve Management. The
students who major in Forestry also take 50 hours of lectures on Nature Reserve Management over their
four year degree course.
East China Normal University in Shanghai has a small zoology department with an ecology research
group of five lecturers who have established a number of short training courses in collaboration with
outside organizations. The actual degree course in Zoology includes only 10 hours of lectures on wildlife
conservation. There is an annual six week training course on Wildlife Conservation for 20 trainees,
including 10 from overseas. There are normally four to five local teachers and up to six from overseas,
and the course has been funded largely by the Smithsonian Institution. There is a biennial three week
course on Zoo Biology and Management in Shanghai, which is also funded and partly taught by the
Smithsonian Institution.  Apart from  these regular courses, there have been occasional wetland
conservation training courses run in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Asian
Wetland Bureau, and the North American Environmental Education Association has been training teachers
in environmental education, first through four day workshops, and, in 1993 through a two week course.
The Department of Biology at North West University has run three two year Diploma courses in Wildlife
Conservation and Management (1986-88), and at present runs short (one to three months) training courses
for reserve staff from the north western provinces (mainly Shaanxi) once or twice per year, with 30
trainees per course. Some of these courses and the practical exercises they involve are cause for concern
because they encourage large scale collections of specimens, including mammals and birds.
Occasional short training courses are run by Beijing Normal University, North-East Normal University,
Yunnan University and Kumning Institute of Zoology.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR SMALL GRANTS RESEARCH PROGRAM
Background and Objectives
Most nature reserves have scientists on staff who are unable to carry out management-related research
projects due to shortage of funding. As a result, much of the research work done inside nature reserves
is carried out by scientists from research institutes who rarely leave behind the research data or
collaborate with reserve researchers. In addition, many of the research topics have no direct and
immediate relevance to day-to-day reserve management. Therefore, to develop and enhance the research
capabilities of nature reserve staff and to gather necessary information to strengthen on-the-ground
management, a small research grants program will be established under the project.
The program will fund research proposals of up to US$5,000 per year on a competitive basis. The
program will be open to nature reserve staff as well as collaborative research teams comprising reserve
staff and outside researchers. The emphasis will be on applied research to solve practical management
problems. Therefore, preference will be given to the following focal areas: (a) studies on rare and
protected flora and fauna ecology residing in the area; (b) monitoring of key species; (c) ecosystem
management studies; (d) biological resources inventory, development and use; (e) nature reserve
management systems; (f) data management systems; (g) community development and extension of co-
management technologies; and (h) alternative income-generating activities to benefit biodiversity
protection.
Selection Process
Since MFO manages more than two-thirds of the total nature reserves, 70% of the research funds will
be targeted to nature reserves under MFO while the remaining 30% will be targeted to nature reserves
under other jurisdictions, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Environmental Protection
Agency, and the State Oceanographic Administration. Disbursement are expected to amount to 30%
PYI; 25% PY2; and 15% PY3, PY4, and PY5.
Proposals will be solicited by each of the participating ministries using a standard format developed by
DNR. The ministries will screen and submit all the proposals to a central Research Grants Appraisal
Panel, which will be established under the coordination of DNR to evaluate proposals on an annual basis.
The Research Grants Appraisal Panel will report directly to the project Leading Group and will consist
of including one representative from DNR, one representative from PMC, and three senior level experts
from local universities or institutes, such as the Chinese Academy of Forestry, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences. and a non-forestry university. A minimal application fee will be charged to cover processing
expenses. Contracts will be signed with each grant recipient that identifies the terms and conditions of
the grant.
Monitoring, Evaluation, Dissemination
The selected researchers will report directly to the line provincial departments and host nature reserves.
The researchers will be required to submit semi-annual progress reports to allow the relevant ministries
and the DNR to monitor and supervise implementation of the research projects. An evaluation of the
research will be required within six months of completion and will be reviewed by the Appraisal Panel.
DNR will be responsible for dissemination of research results. It is expected that a publication
summarizing research funded by this program will be produced at year six of the project.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROGRAM
The main objective of monitoring and evaluation activities is to provide information to reserve
managers (and MFO planners and coordinators) that will improve management decision-making in the
field. The goal of the project is to develop a project monitoring and evaluation system that becomes part
of operations for each of the reserves, relevant provincial organizations, and the DNR in the MFO. This
will be accomplished in several ways:
*    baseline and end of project biophysical and socio-economic baseline surveys will be
conducted;
*    organizational management interventions will make protection staff more accountable, with
supervisory staff more knowledgeable of field-level conditions and events;
*    guards will be trained to observe and record information during their patrols that is useful
to the management staff of the reserves;
*    reserve staff will use Participatory Rural Appraisal (RRA) for the periodic collection of
information from communities within and contiguous to reserves;
*    project implementation tracking-accomplished by providing regular technical and
administrative supervision during the six years of the project; and
--   a nature reserve management information system (NRMIS) will be set up to store and
integrate information collected by the above methods. This information will be used by
nature reserve managers, provincial planners, and national-level MFO technical staff to
plan, coordinate, and implement nature reserve conservation efforts.
Table 1 indicates possible monitoring variables, sampling time periods, tools, and location for monitoring
to occur over the life of the project.

SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR KEY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Technical assistance under this project will provide both international and domestic specialists for the
following activities:
*     development of nature reserve management plans;
*     development of conservation plans (national and provincial-Yunnan levels);
*     development of sustainable forest management plan in Changqing;
*     organizational/institutional management assessment and planning;
*     in-service course development;
*     participatory planning (including Rapid Rural Appraisal [PRA]) and socio-economic baseline
inventories; and
*     monitoring and evaluation.
The following Terms of Reference (TOR) are intended as guidelines for developing more specific TORs
during project start-up.
Nature Reserve Management Planner(s)
Proposed Activities. Annex 1 includes an outline for the development of a nature reserve management
plan. This is provided as a guide for the development of management plans for Shennongjia, Qinling,
Wuyishan, and the five Yunnan nature reserves. It should also be used to guide the revisions of the
management plans for Poyang Lake and Xishuangbanna nature reserves. Technical assistance will be
provided for the development of the Shennongjia and Qinling management plans. Nature reserve staff
from Xishuangbanna, Wuyishan, Poyang Lake, and the five Yunnan nature reserves will either develop
or revise their own management plans based on the experience learned from the other two reserves.
The foreign and local nature reserve management planners provided as technical assistance will be
responsible for assisting Shennongjia and Qinling nature reserves to develop management plans while
training staff from all five of the reserves management planning. These staff will participate in the
management planning process for a period of up to six months during the first year of project
implementation. The technical assistance level of effort for these planners totals 36 person-months of

Habitat Inventory Planner
Proposed Tasks. The Changqing Forestry Bureau has been in operation since 1968 and presently is
operating a non-sustainable forestry enterprise contiguous to the western boundary of the Foping Nature
Reserve in Shaanxi Province. At least 25 species in the Foping/Changqing area have been listed as
endangered, including the giant panda. A resident panda population exists in both Changqing and
Foping, but faces severe threats from the continued logging occurring in Changqing.
Under the GEF project, the Changqing Forestry Bureau will be used to demonstrate alternative methods
of operation that combine protection and sustainable harvesting. A core area of 11,000 hectares will be
established contiguous to the western boundary of the Foping Nature Reserve to protect habitat for panda
and other species. In addition, an experimental area of approximately 19,000 hectares will be demarcated
in which logging will be allowed according to stricter guidelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure
sustainable harvesting. A management plan for both the core and experimental areas will be developed
during the second year of the project.
The Habitat Inventory Planner is expected to assist in developing a plan for sustainable forestry operations
in the experimental area so that it is compatible with the management plan objectives of the core area.

Socio-economic Baseline Inventories and/or PRA
Proposed Activities. During the preparation of the management plans, baseline socio-economic data will
be collected. These data will also be used as the basis for the monitoring and evaluation efforts of the
project. The project provides support for these inventories by Chinese research institutes. However, it
is not yet known to what extent these organizations will require technical assistance in the design and
conducting of baseline socio-economic inventories. As well, the project supports the use of PRA
consultants, either internationally or locally, for the training of nature reserve staff in PRA methods.
During the preparation, it was assumed that the skills and experience to conduct socio-economic baseline
inventories existed within China. However, the project also provides additional technical assistance for
PRA training and socio-economic inventory development. Detailed TORs for these activities should be
determined after that monitoring and evaluation plan is developed in the first quarter of PYI. At that
time, the approach to collecting these data and conducting the RRA training activities will be more clear
and detailed TORs can be more fully developed.
Community Development Specialist
Proposed Tasks. During the project a process will be developed for nature reserve staff and other
appropriate extension staff to plan with communities the use of natural resources within the experimental
areas of nature reserves. This process will be tested in a number of communities and to train nature
reserve staff in needs assessment, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and conflict resolution. This
consultative and collaborative process will result in community resource management plans that form the
basis for co-management contracts between the communities and respective nature reserves. The DNR
of the Ministry of Forestry will refine and develop a generic process that can be used and adapted by the
extension staff of all nature reserves and respective local government for the sharing of natural resources
management between communities and government agencies.
The Community Development Specialist (CDS) will be an international specialist resident in China for
the first two years of project implementation to assist the DNR in the conceptualization, development,
and institutionalization of a nature reserve co-management process for integrating biodiversity
conservation with appropriate economic development. S/he will assist in the coordination of other key
aspects of the project, especially  those requiring social science input, such as the organizational
management review, design of the Nature Reserve Management Information System (NRMIS),
preparation of training modules and material, development strategic and operational plans, and designing



- 107                                     Annex 14

and conducting socio-economic baseline surveys. In addition, the CDS will assist the PMC by developing
suitable workshop methods for the preparation of annual work plans that allow for the participation of
nature reserve staff and community members and provide input into the development of a project
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan.
The CDS will be based at the Ministry of Forestry (MFO) and will work directly with the DNR. The
CDS is expected to approach the tasks by:
*     facilitating discussion and dialogue on critical biodiversity issues in China;
*     identifying and introducing technical and management approaches that have been attempted
elsewhere in the world;
*     identifying and institutionalizing linkages with the project between Chinese researchers and
nature reserve management and international specialists in biodiversity conservation;
*     insuring the integration of the biophysical and socio-economic aspects of the project towards
meetings its objectives; and
providing on-the-job training so that key technical and management concepts developed
under the project during the first two years are institutionalized.
Specifically, in consultation and collaboration with the DNR, the CDS is expected to:
*     further define, develop, and revise a process and methodology for integrating communities,
local governments, and nature reserve management in co-management of natural resources;
*     coordinate co-management activities at pilot sites in the five project nature reserves. Co-
management activities are specifically detailed in the feasibility report and include
organizing and training leading and stakeholder groups, conducting and analyzing rapid
socio-economic surveys, negotiating resource management plans and agreements, and
establishing community investment grants;

Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specalist
Proposed Tasks. Monitoring of project implementation and evaluation of its biophysical, socio-economic,
and organization impacts is outlined in Annex 11 of the Feasibility Study. Two broad categories of M&E
will be accomplished during the project. Project implementation will be tracked to determine the degree
to which component activities are being completed according to timelines proposed in annual work plans.
In addition, project impacts will be assess to ascertain the impact of component activities on meeting
project objectives.  In general, it is expected that project implementation tracking will be the
responsibility of the PMC and project impact assessment the responsibility of the DNR. However, it is
expected that substantial coordination and collaboration will be required between these two units, as well
as with the staff of the five nature reserves being supported under the project.
During the first two years of the project, the Community Development Specialist (CDS) will assist DNR
and PMC in the development of the M&E plan and review and assess both project implementation
tracking and impact assessment of project interventions, For the subsequent four years of project
implementation, periodic monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by an international specialist every
year. It is expected that the external monitoring will allow review of progress and impact so that DNR
and PMC can adjust implementation if necessary and desirable, as well as analyzing the data so that it
can be used by GEF for comparisons with other biodiversity conservation projects worldwide.
Specifically, the M&E specialist will assist DNR to complete the following, as necessary:
*     assess quantitative and qualitative data collected in terms of its completeness, reliability, and

usefulness in tracking project implementation and impact;
*     assess progress and effectiveness of the Nature Reserve Management Information System
(NRMIS), specifically which data are being input and used, the degree to which databases
are being maintained, skills and training required, and the relevance of data being input to
determining the degree to which the project is meeting its objectives;
*     analyze data and draw  conclusions concerning the biophysical, socio-economic, and
institutional impacts of project interventions;
*     develop recommendations and revise monitoring indicators, area of coverage, or intervals
for data collection, in order to refine the M&E program;
*     determine methods for using monitoring data to redirect project and program activities;
*     prepare reports that can be used to fulfill requirements for monitoring and evaluation
required by GEF and the World Bank, or that can be disseminated to the global biodiversity
community, for comparison of lessons learned and impact assessment.
The M&E specialist should possess the following:
*     graduate-level training in ecology, protected areas management, socio-economics,
community forestry, or another relevant discipline;
*     extensive experience with protected  areas management and/or natural resources
management;
*     comprehensive data acquisition, analysis, and presentation skills;
*     knowledge of database development and maintenance procedures;
*     experience designing and developing monitoring and evaluation plans and programs for
natural resources management or biodiversity conservation projects;
*     ability to work collaboratively with nature reserve management staff and other stakeholders;
*     experience in China with biodiversity conservation issues and projects; and
*     proficiency in Chinese or the desire and ability to develop competent language skills.
