MEMORANDUM AND RECONOENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
OF TRE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TME EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BURKINA PASO
FOR A FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 5.5 million (US$ 7.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance the first
phase of a long-term program aimed at improving household food security
and achieving better nutritional status for children below the age of
three. Government will finance $US 1.5 million equivalent or 11.5% of
project costs. Germany will finance SUS 2.7 million equivalent, and the
World Food Program (WFP) will finance sUS 1.1 million equivalent.
2.          Country/Sector Background.  Burkina Faso is a landlocked
country with a populati(-n of about 9 million. It lies in a transitional
zone between the Sudano-Guinean region and the Sahel. With a per capita
GDP of about USS 320 in 1990, Burkina Faso is among the poorest countries
of the world. Basic social services are relatively undeveloped and social
indicators such as life expectancy at birth (47 years) or primary school
enrollment (31%) remain among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burkina
Faso's economy is dominated by agriculture.   Agricultural production
accounts for about 30% of GDP, generates over 60% of export earnings and
employs 90% of the economically active population.   Agriculture is
predominantly rain-fed. However, water and soil resources are limited and
fragile and rainfall is low and irregular.
3.          Although the performance of Burkina's agricultural sector over
the past decade was impressive for a Sahelian country (6.4% annual growth
between 1980 and 1988), this performance reflects relatively favorable
rainfall patterns and significant expansion of cultivated area.   The
remarkable expansion of cultivated area (overall average annual rate of
almost 5%) was partly rendered possible by the eradication of
onchocerciasis in the more fertile and higher rainfall areas of the South
and South-west, as well as extension onto marginal lands in the North and
East.   In all areas of the country, however, reduction of the fallow
period has been observed.
4.          Even in years of "normal" rainfall and adequate production, a
substantial proportion of the population is chronically food insecure. In
1989, about 4.8 million people were estimated to be vulnerable to food
insecurity, of which 2.5 million are exposed to transitory food
insecurity.   Thirty to 50% of pre-school children suffer from chronic
malnutrition, with peaks between January through May. The "hungry season"
is still a yearly occurrence in many rural areas.  Within households,
children are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity and poor
nutritional status.   Malnutrition rates are the highest for children
between 6 months and 3 years of age, and especially those between 1 and 2
years, during which time the child is being weaned. The low incomes of
the majority of the population is one of the main factors affecting long-
term food security at household level. Equally important, however, is the
stability of that income over time. Where rural hwuseholds have been
successful in reducing their dependence on drought-prone crop and
livestock production, and thereby stabilized their incomes, their access
to food markets has increased.
5.          Since the early 1970s, successive Governments of Burkina have
been most concerned with improving food security. Some important measures
taken in the past to increase household food security and nutritional
status ares (a) national commission for fighting drought effects (CNLES)
which was created in 1983 to monitor and control emergency plans set up to
help drought victims to gain access to food, water, health services and



- 2 -
equipment; (b) several early warning systems which have been put in place
either by the Government or by other agencies; (ci several development
funds which have been established by NGOs; (d: xutrition education
programs implemented by the Ministry of Health fo:  hildren under five
years of age; (e) school lunch program run by the Mi stry of Education.
Although these activities have produced some impressive local results, the
overall impact has been modest.
6.          The  reasons  for  these  results  include:  dispersed  and
unintegrated Early Warning Systems (EWS) based on data of limited
reliability; the limited coverage of nutrition educatior programs (which
are health center based) and of school lunch programs; isolated, and not
well targeted activities supported by development funds; exclusive focus
or. cereals balances at the provincial level as indicators of famine
vulnerability; lack of a national institutional base or focal point for
food security issues.   In addition, past Gove;nment cereals price and
market interventions tended to increase transaction costs and food prices
rather than achieving the stated aim of enhancing the access of the
population to food at reasonable prices while maintaining producer
incentives.
7.          The recently negotiated Agricultural SECAL, by supporting
general reforms aimed at liberalizing cereals prices and marketing, and
trade in cereals will lead to: improved incentives for cereals production;
better functioning of -ereals markets through a greater private sector
role in cereals marketing; increased incomes for the rural populations
and, thereby, contribute to food security. In its Letter of Agricultural
Development Policy, the Government. furthermore, identifies food security
as one of the three objectives to be pursued of the Medium-Term
Agricultural Adjustment Program.   The food security strategy in the
program is intended to reduce the chronic lack of food security in
particular geographic areas and among certain population groups, and
prepare the country better to deal with the consequences of drought (or
transitory food insecurity). To these ends, thw Government is committed
to: creating the conditions that will lead to supply/demand balance where
foodstuff are concerned; reallocating public resources towards programsfor
the improvement of food security; achieving better administration of food
aid through careful coordination; making the food security information
system more effective; and formulating policies that focus on especially
disadvantaged groups and/or zones.  In terms ot specific measures, the
program provides for: enactment of laws/regulations governing the creation
of the National Committee for cereals Policy Coordination (CNCPC or Cemit6
National de Coordination de la Politique C6r6aliere) as a national focal
point for monitoring cereals policy and measures aimed at improving food
security; the Commitee for Food Security Data Coordination; the design and
set-up of an efficient emergency management system; and enactment of
legislation limiting the role of the national cereals marketing board
(OFNACER) to the management of national food security stocks.
8.          Prolect Obiectives.   The proposed project, which will run
concurrently with the Agricultural SECAL, was prepared under the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program as the investment component of a
hybrid operation. During appraisal of the agricultural sector adjustment
credit, the Government and IDA decided to separate the food security and
nutrition component from the agricultural sector adjustment credit in
order to give the Government more time to prepare this operation.   The
project would extend and deepen the impact of reforms supported by SAL I
and the Agricultural SECAL on food security and improved nutrition.  The
project has two objectives:  at the national level,  (a)  reduce the
Government's response time for reacting to national food emergencies, (b)
improve the targeting of food security programs to concentrate on low
income groups in drought-prone provinces, and (c) provide a data base and
logistic  frame  for  rational  decision-making  on  food  security  and
nutritional issues; and at the household level, improve household coping
mechanisms by (a) diversifying income sources of the rural poor for



improved food security and nutrition, and (b) improve the efficient use of
available household food to achieve better nutritional status for children
below the age of three and lactating mothers.
9.          Proiect  Descriptiqn.    The  project  has  five  rrincipal
components:   (i)   Institution Building and Strenat,ieninc  fUSS  1.8
millions: would provide assistance to; the Permanent Secretariat of a
proposed National Coordinating Committee to Coordinate the Cereals Plan
(CNCPC) which will be within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
(MOAL); the Household Food Security Unit (MOAL); BSONG (the Government's
NGO coordinating unit); and SPONG (an NGO umbrella organization) to plan,
implement and monitor food security interventions; (ii) Establishinq an
Inteorated Early Warnina System  (USS 1.4 million):          would provide
assistance for integrating various existing EWSs within MOAL and to
implement the National Survey of Agricultural Statistics (NSAS). Funding
will be provided for workshops, the preparation and implementation of a
plan for system integration, and the printing and distribution of monthly
EWS bulletins.   Support to the NSAS will improve the reliability of
agricultural statistics at the provincial level, and enable the collection
of information on farming activities, including rural household incomes,
needed to assess fanine vulnerability; (iii) Labor Intensive fFood/Cash-
for-Work)  Programs  (USS 4.9 million):   would provide for: technical
assistance and incremental staffing to MOAL's Secretariat of the WFP to
strengthen its monitoring and evaluation of labor intensive food-for-w,-ck
programs. Complementary funding for food/cash-for-wcrk program will be
provided under this component with co-financing from Germany and the World
Food Program;   (iv) Household Food Security Interventions  (USS 3.4
millionl: would finance income generating activities (directed primarily
at women's groups) in the four selected provinces. Within this context,
support will be provided to a pre-qualified group of NGOs who will assist
the beneficiary groups to identify feasible activities, prepare dossiers
for funding requests, and monitor the execution of the activities; (v)
Nutrition Information, Education. and Communications Campaign (USS 1.4
million): will support (a) a Beneficiary Assessment, (b) a rapid
assessment of training needs of NGOs and agricultural extension workers
responsible for women's activities in the provinces, (c) nutrition
education message development, (d) training of agricultural extension
workers and NGO agents in nutrition education, and (e) a multi-media
nutrition education campaign. The project, to be implemented over a six-
year period, would provide financing for civil works, vehicles, equipment
and supplies, consultants' services, training, studies and incremental
operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.8
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.1 million (40%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations  in Burkina  Faso  are given  in Schedules  C and D
respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10615-BUR, dated
April 27, 1992 are also attached.
10.         Project Implementation.   The administrative set-up of the
project has been designed taking into account the decentralized nature cf
Burkina's administration, the need to ensure effective grassroots
participation in project identification, preparation, and implementation
and the nature and tasks of institutions (NGOs, Village Associations,
provincial administration and the central services of the MOAL) involved
in the project. Three institutional levels will be involved in project
implementation: (a) village level, (b) provincial level, and (c) national
level. At the villaae level, a Village Association would be the primary
channel of communication with the project on labor intensive works; while
the Women's Village Group (or Beneficiary Group) would be the primary unit
to which assistance would be provided for household income generating
activities.   Both the Village Associations and the Beneficiary Groups
would be assisted by local NGOs, who would be trained by the project in
subproject identification, preparation, presentation and accounting, as



well as nutrition education.   At the -rovincial lev_l, a full-time
provincial coordinator would be provided in each of the four provinces.
The main role of the provincial coordinators would be coordinating
extension services to Village Associations and Beneficiary Groups, vetting
subproject proposals and managing the provincial project budget.   The
provincial coordinator would also monitor project implementation, act as
liaison between beneficiaries and the national level, and periodically
review procedures to identify bottlenecks in sub-project preparation and
implementation.   At the national level, the MOAL would have overall
responsibility  for  project  implementation.    Rather  than  using  an
especially established implementation unit, the project has been designed
to be implemented through the management structure of the MOAL, although
a full-time Project Coordinator (the head of the Household Food security
Unit), who would report to the Minister, would be appointed. The Project
Coordinator would supervise the work of the provincial coordinators and
coordinate project actions carried out by the MOAL field staff, local NGOs
and Village Associations or Beneficiary Groups.
11.         troiect SustAinabil$tv.  Support to the Permanent Secretariat
of the CNCPC and the Household Food Security Unit would permanently
strengthen the institutional capacity of the MOAL to implement and monitor
food security projects. Establishing an Integrated EWS and upgrading the
anAlytical capabilities of staff of the EWS Unit should similarly be
sustainable in the longer-term.   In the area of assistance to poor
households to enable them to diversify their sources of income, project
design provides for the establishment of Second Generation Special
Accounts (SGSAs) in each of the four provinces. After disbursements from
the proposed project ceases, support to household income generating
activities would continue with funds reconstituted by beneficiaries of
project assistance.   Donors  (such as the European Community)  have
expressed some interest in eventually providing funding for similar
operations, should tVis pilot operation prove successful.
12.         Lessong Learned froM Pevious IDA Sector Involvoeumt.   The
design and implementation arrangements for components aimed at reducing
chronic food insecurity were based on lessons learned from a similar Bank-
supported food security projects Republic of Cameroons Food Security
Project (Report No. 9048-CM). The main lessons are discussed in Annex XII
of the SAR (Report No. 10615-BUR) and are summarized as: (1) the need for
simplification of subproject categories to be financed and the necessity
to start on a pilot basis;  (2) the importance of decentralization of
decision making, procurement and disbursement to reduce the length of time
between reception of stbproject proposal and start of subproject
implementatlon, and (3) the central role that NGOs--provided they are well
organized and maintain good relations with P-overnment, as is the case in
Burkina Faso--could play in poverty alleviation.
13.         However, food security is a cross-sectoral concept. As such,
there are many actions that contribute to food security and improved
nutrition. Among these, macroeconomic reforms to enhance the efficiency
of resource use and improve the prospects of economic growths and sector
specific policies (especially in agriculture, education, and health) to
increase productivity, employment and incomes must be considered as
necessary preconditions.   More sharply defined food security programs
invariably involve specific measures to cope with transitory food
insecurity.   Such programs also require a cross-sectoral approach:
measures to cope with transitory food security touches many different
sectors including meteorology, crop production, animal production, health,
education and demography. The number institutions required could also be
significantly large: a minimum of one well functionxng integrated Early
Warning System unit, a number data gathering and analysis units, a unit(s)
involved with emergency preparedness and the management of food aid.
14.         In this operation, it has been possible to reduce the number
of necessary measures to deal with transitory food insecurity as, within



- 5 -
the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program and with other donor
assistance, adequate provisions are made for Emergency Preparedness.
These include the maintenance and management of a national food security
stock, support to agencies which handle the logistic of emergency food
distribution, and provisions for the management and coordination of food
aid.
15.        BRtiMnae fog IDA &ivol eN_t.   If a serious effort to
alleviate poverty and ameliorate the social impact of adjustment is to be
carried forward in Burkina Faso, efforts to reduce widespread food
insecurity and malnutrition would have to be actively promoted. First,
Bank-supported reforms under the ongoing SAL I and the proposed
Agricultural SSCAL would help enhance food security of some vulnerable
groups, but would not, on their own, be sufficient or have a significant
short-term impact.   Second, major reductions in food insecurity and
malnutrition would promote key sectoral goals supported by the Bank in
health, education, and agriculture. Third, any effort that is likely to
have a significant and long-lasting impact on food security and nutrition
in Burkina would require resources beyond what the Government of Burkina
could mobilize. Fourth, the Bank is uniquely positioned to work with the
full array of ministries (agriculture, finance and planning, and health),
donors, and NGOs that would be involved in implementation. Finally, the
Bank, through its seminal economic and sector work on food security in
Burkina Faso, has acquired the necessary expertise which would be
invaluable fez the design of a project which is likely to succeed. With
SAL I and the proposed Agricultural SECAL, this project would complete the
requirements for the three-prorged strategy recommended in the Bank's
reports building the capacity of local institutions for improved food
security management; economic policy reforms to enhance incomes and
sustain access to food supplies; retargeting public finance and government
expenditures to priority sectors as health, education, and agriculture.
16.         Aoreed Actions. The Government has agreed to the following
actionss (a) as conditions of effectiveness: (i) publication of decrees
establishing the CNCPC, its Permanent Secretariat and the Household Food
Security Unit (HHFSU); (ii) Government's signature of a project management
contract with a non-governmental agency (FASO BAARA) as Executing Agency
for labor intensive food/cash-for-work programs and amendment of the
Agency's current Procedures Manual to reflect the rural focus of the
project; (iii) Government issuance of a Procedures Manual, acceptable to
IDA, setting forth the procedures governing the preselection of NGOs and
their activities under the project; (iv) recruitment of technical
assistants and other higher level staff required for the EWS Unit; (v)
completion of a baseline survey of Passore; (bi as a covenantt a joint
mid-term review would be undertaken no later than September 30, 1995 and
that its operational conclusions would be promptly implemented.
17.          Navi.rornastal Ahsects.  The overall environmental impact of
the project is expected to be neutral to positive. The environmental
classification is C. Components such as the integrated early warning
system and the food security institution building will increase the
information available to the Government on drought-prone provinces, and
could potentially be beneficial to the environment. Public works to be
financed under the project will be small and scattered and their impact on
the environment is expected to be marginal. However, to eliminate risks
to the environment, the environmental evaluation criteria developed under
the Durkina Faso National Environmental Action Plan will be applied in the
evaluation of all activities of the labor intensive program.
18.         ProeraM  Obiective  Categories.        Food  insecurity  and
malnutrition are serious problems in Burkina. To some extent, the causes
of these problems derive from inadequately performing EWS and emergency
preparedness. For the most part, however, poverty and poor child-weaning
practices  are  the  major  causes.    The  project  would  contribute
significantly to poverty alleviation and enhanced food security and



- 6 -
improved nutritional status for the rural poor by: targeting food security
programs to concentrate on low income groups (especially women) in
drought-prone provinces, increasing and diversifying the sources of income
of the rural poor and enabling the Government to design, implement, and
monitor programs to improve the food security and nutritional status of
the most disadvantaged groups.
19.         Project Banefits.   The proposed operation would provide
assistance to poor groups in four of the most vulnerable provinces through
promoting income generattng activities. By increasing and diversifying
the sources of income of poor groups, their dependence on crop production
in drought-prone provinces will be considerably reduced.   Nutrition
education activities supported by the project should also significantly
contribute to behavioral change and adoption of better child-feeding
practices.
20.         Through assistance provided in part by the proposed project,
the Government, for the first time, will establish a national focal point
(the Secretariat of the CNCPC) for food security issues. Moreover, the
Household Food Security Unit, to be supported by the proposed project,
will enable the Government to design, implement, and monitor programs to
improve the food security and nutritional status of the most disadvantaged
groups and, especially,  of children below age 3.   Furthermore,  the
capacity of the Government to deal with emergencies (Emergency
Preparedness) will be significantly strengthened through support to the
establishment of an integrated early warning system. Finally, improved
collaboration between NGOs and the Government in promoting community-based
development will reinforce the peop'le oriented approach of this operation.
21.         Risks.  The main risk is a possible delay in implementation
due to the newness of the Permanent Secretariat as an administrative
structure.  This risk is mitigated by the fact that the proposal to create
the Secretariat was the result of a long preparatory phase and has strong
commitment  by  the  Government.    The  phasing  of  income  generating
activities, building on the established experience of FASO BAARA, and
intensive project supervision and annual program and budget reviews should
also reduce this risk.   Furthermore,  within the current context of
Burkina, there is a lot that the proposed project can build on: as a
result of significant sector work already accomplished on food security
the dimensions and causes of the food insecurity problem are much better
known.   Second, rural communities are much better organized and local
initiatives to deal with environmental degradation are widespread. Third,
NOos are very active in Burkina and have acquired considerable experience
providing assistance to village communities and managing resources which
are channeled through them by the donor community.
22.         RecoM_endation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
