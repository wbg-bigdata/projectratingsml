PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the third education project in
Pakistan for which an IDA Credit of US$15.0 million is proposed. Two other
education projects are being assisted under Credits 50-PAK (1964) and 206-PAK
(1970) amounting to US$8.5 million and US$4.0 million, respectively. The
first project aims at improving post-secondary polytechnic training and
university agricultural education at Lyallpur Agricultural University (LAU).
Project implementation has been seriously delayed, but the project was com-
pleted in June 1976. The quality of education has improved substantially
at LAU during the project period and the manpower requirements of the
Punjab Province are being satisfied. Facilities constructed under the second
project, which relocates and expands the Government Engineering College in
Karachi, were partly occupied in early 1976.
ii.       Agriculture, which accounts for 60% of the labor force, grew in
output by only 1% per annum between 1970-75. Weak agricultural extension
services, among other factors, limited the spread of new agricultural technol-
ogy and better farming practices. The Integrated Rural Development Program
(IRDP), launched in 1972, is attempting to stimulate broad rural development
through organization of cooperatives, better supplies of agricultural inputs,
and provision of technical advice on farming. The expansion and effectiveness
of the IRDP, however, has been limited partly by lack of persons with appro-
priate agricultural skills. An increased supply of qualified agricultural
personnel is an important requirement for expansion of the IRDP and improve-
ments in agricultural productivity.
iii.      Despite recent substantial gains in expanding enrollments, educa-
tion in Pakistan suffers from several basic deficiencies: (a) Educational
opportunities are unequally distributed, particularly for females and in
rural areas; (b) Training of agricultural technicians and professionals is
both quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate; (c) Education is not prac-
tically oriented; (d) Expenditures on education have been exceptionally low;
and (e) Available resources have not been used efficiently, as evidenced by
high dropout rates. During the period, 1976-81, the Government plans to
overcome many of these weaknesses, but staffing and financial constraints may
impede the achievement of these plans.
iv.       The proposed third education project is designed to help overcome
some of these weaknesses. It is comprised of two parts, basic education and
agricultural education, that seek to:
(a) Increase the supply of qualified primary and middle school
teachers, particularly for girls' schools and for rural areas;
and



- ii -
(b) Improve the quality and output of trained personnel for
agricultural and rural development.
V.        Specifically, the project would include the following:
No. of
Grades     Additional Student Places
Basic Education
(a)  Teacher Training Institutes          11 or 13             2,200
(b) Experiment on Adult
Functional Literacy                     -                   -
Agricultural and Rural Education
(a) Agricultural Training Institutes
Pre-Service Training              11-12               680
In-Service Training                  -                180
Farmer Training                      -                180
(b)  Sind Agricultural University             16               120
Preinvestment Studies
vi.       The proposed teacher training institutes (TTIs) would annually pro-
duce 2,200 additional primary and middle school teachers. By 1985 this would
allow an additional enrollment of three million children in primary and middle
schools. The assistance to agricultural training institutes would help to:
(a) improve the curriculum and make it more practically oriented; (b) expand
the annual output of middle-level agricultural and livestock workers from 250
to 640; (c) provide in-service training to about 1,800 extension workers in
both areas annually; and (d) train 7,200 farmer leaders each year. The par-
allel training of both types of workers in a common institution would use
better both staff and physical resources. The proposed investment in Sind
Agricultural University would provide the University with a phased master
plan for institutional development and would strengthen the currently weak
preparation of university graduates to serve the Sind Province and the less
developed regions of Baluchistan and Azad Kashmir. The proposed experiment
on adult functional literacy program, and preinvestment studies on irrigation
and water management, middle-level agricultural manpower, and female teachers
would provide a basis for improving training in those subjects and for further
investments in priority areas.



- iii -
vii.      The total project is estimated at US$27.2 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$11.1 million, or 41% of the total. The
proposed IDA Credit of US$15.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
component and 24% of local costs.
viii.     The proposed project would be administerld by a project unit in
collaboration with various provincial line departm nts.  The Public Works
Departments and private consulting firms would design and supervise civil
works. Consulting architects have been selected, sketch plans substantially
completed, preliminary equipment lists prepared, and most sites acquired.
It is proposed that costs incurred for professional architectural services
between April 1976 and signing of the Agreement be eligible for retroactive
financing up to US$40,000 equivalent.
ix.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of competi-
tive bidding advertised locally in accordance with Government procurement
procedures satisfactory to the Association. Foreign firms would be allowed
to participate. Equipment and furniture contracts exceeding US$50,000 would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accor-
dance with Bank Group Guidelines. Domestic manufacturers participating in ICB
would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% over competing imports. Con-
tracts for equipment and furniture that cannot reasonably be grouped in pack-
ages of at least US$50,000 could be awarded without prior IDA approval on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Association. Books would be procured in accordance with
standard Government procedures acceptable to the Association.
X.        Subject to the conditions outlined in Chapter VII of this report,
the proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$15.0
million to the Government of Pakistan on standard IDA terms.






PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1964, the Bank Group made its first credit for education to Pak-
istan (Credit 50-PAK) to improve and expand technical and agricultural educa-
tion. The US$8.5 million credit financed technical assistance for training
technical teachers, equipment for six polytechnic institutes, and physical
facilities and professional services for Lyallpur Agricultural University.
The project was completed on December 31, 1976, eight years behind schedule
mainly because of exceptional calamities (war, flood, and drought), weak
project management, and more recently, price escalation (more than 20%
annually). The project has substantially increased the proportion of trained
technical staff and been successful in graduating high-level agricultural man-
power required for the Punjab Province. A second credit for US$4.0 million was
made in 1970 to relocate the NED Government Engineering College, Karachi. The
new facilities have been in partial use since early 1976 and are expected to
be completed six months after the Closing Date, December 1976. Full implemen-
tation of the technical assistance program would bring the project to comple-
tion in December 1978. These projects are described in further detail in
Appendix I.
1.02      This report presents the findings of an appraisal mission 1/ that
visited Pakistan during April/May 1975 and a follow-up mission in August/
September 1976, that appraised the third education project proposal consisting
of: (a) pre-service education of primary and middle school teachers; (b)
agricultural and rural education; (c) adult functional literacy experiment;
(d) in-service education of teachers; and (e) educational equipment services.
The project was prepared with UNESCO assistance. In-service education to
teachers and educational equipment services were deleted during appraisal
because of insufficient readiness and availability of assistance from other
sources. Preinvestment studies were added to the proposed project on irriga-
tion and water management, middle-level agricultural manpower, and female
teachers, to provide a basis for future investments.
II. RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Pakistan is divided administratively into four Provinces - the Pun-
jab, Sind, Northwest Frontier, and Baluchistan - plus the State of Azad
1/   Messrs. M.H. You (economist), A. Stam (architect), 0. Bergman (general
educator) and W. van der Wal (agricultural educator, consultant).
Messrs. S. Futagami (mass media specialist) and S. Sigurdsson (architect)
joined the mission during the final ten days.



-2-
Kashmir and several centrally administered tribal areas located in the North-
west. Some 40 million Punjabis constitute the majority in a population of 69
million. About 75% live in rural areas. Communication and education 1/ are
complicated by language differences: Only 9% of the population speak Urdu,
the national language, but Punjabi and Sindhi are spoken by 65% and 11%,
respectively; the remaining 15% of the population communicate in more than
ten other languages. Adult literacy is estimated at 22% (30% for males
and 10% for females), one of the lowest rates in the world (Comparative
Education Indicators). The Federal and Provincial Governments recognize
that the high rate of illiteracy in the rural areas impedes its efforts to
teach modern agricultural techniques.
2.02      Pakistan faces difficult development problems.  GNP growth, adjusted
for population growth (about 3% per annum), averaged only about 0.3% per capita
annually (at 1972 market prices) during 1970-75. Income is unequally distri-
buted among population groups. Only 8% of the total income is shared by the
lowest quintile, compared with 42% for the highest quintile. The agricul-
tural sector continues to dominate the economy, employing nearly 60% of the
labor force and contributing 36% of the 1974 GNP (measured at factor cost).
During 1970-75, agricultural production increased only about 1% per annum.
Sustained improvement of agricultural production will require a more effective
extension service.
2.03      The Bank's Agricultural Sector Survey Mission which visited Pakistan
in March/April 1975, identified weaknesses in the existing extension network.
Coordination was weak among different agricultural services, and agents had
not been adequately trained in the technical aspects and practical problems of
irrigated agriculture and water management systems, although irrigation should
be the core of the agricultural development of the country. Agents were
trained either in crops or animal husbandry and, therefore, were not fully
able to serve farmers who traditionally practice mixed farming.
Rural Development Program and Manpower Requirements
2.04      The purpose of the Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP)
(Appendix II), launched in 1972, is to provide the various services required
to increase agricultural producti-vity and stimulate broad rural development.
The main instrument to achieve these objectives is the markaz 2/, which oper-
ates through interagency coordination and local participation. The markaz
provides facilities, such as the services of government departments, supply
of inputs, credit, machinery workshops, storage, marketing, health, and
education, to between 50 and 100 rural villages. All the provinces have
adapted the objectives and instruments of the IRDP to their specific prior-
ities and needs. The establishment of the markaz has been slow in most areas
1/   Primary level education is generally conducted in the local language;
Urdu is used at the secondary level, and English is generally used at
higher level.
2/   Markaz (plural marakaz) means; center or central place.



- 3 -
kIr the country; only 130 marakaz have been organized up to June 1976 (many are
still understaffed) compared with the Government draft plan to establish 500
and 700 marakaz by 1981 and 1984, respectively. According to the IRDP, each
markaz would need roughly 18 professionals trained in agriculture or related
areas and 225 subprofessionals, (including 50 agricultural field assistants,
10 livestock assistants, and 100 village-level adult literacy instructors) to
implement rural development activities. It is unlikely that such staff re-
quirements could be fully met. Since the mobility of skilled manpower among
provinces is limited, larger provinces develop their own training programs to
meet their specific manpower requirements.
2.05      The assessment of the 1981 manpower requirements for agricultura-
lists based on planned IRDP expansion (500 marakaz by 1981), which considers
the 1976 stock, the 2% attrition per year, and additional supply between
1976-81, shows the following (see Annex 1 for details):
Deficit (-)/Surplus (+) in thousands

/a   Requirements for education, research, and private sector are not
included.
/b   Includes Baluchistan and Azad Kashmir whose source of recruitment of
professionals is Sind Province.
The cost implications of training and posting such a large number of rural
development personnel are significant. An allocation of PRs. 1,540 million
has been proposed by the Planning Commission of Pakistan (Draft Development
Perspective, 1976-81). This planned fund allocation would be adequate to
carry out the program, but it is doubtful that the planned allocation can be
realized because of overall budget constraints. Moreover, the planned expan-
sion of the IRDP may not be feasible because of difficulties in formulating
specific operational programs and achieving interdepartmental coordination.

III. EDUCATION SECTOR-/
Structure and Characteristics
3.01      The general education system consists of the following levels:
primary (grades 1-5), middle (grades 6-8), high (grades 9-10), intermediate
(colleges, grades 11-12) and degree (colleges and universities, grades 13-14
plus) (Chart 1). The Ministry of Education is responsible for all education
and training except for the universities, which are semiautonomous, and cer-
tain vocational and professional programs, which are run by Agriculture and
Health Ministries to train present and future employees. The Provincial Gov-
ernments share administrative responsibilities with the Federal Government.
The Provinces administer schools and supply operating budgets, and the Federal
Government provides development finance, policy formulation, and coordination.
Summary Evaluation
3.02      Pakistan has made great strides in the expansion of enrollments,
but the following problems remain:
(a) Education is less developed for females and in rural areas.
The grade I enrollment ratio averages 99% for males and 47%
for females but is below 10% for females in several areas
in Baluchistan. Disparities are equally great at the secondary
level;
(b) Too little emphasis has been put on quality and relevance of
education. Examinations bar advancement at several stages, and
rote learning predominates;
(c) Vocational subjects are rarely offered in the middle
or high stages, (less than 10% in vocational streams in the high
stage);
(d) There is insufficient capacity for the training of agricultural
subprofessionals in all provinces, and the quality of training
is low. These weaknesses also exist in the training of agricul-
tural professionals in Sind;
(e) Resources are not used efficiently. About 50% of the primary and
25% of the middle-level entrants leave school without completing
the cycle and because maLe and female education are almost com-
pletely separate for social reasons, small schools result; and
1/   See Appendix III for a more detailed description of the education

(f)  Expenditures on education have been exceptionally low.  This
reflects the low priority given to education and the compara-
tively low teacher salaries. Total public expenditure on edu-
cation during FY1971-75 averaged less than 5% of the total
Government expenditure and less than 2% of the GNP.
Levels and Types of Education
3.03      Primary level education in 1975/76 enrolled about 3.7 million boys
and 1.4 million girls, or 68% and 29% of the corresponding age groups. These
low enrollment ratios were caused by low initial attendance among girls and
an overall dropout rate of about 50% during the five years of primary school-
ing.   The low enrollment ratios for girls may partially be attributed to
tradition. There are a number of factors that contribute to the high overall
dropout rate. Physical facilities are poor and inadequately maintained,
instructional material is scarce, the curriculum is academically oriented,
and the opportunity costs of attendance are often high. Although most teach-
ers are formally qualified, their education and training are often inadequate.
In some districts about 50% of the primary level teachers have had less than
10 years of schooling. In 1971-73 the Government instituted a crash program
to train 50,000 new teachers. This was done in anticipation of a rapid expan-
sion of primary school enrollments that never materialized, and most of these
teachers are now without jobs; however, by 1980, all of them are expected to
be employed. I/ Further studies by the Government are needed to clarify the
causes of the low internal efficiency and the high enrollment differentials of
the primary school before fully effective measures can be proposed to improve
the system.
3.04      Secondary level education included about 1.3 million boys and
290,000 girls in 1975-76. Enrollment ratios for the middle and high levels
were, respectively, 32% and 20% for boys and 8% and 4% for girls. Less than
5% of the students specialized in vocationally oriented subjects. Enrollment
in secondary vocational schools, which are separated from general high schools,
is about 10% of the total enrollment at this level. Most of the teaching
staff is formally qualified.
3.05      Teacher training is conducted in one-year courses at three different
levels as follows:

supply of primary and middle school teachers.

Facilities of the teacher training institutes (TTIs) are usually poor.  There
are often no laboratories and workshops, almost no equipment, and furniture
is of the wrong type. Several institutes are in disrepair and need to be
reconstructed. Furthermore courses often do not last more than six months,
and many students register late during the year. The annual output of the
TTIs, 8,000 males and 3,000 females, is insufficient to meet the needs of the
primary and middle schools. Female TTIs are unable to supply enough teachers
to achieve any substantial increase of enrollment ratios for girls 1/.
Teachers for secondary and higher education are in particularly short supply
for agriculture, home economics, industrial arts, and science.
3.06      Higher education facilities in 1972/73 included eight universities,
76 professional colleges and 362 arts and science colleges, of which two-
thirds provide degree-level courses. These institutions enroll 260,000
students; 38,000 of these are in professional colleges. The annual output at
the degree-level is approximately 40,000; 10,000 of these are females. The
Government acknowledges that higher education has received relatively large
budgetary allocations. It plans to contain enrollment increases so that the
limited funds can be allocated to other educational priorities.
3.07      Adult education, including literacy training, is conducted inde-
pendently on a small scale by several Government and voluntary agencies.
Large scale literacy campaigns, undertaken during the last three years,
failed as a result of materials inappropriate in both content and approach,
and poorly prepared teachers. The most successful organization so far, the
Adult Basic Education Society (ABES), has focused on improving materials and
teacher training and succeeded in reducing dropout rates to under 20%. The
ABES approach is now being modified for mass media support in an experiment
to make 24,000 adults literate. The draft Fifth Development Plan calls for
reaching one million population (0.6 million male and 0.4 million female)
from ages 15 to 23. It is estimated that the literacy rate for the population
of 5 years and older will increase from 22% to 28% (41% for male and 15Z for
female) by 1980-81 as a result of the proposed primary and adult education
programs.

Agricultural and Rural Training
3.08      Agricultural field assistants are currently trained in two-year
post matriculation courses (Grades 11-12) offered by five Agricultural Train-
ing Institutes (ATIs) under the Provincial Departments of Agriculture. Their
output capacity of 250 per year is clearly incapable of bridging the gap
between the present corps of 4,200 field assistants and the estimated addi-
tional need of about 19,000 (para. 2.05). The training is inappropriate to
the needs of the country. The rural population practices mixed farming, the
extension agents study either crops or animal husbandry. Moreover, animal
husbandry training has not been formalized and now consists mainly of
"apprenticeships" to animal hospitals. There are too few courses in relevant
fields such as rural sociology and irrigation and water management, and too
little field work. In addition ATIs have insufficient books and equipment.
3.09      Lyallpur Agricultural University (LAU), which was assisted under
the first education project (Credit 50-PAK), currently enrolls 3,000 students
and its capacity is 4,200. The quality of professional training at LAU has
improved, as indicated by increased staff qualifications (30% PhDs). LAU was
orginally intended to serve professional manpower requirements in agriculture
for all of what was then West Pakistan. However, since the reorganization of
the Government into four Provinces, LAU has concentrated on the supply of pro-
fessional agricultural manpower required for the Federal Government and the
Punjab Province. Sind Agricultural University (SAU) produces graduates for
work primarily in Sind, Baluchistan, and Azad Kashmir. It has about 1,420
students (August 1976) 1/, including about 400 graduate students. SAU has
three faculties: Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering, and Animal Husbandry.
SAU intends to open new departments during the plan period (1976-81). However,
before any further expansion takes place SAU will with the assistance of a
group of external consultants, prepare comprehensive plans for institutional
development. SAU has received no external assistance, and the quality of
education is inferior to that of the LAU. Only 6% of its teaching staff have
doctoral degrees, compared with nearly 30% at LAU. The laboratories, work-
shops, and library are poorly equipped, and the curriculum needs to be
focussed on practical work. The research capability in applied sciences
is limited, space facilities are insufficiently used and management needs
strengthening. Instruction in irrigated agriculture, including water manage-
ment, is particularly weak.
3.10      Training of staff to implement IRDP is limited to the Pakistan
Academy for Rural Development in Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province
(NWFP), and a second academy is being built in Quetta, Baluchistan. Although
the Academy was established as a national institution for rural development
personnel, so far it is fully used only by the NWFP. The present programs and
future requirements or rural development training programs are being studied
to support the planned expansion of IRDP.
1/   This enrollement may be reduced by phasing out the first two years
of certificate courses (200 students).

Educational Policy and Strategy
3.11      In its draft Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-1981), the Government
stresses: (a) Free and universal education, initially for the primary level
and subsequently to grade 10; (b) Equal access to education for all; (c)
Design of new curricula to reflect changing socio-economic needs, including a
shift toward agrotechnical education; (d) A massive literacy program; (e) Use
of mass media for education; and (f) At the higher level, improvement of
science and technical education, and strengthening of post-graduate education
and research, especially in science, engineering, agriculture, and the national
language.
3.12      Under this plan, effor-ts will be made to equalize access to educa-
tion for females and in rural areas. New school construction (11,500 schools
for the five-year period) will be planned to minimize walking distances. The
primary curriculum will be revised to include more local content and more
balanced academic and practical training. It will also encourage exploration,
practical work, and creative expression. At the middle and high levels the
teaching of home economics, agriculture, and industrial arts will be expanded.
Although admission to intermediate and degree-level courses in arts will be
held constant, increased enrollments in science will be encouraged. Extensive
use of mass media is proposed for an adult education literacy program for one
million, mainly farm and factory workers, before 1981.
3.13      The following table compares the quantitative goals of the Plan with
actual achievements from 1968 to 1973 and provides an estimate of the number
of teachers required through 198L:

3.14      Plan Evaluation.  The enrollment targets of the Plan at the pri-
mary and secondary levels seem optimistic in light of traditional patterns
and failure of the Plan to develop a strategy to combat the causes of slow
growth (para 3.03). At the degree level, the proposed expansion seems more
realistic, and the greatest relative increases seem appropriately placed on
home economics (700 to 2,700) and agriculture (1,100 to 4,200).
3.15      Staffing.  Any expansion and improvements will depend on the supply
of teachers and their ability to implement planned reforms. Teachers for
female primary and secondary education are expected to be particularly
limited since existing womens' TTIs can supply only 27% of the teachers
needed to meet targets. Qualified staff are particularly lacking for the
introduction of practical courses in home economics and agriculture.
3.16      Finance.  Inadequate provision of funds (para. 3.02) has been a
serious constraint on educational development in the past. The education
development expenditure proposed by the Planning Commission for 1976-81 is
PRs 7 billion, compared with PRs 1.8 billion during 1971-75. Recurrent
expenditures would be PRs 12 billion over the next plan period compared with
PRs 5 billion over the last five years (Annex 5). The Government recognizes
that low budgetary allocation to education has seriously impeded educational
development and intends to authorize the planned fund allocation for the
five-year period 1976-81. Nonetheless, it is not yet clear whether the
Government can implement these plans in view of expected continued pressures
to expand colleges and universities.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project would pursue the following major objectives:
(a)  Improve and  expand primary and middle-level education
by increasing the supply of qualified teachers, particularly
for rural areas and females; and
(b)  Supply trained personnel for agricultural and rural development.

4.03      The Government would establish a monitoring system covering each
project institution to collect information on: (a) the number of applicants,
number accepted, and enrollment at the beginning of each school year; (b) the
number of graduates who have completed the course within the prescribed dura-
tion of the course, compared with the original intake; and (c) the number
of graduates employed within six months, one year, and three years after gra-
duation. The tracer study would also include other data needed to improve
efficiency of training programs. During negotiations the Government agreed
that it would establish such a monitoring system and would annully provide
the Association with summaries of the above information during the project
implementation period and for five years thereafter.

4.04      The project component would help to construct, reconstruct, expand,
improve, and equip the TTIs as follows:

Relatively small institutions (140-350 students) would be financed under the
project because of two factors: (a) separation of sexes; and (b) the need to
keep enrollment areas small since teachers tend not to accept posts in any
rural areas other than where they live. The above number of institutions was
arrived at after careful review at provincial level of the anticipated demand
for teachers and constraints on expansion. The number of female institutions
chosen represents the maximum expansion feasible, given the shortage of
qualified applicants. The number of male institutions indicates modest
expansion for quality improvement of selected TTIs. The project would help
introduce the recently revised primary and middle stage curricula, and promote
basic education for hitherto poorly served groups, particularly females and
children in rural areas. Further expansion of both male and female training
will be needed (Appendix III para. 35 and Annex 3).
4.05      To prepare teachers for introducing the new curricula, the TTIs
would be provided with multipurpose workshops, laboratories, teaching aids,
and adequate furniture. Application schools would be provided by the Govern-
ment for practice teaching and demonstration of teaching methods. Facilities
for training middle-level teachers of agriculture, home economics, and indus-
trial arts are included in the project. The TTIs would operate with rotating
classroom organization and a standard class size of 35 pupils. The project
would finance 2,440 boarding places to serve students for whom commuting
distances are excessive.
4.06      The proposed investment would create a 10% expansion in male teacher
training capacity (from 7,800 to 8,600), and a 50% expansion in female teacher
training capacity (from 3,000 to 4,500 places). Although the country currently
has a surplus of male TTI graduates (para. 3.03), the modest increase called
for appears reasonable in light of projected increases in school enrollments.
The increase in the capacity of female TTIs in some locations initially will
1/   Proposed outlays exclude contingency allowances.



- 12 -
outpace available high school graduate candidates. While the number of
graduates increase unused TTI classrooms would be used for female high
school classes (see Annex 3 for projected demand for and supply of teachers).
During negotiations the Government agreed that, within 18 months after the
Credit agreement is signed, a study of the projected supply and demand for
female primary teachers by province for the period 1977-87 and specific plans
for overcoming any imbalances would be submitted to the Association.
4.07      Teacher training programs in Pakistan would be lengthened to a
minimum of nine months (para. 3.05). In addition, at least one project
institution would experiment with an alternative curriculum in which the
students would be given outside teaching and study assignments to supplement
the nine months of training. This new dimension could be added without alter-
ing capacities or costs. During negotiations the Government agreed that,
within one year after the Credit Agreement is signed, nine months of effective
work in an approved institution would be made a requirement for all teacher
certificates and that experiments with alternate curricula would be carried
out.
Experiment on Adult Functional Literacy Program (Proposed Outlay: US$0.3 million)
4.08      The proposed Credit would help to:  (a) purchase 240 TV receivers
and other audio-visual aids; (b) update and revise about 100 educational TV
programs; (c) finance reading materials and in-service training for the
teachers involved; and (d) finance evaluation of the experiment. The proposed
program would constitute a second phase of an experimental adult literacy
program currently being conducted with UNICEF assistance. It would refine
techniques used in the first phase and extend coverage of the target group
from 24,000 to 96,000 villagers (about equally divided between males and
females). Adults would be taught reading, writing, and simple arithmetic from
teaching materials on nutrition, hygiene, child care, and basic agricultural
skills. There would be two six-month cycles of instruction. TV lessons,
classroom monitors (selected from school teachers and IRDP staff), and readers
would be the principal means of teaching. About 1,600 monitors have been
trained. Another 200 community viewing centers would be added, and partici-
pants would receive one 35-minute TV lesson each weekday (156 programs al-
together). Experience gained from the first and second phase experiments,
and the results of a comprehensive mass media feasibility study, financed by
bilateral aid, would provide a basis for the development of a comprehensive
nationwide education program.
Agricultural and Rural Education
Agricultural Training Institutes (Proposed Outlay: US$3.6 million)
4.09      The five existing Agricultural Training Institutes (ATIs) would be
improved by the project. Four would be expanded and one would be reconstructed
at a new location. The goal is to increase the number of graduates and improve
their training. All five ATIs would offer both pre-service, in-service, and
farmer leader training. The pre-service training capacity would be expanded
from 600 places to 1,280 (about 640 output per annum) and provide 180 places



- 13 -
each for in-service training and training farmer leaders. The number and
size of ATIs were selected to ensure: (a) a balance between projected supply
and effective demand for agricultural and livestock field assistants; and
(b) an appropriate geographical distribution of the supply. The quality of
the pre-service and in-service training would be improved by: (a) integrating
part of the present separate crop and animal husbandry course (para. 3.08);
(b) making the training more relevant by introducing new courses, such as
rural sociology and irrigation and requiring that at least 50% of the two-
year course be spent in farming practice and field demonstration; (c) provid-
ing for more frequent farm visits and participation by the students in markaz
activities; (d) improving physical facilites and equipment; and (e) estab-
lishing, at each ATI, farmer leader training programs from which the ATI
courses would profit.
4.10      Students would be recruited from among high school leavers; pre-
ference would be given to those with science and rural backgrounds. To
operate the five ATIs, a total of 110 staff would be required by 1981, 80
more than at present. The major sources of teacher recruitment would be LAU
and SAU. No recruitment difficulties are anticipated. During negotiations
the Government agreed that: (a) within six months after the signing of the
Credit Agreement, an Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of rele-
vant government agencies and the research station, selected model farmers, and
a selected agricultural university official, would be established at each ATI
to advise on academic improvements, the relevance of the courses to agricul-
tural needs, and other matters related to institutional development; and
(b) within 18 months after the signing of the Credit Agreement, the Govern-
ment would submit a study of the projected demand and supply of middle level
manpower to 1987 in livestock and agriculture by province and proposals for
overcoming any imbalances.
Sind Agricultural University (Proposed Outlay: US$3.6 million)
4.11      IDA financing would be provided to SAU to help remodel, expand,
and equip the existing academic facilities and construct and furnish facil-
ities for housing and boarding 80 students. The primary objectives of this
component are to: (a) improve the quality of on-going teaching and research
activities of three existing Faculties (Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering,
and Animal Husbandry/Veterinary Medicine); and (b) establish a new Department
of Agricultural Education, Extension, and Short Courses, which would offer
a program of teacher training in agricultural education and extension. The
University's teaching and research capability would be strengthened by: (a)
upgrading the qualification of staff 1/ through fellowship programs (para.
4.14); (b) designing more relevant curricula through specialists' services
(para 4.14); and (c) remodeling the physical facilities, and procuring library
books. SAU management would also be strengthened with specialists'
assistance for formulating a long-term development plan and establishing
student records and placement services. The proposed new Department would
1/   Of the total University staff of 148 only nine have doctoral degrees,
126 MSc degrees, the remaining 13 BSc degrees (para 3.09).



- 14 -
accept 40 to 60 students for a one-year post-graduate program, after a four-
year BSc agricultural course; about 40 students would take in-service train-
ing courses, and about 40 trainees would take short courses in specific agri-
culture subjects. It would al,o need seven additional staff, probably grad-
uates of Lyallpur Agricultural University, with further training abroad under
the proposed fellowship plan. Maintenance repair facilities for equipment
would be included in the proposed component.
4.12      Some 1,200 university students 1/ would come from Sind Province and
about 50 students from Baluchistan Province and Azad Kashmir under a quota
system.- Graduates of the three Faculties are expected to be employed in Sind
and Baluchistan Provinces and Azad Kashmir (para. 3.09) by the IRDP organiza-
tions, agroeconomic research institutions, and private organizations. The 40
to 60 yearly graduates from the proposed new agricultural teacher training pro-
gram are expected to be engaged in teaching agricultural and related subjects
at secondary and intermediate levels and at ATIs. A 500 enrollment boys'
school located at the University campus would be utilized by students of the
Department for teaching practice. During negotiations the Government agreed
that: (a) A ten-year educational development plan (1977-87) would be prepared
within 18 months after the signing of the Credit Agreement, that would project
by department enrollments in reLation to manpower requirements, staff
requirements, teaching programs, and research and extension activities; and
(b) the University would not expand enrollments further until the comprehensive
development plan for SAU had been completed and discussed with the Association.
Disbursements of funds, other than for professional services, for the Univer-
sity would be contingent on an agreement, satisfactory to the Association,
with an institution, acceptable to the Association, for provision of special-
ists' services provided under the the proposed component.
Preinvestment Studies (Proposed Outlay: US$0.5 million)
4.13      Study on Irrigation and Water Management Training.  The Agricultural
Sector Survey Mission, which visited Pakistan in March/April, 1975, stressed
the need for a comprehensive study of training requirements in irrigation and
water management. The purpose of the proposed study (see Annex 6 for draft
terms of reference) is to: (a) assess the status of the existing curricula
related to all aspects of water resources and management; (b) assess the
long-term requirements for personnel at all levels trained in water resources,
management, and irrigated agriculture husbandry as well as rain-fed agricul-
ture husbandry; and (c) recommend feasible investment and development programs.
Manpower studies would also be conducted under the project on the projected
supply and demand for female primary teachers (para 4.06) and middle-level
agriculture and livestock assistants (para 4.10). These studies would be
designed and undertaken by local experts to the extent possible to stimulate
local interest and participation,
Technical Assistance
4.14      The proposed project includes financing for 28 man-years of spe-
cialists' services and 60 man-years of fellowships for the project schools
and the proposed study (see Annex 7 for details) as follows:
1/   See footnote to para 3.09.



- 15 -
(a) Teacher training institutes - three man-years of
specialists' services on equipment and training methods;
(b) Agricultural training institutes - four man-years
of expert services on organization and course
development and three man-years of fellowships
for administrators or heads of instructional staff
to study similar operations abroad;
(c) Sind Agricultural University - 13 man-years of
expert services for curriculum development and
University management and 57 man-years of fellow-
ships for advanced studies abroad; and
(d) Preinvestment studies - five man-years of expert services
for designing and conducting the irrigation and water man-
agement study and three man-years of expert services to
conduct manpower studies on supply and demand of female
teachers and middle-level agriculture and livestock field
assistants.
During negotiations the Government agreed that selection criteria and pro-
cedures for awards of fellowships, general programs of study abroad, terms
of reference and appointment of specialists, and terms of reference for the
proposed studies would be acceptable to the Association.

- 17 -
5.02      Base cost estimates refer to December 1976 prices.  Construction
costs have been estimated on the basis of functional and economical sketch
plans prepared for the project institutions and unit building costs derived
from resent construction in Pakistan. Base-unit building costs range from
US$87/m  for residential facilities to US$98/m  for academic and communal
facilities. Additional allowances have been made for regional price dis-
parities and earthquake resistance.
5.03      Preliminary equipment lists have been prepared for all project
components; they have been reviewed and revised by the Association and are
reasonable in scale and cost. Technical assistance costs are estimated at
US$55,000 per man-year for expert services and about US$9,000 for fellowships.
Professional services are estimated at 7% of construction cost.
5.04      Costs of academic and communal facilities per student place
amount to US$857 for the TTIs and US$1,558 for the ATIs. These costs are
reasonable for the accommodations to be provided. A detailed breakdown of
unit costs is shown in Annex 11.
5.05      Estimated project costs include the following contingency
allowances: (a) physical contingencies, estimated at 10% of base cost
for unforeseen factors; and (b) price contingencies, calculated on the
base cost plus physical contingencies on the assumption that construction
would take about 3-1/2 years, start in mid-1977, and would increase in
cost annually through 1979 by 12% for construction and 8% for equipment and
technical assistance. Corresponding annual increases after 1979 would be
10% and 7% respectively.
5.06      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$11.1 million,
or 41% of the total project cost. This overall foreign exchange cost was
derived from the following estimates: 30% for civil works and furniture;
85% for equipment and technical assistance; and 10% for professional serv-
ices.
5.07      The total customs duties and taxes on civil works and locally
produced furniture and equipment would amount to US$2.1 million or 11%
of the estimated cost of these items, including contingencies. No import
duties are levied on imported educational equipment. Pakistan does not
participate in any regional arrangement that allows reduced import duties
for specified import supplies.
Project Financing
5.08      The total project cost of US$27.2 million would be financed as
follows: (a) the proposed IDA Credit of US$15.0 million (60% of the total
project cost net of taxes) would meet 100% of the foreign exchange cost and
24% of local costs; and (b) the Government would finance the remaining costs
of US$12.2 million. The detailed financial plan is as follows:

Local cost financing would cover US$2.0 million for civil works and related
professional services, US$0.6 million for locally procured furniture and equip-
ment, US$0.3 million for technical assistance and US$0.9 million for contin-
gency allowances or locally procured items.
Implement ation
5.09      Administration.  The project would be implemented by existing line
agencies in the provinces, suppLemented as necessary by additional staff.
Posts for these additional staff have been established in all the provinces.
This arrangement is appropriate in view of the large number of provincial
departments involved in the project and the relatively small size of works
pertaining to each provincial department. In Baluchistan, NWFP and the Punjab,
the teacher training component would be implemented by the respective Depart-
ments of Education, and the agricultural training component by the respective
Departments of Agriculture. The project unit in charge of the engineering
education project in Karachi (Credit 206-PAK) would be responsible for imple-
menting both the teacher and agricultural training components in the province
of Sind. The management of the Sind Agricultural University (SAU) would be
responsible for implementing the SAU project component. These provincial
agencies would be responsible fcr provision of architectural services, selec-
tion of fellowship candidates, and local procurement of civil works, furniture,
and equipment. A project unit, already established and staffed in the Federal
Ministry of Education, would be responsible for coordinating the provincial
government agencies involved. The functions of the project unit include:



- 19 -
(a) coordination of the work of the provincial agencies and provision of
guidance in problem areas; (b) international procurement in collaboration
with the Department of Investment Promotion and Supplies and the provincial
Directorates of Industries; (c) recruitment of specialist services and admin-
istration of technical assistance; (d) supervision of the project studies; and
(e) reports to the Association. During negotiations the Government agreed
that: (a) the project unit would be maintained throughout the project period;
(b) qualified staff acceptable to the Association would be retained on a
full-time basis in the positions of Director, educator, procurement officer,
architect, and accountant in the project unit; and (c) qualified officers in
sufficient number would be made responsible for project implementation in the
various provincial line agencies.
5.10      To prevent delays in project execution caused by rupee shortages,
as experienced in the first education project, the Government agreed during
negotiations that a special revolving fund and the initial deposits in such
funds would be established as a condition for the effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement for each provincial implementing agency. The establishment of
special revolving funds and the initial deposit in such funds would be a
condition for the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement. The funds would be
administered by each project implementing agency and would be replenished
quarterly to maintain minimum balances of PRs 100,000 plus expected local
expenditures in the following three months.
5.11      Under the proposed project, about 95% of the cost of equipment and
vehicles required for the project administration and execution would be
financed from the proposed Credit to ensure efficient functioning of the
various Government agencies implementing the project. Funds for this pur-
pose would be limited to US$200,000.
5.12      Professional Services.  The respective provincial Public Works
Department have already prepared acceptable sketch plans for all project
institutes in the Punjab and Baluchistan and will also prepare tender docu-
ments and supervise construction in these provinces. Sketch plans for the
NWFP are being prepared under the guidance of the architect of the project
unit. Tendering and supervision in the NWFP is expected to be done by the
local Public Works Department. A local architectural consulting firm in the
Sind Province has been appointed and is preparing sketch plans for all project
items in Sind, and is expected to provide complete design and supervision
services for these project items, including master planning for SAU.
5.13      Sites.  Sites for most project schools have been acquired and are
judged suitable. Additional land will be required for staff housing at
several existing TTIs. During negotiations the Government agreed that title
to all sites would be acquired before the scheduled start of construction.
5.14      Retroactive Financing.  It is recommended that the Bank Group pro-
vide retroactive financing up to US$40,000, for professional service incurred
in preliminary works between April 1976 and the signing of the proposed Credit
Agreement.



- 20 -
5.15      Implementation Schedule. Construction would start in mid-1977, and
physical facilities are expected to be completed by 1981. The implementation
of the technical assistance program would start in early 1977, and overall
project implementation is expected to take about five years (Annex 12). The
key steps to be taken in the first 18 months are shown in Annex 13.
Procurement
5.16      Previous experience with education projects in Pakistan suggests
that the relatively small size of the civil works contracts 1/, the geo-
graphic dispersion of the sites and the competitiveness of the local con-
struction industry make it unlikely that foreign firms will bid. Contracts
for civil works would therefore be awarded on the basis of locally advertised
competitive bidding in accordance with Government procurement procedures
acceptable to the Association. Foreign firms would be allowed to participate.
Prior IDA review would be required for contracts over US$200,000.
5.17      Equipment and furniture contracts exceeding US$50,000 would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank Group procurement guidelines. Local manufacturers participating in
ICB would be given a preferential margin of 15% over competing imports, or
the existing rate of impott duties, whichever is the lower. Contracts for
equipment and furniture that cannot reasonably be grouped in packages exceed-
ing US$50,000 would be awarded without prior IDA review on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures acceptable
to the Association. The value of equipment and furniture to be procured by
local bidding is estimated at about US$1.8 million. There is adequate compe-
tition and foreign firms would be allowed to participate. Miscellaneous
equipment and furniture, subject to a maximum of US$10,000 for each contract
and an aggregate total of US$250,000, could be procured by local shopping when
local bidding is inappropriate or would not yield lower prices than local
shopping. Books would be procured in accordance with standard government
procedures.
Disbursement
5.18      The proposed Credit of US$15.0 million equivalent would finance 60%
of the total project costs net cf taxes (all foreign exchange costs and 24%
of local costs). The Credit would be disbursed over a period, of about five
years to meet: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for furniture and equip-
ment or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured furniture and
equipment, or 85% of local expenditures for furniture and equipment purchased
off-the-shelf; (b) 45% of the total expenditure for civil works and related
professional services; and (c) 100% of the foreign expenditures of overseas
1/   These vary from US$0.1 million to US$0.6 million, based on the expecta-
tion, reinforced by previous experience, that academic and communal
buildings and housing and boarding facilities will be let separately
in the case of new institutions.



- 21 -
training and 100% of total expenditure for project specialists. Any savings
in the technical assistance program would be cancelled from the Credit,
although savings under any physical facilities category would be available to
cover overruns in other categories. Any savings in the proposed Credit on the
Closing Date would be cancelled. An amount of up to US$40,000 could be
disbursed retroactively to finance the consultants services (para. 5.12).
Annex 14 shows the estimated disbursement schedule. Disbursement is expected
to be complete by mid-1982.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The proposed investment in 17 TTIs would help improve the quality
of pre-service teacher education and expand their capacity by 2,200 places.
This component would facilitate: (a) introduction of new primary and middle-
level curricula by training teachers in their use; and (b) expansion of
primary enrollments particularly for girls, from the present 5.1 million to
7.5 million by 1985. The proposed experiments with the adult literacy program
would be conducted to develop a comprehensive strategy for improving educa-
tional opportunities among less well served regions and groups.
6.02      The proposed assistance to five ATIs would:  (a) improve the quality
of training by introducing partly integrated training programs with emphasis
on practical preparation; (b) expand the annual output of middle-level agricul-
tural workers from 250 to 640; (c) improve the training of existing middle-
level agriculture and livestock extension workers (1,800 per year); and (d)
provide training on specific skills and technologies to about 7,200 farmer
leaders per year. The additional output would enable the Government to reduce
the ratio of field agricultural assistants (public service) to farmers from
1:900 to 1:450 by 1986. The proposed investment in Sind Agricultural Univer-
sity would strengthen the quality in preparation of agricultural graduates to
serve Sind Province and two less developed regions, Baluchistan and Azad
Kashmir. The IRDP organization's requirements in Sind and the two other
regions in 1986 could be met by some 1,300 graduates to be produced. The
proposed preinvestment studies would identify specific needs for training
programs and provide a basis for future investment.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following points:
(a) establishment of a project monitoring system (para. 4.03);
(b) preparation of two manpower studies (paras. 4.06 and 4.10)
and a development plan for Sind Agricultural University
(para. 4.12);



- 22 -
(c)  establishment of a minimum of nine months effective work
required for a teacher's certificate and experiments with
alternative curricula (para. 4.07);
(d)  establishment of Advisory Committee for each ATI
(para. 4.10);
(e)  No further expansion of the present enrollment at Sind
Agricultural University until the educational development
plan is completed and discussed with the Association
(para. 4.12);
(f) selection criteria arnd procedures for the awards of
fellowships, terms of reference and appointment of
technical specialists, and terms of reference for the
proposed studies (palra. 4.14);
(g)  maintenance of the project unit throughout the project
period and appointment of qualified staff in sufficient
number for project implementation (para. 5.09); and
(h)  acquisition of title to every site prior to the
scheduled start of construction (para. 5.13).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement would be the
establishment of special revolving funds and the initial deposits in such
funds (para. 5.10).
7.03      Disbursement of funds (other than professional services) for Sind
Agricultural University would be contingent upon the conclusion of an agree-
ment for specialists' services with an institution acceptable to the Associa-
tion (para. 4.12).
7.04      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$15.0 million equivalent to the
Government of Pakistan on standard IDA terms.

Summary of Previous World Bank Group
Education Projects in Pakistan
Education Project I (Credit 50-PAK)
1.        The first education project in Pakistan was signed and became
effective in 1964. Total estimated project cost was US$17.0 million, of
which US$8.5 million was financed under the Credit. The principal objective
of the project is to improve and expand agricultural and technological man-
power in Pakistan.
2.        The project provides the Lyallpur Agricultural University (LAU)
in the Punjab with needed facilities in the form of construction, consultant
services, and equipment, expanding its capacity approximately four times;
teaching equipment for five existing (three in the Punjab and two in Sind)
and one new polytechnic institute (in the Punjab); and technical assistance
for training of technical teachers at two other institutes. Enrollment
at the agricultural university was 3,000 in 1976 (excluding those students
in short courses and the affiliated College of Animal Husbandry, Lahore).
Enrollment capacity of the university is about 4,200. The quality of educa-
tion increased substantially at LAU during the project period and applied
research and extension have recently been given high priority by the univer-
sity management. LAU has successfully met manpower requirements from the
Punjab Province. Present enrollment at the technical institutes, including
teacher training is about 4,000, only half of the enrollment forecast at
appraisal for 1973.
3.        The project was completed seven and a half years behind schedule.
Reasons for the delay include: (a) two wars, (b) floods, and (c) shortages
of materials and sharp price increases with subsequent suspension of work.
The project has, however, also been delayed because of: (a) cumbersome
implementation procedures, (b) unfamiliarity of project staff with IDA pro-
cedures, and (c) late appointment of consulting architects. The project was
finally completed on December 31, 1976, a fourth postponement of the Closing
Date. Total project cost is now estimated at US$17.9 million, 4% above the
original estimate in dollar terms. Final disbursements amounted to 96% of the
Credit amount.
4.        The experience gained from the implementation of this project has
been:
(a) Enrollment targets for the agricultural university have
not been reached because of delayed project implementation.
Furthermore, manpower needs have been reduced as a result
of changes in the provincial structure of Pakistan since
appraisal. Enrollment at the technical institutes is only
50% of appraisal forecast because of employment difficulties
of the graduates, caused by inadequate and overly academic



APPENDIX I
Page 2
training. Enrollment at the technical teacher training pro-
gram falls far short: of expectations because of lack of pre-
service facilities and difficulties in releasing teachers for
in-service training because of staff shortages (about 35%).
(b) Equipment at the polytechnic institutes is underutilized
because of overly theoretical and poorly designed curricula
and the absence of repair and maintenance funds and facili-
ties.
(c) Delays and problems in implementation are partly attributable
to the project executing agencies' unfamiliarity with IDA
procedures, as well as to the lack of a coordinating imple-
mentation unit for all project items.
Education Project II (Credit 206-PAK)
5.        The Second Pakistan Education Project was signed in 1970 and
became effective in 1971. The main objective of the project is to improve
the quality of engineering educ:ation in Pakistan. The US$4 million Credit
is financing physical facilities, expert services and fellowships for a new
engineering college to replace and relocate the NED Engineering College,
Karachi. The current cost estimate is US$5.6 million about 90% of the
appraisal estimate. Disbursement had reached US$2.5 million, in December
1976 about 63% of the appraisal estimate.
6.        The new campus is designed for an overall enrollment of 1,500,
but current enrollment is 1,650 students and present intakes will lead to an
enrollment of 1,900 students within four years if not checked. The College
offers degree courses in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.
7.        Execution of the project is approximately two years behind schedule.
The new facilities have been in partial use since early 1976 and are expected
to be completed six months after the current Closing Date, December 1976.
The technical assistance program, will take three more years. Extension of
the Closing Date beyond December 1978 is however not likely to be necessary.
The delay has resulted mainly from the Government of Sind's reluctance to
use Credit funds for foreign experts and fellowships. Other causes of delays
are the same as in the first education project, namely, cumbersome implemen-
tation procedures and project staff unfamiliarity with IDA procedures.
8.        The problems encountered and experience gained from the second
education project can be summarized as follows:
(a) Weaknesses among college staff threaten to impede the
project's effectiveness. While the appraisal report
envisaged 89 staff members, about 60% are presently on
the job. Furthermore, only 23 hold a master's degree
and four a doctor's degree. Staff salaries are low com-
pared with those offered by local and foreign industries
and BSc degree holders are not eager to complete



APPENDIX I
Page 3
M.Sc. studies locally. The situation shows however an
improvement tendency, particularly since early 1976
when salaries were increased by about 40%.
(b) The staffing problem has been further aggravated by
student unrest and lack of control in student intake
due to external pressure on the college authorities.
Student enrollments should not be increased until staff
training has been improved.
(c) Problems encountered in procurement has mostly been of
practical nature, for instance, difficulties in opening
letters of credit and in obtaining books through pres-
cribed ICB procedures. Flexibility in procurement methods
is thus of great importance and the Association has waived
TCB procedures where justified.
5.        Applicable experience gained in the implementation of previous
projects in Pakistan has been taken into account in the project design
of the Third Education Project as follows:
(a) A co-ordinating project implementation unit with the
necessary powers and staff has been etablished in the
Federal Ministry of Education;
(b) Key project implementing staff have been invited to
attend a Bank sponsored seminar to familiarize them-
selves with IDA procedures in project implementation;
(c) To prevent delays in the provision of technical assis-
tance, conclusion of a technical assistance agreement
would be a condition of disbursements for other project
items (except professional fees) at the Sind Agricultural
University (SAU);
(d) The Government has agreed to freeze enollments at the SAU
until long term development plan and mnapower studies have
been undertaken to determine man-power needs; and
(e) The Government has agreed to specific maintenance budget
allocations for all project institutes. Maintenance
repair facilities for equipment are included in the
Project.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND FIELD ASSISTANTS
Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP)
1.        The IRDP was launched in 1972 as the country's primary effort
toward rural development and has been given top priority, All of the pro-
vinces have included an increase in agricultural production, particularly
in foodgrains, among the other objectives of the IRDPs. This is the sole
objective in the Punjab Province, but only part of a much broader set of
objectives in other provinces, with village cooperative organization as the
primary objective in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). The main in-
strument to achieve these objectives is the markaz which operates through
inter-agency coordination and grass roots participation. Markaz provides
supporting facilities such as the services of government departments, supply
of inputs, credit, machinery workshops, storage, marketing, agro-based
industries, health and adult education to the rural population of the
assigned area of 50-100 villages.
2.        Essential to implementing IRDP would be a master plan for the
delivery of development services and inputs to ensure their timely and ade-
quate availability. None of the provinces has yet completed such a master
plan. Annex 1 gives an estimated number of professional and sub-
professional staff presently available, and the expected manpower surplus
or deficit that will result by iChe year 1981 1/, taking into account the IRDP
typical staff structure of a markaz 2/, and the expected supply between
1976-1981 by the various training institutions. Most markaz have only
recently been established and the number of line department staff is limited,
except in NWFP. As a result practical courses for farmers in crops, animal
husbandry, water management, functional literacy and other support programs
which would normally be conductE-d by line department staff, have begun only
on a limited scale.
3.        The Bank Group Rural Levelopment Project Preparation Assistance
Mission which visited Pakistan in March/April 1975 reports that although
training of staff and beneficiaries is considered an important element of
the IRDP, training for rural development is still limited. The Pakistan
Academy for Rural Development in Peshawar, NWFP, is the major training in-

staff and line departments; the Quetta Academy for IRDP staff only. The
federal level is not now providing assistance or encouragement to provincial
training programs. A comprehensive study is needed to determine the present
status or pre-service and in-service courses for both IRDP and line staff,
and to recommend a feasible investment project for meeting anticipated de-
mands for rural development manpower.
Field Assistants and TraininR institutes
4.        Present middle-level field assistants 1/ are generally incapable
of providing the practical advice and assistance that farmers need. The
farmer is usually engaged in both crop and animal husbandry and requires
simultaneous advice in both fields. The agricultural field assistant who
is expected to operate at village level within the staff structure of a
markaz should then be capable of providing the small farmer advice on crops
and on the broader and routine problems of animal husbandry. He should
detect those problems on animal husbandry for which he would require further
support (particularly animal health problems), and seek that support from
specialized staff in that area, e.g., from stock assistants (Union Council
level) or Animal Husbandry/Veterinary Officer at markaz level. Concurrently,
the stock assistant should be able to provide specialized livestock farmers
with services in animal husbandry and health under the supervision of the
animal husbandry/veterinary officer.
5.        Field agricultural assistants and stock assistant training are
currently of low quality. The ATIs' instructional staff are poorly motivated
and trained. The ATIs lack laboratory and workshop equipment and farm imple-
ments, machinery and animals. While the duration of courses at the ATIs has
recently been increased from one to two years post-matriculation, stock
assistants will frequently have no formal training and are only "apprenticed"
to officers at district and animal hospitals, whose own professional training
is predominatly in veterinary medicine rather than animal husbandry. This is,
however, being changed in the Punjab Province's Lyallpur University, with the
opening of an undergraduate course on aninmal husbandry separate from that on
veterinary science.
6.        Integrating the training of agricultural field assistants and
stock assistants in a common institution is essential. Training should be
of two years duration, based upon a revised curriculum which should include
a common core of agricultural science subjects, farm management, rural
sociology and some specialization in crop or animal husbandry. At least
half of the instruction should be practical and specifically related to the
type of farming predominant in the area. These approaches have been adopted
in the proposed ATIs.
1/   "Middle-level" implies staff with less than degree qualifications (usually
post-matriculation course of two years duration) such as field assistants
for crops, stock assistants for animal husbandry compounders for animal
health.



APPENDIX II
Page 3
7.        There are no firm estimates of the demand for field agricultural
assistants and stock assistants or of the Government's capacity to support
them. According to the official IRDP report 1/ 1973 requirements for sub-
professional agriculturalists was estimated at 50 agricultural field assist-
ants and 10 stock assistants per markaz. The original proposal was that
500 markaz should be established by 1975/76 and 700 markaz by 1980/81, creat-
ing a theoretical need for 35,000 agricultural field assistants and 7,000
stock assistants. Neither of these targets is likely to be reached. In fact,
the 500 markaz target has been postponed to the year 1981 and there is evi-
dence that even this new target will not be met by some of the provinces.
Also, the manpower considered necessary is too ambitious as judged by the
planned final ratio field agricultural assistants/farm families. However,
some provinces have modified the original staff structure of the markaz.
There are now about 5,700 extension workers, of whom about 700 are agricul-
tural graduates and 5,000 field agricultural assistants. In addition there
are nearly 2,500 stock assistants and compounders who are engaged mainly in
animal health programmes. The annual output of the five ATIs is about 250
which would barely provide for the annual turnover of current staff and would
not cover even one-half of the relevant staff requirements projected by the
IRDP for the 500 markaz. Intensifying extension services to smaller farmers
in Pakistan, whether through the IRDP or the provincial agricultural depart-
ments, would require improving the orientation and quality of pre-service
training and frequent in-service training.

THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Structure
1.        The education system is divided into the following stages: primary
(grades 1-5), middle (grades 6-8), high (grades 9-10), intermediate (grades
11-12) and degree (grades 13-14 plus). Secondary education includes the middle
and high stages (Chart 1).
2.        School attendance, limited by shortage of facilities as well as
social and cultural factors, is low: in 1975/76 primary, middle and high
stage enrollments were estimated to 49%, 21% and 12% of the corresponding
age groups. About three times as many boys as girls were attending school.
3.        Male and female education is generally separated in terms of
physical facilities, staffs, and supervision by inspectors. The required
separation could economically be achieved by separate morning and afternoon
shifts for boys and girls, rather than duplicating buildings within each
catchment area. Although encouraged by the Government, two shift schools
remain, however, less common.
4.        There is no strict organization of schools by stage.  Middle stage
education, for instance, is either provided in separate middle schools or
attached to primary or high schools and expansion beyond the primary
stage is to a considerable extent achieved through upgrading primary
schools to middle standard and middle schools to high standard. This
illustrates the rather weak position of education planning.
5.        Vocational education is largely provided by separate vocational
schools where enrollments corresponded to less than 10% of the high school
stage. In order to give the general education system a more practical
orientation and to expand vocational education, the Goverment plans to merge
vocational and high schools. 1/
6.        High education is provided by over 400 colleges, the majority
of which offer degree-level classes, and eight universities. Due to social
pressures, Government investments have favored higher education. 2/ Development
has now reached a point where further investment in general university and
college education seems to be associated with a negative rate of return while
the investments in primary education have been so marginal that additional
investments are estimated to return 15%-20%. 3/

7.        Adult education, including literacy, is fragmented and no large-
scale operations have yet been successfully undertaken. However, several
private and public bodies have, independently, been involved in adult education
and/or literacy, and in the process valuable experience has been gathered. An
administrative structure suitable for a nationwide effort may be forthcoming
through the Integrated Rural Development Program.
Administration
8.        The Federal Ministry of Education and the Education Secretariats
of the Provincial Government share the responsibility for formal education in
Pakistan. In broad terms, the constitution charges the Federal Ministry with
the duty of overall planning, policy formulation and coordination whereas
institutional planning and management is made a provincial responsibility.
However, a directorate within the Ministry is in charge of a number of Fed-
eral Government institutions and certain areas of Pakistan are under Federal
administration (Tribal areas, Azad Kashmir and Northern areas). Curricula and
study materials are centrally approved for the whole country. Development
work is done by the National Bureau of Curriculum and Textbooks in collabor-
ation with the appropriate Provincial Bureau.
9.        In a program of nationalization begun in September 1972, the
Government has taken over private schools and practically all schools are
now public. School fees have been abolished up to matriculation (grade 10),
but contributions are often charged for materials or school support funds.
Formally, universities are autonomous, but for budget reasons they are linked
with the Provincial or Federal lDepartments of Education. In recent years,
student pressure groups have taken control over important management decisions
and strongly influenced academic work.
10.       Departments other than Education (Health, Agriculture, Veterinary,
Labor Activities or Industries, etc.) give training programs related to
their fields. These include the training of nurses, lady health visitors,
field assistants, farmers, skilled craftsmen, handicraft training, etc.,
and account for approximately 8% of Government education expenditure.
General Education
11.       For primary education grade one enrollment includes approximately
74% of all children. 1/ However, the dropout rate is considerable and less
than half the initial entrants remain through grade five. Commonly quoted
causes include inadequate physical facilities, poorly qualified and moti-
vated teachers, poverty requiring or encouraging child labor and social
prejudices. It is unlikely that parent's negative attitudes towards
schooling, as reflected in the high dropout rates and their poor responses
to physical need of their village schools, will be overcome in a short period
1/ As automatic progression was only recently introduced, these figures
include an unknown amount of repetition.



APPENDIX III
Page 3
of time. In fact, primary school development has been sluggish in recent
years; the growth rate 3.4% p.a., barely exceeding the population growth
(see Annex 2).
12.       Educational opportunities are unevenly distributed by sex; close
to 100% of the 5-year old age group of males is enrolled in Grade 1, compared
to only 47% of females. 1/ In addition, female dropout rates are significantly
higher than male so that Grade 5 provides schooling for three times as many
boys as-girls. Regional inequities are also sizable. Whereas in 1972/73 the
female primary enrollment ratio for Karachi Division was 47%, the ratio for
Hyderabad Division was only 12%, and in the Tribal Areas the supply of
educational services to girls had barely begun.
13.       The Education Policy 1972-80 has led to a number of reforms in
primary education including (a) a revision of the primary curricula to ensure
greater activation of the children in accordance with their stages of
development, (b) the abolition of annual examinations in favor of a continuous
assessment, and (c) the introduction of automatic progression. New primary
texts are being procured by the National Textbook Foundation and kits, includ-
ing small implements and texts for use by teachers and children, are being
developed and tried in the field.
14.       Teachers now entering the profession have ten years of schooling
(matriculation) and one year professional training. However, many teachers
with only eight years of schooling remain in the profession; approximately
half of the teacher force in Sind and NWFP is of this type. Following large-
scale in-service teacher training programs conducted by the Provincial Govern-
ments, most teachers are formally qualified. The need for in-service training,
particularly for the introduction of the new curricula is nevertheless great.
15.       The normal class size is 40 pupils, but a considerable over-enroll-
ment occurs in the lower grades, and despite dropouts the average pupil!
teacher ratio is 39. Schools are usually single stream, with one teacher
assigned to each class, but smaller schools, notably single teacher-schools,
exist in rural areas. The planned expansion of education to under-privileged
areas will require a lower pupil/teacher ratio since otherwise catchment
areas would become too large. 2/
16.       Middle staRe education is characterized by many of the problems
mentioned under previous headings (poor facilities, scarcity of teaching
materials, etc.). Educational opportunities are more unevenly distributed
by sex and region, but the dropout rate is smaller. Enrollment ratios are
in 1975/76 estimated to 32% for boys and 8.2% for girls (see Chart 2).

on a teacher/pupil ratio of 1:33.



APPENDIX III
Page 4
17.       Among educational reforms stemming from the 1972-80 Education Policy,
the introduction of agrotechnical education is of particular significance to
the middle level since it is envisaged that all schools will be involved in
this reform and that boys will take either agriculture or industrial arts
and girls, home economics. The weekly time allocation is approximately 18%
and the syllabi have a fair bias towards general science education. Although
the reform would increase the value of schooling to most pupils, care should
be exercised in implementation. Teachers are not available in sufficient
numbers while courses need to be experimented with and materials tested.
18.       The required teacher qualification is 12 years of schooling (Inter-
mediate degree from College), plus one year of professional training. How-
ever, an admixture of graduate staff is preferred. 1/ Because of the
frequent attachment of middle stage classes to primary schools (see para. 4)
and the reporting techniques used, it is not possible to specify actual
teacher qualifications for the middle stage.
19.       High school education is in 1975/76 estimated to be available to
12% of the 14-15 year old age group (male 20%, female 4.5%). The unequal
regional distribution of the schools is an obstacle to development in rural
areas because urban graduates are usually unwilling to accept rural employment
after professional training. The scarcity of high school graduates for teacher
training limits primary school expansion in certain areas. 2/ High school
teachers are required to have a university degree and professional training.
20.       Agriculture, industrial arts and home economics are offered as
high school subjects, but the number of matriculates have so far been low
(800, 1,700 and 1,300, respectively, p.a.). In agriculture, for instance,
the low output precludes that a high school background presently be made a
requirement for entry to Agricultural Training Institutes or to middle
stage teacher training in agriculture. The only other common vocationally
oriented study group in the high school is commerce. Together these groups
of study represent only 5% of the matriculates.
21.       While vocational and  :echnical education at the secondary level has
been expanding at a rate of almost 12% p.a., much greater than other areas
of education, it still represents only 10% of overall enrollment. In
1972/73 there were 149 male and 135 female institutions enrolling respectively
30- and 13-thousand pupils. Vocational Institutes for boys (minimum grade
8 entry) train semi-skilled and skilled workers in various technical fields,
such as carpentry, painting and carpetmaking. Vocational Institutes for
girls (minimum grade 5 entry) provide one or two-year courses in various
handicrafts and secretarial work. Commercial Institutes provide one or
two-year course and Polytechnics (grade 10 entry) provide three-year courses
essentially for boys.
1/   In Karachi, the supply of graduate teachers is so great that essentially
only graduates are being recruited.
2/   Proposed project items have taken this into account by giving preference
to rural sites and by increased boarding capacities, particularly for
female institutions.



APPENDIX III
Page 5
22.        Particularly in technical fields, graduates from formal training
institutes have encountered employment difficulties which may be explained
by the strong role that apprentice training plays in Pakistan through family
enterprise and, as a result, polytechnic institutes have not expanded as
originally anticipated.
23.        Vocational and technical education is a priority area under the
1972-80 Education Policy. However, future expansion is envisaged to take the
form of integrated secondary education.
24.       Higher education is provided by 362 Arts and Science Colleges,
76 Professional colleges and eight universities (1972/73). Degree colleges
go beyond the Intermediate examination (12th year) to the Bachelor's degree
(14th year). Universities provide Honors' degrees (usually three years
beyond intermediate) and post-graduate programs. The professional colleges
provide training varying in length from one to six years in agriculture,
engineering, commerce, law, medical fields, home economics, education and
some other smaller professional areas. Female enrollment is low (15% of
total) and concentrated in the latter three fields.
25.        Higher education has received an unduly large share of previous
development budgets. This fact is acknowledged by the Government and ex-
pansion will, according to the Working Paper for Development Prespective
(1975-80), be limited to backward areas and to subject areas other than the
Arts (which now account for over half of the enrollment).
Development Perspectives, 1976-81
26.        The Education Policy announced by the Government of Pakistan in
March 1972 forms the basis for a number of important reforms and expansion
plans. The qualitative or administrative reforms include: free education
up to Grade 10 and nationalization of private schools, curriculum reform,
abolition of examinations through Grade 9 and increased emphasis on agro-
technical education including home economics.
27.        Demanding quantitative goals were, however, also set forth both for
in-school and adult education. The detailed plans set forth in the draft
Fifth Five Year Plan (1976-81) envisage primary enrollment ratios to reach
85% and 49% respectively for boys and girls by 1981, with growth rates for
enrollment averaging 9.3% per annum. Expansion rates of this order of magni-
tude are also planned at middle and high school levels. To achieve these goals,
double shifts would be extensively used to minimize new construction. New
facilities would be created for teacher training, and in addition teachers
would also be trained at high schools and colleges. The following table dis-
plays the actual and projected enrollment ratios for 1972/73 and 1980/81
together with the average annual growth rates achieved or required for the
preceding five-year period:

/a   Enrollment as fraction of age groups including overaged students.
Vocational secondary schools are not included as enrollments were
not projected.
28.       Considering that the present low enrollment ratios are largely due
to high dropout rates - which in turn seem to be caused by factors which are
only slowly changing (see para [1) - there is reason to doubt the realism of
these projections. Crash programs of teacher training attached to high
schools and colleges, which are due to poor quality of training, might even
counteract primary school expansion, should this not be considered at present.
29.       For literacy the goal of the 1972 Education Policy was to reach as
much of the population as possible (about 11 million) through ten thousand
centers established at women's education centers, schools, factories and
youth centers. Mass media were to be extensively used. (The number of
illiterates was then estimated to 40 million and to be growing at over one
million per year).

30.       The main staff categories desired 1/ within the three stages of
the school system are:
1/   In addition there are a number of other specialized categories (drawing
masters, oriental teachers, etc.), but generally speaking, their
training and level of service falls within this pattern.

A composite staff--certain degree teachers, for instance, working at the
middle stage--is desired and practiced.  However, the composition of the staff
is essentially determined by the availability of teachers, and varies con-
siderably by location 1/. While such variations are important in local
planning, national estimates of teacher requirements may, with reasonable
accuracy, be made on the assumption that all new posts in the primary stage
should be filled by PTC-level staff and most middle stage posts by CT-level
staff.
31.       There are 55 institutions training teachers of PTC and/or CT
standard with an overall annual output of about 11,000. The proportion of CT
intakes can in most cases be adjusted at short notice. Although exceptions
exist, the training is usually of poor quality and geared to provide a for-
mal certification rather than professional skills. Lack of workshops for
crafts, laboratories, suitable furniture and equipment, favor a lecture -
style education which the curriculum reform introduced by the 1972 Education
Policy attempts to avoid. The teaching staff generally has a poor understand-
ing of the methods required by the new curriculum, and there is a strong need
for extensive reorientation courses. From time to time short courses of this
nature are arranged by Provincial Extension Centers, 2/ the People's Open
University, Islamabad and some other University departments.
32.       Present non-degree pre-service programs (PTC, CT and equivalent)
are poorly organized, and last barely six months. In addition, the profes-
sional atmosphere and standards are adversely affected by improper admissions
1/   Because of their availability, only degree teachers are recruited
to male middle stage posts in Karachi Division. This occurs less
frequently in other areas.
2/   One to two institutions per Province, primarily responsible for

late in the year - even up to a few months before the end of the course.
A lengthening of the courses to a minimum of nine months of effective work
and termination of late admissions was recently agreed to by the Government.
Teacher qualifications may now also be earned by appearing as an external
candidate without having taken professional training. This practice should
be abolished.
33.       In-service training of school teachers is the responsibility of the
Provincial Extension Centers together with the People's Open University.
The former are organizing large-scale courses to introduce the new curricula.
The goal is that all primary teachers should be reached within three to five
years.  The courses are short and conducted by "master-trainers" who them-
selves have had only brief training. The People's Open University is planning
longer radio and correspondence courses, primarily for the academic upgrading
of teachers.
34.       Graduate level teacher training is organized as a one-year post-
graduate professional course at Universities or Colleges of Education.
There are special programs for training technical teachers.
35.       As can be seen from Annex 3, the present supply of trained male
teachers will not constrain implementation of the plans for expanding primary
and middle school education for boys. The estimated shortfall of 5,000, out
of 85,000 required to meet the planned expansion, would be covered by a sur-
plus of graduate teachers, and expansion will for other reasons probably not
be as dramatic as envisaged (see para. 28). If the existing stock of 40,000
unemployed teachers trained in crash programs is absorbed, primary schools
could enroll 80%-85% of the age group by 1980. However, a capacity expansion
of about 1,500 male teachers p.a. would be required by 1980 solely to maintain
that enrollment ratio between 1.980-85.
36.       The supply of female teachers is, however, a severe constraint to
the development of female education. Present sources would provide only
15,000 or 27% of the 55,000 required in the period 1976-81 (see Annex 3).
Female teacher training should accordingly be expanded as fast as feasible.
The major difficulty here is the lack of qualified candidates for teacher
training in rural areas. Plans for further investments will require
reassessment of the situation after about two years.
Agricultural Education and Home Economics
37.       Recognizing that much of Pakistan's population is engaged in agri-
cultural activities, the 1972 Education Policy calls for a "shift from
general education to more purpoSeful agrotechnical education." Agriculture
is thus being introduced as a science-oriented subject in middle schools
with a time allotment of eight periods per week. It is planned that 70%



APPENDIX III
Page 9
of all male schools 1/ will participate. Foreign experts are helping develop
curricula for agriculture and other agrotechnical subjects.
38.       Agriculture is studied to matriculation level by only a small
fraction of secondary school students (Approx. 800 of 150,000). The Gov-
ernment proposed an increase for the present planning period; if plans
materialize, approximately 6% would specialize in agriculture.
39.       Field assistant training is offered in five Agricultural Train-
ing Institutes under the Provincial Departments of Agriculture. 2/ These
terminal two-year post matriculation courses specialize in either crop or
animal husbandry. Annual outputs have been in the range of 250 p.a. for
all institutes together (see Appendix II for more detailed information).
40.       Degree level courses, requiring five to six years of post matri-
culation studies, are offered by five colleges or universities in Pakistan:
(a) College of Agriculture, Peshawar University, NWFP;
(b) Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar, NWFP;
(c) Sind Agricultural University, Tandojam;
(d) Agricultural University, Lyallpur, the Punjab; with affiliated
(e) College of Animal Husbandry, Lahore, Punjab.
Total outputs at bachelors' and master's levels numbered 729 and 253,
respectively in 1971.
41.       Signs of employment difficulties have been noted for agricultural
graduates. There is, however, a severe shortage of teachers for the pro-
posed expansion of agricultural education in middle and high schools and
resources should be diverted in that direction by one-year teacher train-
ing programs for agricultural graduates. Agricultural teacher training
programs are now only offered by Lyallpur University through a three-year
integrated course (recent outputs approx. 20 p.a.). Under the proposed proj-
ject Sind Agricultural University will develop one-year post-graduate pro-
gram in agricultural education.
42.       Several non-formal programs related to rural development or agri-
culture are arranged by agricultural colleges or universities, the Pakistan
Academy for Rural Development, cooperative colleges, directorates of agri-
culture and rural development, the Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV),
1/   This figure is based on a proposal that female students will be offered
home economics and male students will be offered either agriculture or
industrial arts, the latter in 80% of the urban schools and 8% of the
rural. The rural population is estimated to be 70% in 1980.

the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) and private enterprises. The
larger programs include: (a) the training of farm guides or farm home guides
in two-week to two-month courses at Lyallpur Agricultural University; (b)
half-hour daily radio programs, including recorded discussions among farmers,
organized in collaboration with lectures from the PBC and agricultural depart-
ments; and (c) a whole series of short applied courses of one week to three
months duration for farmers.
43.    - Home economics is currently given the same emphasis for girls
as agriculture is for boys.  ItW is being made a compulsory subject in mid-
dle schools and emphasized in high schools.  At present, 3.2% of matriculates
have majored in the field and the subject is offered at degree level at
three colleges. The number of graduates have been just over 200 p.a.
44.       The content of the courses offered are the same for urban and
rural girls. They include food and nutrition, clothing and textiles,
child development and family relations, various arts, crafts and some
general science. Very little is offered of relevance to agricultural oc-
cupations. A reform in this respect is urgent since the women play an
important role in the rural economy. Pilot programs are planned by the
Lyallpur Agricultural University.
Literacy and Adult Education
45.       Relatively large-scal? literacy campaigns have been attempted
by Provincial Governments through the People's Works Program. Some 20,000
teachers, generally educated but unemployed persons or school teachers, were
instructed in literacy techniques by 650 master trainers. Primers, wall
charts, and in some cases, radio broadcasts supported the program. The effort
was, however, not particularly successful and the program has been cancelled
in Sind and the Punjab. The recson for failure was probably poor project
preparation, with the result that the participants did not contribute their
time and effort.
46.       Several other organizations have launched independent adult edu-
cation programs. These include Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation, Adult
Basic Education Society (ABES), the Girl Guides Association, Universities,
Ministries and recently the People's Open University which was founded with
adult education as one of its functions.
47.       ABES, which has developed its techniques over several years, has
been recognized as one of the mo3t successful organizations in the field.
Its target groups have been illiterates and neo-literates in cities and
villages along main roads. With class sizes averaging 12 adults, drop-
out rates below 20% were achieved. Courses are run on a part-time basis.
Centers have been chosen so as to be easily accessible to ABES supervision.
Basic literacy and short functional courses, supported by reading material,
aim at improving participant's abilities to perform as more self-reliant
citizens. Several booklets graded according to linguistic ability have been
developed and in 1973/74, over 1(D0,000 books were sold. Although still

Page 11
reaching only a small fraction of the population (1,700 were made function-
ally literate in 1972-73), the ABES pilot effort may have laid the ground-
work for future large-scale operations. Its material and experience have
been utilized for a first phase experimental program conducted in 1975/76 by
the PTV with UNICEF assistance.
Education Finance
48.       The Federal Government has the primary responsibility for pro-
viding development expenditure to the Provincial Governments; the latter
are responsible for recurrent expenditures. This budgetary system has led
to certain distortions and imbalances in the growth of the educational system,
inter alia, relatively capital intensive higher education. Implementation
of the Government priority of developing education facilities in less developed
areas seems to require that it provides recurrent expenditure to the least
educationally developed provinces.
49.       The following table summarizes expenditure trends since FY1971
and provides a projection for FY1980. More complete data are presented
in Annex 5.

50.       During the fiscal period 1971-75, the Government's education
expenditures increased at an average rate of 29% p.a., as compared to a
growth of consolidated Federal and Provincial budgets of about 28% p.a.
During the same period the overall inflation rate was estimated at more



APPENDIX III
Page 12
than 20% p.a. An increase in development expenditure from PRs. 167 million
in FY1971 to PRs. 486 million in FY1975 was insufficient because of cost
escalation in construction, equipment, furniture, and materials. Teacher
salaries in nationalized private and public school largely accounted for
increases in recurrent expenditure from PRs, 416 million to PRs. 1,108 mil-
lion. Government education expenditure as a percent of GNP increased from
1.3% in 1970 to 1.8% in 1975; as a percent of total Government expenditures,
it increased from 6.0% to 6.2%. Education spending per capita in FY1975 was
estimated at Rs. 30. These figures are among the lowest in the developing
countries (Comparative Educat:ion Indicators) and the Government intends to
improve them during FY1976-8].
51.       Despite the high priority given to education, the budgetary allo-
cation to this sector has been insufficient (para. 50). The shortfall be-
tween targets and actual performance was mainly due to calamities (two wars,
flood and drought) which pre-empted required resources. The draft Development
Perspective (1976-81) proposes to increase per capita education spending to
Rs. 63 by FY1981 and the Government education expenditure as a percentage
of GNP to 3.2%. The projection of expenditure for FY1981 is based on the
following planned increases in enrollments and teacher requirements: primary
level from 47% in 1974/75 to 73% in 1980/81; secondary level from 17% to
26%; 166,000 primary school teachers; and 30,000 secondary school teachers
during 1976-81. The enrollment at diploma level is planned to increase from
156,000 in 1974/75 to 220,000 in 1980/81 and enrollment at degree level
from 66,000 to 91,000. However, some of these projections seem overly
optimistic.
52.       Unit costs of education (in PRs) are summarized in the following
table:

The above data show that for eazh place created in a university nearly 400
places could be created at primary level and the annual recurrent cost per
student in university is 50 times the recurrent cost per student at
primary level. In the past, whenever reduced funds required reallocation
of the education budget, higher education was well protected at the expense

of primary education. A crucial factor in implementing education policy
for the period 1976-81 will be the Government's ability effectively to resist
social pressures to expand colleges and universities and not to divert
funds earmarked for the primary level.

outputs from existing training institutions. Figures do not add due to roundings.
1/     The stock of unemployed teachers, currently estimated at 30-50,000, was
created by now discontinued crash programs at High Schools. According to re-
ports from District education officers these are largely male.
2/     The assumption was made that only non-degree teachers are employed in the
middle schools, which is pessimistic. The following more-realistic primary
enrolments would be achieved if approximately 1/3 of the estimated demand
(line 5 fom middle stage) is of graduate level:

Draft Terms of Reference
Study on Curricula Related to Irrigated Agriculture,
Rainfed Agriculture and Agriculture at Large Including
Animal Husbandry
1.        The basic objective would be to recommend an irrigated agriculture--
specific and rainfed agriculture--curricula as they are envisaged to apply in
Pakistan's ecology and under her national agriculture development objectives
over the next decades. Consequently, the recommended curricula should be
goal-oriented with the goals derived in dialogue with authorities responsible
for formulating national targets for agriculture and education sectors.
2.        The consultants would pay special attention, but not necessarily
limit their activities, to the following:
(a) To assess the status of agriculture and irrigation
engineering education related to all aspects of water
resources and water management, irrigated and rainfed
agriculture and agriculture at large including
livestock husbandry as such education is given by
agricultural and engineering universities, colleges,
institutes and in-service training courses.
(b) To assess long-term requirements for qualified personnel
at all levels in the agricultural sector as defined above;
in particular, assess the personnel required to match
macrodevelopment strategy in the agricultural and water
resources sector so that projected benefits are not limited
by management constraints.
(c) To evaluate the educational objectives, curricula, methods,
and any other relevant factors as to assure their con-
sistency with the ecology of the country and with national
development objectives in the above subsectors of agriculture.
(d) To prepare necessary modifications to curricula and outline
their implementation.
(e) To formulate a broad educational strategy to meet long-
term personnel requirements in the agricultural sector and
prepare estimates of financial and human resources needed.
The strategy should indicate the rate at which the present
system can be improved.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(f) To investigate how additional staff at field level
can be made available for extension work in water
management, irrigated agriculture and other agricultural
development activities so that a substantial Governmental
impact can be made in these specific fields referred to
and other technical activities of Government.
3.        The study would require the following experts:
(a) Team Leader - Agricultural Economist/Economist with
educational experience as a senior member of a faculty
or educationist
(b) On-Farm Water Management Expert
(c) Agronomist - irrigated crops and their production
(d) Irrigation Engineer - Planner
(e) Agronomist - rainfed agriculture
(f) Specialists on short-term assignments (including
agricultural economist if the team leader is not an
agricultural economist.
4.        Senior experts should be assigned to this project in order to
ensure a high-level dialogue with Pakistan authorities.

The above-mentioned areas and costs have been celculated for all new project institutes.
Dining and kitchen areas/student amount to 1.9m and are included with the boarding
facilities.   While above costs are not readily comparable with those for similar insti-
tutions in other Bank Group-financed projects, due to differences in construction unit
costs and conditions peculiar to each project, they are reasonable for the accommodation
to be provided on the basis of area/students for the various facilities.   Areas for
the ATIs are similar to those in other recent Bank projects.   Costs are based on
December 1976 prices and are net of contingencies and consultantsffees.
