                  THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT - CREDIT 678-PAK

                              COMPLETION REPORT


                                   PREFACE


        The Pakistan - Third Education Project for which Credit 678-PAK in
the sum of US$ 15 million was approved in January 1977, was closed in Septem-
ber 25, 1984, about nine months after the extended closing date of December
31, 1983; the original closing date as envisioned at project appraisal was
December 31, 1982.  Final disbursement on the project was made on August 7,
1984.

        The project has two distinct general components -- the agricultural
education component and the basic education component.  Separate completion
reports were prepared for each of these components.  Both reports are
attached.  The completion report on the agricultural education component was
prepared by an FAO/CP mission which visited Pakistan in May 1984 while that
of the basic education component was prepared by a UNESCO/CP mission which
visited Pakistan in ~e~tember/~ctober1984.   Both of the above missions were
launched upon request of the Government.

        Since the two completion reports were prepared at different times
and by different missions which did not have a chance to coordinate their
plans and activities, there are sane inconsistencies in the data presented in
both reports on the same subject.  In particular, on the number of supervi-
sion missions conducted, the FAO/CP report listed 11 supervision missions,
while the UNESCO/CP report listed 15.  The reason for this discrepancy was
that the completion missions did not have the same views on what should be
considered a supervision mission.  The UNESCO/CP team considered any educa-
tion mission to Pakistan which wrote something about the project, a supervi-
sion mission, while the FAO/CP team considered only those which were con-
ducted specifically to supervise the project.  For the date of supervision,
the FAO/CP mission reported the date the supervision mission returned to
headquarters while the UNESCO/CP mission reported the month the supervision
mission was conducted.  In most project completion reports, however, a mis-
sion which includes project supervision in its terms of reference is con-
sidered a supervision mission and the period the mission devotes to supervi-
sion is considered the date of the mission.  One other difference between the
two completion reports is that the data on project disbursement of the FAO/CP
report is incomplete since the review of the project was carried out four
months before the project was closed and when disbursements were still going
on.  The UNESCO/CP report gives a more accurate picture of project disburse-
ments since the data presented was collected after the final disbursement was
made.

        On the whole, however, the completion reports by FAO/CP mission on
the agricultural education component and of the UNESCO/CP mission on the

                                      EVALUATION SUMMARY

Introduction

             This project, the third Bank-financed education project i n Pakistan
and the second t o assist agricultural education, was identified and prepared
with UNESCO assistance.          The project was originally appraised i n April-May
1975, and project scope was further refined through two poet-appraisal
missions i n June 1976 and August-September 1976.          A c r e d i t of USS15.0 million
equivalent was approved i n January 1977 t o finance a project whose t o t a l
costs were estimated a t USS27.2 million equivalent.          It was anticipated that
the project would be completed by June 1982.

Objectives and Project Content

              The project was designed t o meet objectives outlined i n the Fifth
Five Year Development Plan (1976-1981).           The project sought t o increase the
supply of qualified primary and middle level teachers, particularly f o r r u r a l
areas and for females, thereby strengthening basic education, a s well a s t o
increase the supply of trained agricultural personnel.             I n basic education
the project financed:          (a) three new and 14 existing teacher training
institutions (TTIs); (b) an experiment i n adult l i t e r a c y ; and (c) a study of
the supply of and demand f o r female primary teachers.           An additional 2,500
student places were t o be created, raising t o t a l enrollment t o 5,040, of
which over half would be females.           The project would expand female teacher
training capacity i n Pakistan by 50 percent.

              The agricultural education component financed (a) c i v i l works,
s t a f f improvement and program development f o r the Sind Agricultural
University; (b) expansion/reconstruction of f i v e existing Agricultural
Training I n s t i t u t e s (ATIs); and (c) preinvestment studies on i r r i g a t i o n and
w a t e r management training and on the supply of and demand f o r middle-level
agricultural personnel.          An additional 680 places would be added t o the ATIs,
allowing f o r a per year output of 640 pre-service, and 180 in-service
personnel and 180 farmer leaders.           Given that project i n s t i t u t i o n s were
scattered throughout several provinces, the project was t o be implemented by
existing l i n e agencies--the       provincial education and agricultural departments
and the University-under t h e coordination of an existing project unit under
the Federal Ministry of Education.

Implementation Experience

                   Implementation was beset by problems, and was considerably delayed
during the f i r s t three years following effectiveness by l a t e establishment of
provincial project u n i t s , delays i n site acquisition and shortages of
building material.                 There was a time overrun of 78 percent.      There was a 13
percent underrun i n t o t a l project costs, however, largely a s a r e s u l t of
successive devaluations of the Pakistan Rupee and under-procurement of
equipment and furniture.                   Weak management underlies most implementation
problems and was characterized by:                   (a) the two-tier structure, wherein the
federal project unit had insufficient authority over and was out of touch
with project implemention a t the provincial level; (b) lack of sustained
technical competence a t the provincial level; and (c) lack of i n t e r e s t i n
addressing problems occurring within the agricultural components on the part
of provincial education s t a f f i n charge of implementation,

                   Delayed site acquisition and poor site preparation (including
inattention t o essential infrastructure), architectural designs based on the
principle of c l a s s rotation where c l a s s rotation was not customary o r t h a t
responded more t o aesthetics than t o the exigencies of the local climate o r
the local construction capacity, poor quality construction and numerous
departures from project content, and even misappropriation of project funds,
a l l point toward the l a x supervision t h a t characterized project implementa-
tion,        One serious departure, i n the case of a teacher training i n s t i t u t e
which was not b u i l t according t o specifications i n terms of design o r
construction standards, was not uncovered u n t i l the project completion
mission, because no supervision mission had hitherto visited the site,

Results

                   Project r e s u l t s have been generally poor.    Although physical
f a c i l i t i e s w e r e b u i l t , usable area is less than anticipated, quality of
construction is often substandard and furniture and equipment were not
procured a s specified.                  Fellowships provided through the project successfully
strengthened university s t a f f , but other technical assistance o r capacity
building aspects were not implemented a s designed.                  Because class rotation
was not being practiced, specialized rooms a t the TTIs were being used a s
classrooms.           This plus the absence of water, e l e c t r i c i t y and/or gas hookup
and the i n a b i l i t y o r unwillingness on the part of instructors t o use
specialized equipment, indicated that the q u a l i t y of s c i e n t i f i c and technical
education f o r teachers had not improved much.                 Although the AT1 curriculum
has been improved, the implementation of the curriculum, and especially of
practical work, has been neglected.                   Inadequate remuneration and, i n some
cases, the remote locations of and poor living conditions a t some of the ATIs
made it d i f f i c u l t t o a t t r a c t and retain qualified s t a f f . Thus, t h e improve-
ments i n middle level agricultural s t a f f quality which were t o r e s u l t from
t h i s project have not materialized.                On a more positive note, e f f e c t i v e
upgrading of s t a f f and programs a t the agricultural university suggests an
improvement t o upper level agricultural personnel f o r the Sind province.

                  A t the time of project completion, enrollment a t project TTIs was
about 78 percent of appraisal expectations.                             This underenrollment was mainly
attributable t o excess capacity (caused by inaccurate estimates a t appraisal
of teaching stock and future demand) and a rigid area-quota system which did
not allow vacant s e a t s t o be f i l l e d with students from other areas.                             Never-
theless, the f a c t that two-thirds of the teacher trainees were female and
that the graduates of the r u r a l TTIs readily found teaching positions                                   .
indicated that the project was achieving some of its equity objectives

Sust a i n a b i l it v

                  Although most project i n s t i t u t i o n s were functioning, t h e i r a b i l i t y
t o provide quality education over the long term was being adversely affected
by a number of factors.                    Inadequate budgets f o r maintenance meant t h a t t h e
general physical plant, which, i n some cases was of questionable quality t o
s t a r t with, was deteriorating further.                       Absence of a strong policy a t the
provincial level supporting agricultural training and ensuring adequate
remuneration f o r teaching s t a f f undermined the potential dynamism, and
therefore quality, of education available a t the ATIs.                             Efforts t o strengthen
the curriculum of primary and middle level teacher education have not been
supported with functional l i b r a r i e s and laboratories; thus, chalk and t a l k
teaching methods prevail.

Findings and Lessons

                  The project was characterized by the diversity of its objectives,
the dispersion of its i n s t i t u t i o n s and the decentralization of its implemen-
t a t i o n arrangements, and t o a great extent these features determined t h e
problems experienced by the project.                          If the project had focussed on e i t h e r
basic o r agricultural education and had a federal project unit with
s u f f i c i e n t managerial capacity and authority, the control over the course of
the project and consequently project outcomes might have been better.

                   The project a l s o demonstrates the impact of government policy on
project outcomes.                Inadequate incentives f o r teachers have kept t h e ATIs and
the TTIs from being f u l l y staffed and were a l s o i n i t i a l l y a factor i n the
underenrollment of the TTIs.                    A r e s t r i c t i v e admissions policy, based on an
area-quota system, still delimits enrollment of the TTIs, while a degree of
apathy on the part of provincial agricultural authorities has fostered a
slower growth of AT1 enrollment than anticipated.                              Local Advisory Committees
which were t o support the ATIs, never functioned effectively because the
commitment needed t o organize them never existed.

                   Other point of i n t e r e s t include:

          (a)      the d i f f i c u l t y of enforcing covenants--concerning           r e s t r i c t i n g
                   enrollments t o universities o r maintaining a system of t r a c e r
                   studies--once          the project has been completed (Agricultural
                   Education PCR, paras. 4.23 and 6.6);

(b) the need not t o expect the transformation of any established
    institution, i n t h i s case, an agricultural university, within the
    context of a single five-year project (Agricultural Education PCR,
    paras. 6.2-6.3);

(c) the need to synchronize s t a f f training programs with the provision
    of counterpart services t o ensure maximum impact (Agricultural
    Education PCR, para. 6.4);

(d) the need for architectural specifications and worksheets t o be
    explicit and reflect closely local climatic conditions (Basic
    Education PCR, paras. 4.3 1-4.32) ; and

(e) the need to allocate sufficient time and technical personnel t o
    supervise implementation, particularly where project s i t e s a r e
    scattered, administrative authority is diffuse, and the capacity of
    local l i n e agencies is uncertain (Basic Education PCR, para.
    4.40-4.41).

1.1      The agriculture-re1ated components of the project as    appraised   in
1975/76 aimed   at improving the quality of high level agricultural manpower
in Sind and Baluchistan  provinces    and  increasing both   the quality    and
numbers  of trained middle-level agricultural staff throughout Pakistan. The
component consisted of (a) constructing new services and faci1ities at     Sind
Agricultural  University  and   equipping new facilities at flve Agricultural
Training Institutes in four provinces: (b) providing     technical  assistance
for curriculum   planning  and development, project implementation and staff
development at a11 project-assfsted institutions; and (c) for pre-i nvestment
studies.  The total   project   cost was estimated at USS27.2 million wlth a
credit amount of USSl5.O million. The total cost of the agriculture-related
components was about USS12 mi 11 ion, accounting for about USS7 million of the
credit.

1.2      The project as  designed    was  highly  relevant  to the   needs   of
agricultural  education  and   training   in Pakistan.   Implenrentation of the
project extended over seven years,    one and    one-half years   longer than
planned.  The  moderate  delay was     caused mainly by problems early in the
project connected wlth late appointment of    personnel,  problems over    some
sites and shortages of building materials.

1.3      Procurement  of  goods   and   services was   undertaken according to
acceptable procedures, though wlth some delays. There were some deficiencies
in the design    and construction of the civi1 works components but they are
not expected in the longer term to affect significantly the overall    quality
of  the project   achievements.   However,   some deficiencies could have been
                   tngs
avoided if there  h d  been more     stringent  and  qualified  inspection of
architectural  draw      at  the    approval  stage.  Financial provision for
maintenance by the provincial governments is adequate, but action    needs   to
be taken to implement maintenance which
                                 -         is overdue on buildings constructed
early in the project period.

1.4      The project was implemented   with  a cost    over-run  in  terms of
Pakistan  rupees  caused by higher than anticipated inflation. However, this
was more than compensated for by the progressive weakening      of  the rupee
against the dollar and it is estimated that there -will be a saving of about
20% in the total credit.

1.5      The  Impact of   the technical     assistance program,      comprising
specialist  services and fellowships, has been satisfactory except for some
weaknesses  in the pre-investment surveys. Speciali sts were    we1 1-qua1ified
and  in general   performed  competently. .The fellowship progranme was we1 1
implemented, although the time spent abroad was longer than planned for SAU
fellows;  the majority of them have now returned to posts in the university.
In the case of short-term fellowships for AT1    personnel,  however,   several
fellows who   received   training    in teaching have been transferred back to
field assignments.

1.6      The educational impact of the project has been    positive.   Although
the anticipated improvements in quality of teaching programs have not yet
been achieved, the base from which the improvement can develop has now     been
established.  However,  a greater     degree of   commitment  requires to be
demonstrated by  the provincia1     agricultural  authorities to the proper
staffing of their training institutions.

2.1      This completion report on the agricultural components of the Third
Education Project (Credit 678-PAK) was prepared by an FAOICP mission
comprising P. Bagshaw (Agricultural Training Consultant) and H. Dequin
(Agricultural Economist), which' visited Pakistan 7   -  30 May 1984. The
mission visited all six locations on which civil works had been executed,
being the Sind Agricultural University       (SAU), Hyderabad,     and   the
Agricultural Training Institutes (ATIs) at Sarghoda and Rahim-Yar-Khan
(Punjab Province), Peshawar (North-West Frontier Province), Sakrand (Sind
Province) and Quetta (Baluchistan Province). The mission held discussions
with the SAU Vice-Chancellor and AT1 Principals together with their staffs
and inspected all project provided facilities; with the Secretaries of
Agriculture or their representatives in the provincial capitals of Lahore,
Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi; with       the Vice-Chancellor of Faisalabad
Agricultural University (FAU); with the       Chairman   of   the   Pakistar
Agricultural Research Council and the Planning and Development Officer of
the University Grants Commission, in Islamabad. Interviews were held with
farmers and students and concerned officials at all levels. The mission also
used information obtained from reports and records of the World Bank, the
Federal Project Coordinating Unit of the project (FCU) and all Provincial
Project Implementation Units (PPIUs).


                          111.  PROJECT BACKGROUND



Sector Settinq


3.1      The green revolution of the late sixties and early seventies
checked the years of famine and emergency of the previous decade. The
appropriate technologies for that revolution came from the institutes of
research and education in Pakistan and abroad. An earlier WB education
project (Credit 50-PAK, 1964) had helped in this by assisting    Faisalabad
(then Lyallpur) Agricultural University (FAU) to improve the qua1ity of
education and satisfy the high-level manpower requirements of Punjab
province. The success of that project led to consideration of the situation
at Sind Agricultural University, the only other agricultural university in
Pakistan in the seventies, which was to provide manpower for both Sind and
Baluchistan provinces. SAU was huch behind FAU in size and standard of
facilities, faculty and programme.

3.2      A WB Agricultural Sector Survey Mission in 1975 had identified
weaknesses in extension services, particularly in practical aspects at field
level and especially in irrigated agriculture and water management systems,
which were partly attributed to shortcomings in the quality of agricultural
education and training.

3.3         A t that time also, the Integrated Rural Development programne                           was
considered         a   principal    i n s t i t u t i o n       of.      development     that   rzquired
considerable additional numbers o f middle-level agricultural technicians                             i n
a l l  provinces t o help raise the quality of l i f e i n village comnunities. The
IRDP need swelled the estimated t o t a l requirement of                         technicians   over  the
following decade t o 19,000.        The only sources t o provide these were the f i v e
existing ATIs with a combined annual output of 250.

3.4          Pakistan i n 1984 has some 90 m i l 1ion inhabitants, 75%o f                      whom  are
dependent on agriculture. Wheat and paddy are the                            staple crops, with cotton
and sugar cane        as   important   cash        crops.           F r u i t trees   are   economically
important      i n some areas and livestock production i n others. Agriculture i s
the single largest sector o f the country's economy, accounting f o r about 30%
of 6DP, employing about 55%o f the t o t a l labour force and providing some 70%
o f  export      earnings.    After   high annual                growth       rates   of   about  6% i n
agricultural production i n the sixties, growth slowed down i n the seventies,
due t o bad weather but also p o l i t i c a l unrest. After about 1979, agricultural
production growth          rates  improved,           again reaching 6% i n 1982/83; also the
1983/84 crop was        good. As a result, Pakistan has been a net grain                        exporter
f o r .-he l a s t three years.

3.5          Since the mid-1970s,     increases i n agricultural output have been the
result of acreage increases,          with       only         s l i g h t   upward   trends   i n yield.
Paddy/rice        and cotton yields        have grown only slowly. Wheat has been the
exception and average yields have increased substantially: i n 1982/83 by                             as
much as       3.4%. Average wheat and r i c e yields i n 1984 are about 1.8 tons/ha.
However, there i s plenty o f s'cope for further y i e l d increases, especially i n
wheat,    f o r    which 2-2.5  tons/ha are obtained i n Canada and USA and 3.5 tons
i n Europe, emphasizing the need for               more efforts               t o  promote   production,
including improvements i n agricultural extension.


Project Generation

3.6          This project was WB's second               lending operation              i n Pakistan f o r
agricultural        education (para 3.1).         It was identified in an Education Sector
Survey carried out by UNESCO/CP i n December 1973,                              prepared   by  GOP with
UNESCO assistance i n 1974/75 and appralsed by WB i n Apri 1 1975. Negotiations
were completed I n December 1976 and Board approval given                            i n January   1977.
The Credit         Agreement was    signed i n February 1977 and became effective i n
July 1977 with a planned completion date o f 31 December 1982.

                        IV.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION



Overview

4.1      The  project   was closed on September 25, 1984, with 77,
percent     of  the Credit   of  USS1S.O  million    disbursed.&/  Delays   in
impler#ntation resulted   in the extension of the closing date byi.75   years.
Escalating  infl.ation necessitated  an   increase   In    the   contingencies
allowances,  especially  for civil works, but th?s was more than balanced in
dollar terms by progressive devaluation of the Pakistan rupee.    The effects
of  these factors on the expenditures relating only to the agricultural
components of the project, could not be determined precisely because much of
the accounting work done   during implementation did not dl stinguish between
basic and agricultural components.

4.2      The technical  assistance  provi sion was   implemented   broadly  as
planned  a1though 25%   fewer  staff-months  of   specia1 ists'  services were
considered by GOP to be sufficient for the purpose. Additional savings were
generated  by  using  local  instead  of   international consultants for some
special studies. The fellowship programme achieved   its objectives,    though
with a considerable increase over the planned amounts in the time allocation
to individual fellowships. To cover this overrun, some of the saving in the
specialists'  servlces provision was    converted,   with   WB  consent,  into
add4tional man-months of fellowships,  resulting   in  the graduate    studies
abroad  of high-level university scientists being   extended to allow them to
complete their programmes.

4.3      The most successful aspect of the project was the increase    in the
teaching  capability  of  SAU,  in  both  physical   and faculty development,
although the benefits  of  that  increase  have yet    to mature.    The most
disappointing  aspect has been the slowness of the ATIs to take advantage of
the opportunities created by the provisions of the project.

4.4      In general the delegation   of  authority   to  PPIUs worked    well,
although  the FCU,   having  mainly a coordinating role and therefore little
direct authority, had at times a less-than-sufficient influence    on  project
evolution.  Some  problems  a1so arose   because,   a1though the agricultural
components were   the operational   responsibility   of  the   Secretaries of
Agriculture,  the PPIUs were    responsible to the Secretaries of Education.
Arising out of this dichotomy, there was some tendency for    the  agricutural
authorities  to consider   the  project  not  of   their o\:n making and they
therefore lacked full committment to its success.

4.5      Overall, the implementation of   the physical     objectives of   the
project  has by and large been achieved, though with a modest delay in time.
The operttional outcomes are dealt with in a later chapter.


Credit Effectiveness

4.6      Conditions  of  effectiveness were (a) the establishment of special
revolving funds in each province; and (b) conclusion   of   an  agreement  for
specialist  services  at  SAU with   an institution acceptable to IDA. These
conditions were met and the credit was declared effective on 6 July      1977.
During  negotiations  GOP  also agreed to (a) establish a project monitoring
system; (b) prepare an educational development plan for SAU and    freeze  the

1/   Date was updated after the Closing Date (and after the report was completed.)

level of. enrollment    until  the plan had been discussed with IDA; and (c)
establish an Advisory Committee for each ATI. These aspects are   dealt   with
later in this PCR.


Project Management

4.7      Operational management of the project was almost   entirely   in the
hands of    the   Provincial  Project Directors of the four PPIUs,   who were
appointed fuT1-time to project dut1.e~.They were assisted by   support   teams
and  had  direct   authority over the bulk of the project funds; these were
allocated through the normal GOP process of annual budget   allocations   made
in accordance with long-term project implementation plans (known as P.C.l)
approved in advance by the provinces' Planning and 'Development Comnissions.
These implementation plans were based on and incorporated all the provisions
and conditions of the Project Appraisal Report.

4.8      At Federal Level the officer nominated as Overall Project   Director
was an Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Education having a full range
of duties besides the project. The Deputy Director of   FCU,  also  a   senior
officer of the Ministry, was engaged more or less full-time and handled the
day-to-day   business  of  the project .' He   was  ass1sted   by   full-time
agricultural, accounting and administration officers. However, while the FCU
had an important role in liaison, guidance and monitoring, and in   effecting
reimbursements, it had 1 ittle control over implementation, especia1 ly of the
physical aspects of the project.

4.9      Monitoring was particularly hampered by the autonomous character of
the provinces and the PPIUs in that requests and proposals of the FCU were
frequently not followed, for    Instance:  to  use  the  remainder  of   funds
available when   project   completion time was nearing; to submit regularly
progress reports; to prepare data for       the  supervision and   completion
missions.  While   all  accounting work for reimbursement procedures seems to
have been handled   on  time  and  records  correctly  kept,  monitoring  was
inadequate and the FCU did not have a clear picture of project progress. The
FCU did not therefore have the necessary basic information to enable    it  to
act  as  a progress chaser    either of    the physical components or of the
institution building aspects. Also, the personnel of the FCU   did  not   have
the dynamism to over-ride     these problems. The role of the FCU in project
leadership was therefore somewhat ineffectual, caused     by  a  Compound   of
procedu.ra1 difficulties and complacent management.

-
Sites

4.10     Sites at SAU and   at Sarghoda and Sakrand ATIs were well chosen   at
appraisal. There were problems with other AT1 sites as follows:

      a) At   Rahim-Yar-Khan,  prolonged  litigation over an area for student
         practice contiguous to the existing campus, led to the development
         of an alternative area for crop and animal husbandry practice   8 km
         away, on which    stables and   a poultry   house were   built.  The
         litigation was eventually concluded in favour of the AT1 and the 6
         ha area thus acquired on the main campus is   sufficient  for  crop-
         oriented   practice. Because of this, and with the added factor that
         1 lvestock assistant training is done  entirely  separately  by  the
         Department of Animal Husbandry, the 8 km distant complex, now used
         for livestock teaching only,   haslrof   been  fully  developed  and
         appears isolated and little used. -

 -   -

 -1/ The Borrower notes that the site was shifted upon advice from the World
     Bank, and that, in fact, is still under litigation (see Attachment 11,
     page 111).

      b) At Quetta, changes    in  urban  zoning  in   late  1977  necessitated
         selection   of   a  new  site  for the ATI, with some loss of time in
         acquiring legal title. The new site of 11 ha is well situated about
         5   km  from   the  town  centre on a main connnunicatfon route, well-
         drained and fully irrigable, with adequate tube-well water.

         At Peshawar, urban development    including   hospital  buildings  has
         closed   round   the  chosen  site,  here classroom bui ldings already
         existed. For associated health and sanitation     reasons,  the  newly
                                                                               '

         erected   cowshed   and  poultry  housing- could not be used for their
          intended purpose and have been   diverted   to  other  Department  of
         Agriculture    uses;  no  replacement  faci1 ities  have been provided
          (para 6.23ff).  Also, there is no land at   the  AT1  site  for  crop
         de~nstrations although,      since  1983, 1.5 ha of irrigated land at
         the nearby Agricultural University farm has been made available. It
          is  interesting   to  note  that  a  WB   Issues Paper of 30 May 1975
         discussed the relocation of the AT1 to Pir Sabaj,     adjacent  to  an
         existing   agricultural research station. The reasons    for retaining
         the urban site were not no'?ed  in the file.



Construction and Maintenance

4.11     All goods and services required for the civil works were     procured,
except  as   WB   had   otherwise agreed, under procedures consistent with the
Guidelines for   Procurement   for  WB  loans  and   credits.  During  detailed
planning   and  design,   local committees were specially formed to advise the
project. Some changes to drawings prepared by the contracted architects were
demanded   by  WB  architects   during  supervision   missions (in one case the
complete redesign of a student hostel).

4.12     A general observation was that    the  association of    WB  with  the
project   seemed to have encouraged the architects to produce designs more to
attract the eye than to serve functionally. In many     cases,  communal  rooms
and  staff   houses   become excessively hot in summer because of low ceilings
and lack of verandah-shade and ventilation. Extra fans     and  desert  coolers
have  had to be installed. Probably many areas of internal circulating space
would. have been better div-lrted to external  verandah-type   access.  Project
buildings   were  in   sharp  contrast  to  the  more   conventionally designed
functional buildings of simpler appearance which were to be seen nearby     and
which  were   more   in  keeping with the agricultural environment. Cases were
observed where odd-shaped rooms and curved walls had     proved  too  difficult
for  local   contractors   to execute properly  resulting in uneven appearance
and water penetration. One terrace of staff houses     at  Peshawar,  evidently
intended   to  have   a fortress-like appearance similar to 'hat seen in local
historical buildings, incorporated a circular water tank on the front of the
upper story of the house: in all cases inspected, water was leaking from the
tanks, through ?he ceilings and down the inside walls of the houses.

4.13      At the ATIs penetration of water into buildings was also caused    by
inadequate protection above and around windows. The designs of livestock and
poultry housing generally showed lack of appreciation for     the  requirements
of  animals and significant structural modifications have had to be effected
to make them usable. Staff houses have not turned out to be     the  attraction
andoadditional incentive to staff that was intended, due both to poor design
and to the fact that some nouses are 30% less     an the floor area officially
allocated   to the particular grade of officer.-Another design problem common
                                                lh
to  all   ATIs  was   the  over-generous  provision   of  dining  and   kitchen
-11 According to the Borrower, staff housing did conform to state standards and
    and specifications (see Attachment 11, page 111).

 facilities..  International     space-per-student standards were presumably used
 to arrive at the size of facilities required, but these            standards   did  not
 take  account   of  the situation in many Asian countries including Pakistan,
 where student stipends are awarded in cash to cover boarding costs.             Instead
 of  having   the  institute provide the meals in a formal manner, small loch1
 contractors are hired to provide the food. This they do with             a  minimum  of
 space requirement    for preparation: furthermore many students take the food
 to their rooms, or consume it outdoors and do not therefore use             the  dining
 facilities.   In the ATIs, less than 30% of the space provided for dining and
 kitchen was being used regularly. At           Sakrand, the original    design  of  the
 student   hostel had incorporated a bathroom en-suite with each 4-bed student
 room. Only after building had started was the            decision  made   to  build  an
 entirely   separate bathroom block. Each student room therefore sti1 1          has the
 original bathroom space annexed to it. Also the furniture of these rooms was
 not  we1 1  planned,  because i tems provided actual :y take up over 80% of the
 area of the rather odd-shaped floor space. This impossible            circumstance   is
 alleviated   by moving wardrobe cupboards into the bathroom space and placing
 tables on the verandahs.    Even        so,   the  rooms   are  still   congested  with
 furniture.

 4.14      While  these faults have caused considera2le irritation and adverse
 comnent, have been expensive tcs rectify and have caused           delays   in  project
 implementation,   they have not militated against the.eventua1 success of the
 project in any significant manner. Delays in project implementation             started
 early,  due to late establishment of the PPIUs.            Subsequent delaying factors
 have been site problems (para 4.10 ). country-wide shortage             of  cement  for
 long  periods,   and  disputes        with    building   contractors  over   escalating
 material costs. In Quetta there were design changes initiated by supervision
 missions   and  problems  with contractors: there is now a race to finish the
 civil works before the completion date and students will be admitted only in
 late  1984. In Peshawar there was delay after the previous Project Director
 absconded when an official enquiry into a1 leged misuse of           provincial   funds
 was  initiated.   In  general,        frequent    changes   of  project   directors and
 supervising engineers in the PPIUs (except in            Sind)  resulted   in  loss  of
 continuity and consequent delay in following-up problems.

 4.15      Although  only  recently          completed,   some buildings show premature
 signs of needing repair, for instance the water damage            referred   to  above;
 also  incorrect   slope on      outside pathways resulting in permanent flooding
 during the rainy season and       consequent      softening   and  crumbling   of  wall
 plaster;   septic  tanks  seem to be of insufficient capacity; doors of cheap
 plywood not properly painted have warped           and   split.  In  all   ATIs,  other
 complaints   were  received     from the staff which were born out by inspection
 during the mission. Generally speaking, government buildings are             reasonably
 maintained,   but  in the case of project buildings, maintenance work has not
 started, as the buildings are         considered    too   new  to  need   it.  However,
 maintenance   is urgently required to rectify faults in order to minimise the
 deterioration. 1/

 EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE

 4.16      In general.   furniture and equipment for ATIs has been procured in
 accordance with master lists which were compiled by FCU in consultation with
 the   AT1    principals.    officers          of  the  departqents   of  education   and
 agriculture, and speclalists appointed by the project. However.              some  lists
 were  changed   by  unllateral          decision   of  AT1   staff;  that   of  Sarghoda
 particularly soZ1Four of the five ATIs show            significant   under-procurement.
 This was most extreme at Peshawar, caused by the absconded Project Director
 who overspent on bullding contracts (about which             corruption   investigations
       in  process) and had only small funds left for furniture and equipment.
,are

 11 The Borrower notes that the responsibility for repairs rests with the state
     level Building Department (see Attachment 11, page 111).
 -
 21 The Borrower notes that purchases for the Sargodha Institute were made in
     accordance with the approved l i s t . The apparent unkgrocurement witnessed
     by the PCR team was r e c t i f i e d i n 1985 when the remaining items were purchased
     and installed (see Attachment 11, page 111).

subsequent efforts by a supervision mission to a1 leviate the situation       were
hindered  by  the   obstinate    attitude   of  the AT1 Principal over problems
relating  to certain relatively        insignificant  items   of  furniture    and
equipment.  Some   equipment    items   included  in the lists for International
Competitive Bidding would have cost much      less  if  purchased   locally   (for
instance   glass   preserving    jars   and  electric  irons   at  US$lD   and  60
respectively compared with US$2 and 10 equivalent local costs). At the ATIs,
because  of lack of enthusiasm on the part of staff and reduced       emphasis on
practical work generally, a considerable amount of the equipment       remains in
the packing cases.

4.17     At  SAU    some problems arose concerning equipment which could have
been avoided if the Technical Assistance programme had       been  timed   better.
The  lists  of   equipment for procurement under the project were prepared by
the senior faculty staff shortly after the start of      the   project.   In  most
cases  these were the staff who were awarded the fellowships and whose ideas
about relevant equipment were drastically changed as a result of       fellowship
study  abroad. l/I f  1 i sts of  basic   equipment  cou1d have been prepared by
curriculum planner (described      later  in  para  6.4) and    a  provision   for
specialist  equipment      left open   until  the  return of the fellows, a more
relevant equipment inventory would have resulted. Eventually, SAU used        more
than the originally allocated funds for furniture and equipment. Many items,
notably heavy ~orkshopshave not been put into operational condition, mostly
because  the items arrived after the departure of the specialist and none of
the regular faculty has the practical ability, or apparently much        interest,
to supervise the installation.



Technical Assistance

4.18     Specialis+ Services,       (Table 7).   The proj k t original ly provided
thirteen staff-years of specialht services for SAU,       four   staff-years   for
ATIs   and   eight     staff-years     for pre-investment    studies  related   to
agricultural training.

4.19     At appraisal fifteen specia1i sts were scheduled for SAU, comprising
twelve  subject   matter     specialists  for the   teaching faculties and three
experts in administration and auxilliary services. In the event, five of the
assignments  were    considered    to  be of low priority and were dropped. With
some adjustment in the duration of other assignments, a total of       ten   staff
years  will have been used by the completion date (the only specialist still
serving has been given an extension of contract for six      months   beyond   the
completion date     of the project, but that extension has not been counted in
this PCR). The saving of three staff-years was diverted, with       WB  approval,
to extend the study period abroad of some SAU fellowships.2_/


-
11 The Borrower subscribes to this view (see Attachment I, pages 107-110).

-
2/  The Borrower notes that effective utilization of the specialists was
    diminished by the poorly synchronized timing of (a) counterparts with
    experts and (b) arrival of laboratory equipment (see Attachment I,
    pages 107-110).

4.20        The provision of two specialists for two years each, to organise
and develop courses for ATIs (including compiling of equipment lists), was
used for assignments of only twelve and sixteen months respectively, total
28 staff-months. Both specialists were recruited concurrently and more than
3 years after effectiveness date whereas at least one had been planned       for
the start of the project.         Their contribution was a valuable factor in
achieving project objectives, but their late recruitment and overlapping
terms of reference reduced their effectiveness somewhat and resulted in late
procurement of equigment. Ne'ther draft terms of reference nor guidance as
to the respective functions of the s~ecielistswere,given in the project
appraisal report and the FCU did not have sufficient expertise to draft the
TOR effectively.

4.21       A pre-investment study on Irrigation and Water Management Training
was planned to require 5 staff-years of foreign specialist services and was
intended to result in the formulation of feasible programmes of investment
and development. Under pressure from GOP this study was performed         by    a
national    university professor for a fixed honorarium equivalent to about 10
months of a senior national officer's salary (or one month of foreign expert
cost).    The resulting report was very verbose and made recommendations
heavily weighted towards the development of the author's own institution. It
was not widely read, had         little impact and    did not result in further
investment. A study on middle-level     agricultural manpower for which     1.5
years of specialist services were provided, was carried out by a UNESCO
consultant in only three months. The resultant report was considered too
narrow      in scope and the Department of Development Studies of NWFP
Agricultural University was contracted to expand        the study for a fee
equivalent to three months of specialist services. The revised report was
accepted by WB in Apri 1 1984.


4.22        Fellowships (Table 8).Three years of fellowships were provided for
th AT1 programme and 57 years for SAU. For the ATIs, 3.5 rim-years and for
SAU, 70.5     man-years were actually used.     The excess of man-years of
fellowships was set against the saving in specialist services     (para 4.19).
The AT1 fellowships provided 3-month duration overseas training      in subject
matter teaching, for 14 AT1 teachers. Under the SAU programme, five fellows
attended MSc      and  14 attended PhD programmes overseas. However, whereas 24
and 36 months for MSc and PhD respectively were provided for, the average
periods actually taken were 27 and 51 months r e ~ ~ e c t i v e l ~ . ~fellows
                                                                        ~ ~ o u r
returned without qualifying and two who successfully completed 5-year PhD
programmes     in 1983 have not yet returned to Pakistan. The remainder have
rejoined the faculties at SAU or are expected to return soon.        Seven SAU
administrative and auxilliary staff also received short-term fellowships,
tot?.l1 i ng two man-years.


Covenants

4.23        Covenants provided for in the Credit Agreement (CA) relating to
agricultural components were fulfilled except that:

-I/ According to the Borrower's comments (Attachment I, pages 107-110) six
    were trained at the MSc and thirteen at the PhD levels, respectively.

      a) Under Section 3.07 of the CA, the required tracer system to collect
          information on the career of graduates after completion of training
          is operating for ATIs, but not for SAU.   Also,   GOP  has made    no
         provision for continuing the AT1       tracer study after FCU ceases
         operation on completion of the project.   This   study  has made    an
          interesting start and needs to be continued after the project. That
          intention was evidently implied in the covenant.

       b) Under Section 3.09 of the CA, the AT1 advisory connittees    are not
          yet in effective operation (para 6.14).

       c) Under Section 3.12 of the CA, studies referred to (para 4.21) were
          submitted considerably 1ater than agreed.


Supervision


4.24      The project was supervised   throughout  as an    entity,  basic    and
agricultural education    components   together.   Ten WE supervision mi sslons
                                                      '

(counting two visits in May    and  June  of  1979 as one     mission)  visited
Pakistan during the 7-year disbursement period at an average interval of 8.5
months and a range of   3 to    14 months.   The   average  duration of   visit
(a1lowing estimated dlseounts      for misslons engaged concurrently on other
projects) was 2 weeks. One mlsslon was of an architect only,      three of     an
educator    only  and  six of    both  architect   and educator.   A  total   of
approximately 33 man-weeks were spent in the field     on  supervision of     the
project .
4.25      The supervision mi ssions were particularly effective in promoting
liaison between the FCU and the    PPIUs.  The  later missions    also gave     a
significant   Impetus towards achieving the project's educational objectives,
especially concerning the AT1 programme. If earlier missions had     been  more
stringent   In their    inspection  cf architectural drawings and had referred
them to experienced agrlcultural architects, some errors which     have  proved
costly to rectify could have been avoided.


Performance of Architects and Contractors &/


4-26      The agricultural    designs  for ATIs were done by different private
firms. Though locally based and highly qualified, the designs they     produced
did   not seem well adapted to the extremes of local climate, particularly in
regards to keeping out heavy rain and preventing the build up     of  excessive
heat.   Subsequent approval    and supervision was done by Government-employed
architects in the provinces. Unfortunately, 1ittle criticism was evident      at
the   approval  stage. The number of contractors used varied widely from site
to site, from one only at Quetta to fourteen at Sarghoda. Project     Directors
reported   good  cooperation   with  contractors, including agreements to make
amendments and    additions   during  the   liability    period.   A   possible
disadvantage   of employing    only  one  contractor could    be  seen  in the
circumstances already reported at Peshawar, where the cooperation between
Project Director and Contractor was perhaps too close. After the problem was
brought to light, four other contractors finished the contracts there.

-11 Architect of the Building Depariment,and that contractswere awarded to
    The Borrower notes that, in Pun ab, the design was approved by the Chief

    several contractors and were supervised by the Building Department (see ..
   Attachment 11, page 112).

                       V.   PROJECT CCSTS AND FINANCING



5.1      The base cost estimates for the whole project, comprising both
basic and agricultural education compcnents as well              as pre-investment
studies, amounted to PRs186.7 million or USg18.9 million at appraisal. With
contingencies added, the tc:al    was PRs269.8 mi 1 l ion o r USj27.2 mi 1 1 ion. The
WB credit of US$15.0 mi 1 1 ion was to meet 100% of foreign exchange costs and
24% of local costs. The GOP was to finance the remaining US$12.2 million.

5.2      Within this total, the physical       facilities of the agricul'tural
components were estimated to cost, with contingencies, PRs94.5 million or
US89.5 million (Table 1). Adding PRs24.0 million for technical            assistance
(specialist services and fellowships) and agriculture-related pre-investment
studies; and PRs5.O million for Project Management (one-third of the total
project management cost, pro-rated on the basis of the number of sites to be
supervised), we arrive at the total cost of the project components related
to agriculture, which amounts to about PRs123.5 million or US812.5 million.
(at appraisal, the conversion quoted was         PRs9.9   =   US$1.0,   although a
marginally  different rate was used in some of the tables). By pro-rating
this to the total credit of          US$i5  million, the       agriculture-related
components account for about US87 million of credit.

5.3      According to the statements received by the mission from the four
PPIUs, an amount of PRs100.3 million of total project costs had              actually
been expended for those same physical facilities referred to in para 5.2,
which had been estimated at appraisal to ccst PRs94.5.        This was the only
direct comparison between estimated and actual costs that the mission was
able to make.


5.4      Actual  disbursements were slow (Table 6),            due to the various
project delays. After two years only 8% and after 4 years, 28% of the total
credit had   been  spent. At the original full duration of the project in
December 1982, only 50% of the loan had been spent. At Closing Date (09/25/84)

US$11.52million (PRs126.5million at an assumed average rate of PRsll per US$) or 77%

of the estimated total credit of USB15.0 million, had been reimbursed by the
World Bank, of which about US84.9 mill ion or PRs54 mil 1 ion was for the
agriculture related components. The reimbursements for the agriculture-
related components of the project stood, therefore, at 70% of the a1location
of US$7 million.

5.5      At   appraisal it was estimated that the cost of university
construction in Tandojam would be PRs1,040 or US$105         per m2.    The actual
costs were PRs1,366 to 1,965 per m2 (Table 3) or US$125-178 at the assumed
average rate of P ~ s l l p e r ~ ~For ~
                                   S . the ATIs the average rates are slightly
lower.  It is estimated that current construction costs in Pakistan are
Rs1,800 to 2,200 per m2.


-
11  The cost overrun was abosorbed by the University, which in turn affected
    the implementation of non-project works.     See the Borrower's comments in
    Attachment I, pages 107-110).

    Introduction

   6.1        The  agricultural   components  of   the project were intended (a) to
'  complement the progress achieved in agricultural education at FAU under       the
   First    Education  Project by a comparable improvement at SAU, and thus cater
   for the needs of professional agricultural      manpower   in  the  provinces  of
   Punjab,    Sind  and Baluchistan (the last-named having a quota of students at
   SAU) and (b) by supporting the existing ATIs, to provide larger       numbers  of
   better    trained  middle-level   agricultural   technicians to serve as support
   staff for the professionals. In addition, studies were to be carried out       to
   clarify    the  possijle   need  for further project activities in agricultural
   education and training.


   Sind Agricultural Universit.1


   6.2        Before the project, SAU was little   more    than  a  diploma-awardtng
   post-secondary    agricultural   school. As a result both of the project and of
   concurrent developmental support from the provincial authorities, there       has
   been    a marked   improvement   in  the capability of the institution to offer
   degree levei courses, In terms of both the physical facilities available for
   teaching and the calibre of t h faculty members.

   6.3        Progress  at  SAU   has  been slower than anticipated, partly due to
   prolonged periods of student unrest (not unique to SAU), partly       to  longer-
   than-planned    periods of education abroad which were needed to reach MSc and
   PhD qualifications and partly to some over-optimism in expecting       a  project
   period    of  five  years   to  be  sufficient   to   bring  about  a fundamental
    improvement in a university, with the inevitable built-in inertia of such an
   institution.

   6.4        Another  effect of the restrictions imposed by planning for a five-
   year project period has been     difficulty   in  synchronizing   the  specialist
   services with     fellowships   for  counterpart   training.   In most cases the
   counterpart was already abroad by the time the specialist       arrived  and  was
   sti 1 1  abroad  when  the   specialist left. In retrospect, it would have been
   more effective if each of the concerned disciplines had       received  early  in
   the    project  period a short, say one to three months visit by a discipline-
   oriented curriculum planner, to-set the teaching programne along       the  right
    I lnes  (including  compilation   of  equipment   1 ists) ; then the longer-term
   scientific specialists could have over-lapped with       the  returning  fellows.
   Also    the  target  periods of 2 and 3 years for MSc and PhD respectively did
   not take realistic account of the restricted educational background       of  the
    intended   fellows.  This   problem  also  resulted in the procurement of some
    irrelevant items of equipment (para 4.17).

   6.5        Overall, however, the technical assistance element (Tables      7 and
   8) was well organised and implemented; it has resulted in lmproved teaching
   programmes and a significant strengthening of subject matter       knowledge  and
   teaching    capabilities. The curricula developed through technical assistance
   are more relevant than before, although more effort and progress are       needed
    if the planned improvements in practical training are to be achieved.

                                   --16 -
6.6      The numbers enrolled at SAU are determined by     factors  which   were
not  affected by the project (e.g.   provincial policy, district quotas, staff
positions available,' non-project bui 1 ding). However, in  accordance  with   a
Credit  Agreement   covenant,  student    enrollments  were  not  permitted   to
escalate sharply and have now stabilised at about 1,700, 20% higher than the
1,400  enrolled   at  the time of appraisal (Table 9). It is the intention of
the university authorities that the numbers should not     be permitted to rise
further  in  the   foreseeable  future, although there is considerable social
pressure to a1 low them to rise. Over the same period    the  number  of  staff
with  university   degrees  has  increased    by  67%  from  105 to 197 and the
proportion with higher degrees has increased     from  34% to   85%;  also   the
teacher-student ratio has strengthened from 1:14 to 1:9 (Table 11).

6.7      Although the benefits of the project have yet to be fully reflected
in the  quality   of  the  graduates,   the   base  from  which  a  significant,
improvement can be achieved has now been established and the benefits should
become progressively more evident over the next five years or so.


Agricultural Training Institutes


6.8      The project has considerably    assisted   in  building  up  the  ATIs
institutionally.   Project activities have brought the ATIs constantly to the
notice of the authorities and project pressure has resulted in the upgrading
of  the  AT1 staff posts (except in Sind Province) and an Improvement of one
grade in the starting pay of AT1 trained government personnel (from Grade      5
to Grade 6) in all provinces.

6.9      Greater  numbers   of  candidates    have  offered  themselves for AT1
courses, enabling selection   to  be  more    stringent,  resulting  in  better
trainees.  Unfortunately however, some alternative careers notably teaching,
offer higher paj scales with shorter training periods. If anomalies such     as
these could be avoided, more and better candidates would apply to the ATIs.l/ -

6.10     Enrollments   in  the  two-year   courses   have  increased  steadily,
although slower than planned (Tablelo). 21 However, by 1986,   when  the  first
class  from  Quetta   is  expected to complete, the appraisal target of 1,280
total ,enrollment and 640 annual output, is likely to be reached.

6.11     The introduction of employment-bonding linked to the award of study
stipends  has  ensured that almost a1 1 trainees initially take up employment
in  the  field  departments.   Some  who   have   broken  the  bond  have  been
successfully  prosecuted in the courts and judgement given for the repayment
of Rs14,000, representing the c6st of training.     Some  staff  do  move  into
agricultural  teaching,   attracted by the higher pay, after serving the bond
period, but this is to the greater good of the agriculture sector, which can
only  profit  by  having teachers with field experience. The increase in the
popularity of AT1 courses has   led  to   discussion   of  the  possibility  of
offering a proportion of places without stipend (and without job guarantee):
if this materialises it should result eventually in     an  inflow  of  trained
agricultural personnel into the private farming sector.

6.12     The failure to build up capable and committed staff cadres has been
the most disappointing aspect of institution-building in the ATls.     Although
the  upgrading  of   posts  has  meant that higher grades of personnel can be
posted to the ATIs (Table 12), this has not changed the reluctance of     staff
to make   the  move to what they regard as a punishment station, even to the
extent that, in some   cases,  direct   orders  to  move  to   ATIs  have  been

disregarded.           A     related outcome                 has  been that    s t a f f have returned from
teacher training overseas (under project fellowships) only t o apply for, and
obtain,       immediate posting back t o the field. These Important constraints on

generous and the number of persons actually engaged has been adequate (Table
13).

6.14         The Advisory Connnittees set up under a covenant of the project have
not      brought        the      expected         institutional benefits t o the ATIs. Attempts t o
convene meetings have failed                         i n a l l   cases.  The   mission was       unable    t o
discover       what         procedure had been adopted I n setting up the comnlttees, but
two factors have dominated t h e i r failure.                       Firstly, the meetings were        t o  be
convened       and chaired by                   the AT1 Principals who however,            were o f a lower
c i v i l service grade than most o f the other officers invited who,                            therefore,
f o r    reasons of            protocol,          could      not   be expected t o respond favourably.
Secondly, no provision was made i n the project                           f o r  payment    of   attendance
expenses, so the members could not attend anyway. It seems probable that the
problem arose because the FCU, which i s part of the Ministry                               o f  Education,
was      instrumental            i n promoting the               committees without obtaining the f u l l
backing and cooperation of the M i n i s t r y of Agriculture o f f i c i a l s who had                    t o
implement the operation. -               11

6.15          I n other matters also, the r i v a l r y between the two ministries seems
t o have hindered the AT1 component, for example i n the lower p r i o r i t y                          given
t o    procurement            o f  equipment            f o r agricultural components, and i n lack of
consultation with agriculturalists i n matters of building design.21                            -

6.16          The intended integration into the ATIs of Stock Assistant                            training
           '

f o r    the Department of Animal Husbandry has been f u l l y achieved only i n Sind
province, (Table 10). I n view o f the traditional professional exclusivity of
veterinarians, the                 tegration was perhaps an over-optimistic expectation i n
the project                         he main operational              consequence      has   been that     the
animal      f a c i l i t i e s    provided          a t   ATIs are over-generous f o r the teaching of
animal husbandry t o general-purpose Field Assistants.

6.17          In-service training and farmer leader                       courses       conducted  by    ATIs
have progressed well i n Punjab and NWFP. I n Sind, recurrent funds as well as
s t a f f enthusiasm have been insufficient t o make a                         start..   Over   the   4-year
period        from          1979/80      t o      1982/83,       Sarghoda   held    30    courses  f o r  960
participants, (less than 4% of them farmers);                             a t   Rahim-Yar-Khan     300    in-
service       trainees           and 900 farmers were reported; and a t Peshawar 240 in-
service and 440 farmers. I n Quefta, where the AT1 w i l l be commissioned l a t e r
i n 1984, a l l Field Assistant training w i l l be in-service t o s t a r t with (para
6.28) and there I s a firm intention t o start                          farmer    training     as  soon    as
possible.

6.18          A    valuable Tracer Study of the dispersal of AT1 trainees has been
carried out by FCU for the courses o f 1979-81 and 1980-82.                                Results   of   the
f i r s t  have       been published                 (Table     14)  show   that    75% are     employed i n
agriculture.            The      results        of      the    second   survey      using     an    improved
questionnaire             are      being       finalised.        As yet, no institutional arrangements
have been made t o carry                 on these             studies  after    the     FCU  dissolves,    as
expected, later i n 1984.

6.19           Peshawar ATI. The c i v i 1 works provided by the project                           a t  Peshawar
comprised          a cowshed,    a poultry house and six staff houses. Because of the
s i t e problem and urban encroachment described i n para 4.10,                               the     AT1 s t i l l
lacks        land and buildings       for      practical livestock work. Consequently the
animal purchases provided f o r i n the project have not been made and related
equipment          already procured     1ies idle. For the Field Assistants, 1ivestock
practical work i s restricted t o infrequent v i s i t s t o nearby Animal Husbandry
Department          farms  where some techniques are demonstrated while the students
themselves only watch.

6.20           The Stock Assistants' class at Peshawar follows                           a much modified
curriculum with only about half of the two-years period spent i n the AT1 and
the other half i n on-job training i n f i e l d support situations and veterjnary
c l i n i c s and farms      under   the     direct      control       o f     the      Animal        Husbandry
Department. The opinion o f the Director of Animal                       Husbandry was                that     the
planned curriculum f o r           stock      assistant    training            a t    the        AT1 would be
acceptable t o him, if only jus:.,            but   i t s implementation was                       so  f u l l  of
problems           (mainly  because o f       lack .of    practical            f a c i l i t i e s )  that     h i s
Department had no option but t o take over                d i r e c t l y   a large              part    of    the
training.

6.21           Crop-oriented     practicals were also very restricted u n t i l about one
year ago, when the ATIobtained the use of 1.5 ha of irrigated land                                       i n one
corner         of    the  nearby   farm     of   the    recently         established               Agricultural
University. The Principal has created a student fund                           t o   pay         f o r contract
ploughing          (the  AT1 has    not     yet    received      any       equipment f o r mechanised
farming) and i n t o which he can pay the               proceeds         of      crop        sales,      thereby
creating some incentive f o r good farm operation and management. It i s t o be
hoped that the authorities w i l l not react against                     t h i s   unofficial            student
fund operation.

6.22        . The Department of Agriculture i n Peshawar has shown a distressing
lack cf support or comnitment f o r the work of the                     ATI.       Even some             of   the
o f f i c e accommodation considered t o be part of the AT1 has been taken over by
the Department i n exchange f o r less favourable accommodation. Also                                  the    AT1
staff,        a l l  of  whom are on deputation from the Department, are transferred
frequently t o s u i t the needs of the f i e l d rather than those o f the ATI.

6.23           Teaching i s also hindered by lack of equipment, because l i t t l e was
procured by the Project Director who absconded (para 4.14 ). There were also
operational and personality problems i n the                 relationship               between the           AT1
Principal          (Ministry o f Agricu 1ture) and the Project Management (Ministry of
Education) which resulted i n more support being given t o                                 basic      education
components than t o the agricultural components as a sort o f sanction against
the ATI.

6.24           A foreseeable eventual operational outcome w i l l                    be        that    the    o l d
classrooms and           offices comprising the AT1 w i l l be absorbed and put t o good
use by an expanding Department of Agriculture, forcing the planning o f a new
AT1 elsewhere           on a much more suitable site. This possibility should be
encouraged and might become a component i n a later WB project.

6.25           Sakrand ATI. The e f f i c i e n t implementation of the                 physical         aspects
at      Sakrand      (supervised   by   the      project   u n i t     i n Hyderabad) throws into
particularly sharp r e l i e f the poor institutional progress. The staff                                 i s of
low calibre and demoralised because, whereas i n a l l other provinces the pay-
scales of AT1 posts were upgraded i n 1983, i n Sind province they                                    were    not.
The        Director-General      of  Agriculture,        Karachi, admitted that some orders
sent t o staff instructing them to transfer t o Sakrand had been disregarded;

  five   teaitling       posts     are s t i l l vacant. Some posts' hhve had t o be f i l l e d by
  applicants who do not wholly f u l f i l the Public             Service      .Commissionls      (PSC)
  requirements        f o r  the    particular      grade.    These,   referred       t o  as "ad-hoc
  appointments" can be made f o r a 6-month               period   on the        authority     of    the
  Secretary      f o r   Agriculture      and     are extendible i n 6-monthly periods by PSC
  approval. Inevitably such appointees are usually                  straight       out    o f  college
  without    f i e l d experience.        To make a bad situation worse, the two "ad-hoc"
  Veterinarians a t AT1 Sakrand had worked f o r one year but as yet had received
  pay f o r   only the f i r s t s i x months, because PSC approval t o t h e i r extension
  had not come through. Lack o f enthusiasm among s t a f f was                  reflected     i n the
  lack   o f trees and shrubs and general development i n the campus area and the
  haphazard way i n which the farm practice area was managed.

  6.26       Budgetary problems are also d i r e c t l y hindering              AT1 operations         a t
  Sakrand,     i n that a) provision o f operating expense i s exceedingly low, only
  PRs175,OOO (US$13,000)           per year for a11 expenses        other       than    salaries    and
  a1lowances:       one     item o f Rs6.000 (USS450) per year for petrol and o i 1, f o r
  both transportation vehicles and farm tractors, i s                 particularly         indicative
  of  the    inadequacy;          b)  The level of student stipend does not a t t r a c t good
  students, being PRs75 per month compared with Rs150 i n Punjab and                         Rs250 i n
  NWFP;   c)     The     240     stipends     available    are   insufficient       t o fill the 320
  available places. The statement by the Director-General of Agriculture                           that

- there would be a sharp increase i n the demand f o r f i e l d assistants due t o an
  expansion of Training and V i s i t s extension, needs t o be matched by                   adequate
  budgetary provision.

  6.27       ATIs       Sarghoda     and Rahim-Yar-Khan. Being both i n Punjab province,
  developments a t these two ATIs are mutually similar and are considerably                            I n
  advance of         other     provinces. Staffing i s reasonably up t o strength and the
  curriculum i s being we11 imp1emented. The curriculum has                      been considerably
  modified from the one prepared by project personnel, by j o i n t i n i t i a t i v e of
  the AT1 s t a f f and the Division of Agricultural Extension of                   FAU,    who    have
  taken over         external      supervision o f the final examinations of these ATIs.
  While the i n i t i a t i v e taken t o advance the c u r r i c u l u ~i s    encouraging,     there
  has  been an unfortunate tendency f o r the changes t o be i n the direction of
  academic rather than practical improvement.y h i 1 flocks of sheep are housed
  a t both ATIs,           but    no   cattle, buffaloes o r poultry. The animal husbandry
  practice u n i t a t Rahim-Yar-Khan i s isolated             (para 4.10 ).

  6.28       AT1 Quetta.          The Quetta AT1 i s not yet        operational         (para   4.14).
  However,     construction         i s rapidly approaching completion. The s i t e i s we1l-
  drained, a l l i r r i g a b l e and with sufficient tube-well           water,     so   that    good
  practical      instruction w i l l        be possible.       The Secretary of Agriculture i s
  highly enthusiastic about the good use t o which he intends the AT1 t o be put
  and he i s determined t o s t a f f it, adequately.

  6.29       Courses        f o r  Field Assistants        a t Quetta w i l l follow the project-
  prepared two-year curriculum. However, for the foreseeable future, only                           in-
  service    f i e l d assistants w i l l be admitted, because, i n Baluchistan province
  only, they have been recruited i n previous years                    ( f i v e  hundred    i n a l l )
  without    pre-service          training. A small group o f 13 i s already being trained
  as a sort of p i l o t group and it i s intended t o bring i n a large group                   l a t e r
  i n the year when the new buildings have been comissioned. A t present there
  are no plans f o r stock assistant training at the ATI,                  though the      Department
  o f Animal       Husbandry       has   agreed     t o provide livestock instructors f o r the
  Field Assistant courses.

 -1/ The Borrower notes that the curriculum has become more practical (see
     Attachment 11, page 113).

6.30     Conclusions.  The   improvements   in   buildings,   furniture    and
equipment,  and  in  curricula   and  staff development, brought about by the
project, have not yet resulted in a major   improvement  in  the  quality  of
middle-level  agricultural  staff   in  the  government  services.  The major
constraint is the difficuity of attracting good staff who prefer   to  remain
in  the field.l/~hecurriculum itself has been considerably improved, with an
adequate  emphasis. on  practical   work,  but  the  implementation  of   the
curriculum, especially the practical work, leaves much to be desired.



-
11 According to the Borrower, implementation of the practical side of the
   curriculum is hampered by the lack of transportation facilities for field
   trips (see Attachment 11, page 113).

7.1             Project design was appropriate t o meet the need (a) t o improve                                             the
q u a l i t y     of      university        level          agricultural              education      serving        Sind      and
Baluchistan provinces and (b) t o increase the numbers and q u a l i t y of trained
middle-level              agricultural          manpower           t o     s a t i s f y   the  public-sector demand
throughout             Pakistan.       The      project          design          was,      however,       somewhat       over-
optimistic             i n   i t s assumption that the Department o f Animal Husbandry would
be persuaded t o entrust the training o f Livestock Assistants                                              t o   the    ATIs,
under         the     management        o f the Department o f Agriculture. Some problems have
been caused by (a) the two-tier project management a t federal and provincial
levels         and       (b)    ,the   implementation o f                    components        i n the Department o f
Agrlcult u r e by PPIUs owing a1legiance t o the Ministry of Education. However,
these          were       normal      problems          of      management which               were       handled      f a i r l y
competently and, even i n retrospect,the organisation                                         adopted was           probably
the most feasible i n the circumstances.

7.2             During project implementation, v i s i t s o f supervision missions were
instrumental i n maintaining reasonable cooperation between the FCU and                                                     the
PPIUs;         also       i n   the    smooth        general running o f implementation procedures.
Possibly          during        appraisal,          and        certainly           during      e a r l i e r     stages       o f
implementation,               the     u n s u i t a b i l i t y  of     the        proposed     s i t e     f o r  livestock
buildings a t Peshawar AT1 (para 4.10) should                                      have     been recognised.             Also,
more       c r i t i c a l  appraisal        of      architectural drawings could have resulted i n
more functional buildings (para 4.12).

7.3             The inclusion o f an educator i n most                               supervision        missions       had       a
markedly           beneficial         influence on               i n s t i t u t i o n a l development and served t o
encourage the authorities t o work                             towards the educational objectives o f the
project.

7.4             Delays         i n   implementation              were        largely beyond the control o f WB,
except a t Quetta were the delay                          was      p a r t l y     caused     by   WB       insistence        on
radical         redesign          o f  the      student          hostel.           However     the       intervention was
necessary and the benefits deriving from it w i l l much outweigh                                              the    effects
o f    the      delay.        Some     delays        were        caused          by     the   need f o r International
Competitive Bidding, especially when applied t o lcng                                         inventories          o f   small
equipment            items;       also    unnecessarily               high prices were paid for some items
which would have been better obtained locally.

7.5              I n general, it would appear that the range of information and                                          data
provided           i n the        grey-cover         Project         Appraisal            Report     d i d     not    provide
s u f f i c i e n t   guidance. for          the        elaboration              o f    implementation plans                and
documents            by    GOP.      Which other documents were used f o r formulation a t t h a t
stage it i s not now                 possible        t o      determine,             but    certainly         some    o f   the
qualitative aspects dealt with i n the Appraisal Report were never reflected
i n the implementation documents (the P.C.1 's produced by the provincial Govern-
ments). Also the Appraisal Report d i d not give the schedule by item of square-
meters of building construction,                         which had been used t o arrive a t the appraisal's
estimates of c i v i l uorks cost, nor d i d i t contain a l i s t o f the buildings of
various categories that were t o be provided a t each location.                                            These data would
assist the PCR mission.
7.6             The expectation that the Credit would be considerably under-used by
completion had been evident f o r a t least eighteen months before the revised
completiondate. There.is no evidence that either UB or the FCU took any f i r m
action t o determine whether any supplementary provisions,                                       within the general
terms o f the project,                should be made fron the anticipated savings.

                              I II.  CONCLUSIONS   .




8.1       It  is  typical  of  education  projects    that   the   qualitative
improvements   and  institution-building  achievements    only start to become
evident at the time of projett completion and require    many  more  years  to
mature   and  to stand judgement. It is inevitable therefore that conclusions
relating .to qualitative aspects will  be  tentative   and  will  tend  to  be
overshadowed   by  the  more'easily assessed physical achievements of project
implementation.

8.2       The project as designed was highly appropriate to the   agricultural
manpower   training  needs  of  Pakistan.  Those  needs   as formulated during
project preparation and appraisal, have by and large been well reflected    in
the demands for trained agricultural manpower that have actually evolved.

8.3       Project  implementation was considerably delayed in the first three
years following project effectiveness, by late establishment of    the  PPIUs,
problems   over some sites, and shortages of building materials. Since then a
good rate of implementation has been maintained in spite of    further  delays
caused  by   disputes with contractors over building costs, re-design of some
buildings, lack of continuity through changes in key personnel of PPIUs, and
problems   of  coordination arising from FCU weaknesses. The outcome has been
that the physical objectives of the project   have  been   virtually  achieved
quantitatively after a moderate time over-run of 1.5 years.

8.4      The cost of civil works has exceeded the estimated cost in terms of
Pakistan rupees, due to a higher than   estimated  inflation   rate.  However,
progressive   weakening  of the rupee against the U.S.  dollar has reduced the
expendfture in do;lar terms to below the estimated amount. As a    result  the
credit is 1 ikely to be about 20% under-disbursed.

8.5      Some   of  the  architectural  design  work was inadequate; although
supervision missions rectified some inadequacies, others were not identified
until  implemented. Other building defects were caused by inability of local
contractors to implement satisfactorily some rather over-elaborate designs.

8.6      The site of the AT1 at Peshawar was   recognised   by  the  appraisal
'mission as a problem. The decision to develop the existing site turns ou+ in
retrospect to have been a wrong   decision,  though   the  full  circumsta,:es
could not have been predicted at the time of appraisal.

8.7      Technical   assistance  was  implemented satisfactorily. Specialists
financed under the project   were  well  qualified  and   for  the  most  part
performed   competently, although the omission of terms of reference from the
appraisal report caused some problems. The   fellowship   programme  was  well
planned   and implemented within the framework of the appraisal proposals and
met its objectives of raisingthe quality of   teaching   staff.  However,  the
need  to   plan  the  technical assistance programme within a five-year time-
frame reduced its potential impact somewhat, because    it  was  not  possible
within   that period to arrange the assignments of the specialists to overlap
with the return of the counterparts from training. L/

1/ The Borrower feels that.this problem did not obtain in the Punjab (see
   Attachment 11, page 113).

8.8      The pre-investment studies which were planned were carried out in a
shorter time than provided     for and locai consultants were employed. The
impact and usefulness of the studies has been less than anticipated.

8.9      The educational impact of the project has been positive.    Although
improvements   in quality of teaching programmes have been         less than
anticipated, the base of agricultural teaching capability has Deen broadened
and  strengthened so that improvements are expected to materialise over the
next few years. This in turn 'should lead to an increase in the capability cf
trained agricultural manpower in the field         and  through them to an
enhancement in the productivity of farmers.

8.10     The build-up in numbers enrolled     for middle-level   agricultural
training has been slower than planned as a result of the delays in project
implementation and because of a degree of apathy on the part of the
agricultural authorities who have not been fully committed to the objectives
of thep,roject.l/Probably because of inter-sectorial rivalries, they see the
project as being    an affair of the education authorities rather than their
own. However, enrollments should reach the project target by   1986. Because
the demand formanpower has also grown more slowly than forecast, the result
has been that supply and demand   have continued to be more or       less in
balance.

8.11     An  important objective of the project was. the integration of
middle-level training for both crop and livestock sectors in the ATIs.      In
the event, the objective has been achieved in Sind province only. In -the
other provinces, the animal   husbandry authorities have not agreed      that
training of their personnel should be carried out under the management of
the crop-oriented Department of Agriculture. The objective was in any case
probably unrealistic because of      long-standing strong inter-departmental
rivalries. The outcome has no serious implications, as both Field Assistants
and Stock Assistants are being trained        in sufficient numbers. However,
livestock facilities at ATIs were geared to the needs of Stock Assistant
training and are over-generous for the needs of Field Assistants.

8.12     The Advisory Committees which were to advise on AT1 policies and
management were created in such a manner that they failed to function well.
The appraisal concept was correct and the authorities intend to reconstitute
the committees in a way in which they can function.

1/ According to the Borrower, there was no delay in meeting target enrollments
   in the Punjab (see the table in para. 17, Attachment 11).

                           SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


Objective

         The Project Component, as appraised in August/September 1976, was
responsive to the educational need of the country and therefore aimed at improving
and expanding primary and middle-level education by increasing the supply of
qualified teachers, particularly for rural areas, and females in seventeen Teacher
Training Institutes from pre-project enrolment of 2,840 to 5,040.


Components

         The Project Component, formulated over a period of 42 months, consisted
of (a) constructing three new female Teacher Training Institutes for a capacity of
770 students; (b) reconstructing one male (210), and three females (1,190) TTls on
new sites for a total capacity of 1,400 students; (c) expanding and improving six
male (1,890) and four female (980) TTIs for a total capacity of 2,870 students,
thereby increasing enrolment by 2,200 places. Also included was an experiment on
Adult Functional Literacy Programme which was then being conducted with
UNICEF assistance. Technical Assistance included three-man years of specialistst
services on equipment and training methods and three man-years of expert services
to conduct a manpower study on supply and demand of female teachers, and
middle-level agriculture and livestock field assistants.


Implementation

         Project Implementation required seven years compared with five-and-a-
half years planned a t A praisal. Each of the four provinces established a Project
                        I' PIU),
Implementation Unit             all of which were coordinated by the Federal
Coordinating Unit (FCU) in Islamabad.      Frequent changes in personnel adversely
affected management's efficiency and effectiveness. Problems identified in built
facilities were caused by some design and specification weaknesses which were not
detected by either the FCU architect in Pakistan or the architect at the Bank
during project development, and a lack of systematic and effective supervision and
quality control at critical points by the Public Works Department (PWD) in the
Punjab, Baluchistan and North West        Frontier Provinces (NWFP) during the
implementation of the Project.


Supervision

         During the Bank's 15 Supervision Missions major observed causes of
implementation delays and under-utilization of facilities were identified and
discussed with the Borrower with the view to ameliorating the conditions.
However, D. I. Khan was never visited, this resulted in a shortage of facilities and
the sub-standard of what was built at D. I. Khan (Females).          Several other
observations resulted in positive action and enhanced the implementation of the
Project. These included: (a) utilization of the three man-years on equipment and
training methods to support 20 fellows from the ATIs on fellowship training
programmes abroad; (b) printing and distribution of teachers' guides to accompany
the new AC; and (c) submission of audit reports on project components in three
provinces.   Mismanagement in the NWF Province appear to be the reason for no
audit being done there.

Cost

        Final cost for this component was same 21 per cent below Appraisal
Estimates of US$14.1 million equivalent.       Factors which contributed to under-
spending were:    (i) reduction in furniture expenditure;    (ii) under-utilization of
technical assistance; and (iii) lack of building all required facilities a t D. I. Khan
(F).

        Had the allocated US$14.1       million been utilized, higher standards of
materials and workmanship would have helped to offset the effects of poor to non-
existent maintenance observed by the Mission.

        At the time of the Completion Mission, although registration for 1984185
school year was virtually completed, enrolment figure was 3,942 or 78.2 per cent of
appraisal expectation. This is less by 1,098 than the 5,040 target enrolment. All
TTIs are operating, but only six have reachedlexceeded their enrolment capacity
while four are below their 50 per cent level.       Under-utilization of facilities is
caused by four major factors: (i) over-estimation of teacher demand; (ii) under-
estimated teacher supply; (iii) unattractive teachers' salaries; (iv) the rigid quota-
system. In order to increase enrolment, the Government upgraded the level and
salary of teachers by two grades; the result was an increase in enrolment from 57
per cent in 1983184 to the present 78.2 per cent of which 66 per cent are females,
74 per cent are primary teachers and 26 per cent are middle-level teachers. The
Mission observed a limited use of libraries, home economics and science
laboratories,   audio-visual    aids   equipment,     and   an   over-use      of   the
lecture/demonstration method, both of which tend to hinder, rather than improve
the quality of instruction.

        Covenants, including the Tracer Study, were generally adhered to.
According to the latter, 94 - 97.5 per cent of graduates are employed within a year
of graduation and over 50 per cent of them are working in a radius of 40 kilometers
from their places of residence.      The study on the SupplyIDemand of Female
Teachers was submitted to the FCU in October 1984.               The Experiment on
Functional Literacy Programme was completed in 1981 and accepted by the
Government.      Technical Assistance was mostly used to assist in providing
fellowships for AT1 teachers.


Conclusions and Major Lessonskarned

        The Project Component as designed was responsive to the educational
needs of Pakistan.       Flexibility in project formulation and implementation
contributed to the effectiveness of the Project and should be encouraged.

        The shortage of facilities and defects in buildings at D. I. Khan (F) could
have been avoided had the site been visited. Deficiencies observed in buildings are
crucial to the well-being of the users and can be corrected by the Borrower, but
success will depend upon the efforts and commitment of both the Regional and
Federal authorities.

        The Government needs to take corrective measures regarding under-
enrolment in order that the expected benefits of the Project might be fully
realized.

        A few major lessons learned which could improve future projects include:
(a) the importance of good design and clearly written specifications; (b) a clear
understanding by the Borrower of the total project funds available and procedures
for requesting withdrawals; (c) the need for more effective supervision by the FCU
at all sites; and (d) the importance of all sites being visited at least once by the
Bank supervision missions, especially at critical point of project implementation.

                                     CHAPTER I


                              PROJECT BACKGROUND




1.1     The total population of Pakistan was estimated in mid-1982 to be 87.1
million as against 69 million (1975 estimate) at the time of Appraisal in 1977 Total
area is 803,943 square kilometers with a population density of 104 per km2, with
about 75 per cent unskilled and living in rural areas. Annual growth rate is about 3
per cent.

1.2     Pakistan is divided administratively into four provinces: the Punjab, Sind,
North West Frontier, and Baluchistan    - plus the state of Azad Kashmir and several
centrally administered tribal areas located in the north-west.

                                                                                   Pt
1.3     The national language, Urdu, is spoken by about 10 per cent of t
population; this has led to complications in communication and education-
Punjabi and Sindhi a r e spoken by 65 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, and the
other 15 per cent of the population communicate in more than ten other languages.

1.4     Gross National Product (CNP) in 1982183 was ~ ~ $ 3 1 . 5billion with an
                                                                       0
annual growth rate of 7.3 per cent. CNP per capita in 1982 was ~ ~ $ 3 8 compared
                                                                           0 ,
with US$137 in 1975, at constant prices.




1.5     The adult literacy rate at Appraisal was 22 per cent.     Education was less
developed for females and in rural areas as evidenced by enrolment ratios which
were for primary schools 49 per cent, middle school 21 per cent and 12 per cent for
high school.   Disparities between males and females in grade one enrolment
averaged 99 per cent for males and 47 per cent for females. However, the ratio
was below 10 per cent for females in Baluchistan Province.     In addition, too little
emphasis had been put on quality and relevance of education, and rote learning was
the major learning process.

1.6     There was a shortage of TTIs for the projected number of teachers required
to meet the needs of the primary and middle schools, especially in science and
home economics. Facilities at existing TTIs were usually poor, including a general
absence of laboratories and workshops, almost no equipment, furniture of the
wrong type, and textbooks and library books were insufficient and were old and
outdated. Several institutions were in disrepair and needed to be reconstructed.
Furthermore, courses lasted for only six months and many students registered
during the school year.    In particular, female TTIs were unable t o supply enough
teachers to obtain any substantial increase of enrolment ratios for girls.
Investment in this Project, under its Fifth Five-Year Plan, was Government's
attempt t o redress these and other weaknesses.

        secondary level, and English is generally used at higher level.

Development Policy and Strategy

1.7     With the view to improve the overall level of education in the country, the
Government developed an appropriate strategy including a major shift from higher
to lower-level education, especially primary education. 'The strategy included the
following characteristics:

        -   free and universal primary education (grades 1      - 61, equal access of
           education for all, design of new curricula to reflect changing socio-
           economic needs with emphasis on practical work and creative
            expression;

        -  the continued expansion of secondary schools, with increased emphasis
           on rural areas and the enrolment of women;

        -  a massive literacy programme aimed a t covering one million persons,
            mainly farm and factory workers, using a variety of teaching methods,
           and utilizing    interested  individuals, non-government     organizations
            (especially women's groups), and local governments.


1.8     The Plan showed that the Government recognized very clearly that an
educated population with increasing levels of skills was necessary for long-term
economic growth and social development, and that success would depend upon the
coordinated efforts and commitment of all concerned.


Project Generation

1.9     Over the last 20 years the Government of Pakistan has negotiated four
credits from the World Bank for educational projects.      The first
                                                              -project,     signed in
1964 and completed on 31 December 1976, aimed at improving post-secondary
polytechnic training and university agricultural education a t Lyallpur Agricultural
University. The second project, signed in 1970 and completed in July 1980, assisted
in improving and expanding engineering education in Karachi.        This Project, the
-
third, signed in 1977 and completed in December 1983, increased the supply of
qualified teachers at primary and middle-level education, partitularly for rural
areas and females.        The fourth project, concerned with improvement of
instructional supervision, at the primary level, is being implemented on schedule.

1.10    This Project was formulated over a period of 42 months.       In August 1973,
the Supervision Mission of IDA I1 was instructed to discuss and agree with the
national  economic     authorities the   possible    contents of    a third  project.
Government's application later followed in October, and a 4-man Identification
Mission    from    the    Unexo      Cooperative      Programme     was    made    in
November/December 1973.         The Identification Mission estimated a project of
USS18.3 million.

   1.1 1    Eight months later, in August 1974, a joint 2-man World BankICooperative
   Programme Reconnaissance Mission was launched and discussions were held a t both
   the Provincial and Federal levels, followed by a joint 6-man World BankIUnesco
   Preparation Mission in JanuaryIFebruary 1975.           The Reconnaissance Mission
   estimated project cost at ~ S $ 2 0million, but the Project was prepared for an
   estimated ~SS25.7million.

   1.12     The Project was appraised in AprilIMay 1975, followed by a one-man post
   appraisal in June 1976, and a follow-up appraisal in AugustiSeptember 1976.

   1.13     Prior to negotiation both Federal and Provincial Governments expressed
   some    reservations   about    the negotiation    documents  and  proposed   some
   amendments, thereby causing delays for negotiation. However, they were dropped
   upon being assured by the World Bank that these were standard Bank procedures
   and practices. Negotiations, therefore, were held in early December 1976, followed
   by Buard approval in January 1977. The Credit was signed on 18 February 1977,
   and became effective on 6 July 1977.         The agreed upon Closing Date was 31
   December 1982. No serious issues were raised a t negotiation as there had already
   been several visits to the country to ensure that all conditions had been met prior
   t o negotiations.


   Project Description and Objective

            Objective

   1.14     As stated a t Appraisal, the major objective of this Component of the
   Project was "to improve and expand primary and middle-level education by
   increasing the supply of qualified teachers, particularly for rural areas, and
   females...".




   1.I 5    The Project consisted of:

            (a) constructing, reconstructing, expanding, improving, and equipping 17
I
         . -    Teacher Training Institutes as follows:

     Total

        Relatively small institutions (140 - 350 students) were financed under the
        project because of two factors: (i) separation of sexes; and (ii) the need to
        keep enrolment areas small since teachers tend not to accept posts in any
        rural areas other than where they live.   The Project was also expected to
        help the Government to introduce the then recently revised primary and
        middle-stage curricula, and promote basic education for hitherto poorly
        served groups, particularly females and children in rural areas;

        (b) Experiment on Adult Functional Literacy Programme which was then
           being conducted with UNICEF assistance;

        (c) Technical Assistance

            (i) three man-years of short-term specialists1 services on equipment
                and training methods;

            (ii) three man-years of expert services to conduct a manpower study on
                 the supply and demand of female teachers.



        Expected Benefits

1.16    The investment in 17 Teacher Training Institutes was expected to help
improve the quality of pre-service teacher education and expand their capacity by
2,200 places, consisting of a 10 per cent expansion in male teacher training capacity
(from 7,800 to 8,600) and 50 per cent expansion in female teacher training capacity
(from 3,000 to 4,500 places).

                                     CHAPTER I1


                            PRO-ECT IMPLEMENTATION


Overview

2.1     The Credit Agreement was signed on 18 February 1977, and became
effective on 6 July 1977.      Physical aspects of the Project were substantially
completed and the Credit was closed on 30 June 1984, after extension of the date
from 31 December 1982.

2.2     The Project implementation required seven years against five-and-a-half
years estimated in the Appraisal Report.         Three Project Implementation Units
(PIUS) had been dissolved, making it impossible to construct four provincial
implementation schedules or an overall one, compared with that of the Appraisal.

2.3     The Project provided for the construction of three new Teacher Training
Institutes (TTI), the reconstruction of a further four TTI's on new sites and the
expansion and remodelling of ten existing TTIs.         All seventeen TTI1s received
equipment and furniture for their new accommodation.          Project facilities have
been built and handed over, with the exception of one institution (para. 2.91,
generally in accordance with the accommodation envisaged in the Appraisal
Report.

2.4     Final actual cost was some 21 per cent below the Appraisal Estimate, in
US$ equivalent, for this component.


Management

2.5     Each province formed a project implementation unit drawn from staff of
the line Ministries. These PW's were coordinated by the Federal Coordinating Unit
(FCU), based in the Ministry of Education.        The PIU's have been disbanded and
"caretakers" nominated for finalisation activity.     Implementation of the building
programmes was effected by the Public Works Department (PWD). Designs were
done by PWD architects, in the case of North West Frontier Province (NWFP)
assisted by the Federal Unit, except for Sind, where consultants were appointed for
design and supervision.

2.6     The FCU and PIU's suffered from staff changes and Punjab had three
Project Directors and NWFP two.

2.7     It was felt that both FCU and PIU's had lacked the services of a senior
technical staff member.     It was noted that the Project Director in Sind was an
engineer and this had contributetd to that Province's good results.

2.8     The quality and reliability of information flowing up and down the
management line left much t o be desired and the management of the two
components of Basic Education and Agriculture within the one system had not
made things easier.

2.9     The one recorded failure   - in the case of the Women's TTI at D. I. Khan    -
serves well to illustrate the main lessons t o be learned from the Project in the area
of management. For this reason it is dealt with in detail in Annex 11.3.

2.10 .   Generally, problems in built facilities have arisen firstly, from wak design
(para. 2.29  - 2.34 inclusive) and secondly, from lack of systematic and effective
supervision at critical points by PWD in the development of the Project. However,
crises were overcome and repairs effected to acceptable standards.


PhysicalImplementation

         -
         Sites

2.1 1    Except for the site at D. I. Khan Women's, which is cramped, sites were
generally adequate for the accommodation as built and the buildings were
satisfactorily disposed within them. However, Peshawar now suffers from flooding
caused by defective drainage (para. 4.42).

         Landscaping

2.12     All the newlydeveloped sites will benefit from the maturing of landscaping
and planting although in most cases little has been done so far. The old established
sites are well provided with shade trees and other matured plants.        The lack of
complete and cared-for landscaping encouraged litter.

         Infrastructure

2.13     Access to and circulation within the sites was generally satisfactory.    In
some cases, notably in Baluchistan, the site works were unfinished and efforts were
in hand to complete them within the existing contracts.

2.14     Electricity supply was made to all sites, although some connections to
facilities were of a temporary nature.

2.1 5    Water supply frequently is a source of problems, even where mains water is
available.   Often supply is augmented by wells or bore holes giving rise to some
doubts as to purity (see D. I. Khan (F) Annex 11.3).

2.16     Hand pumps are much used. Frequently electrical pumps were out of use
and high level water tanks were not filled.

2.17     There is much waste of water due to broken and leaking fittings. Flushing
tanks for W.C.'s are often disconnected for this reason.

2.18     Sewage disposal is only rarely conducted off-site to a town sewer.
Consequently, reliance is placed on the "septic tank1' and s u b systems are not
usually appropriate to urban institutional sites unless very adequate site area is
available with the right ground conditions. Frequently examples of ground surface
contamination were found. The situation at D. I. Khan Women's TTI constituted a
health hazard in the Mission's view and the authorities are actively looking into the
matter.


Works of tmprovement and E.rrran_.ianto Existing Institutions

2.19     In this category of work there have been numerous and detailed de artures
from the provisions of the Appraisal Estimates undertaken after decisions at oca
                                                                           -%T
level, based on assessment of institutional needs and sanctioned by PIU and
sometimes by supervision missions. The value of work thus affected was a small
proportion of civil works and users expressed themselves satisfied with results.

2.20     Typical of these departures was a reluctance to qmvert pairs of existing
classrooms to other s p e c i a l i d rooms; as at D. 1: Khan (F) where no library
tonversion was done, nor at D. I. Khan Men3      m.    At Peshawar, none of the three
classrooms due for conversion were done. At Gakhar, the money for c o n v e r s h of
t h m classrooms into a Lecture hall was used to renew a roof.         No w i d e w e of
Bank's apprwal was found, but users arc satisfied and feel safe with a sound roof.


WhgDuigmforNcrFacilities

         Space Rwision

2.21     Completed buildings provided 7 per cent extra gross area over Appraisal
Estimates, for the dotal TTI component.          Some buildings did not prwide the
required usable area, however.         Annex II.1 shows the comparative analysis of
planned and built areas, both usable and gross.

2.22     Amex II.2  *OWS   the relative efficiency of designs in providing the required
usable area whilst keeping gross area to a reasonable minimum.
r                                                                          A recurrent
 attem is that the designer has succeeded in keeping within the gross area target
 i.e. the cost of the overall building), but at the expense of not having provided the
required usable area.

2.23     Academic buildings have b a n more effectively planned than have the
Hostel buildings, of w h i d there are a variety of generic plan types. As shown in
Annex 11.2, eight academic buildings and six hostels perform well in that they
provide the required usual areas, but two academic buildiqs and six hostels
perform poorly; the difference between appraisal and actual gross usable areas
among other buildiqs is norr+ignificant.


utilhtbrr of Facilities

         Academic buildiw

2.24     Academic buildings show poor utilisation simply because they are planned
for rotation of classes and this is not practiced.         All specialised rooms are
accordingly used as classrooms, of which the users, naturally, complain there are
too few. By tradition class rotation is not practiced in Pakistan.       The Appraisal
Mission did not ascertain whether the Government would have been willing do
introduce such a change in policy, even on a trial basis. Based rpon the discussion
the Mission had with the FCU authorities on this question, there is no likelihood
that this tradition would be broken in the foreseeable future.

         Boarding Facilities

2.25     In Baluchistan boarding places are only 53 per cent occupied, but the
normal position in the other provinces is       OM  of overcrowding.     In NWFP the
womenb TTI are overcrowded by 148 per cent, in Islamabad by 125 per cent due to
o m of the four standard hostel blocks being used as a model school.        h Karadi,
hostel space is also given over to a model school and Education Department
Offices.

2.26     Hostels are not providing the conditions for personal study. Numbers per
room need do be reduced to the designed number, a less, to enable this.           Extra
provision for study areas should be made available, in classrooms adjacent to
libraries for example, but these must be adequately illuminated.                 Where
dormitories are overcrowded, students study on their beds.

         Staff Housing

2.27     Senior staff appeared generally satisfied with their housing, but the smaller
houses provided for support staff were justifiably criticised as being too small and
t h e Mission ob rved several cases of over-crowding and poor environment in
houses of 37 mSI? Since junior grade staff families are normally as large or larger
than senior grade families, consideration should b e given in future t o providing
extra space for this category, with a minimum area of 45 m2   .

Structural Desinn

2.28     Structural designs tend to b e heavy and often over-complex at roof level,
involving numerous leaky expansion joints and junctions.      There have been some
failures and extra members have been introduced in the Baluchistan buildings,
which also appear to have suffered settlements and deflections due to premature
loading of reinforced concrete beams, the movements of which appear to have
ceased.     In order t o b e satisfied with the structural condition, the Mission
recommends monitoring of cracks by "tell-tales" over a period of time by the
Baluchistan Ministry of Education. The Punjab standard Hostel balcony should be
examined as a matter of urgency to see if further supports need t o b e introduced.


Building Quality

2.29     Quality varies from province to province:        Sind having achieved good
standards of design and execution only partly compromised by late economies due
to cost overrun (omission of insect screening is a bad economy). Elsewhere finishes
a r e poor and bedevilled by water penetration and mould growth. Contractors have
not generally been made to clean down t h e work after completion.

2.30     The design, specification and workmanship of plumbing, drainage and
sanitation a r e areas of consistent failure.

2.31     The effective servicing of Science Laboratories and Home Economics
Rooms and Workshops with water, electricity and nas, needs t o be c o m ~ l e t e dand
put into use in all TTIS. In no cask did the ~issionvfindone of these facfiities fully
operating. This means thorough attention to all fittings and drainage.

2.32     Natural illumination is often inadequate in the deeper rooms, frequently
the library!    The artificial lighting installations were usually underdesigned and
evidently little or never used.

2.33     The causes of t h e problems are two-fold.        Firstly, at a design and
specification level, as in the planning of non-waterproof bathrooms within 2-storey
hostels;   secondly,   at the level of      supervision and  quality-control on site
(para. 2.10).

2.34      Both these causes arise from a combination of consultants and contractors
of inadequate calibre or experience in three of the four provinces, adoption of
unnecessarily low costs and an absence of effective technical scrutiny in the
management procedures at the points where it mattered, principally at the
approval of final designs and specifications, during services installation and at the
final inspections of work on sites. It was to be expected that Sind Province would
perform best in technical matters, reflecting the generally moredeveloped nature
of consultants and contractors available there. It is generally accepted t o be more
difficult to achieve good standards in the- other three provinces in both public and
private sectors.

Fittings and Fixtures

2.35    Unwise economy measures have meant a general use of poor quality items
which cause an increasing load on non-existent maintenance services. Two urinals
were installed in a male institute, but have not been used; two were also placed in
a female institute.


Fumiture

2.36    Fumiture lists were prepared by a special committee of the FCU and
approved by the World Bank.    Project Units were responsible for procurement and
supply to TTlts and this was done by local bids and FCU acceptances.

2.37    Uniformly crudely designed and made, durability is doubtful.    The simpler
pieces a r e adequate, but drawers, cupboards, worktops, reagent shelves, locks,
catches and handles are all sources of failures. The chance to improve stocks have
not been taken and much existing furniture retained.    Great savings were made in
Appraisal Estimates on this item.

2.38    The built-in terrazzo workshop and laboratory benches in Sind would b e a
success but are not used due to the non-rotating class system.

2.39    At Karachi, ordinary classroom desks have been crammed in between the
built-in terrazzo laboratory benches and at Moro, wooden laboratory benches have
been supplied in addition to the built-in benches and are stacked under the stairs.
At Khairpur, the benches were supplied unnecessarily, and a r e also stacked under
the stairs.




2.40    Equipment lists were prepared by the FCU and a Committee of Principals
and approved by the World Bank.     Procurement was by International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) or local purchase in accordance with Bank procedures.

2.41    All equipment is reportedly delivered and appeared to be suitable, though
much has not been brought into use.     Balances were often on shaky shelving and
none were adjusted for use.    There has been some misdirection of books between
An's and TTIts but the effective stocking and use of libraries had not been
accomplished, in the view to the Mission much remains to b e done in this area.


Maintenance

2.42    Maintenance is the responsibility of PWD and is evidently not delivered
effectively.   Users said frequently that for small matters they fended for
themselves.

2.43    No institution had a t%andyman" on t h e staff although such a person, if
reasonably competent, would make a big impact on the level of items such as
replacement of light bulbs and tap washers and the unblocking of drains.

Technical Assistance

2.44     The three man-years of specialists services on equipment and training
methods allocated for TTIs was, instead, used t o assist in providing 20 fellowships
for teachers from the ATIs. In a letter of 11 April 1983, followed by a cable on 30
April, the Borrower requested the use of the remaining Technical Assistance funds
to assist with ten more fellowships for AT1 teachers after a first batch of ten had
already been supported partially by said funds. IDA approved the utilization of the
unspent balance of t h e Technical Assistance funds, as requested by the Borrower,
in a cable dated 5 May 1983.       Therefore, ten staff member undertook a three-
month training programme in farm mechanization, agriculture education, and
animal husbandry.


Fulfillment of Covenants

2.45     All covenants (Annex 11.4) were generally fulfilled, although all were not on
schedule.   For example, the tracer system study (analysis was incomplete during
t h e Mission) covered only the employment status of graduates and their distances
from their places of residence.    Number of applicants and number admitted, etc.,
were not included.

2.46     The study on t h e Supply and Demand of Female Teachers was submitted to
the FCU in early October, during the visit of the Mission, rather than at the end of
1982.

2.47     The AC was introduced in all TTIs but no supplementary assignment was
given, as stipulated at Appraisal and in the Credit Agreement.

2.48     Although there appear to have been no covenanted requirement for a
project audit, the Supervision Mission of August 1982 reported that no audit report
had been sent to IDA in six years, and recommended that senior management make
an approach to the authorities with the view to improving the audit situation.
Consequently and in compliance with Article 111, Section 3.05 (b) (iii) which
stipulates that the Borrower "shall furnish to the Association all such information
as the Association shall reasonably request concerning the Project, the expenditure
of the proceeds of the Credit    ...",theBorrower, between I4 September 1982 and
4 April 1983, submitted audit reports for project components in Punjab, Sind, and
Baluchistan to IDA.    It would appear that mismanagement in NWF Province was
responsible for failure in submitting an audit re ort for project components in that
Province.                                        ?

                                PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING


      Appraisal Estimates

      3.1     The cost of the total Project comprising all components and includirlg
      contingencies was estimated a t Appraisal a t PR1s 269.8 million or ~SS27.2. The
      basic education component amounted to 51.8 per cent (USS14.1 million) of the total
      Project. Annex 111.1 sets out the details of Appraisal Estimates for this component.


      Final Cost of t h e Basic Education Comwnent

      3.2     At the time of closing, a total of PR1s 123.8 millions had been spent
      representing 89 per cent of Appraisal Estimate, or 79 per cent if expressed in US$
      equivalent. See Summary Table 3.1 below.

3.3     The underspending was due to savings on the Civil Works and Fumiture
Estimates, affecting the major components in the budget (para. 2.37).

3.4     The appreciation in the value of the US$ against the Rupee occurred
mainly in the last two years of the Life of the Project, when the larger part of the
budgets had been spent.     See Annex 111.2 for the full summary of estimated and
actual expenditure by component and project items. Annex 111.3 sets out details of
Appraisal estimates and actual costs for all categories within project items.

3.5     Actual construction costs showed reductions of 22 per cent to 47 per cent
on Appraisal Estimates when calculated in US$ equivalent, and an average
reduction of 19 per cent in Rupees on a project-wide basis.

3.6     The total cost per new student teaching place created by the Project was
some 12 per cent to 15 per cent below estimates on a Rupee basis. See Annexes
111.4 and 111.5 for details of costs of buildings by province and category costs per
student place created.


Expenditure by Category

3.7     Table 3.2 gives a summary of costs by category of expenditure and Annex
III.6 sets out a comparison of appraisal and actuals by categories and both

Professional Services

3.9     Consultants were not reportedly fully paid in Sind, in accordance with their
contract. Sind's actuals confirm this, being underspent by 42 per cent.


Reconciliation of Disbursement

3.10    This constitutes a problem with regard to reporting separately the
disbursement attributable to the components of Basic Education and Agriculture
and also to the categories of expenditure within each component e.g. :civil works,
furniture, administration, etc.     Neither cummulative disbursements nor the
disbursement curve can be separated for the two components. The double-lesson t o
be learned here is the need to have two separate smaller projects, or to have one
Completion Mission for the entire project in future projects of this kind.

                                    CHAPTER IV


                         PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOMES



Overview-Attainment of Ro'jt Objectives

4.1      This project component was conceived primarily as an attempt to augment
the capacity of the 17 TTIs in Pakistan from a pre-project 2,840 enrolment to
5,040. In addition, it was to help introduce the revised primary and middle school
curricula through the provision of multi-purpose workshops, laboratories, teaching
aids, library books, and adequate furniture. These facilities were provided in order
to help improve the quality of instruction.

4.2      At the time of the Completion Mission, although registration for 1984185
school year was virtually completed, enrolment figure was 3,942 or 78.2 per cent of
appraisal expectation. All TTIs are operating, but occupancy of facilities is not yet
100 per cent in all of them as envisaged a t Appraisal.  Six have reachedlexceeded
their enrolment capacity while four are below their 50 per cent level. The Mission
also observed a limited use of libraries, home economics and science laboratories,
audio-visual aids equipment, and an over-use of the lectureldemonstration method,
both of which tend to hinder, rather than improve, the quality of instruction.

4.3      Had the allocated USS14.1 million been fully utilized, higher standards of
materials and workmanship would have helped to offset the effects of oor to non-
existent maintenance observed by the Mission.           There was US     !3.0 million
undisbursed funds of the Basic Education Component at the Project's Closing Date.


Institutional Capacity Building

4.4      Over the last 20 years the institution capacity building of the Borrower has
been characterized by frequent changes in personnel both a t the Provincial and
Federal levels. Consequently, there is only one province which has developed and
retained a strong and efficient PIU in addition to the Federal Co-ordinating Unit in
Islamabad.

4.5      This Roject must b e reviewed in relation to the previous two projects as
well as IDA IV.    In the last few years there has been more stability in personnel
and the FCU, presently under-staffed, now boasts of being only a year and a half
behind in this Project, but on schedule with Project IV. In Sind Province the PIU
still exists and executes Roject IV without increased staff, in addition to its new
responsibilities under its new title of Directorate of Engineering in the Education
Department.     PIUs in the other provinces have been dissolved.      Except in Sind
Province the Departments of Public Works controlled and executed all physical
aspects of the projects. This decreased the authority and efficiency of the PIUs.
As a result, some institutes are not yet painted, maintenance is needed and there is
no piped water. Principals have made general appeals to Rovincial authorities, but
to no avail (paras. 2.31 and 2.42).

Student Enrolment and Output

4.6    The facilities mentioned in paragraph 4.1 above were, for the most part of
the project implementation, grossly under-utilized as a result of under-enrolment
caused mainly by three major factors:

       (1)     Overestimation      of Teacher     Demand     as contained   in  the
               Government's Third Five-Year Plan and accepted by the Appraisal
               team;

       (2)     Underestimated Teacher Supply based primarily on outputs from
               pre-service    programmes,    without   consideration of alternate
               sources;

       (3)     Following rigidly the quota-system        for allocation of seats to
               d   i   f   f   e   t  e    n   t      admit the students from other
               areas in case sufficient number of candidates are not available
               from the reserved areas.

       The twin factors, (1) and (2) above, led to a crash programme which
       produced an over-supply of teachers, particularly in Punjab and Sind
       Provinces.    Additional reasons for low enrolment are also the direct
       consequences of the following:

       (4)     Determining the number of seats by the respective Directorates of
               Education for admission in the respective training institutions long
               after the declaration of        Examination results.     The fresh
               matriculates do not wait for delayed admissions and instead seek
               other avenues for employment.

       (5)     Appointment of untrained teachers against the posts of PTCICT
               particularly in the schools situated in rural areas.

       (6)     NO relaxation of educational qualifications nor ageil requirement
               for candidates coming from rural and under-developed districts,
               where most of the schools are located.

       (7)     Lack of policy decision to make it obligatory on the working
               untrained teachers to receive full-fledged training course in the
               training institutions.

       (8)     The practice of allowing private candidates to appear for PTC and
               CT examinations without undergoing a training course in an
               institute.




-1/    Only holders of Divisions I and 11 passes from Secondary Schools are
       admitted. Age limit is PTC 17   - 22  years; CT 18 23 years.
                                                            -

4.7     In 1981 the Association and the Borrower were alarmed by the fact that
enrolment target was not being met in project institutes and there was more of a
decline in student enrolment rather than an "increase in the supply of qualified
primary and middle school teachersv, as foreseen at Appraisal.      Consequently, as a
means to arrest this unfavourable situation, in July 1983, the Government upgraded
the level and salary of the primary and middle school teachers by two grades. The
impact of this action was an increase in enrolment from 57 per cent in 1983184 to
78 per cent in 1984185, as shown below:

        Total


        Appraisal capacity 5,040



4.8     A breakdown of the 1984185 enrolment shows that 66 per cent (2,604) are
females, this being in line with Appraisal's expectation          "...particularly for
females".   By level, 74 per cent and 26 per cent are PTC and CT teachers,
respectively.

4.9     Although the 1984185 enrolment is 78 per cent, this does not necessarily
mean that 1985186 enrolment would automatically be higher; enrolment is directly
influenced by the quota system through which the Director of Education assigns the
number of student places to be filled a t a TTI (para. 4.6 (5) 1. Therefore, enrolment
tends to fluctuate yearly, especially in less populated areas, as shown in the table
below:

-11     Punjab is the most populated province.

4.10    Another factor which influences enrolment is the number of in-service
teachers.    In compliance with the Association's recommendation and in order to
maximize the use of facilities, an in-service programme has been instituted in
some TTIs, h districts where their number is large, sometimes there are more in-
service teachers than pre-service, as in the case of Karachi (F)where (in 1984185)
there a r e 323 and 400 pre-service and in-service, respectively. It should be noted
that not all TTIs have an in-service
either, as is the case of Larkana (F ;a t Peshawar (F) there were C T classes in
                                      Programme;   some do not have C T programme

1983184, but none in 1984185.

4.11    Inordertosustainenrolmentgrowthsomecorrectivemeasures,including
abating the recruitment of untrained teachers (para. 4.7) and providing flexibility
in the rigid quota and admission systems, need to b e t en with the view to
enabling all TTIs to reach their full utilization capacitiesfr within the next few
years.     In this connection efforts should be made to establish in-service
programmes in rural areas and other urban TTls when necessary.

4.12    Over 98 per cent of students pass their examinations; the few who fail have
a second chance, and they usually pass.    Annex IV.1 shows the enrolment for the
last three academic years and enrolment for 1984185.


Shott-term I n m i c e Courses

4.13    Further use is made of the facilities through the offering of refresher
courses ranging from a week to two months, especially during the vacation periods,
a t some institutions.  For example, at Lalamusa groups of 60 teachers attended
four-week refresher courses, during 1983184, totaling about 360 teaders. At D. I.
Khan ale) the Mission saw 33 teachers attending the September 15         - October 4
course.   The Mission was informed that in 1983184, 90 teachers had attended 2
courses (2 weeks and 3 weeks each) and 100 attended a 2-month seminar, in 2
groups. At D. I. Khan (Female) the Mission also saw a few of the last t e a d e r s who
had attended a two-week refresher course leaving the campus.        It is the general
policy that after five years of teaching, refresher courses are given to teachers
with the view of acquainting them with the latest developments and trends in
teaching. This programme seems to be a substitute to holding "female high school
classes in the unused TTI classrooms" as envisaged at Appraisal (Appraisal, para.
4-6).


The Experimental Alternate Curriculum(AC)

4.14    The AC is a nine-month diploma programme for primary and middle-level
teaders.     Upon the suggestion of the Association, the Borrower revised the
1976177 curriculum by making certain modifications (Annex IV.3) including
lengthening the training period from six to nine months, adding Health and Physical
Education for CT students, allowing more flexibility for scheduling teaching
practice, providing 40 per cent of time for methodology, and introducing year-
round internal evaluation.    The AC was approved in 1978 and was gradually
introduced in the 17 TTIs at the beginning of the 1981/82 school year. It covers six
major subjects for the PTC and eight for the CT (Annex 1V.3). The abstract of the
annual schedule, the course of study, and the general objectives of the AC are
presented in Annex IV.2


-11     At least 6 TTIs have reachedlexceeded full utilization capacity (Annex
        IV.1). Islamabad (F)100%; Kamalia (F) 103; Multan (F) 112; Hussainabad

4.15    At Appraisal it was foreseen that the content of the AC could not be
covered in nine months, and therefore the Government agreed that the students
would be given 'toutside teaching and study assignments to supplement the nine
months of trainingw. This commitment was not honoured.            It is only in Sind
Province where teachers spend twelve months in an attempt to cover the AC, and
they even complain that this is not enough time.     In the other three provinces, it
was reported that the programme was completed within nine months.

4.16    The AC provides for 60 per cent of time to content and 40 per cent to
methodology.     This distribution seems appropriate.    However, according to the
syllabi and outlines, it appears that the AC is more bias to methodology than
content.   Reference is made only to the old curriculum and the level at which         .
content should be covered, but unlike the methodology courses, no outlines nor
syllabi are given.   Teachers find this a handicap to effective in-depth teaching
especially so in the sciences and home economics, since no details of activities are
given, based upon the new reference books and other new instructional materials
supporting the AC. This situation needs to be corrected by the provision of revised
and balanced outlines and syllabi reflecting the new educational materials.

4.17    The situation is exacerbated by the lack of water and electricity in many
of the laboratories, even after three years of occupancy, in some cases.
Consequently, experiments are not done, microxopes (mostly no slides), chemicals,
and other science equipment are neatly packed in glass cupboards, electric sewing
machines are still in their cases, some home economics utensils and equipment
(Moulinex)    are  still unpacked,    and   therefore    teachers   rely  upon   the
lecture/demonstration method of teaching.

         Instructional Material

4.18    In support of the AC, the Project provided 300.!/      books for each TTI,
science laboratory equipment and supplies, home economics equipment and
utensils, and audio-visual aid equipment. However, most of the new instructional
equipment are seldom used because teachers have not been trained, as foreseen at
Appraisal, how to use them (para. 2.441, and apparently, such facilities were not
available to these teachers when they were in teacher training colleges and
therefore are not familiar to teachers.    While lack of training in the use of the
instructional equipment appear to be the main cause for underutilization, other
strong contributing factors include the lack of water and electricity at many of the
project institutions and Government regulation which requires teachers to pay cash
for any damagedlbroken equipment.       Teachers, therefore, tend to refrain from
using the equipment in order to avoid being penalized in this manner.

4.19    A further disadvanype to the trainees is that the books are in English, and
many are above the level-       of the programme whereas Urdu is their working
language.   Teachers, therefore, have to interpretltranslate the contents for the
trainees. Books in Urdu are old and outdated, some being of the 1940's and 1950ts,




-1/     300 books is the minimum supplied to each TTI; a few had more, some less
        seemingly by an error in distribution. The FCU promised to investigate the
        reason and resolve the issue.
-I Some books for AT1hadbeen misdirected; others, especially science, were
2
        far above the levelof the programme    - e.g.Nuclear Physics.

and a r e seldom used. The libraries are used by each cla at a fixed time, and a r e
closed the rest of the week, there being no librarians-    Yl.  An inspection of the
library registers revealed a low usage rate. Also critically lacking is the supply of
teacherst guides which were to b e written and produced in support of t h e AC; only
eight titles were produced, and they were in short supply. The above existing
conditions lead one to conclude that the quality of instruction is adversely
affected, and this apparent decline in quality at TTls should merit the attention of
the Borrower.

         The Fuhlre of the AC

4.20     The future of t h e AC is uncertain.    Most teachers would lik  51to see it
introduced in other non-project TTls, but extended beyond nine months-      .  In late
1983 a seven-man National Committee conducted a n evaluation of the AC, but the
Report has not y e t been officially published. However, a finding of the study shows
the lack of professional motivation among the trainees, most of whom would prefer
careers other than teaching.       Only about fifteen per cent of them expressed
 enuine interest for the teaching profession.          This revelation warrants the
ettention of the authorities, and calls for the improvement of the self-image of the
teaching profession.   ~ l t h & ~the FCU is still'studying the evaluation report and
                                   h
in due course will make its recommendations to the Government, the Curriculum
Wing of the Ministry of Education has recently issued a 1983 (August) revised
edition of the April 1980 PTC and C T curricula and sent it to all TTls. This latter
edition differs in content only slightly from the 1980 and AC curricula, the major
changes being making Ishmiyat and Social Studies compulsory subjects for the CT
Programme, and reducing the duration of training from 45 to 39 weeks, on a 2-
semester system. However, considering the time constraint in the implementation
of the AC, the major issue which needs to b e addressed is whether to extend the
period of training beyond nine months, and if so, for how long.


c#ciaJ Studies

         The Tracer Studv

4.21     The Appraisal Report stipulates that the Government would establish a
monitoring system for the TTls to collect information on (a) the number of
applicants, number accepted, and enrolment at the beginning of each school year;
(b) the number of graduates who have completed the course within the prescribed
duration of the course, compared with the original intake; and (c) the number of
graduates employed within six months, one year, and three years after graduation.
Other data needed to improve the efficiency of training programmes was also to b e
included.

4.22     During the visit of the Completion Mission, the analysis of the study was
still being done by the FCU; the study is incomplete and deals only with the
employment status (see (c) above) of the TTl graduates. The findings validate the
Proj   ttsexpectations of teacher employment in that, with a 75 per cent response
rate-9,94    - 97.5 per cent of graduates are employed within a year of graduation
and over 50 per cent o f 4 p m are working within a radius of 40 kilometers from
their places of residence-   as shown in the table below:


-11      D. I. Khan (Male) had had a professional librarian for eighteen months;
         however, the condition of the library was the worst seen.
21       Time extension proposals range from 18   - 24 months.
31       3,000 graduates were mailed questionnaires.
-$1      Teachers tend not to accept posts far from where they live (para. 1.14).

4.23    As regards (a) and (b) in paragraph 4.21, the Mission observed that in urban
TTls the number of qualified applicants far exceeded the available places, for
example: 446 Preiservice applicants    -146 admitted; 300 rejected because of lack
of space. In general the trend is a yearly increase in urban applicants: in one TTI
applicants increased from 620 in 1982183 to 752 in 1984185. In another instance,
  ace was available, but the quota assigned could not be surpassed:     Pre-service
zalified applicants for 1984185: 75Q seats assig6335; rejected: 415. On the
other hand, the picture differs in rural and under-developed areas (para. 4.6
(3 and 6)) where most of the schools are located, but where academic and age
requirements for admission are not flexible to cater to the local conditions,
resulting in under-utilization of student places (para. 4.6 (6) 1.  The Mission was
informed that over 98 per cent of the students admitted completed the course
within the prescribed time; the few who failed took the examination the next year
and passed. The final report of the study is expected to be submitted to the
Government in the near future.

        Study on the SupplyIDemand of Female Teachers

4.24    An early version of the study was not found acceptable to the Federal
coordinating Unit.   Consequently, a new contract was signed with a consultant
from the Open University.    The 29Gpage document was submitted to the FCU in
early October 1984 (para. 2.46) during the visit of the Mission. A copy was given to
the World Bank Projects Adviser for transmission to Washing'ton.

        Adult Functional Literacy

4.25    The first cycle was completed with assistance from Unicef.      The second
and third phases were funded by the Government. The fourth phase, funded by IDA
under this Project, was completed and an evaluation report was submitted to IDA
in 1981.   The Government appeared to be satisfied with the outcome of the
Project.


Lessons Learned and Recommendations

1.      General

4.26    Lessons learned from this Project refer to items that should be
improvedlavoided in the formulation, implementation, and supervision of future
projects, and are presented as guidelines and recommendations.



-
11      Some females get married and travel; some males obtain better paying jobs
        in the private sector;      these account for the difference in 100%
        employment. (Seepara. 4.6 (5))       I

-
21      Next school year.

4.27    From the project management point of view, if this project component had
been the only one administered by the FCU, overall administration might have been
more efficient, misdirection of equipment and textbooks (paras. 2.41 and 4.19)
would have been avoided, and the general time delay in implementation caused by
the agricultural component would not have occurred.              The fact that each
component had a separate completion mission also justifies such a separation in the
future (three RUs had been dissolved).     The question can therefore b e posed, is i t
better to restrict projects to one main ministry or authority (e.g. University), and
thus have a series of smaller projects, or t o follow the procedures of this Project
and have a larger but multi-agency type formulation?

4.28    Future projects should ensure qualified and adequate quality control dt
design stage.    The World Bank should be responsible for making this control
effective, in collaboration with, but not delegating to, Project Unit quality control
procedures.    Adequate time and personnel must be allocated by the Bank t o
thoroughly checking all design and contract documents. Designs should b e checked
before final development.    Inefficient planning, unrealistic details and inadequate
specifications must be referred for corrections by the PIU.               Wellchecked
construction documents will provide a solid basis for PIU responsibility for on-site
supervision.

4.29    Hostels are not providing the conditions for necessary personal study by
students. Efforts should be made in all institutions t o rectify this (para. 2.26).

4.30    A concerted effort should be made, at national level, to produce good
standard designs and specifications for all aspects of water use systems, from
supply to treatment and disposal of effluent. If such a programme were effective
and its results implemented in the form of Design Guides, codes of practice and
standards backed up by legislation, then at a stroke one of the biggest single
problems affecting building use and maintenance could be tackled, in addition t o
improvements in public health and reduction of waste of water.


I!.     Physical

        Project Formulation

4.31    The   World   Bank    Architect's  Worksheets     should   incorporate     higher
percentage allowances for walls and circulation in those regions, such as Sind,
where climatic considerations require single-banked planning of rooms on corridors
to permit cross-ventilation.   Annex II.2 indicates that for Academic Buildings, 50
per cent and for Hostels, 45 per cent might b e more achievable target additions to
the usable areas for this purpose.

4.32    Very well-written specifications should be required for all buidings.

4.33    Supporting staff housing 9 w l d be increared to a minimum size of 45 m',
from the present standard of 37 m (para. 2.27).

        Project Implementation

4.34    The selection of qualified staff and their retention is fundamental to
successful project implementation.       PiUs (except Sind) and the FCU were
technically under-staffed    and change in personnel were frequent (para. 2.61,
thereby negatively affecting project implementation.        For future projects, the
Borrower should b e strongly urged to select carefully capable personnel who would
be available during the life of the project with the view to preventing as much as
possible constant staff changes.

4.35    The Borrower did not follow procedures to request unallocated funds;
perhaps the procedures were not readily understood.     No proposals were made to
use unallocated Credit until September 1982, when the Supervision Mission
proposed a civil works percentage increase from 45 per cent to 70 per cent. The
lesson of this is that unless the underspending of Credit is forecasted very early in
the project it is unlikely that the disbursements can be increased effectively. The
only mechanism for greatly increasing disbursement is by raising the civil works
credit percentage and if this is not agreed very early -  indeed before final designs
and, ideally, furniture schedules are prepared  - thenit will not correct the effects
of deliberately cheapened design.       This underlines the recommendation that
forecasts to complete are needed (see para. 4.40).

4.36    A fumiture design and specification policy was desirable.             National
standards and bulk purchasing might have given a much-needed encouragement to
local manufacturers. Money has been badly spent on furniture (para. 2.37).

4.37    Briefing of architects by PIU was inadequate in Baluchistan, NWFP and
Punjab and the selection procedures for consultants were not sufficiently rigorous
in these provinces, leading to the Public Works Departments being allocated
responsibilities for design and supervision services for which they were ill-
equipped.

4.38    Recognition should be given to two powerful counter-incentives to spending
fully the available Credit, particularly as in the case of Credit 678-PAK, it had a
large una llocated component.

        (a) Cash-flow for Provincial PIUts is adversely affected by the time-lag
             inherent in reimbursement procedures; and

        (b) the need to match dollar Credit with scarce local funds.         Exchange
             movements have worsened this effect    - atAppraisal ~ ~ $ 1 Credit for
                                                                             . 0
             Civil Works required RP 12.1 of local funds, by closure this had risen
             to RP 16.8.

4.39    Inflation of the Credit had no effect on (a) and (b) in respect of civil works,
or furniture, where economies hurt the Project (para. 3.3).

        Supervision

4.40    Supervision missions could have been more effective and therefore a
review of procedures aimed at improving activities in the field seems necessary,
including the following:
        - ,.
             Visits to sites and places need to be systematically recorded.       PCM
             was unable to determine clearly what had been seen and when. D. I.
             Khan was never visited.
                        -
        -    Recommendations of previous missions should be followed.              The
             December 1981 ~ission'recommended priority for the next mission to
             visit D. I. Khan (F).
        -    Progress reporting needs to be made more systematic. At present it is
             a random selection of items, dates and percentage; all sites should be
             visited at least once.
                               -      Simple bar charts should be kept by PIU's and
             mission reports updated accordingly.     The system would need to be
             provided by the World Bank for use by PIUtS.

         -   Forecasts to complete are not used, thus overruns, underspending etc.
             are never shown up, only delays reported.     Management needs to be
             alerted before the problem arrives.

         -   Exceptional signals need to be responded to.            NWFP news of
             malpractices should have triggered exhaustive visits and checking
             through documents in us&.

4.41     What this adds up to is increased technical presence and realistic time
allowance for visits on site and contact with effective personnel in the field, as
well as more time in thoughtful checking and perusal, return visits and persistence.
Is a system giving continuity of technical supervision personnel impossible?

         Maintenance

4.42     The old hostel buildings at Peshawar TTI should be urgently examined by a
structural engineer to confirm cause of foundation failure at right-hand end of
block and design repairs necessary.       The drainage of this site, including the
relationship with the adjacent commercial site, should be examined by a civil
engineer as a matter of urgency and a proper and effective drainage designed and
installed. The current discharge onto the TTI site from the adjoining site must be
stopped as it is causing flodding in the TTI premises and could be the cause of the
foundation failure.

4.43    Punjab standard hostel balcony desi n should be examined by a structural
engineer to determine the cause of failure   1inshear ?) and to determine whether
additional support should be provided. If this proves to be the case, all balconies
should be so treated.

4.44    Baluchistan:   The academic building a t Pishin should have tell-tales placed
over the settlement cracks in walls to establish whether further movement is
taking place. A structural engineer should be instructed for this purpose.

4.45    NWFP:     The academic building at D. I. Khan (F) should have tell-tales
placed over cracks in walls to establish if further movements take place.
Examination by a structural engineer is urgently required.


111.    Educational


4.46    During project formulation, the Association too willingly accepted the
projected figures in primary school enrolment which adversely affected the number
of teachers needed.   Hereafter, it has to be more rigorous in checking projections
so as to prevent a situation of under-utilization.    Making realistic estimates of
what would be feasible leads to outcomes that would be more in line with reality
(para. 4.6).

4.47    When proper     salaries and other satisfactory incentives of        working
conditions are provided teachers will respond positively (para. 4.7).

4.48    Review the admission criteria with the view to increasing enrolments in
disadvantaged areas. This would necessitate the following actions: (a) being more
flexible in applying the quota regulations by fixing a specific date for admissions,
and a fixed date for filling unused seats after the official admission date (para. 4.6)
has expired;    (b) relaxation of academic requirements by admitting a certain
percentage (e.g.   5-10 per cent) of Division I11 applicants;        (c) being more
considerate with age limitation; and     (d) admitting students from other areas in
case sufficient number of candidates are not available from the reserved areas.

4.49    During the 3-month vacation period, if not earlier, the Borrower should
provide training in the use of home economics, laboratory and audio-visual
equipment for at least two weeks for each school o r group of teachers as was done
effectively in Sind some time ago. This training would necessitate the installation
and connection of services (para. 2.3 1) and the output of this exercise should b e a n
improvement in the quality of education as envisaged at Appraisal (para. 4.18).

4.50    The success in enrolment in rural TTIs in Sind, NWFP, and Baluchistan
Provinces is attributed partly t o the organizational structure under which TTIs a r e
attached to t h e Bureau of Curriculum Development and Extension rather than t h e
Directorate of Education.     This arrangement tends to ensure greater attention to
the planning and execution of teacher education. Since the AC is a n experimental
programme in teacher education, TTIs in Punjab, if placed under the Regional
Bureau of Curriculum Development and Extension may receive greater attention
resulting in increased enrolments.

4.5 1   Consideration should b e given t o reinstituting the systematic supervision of
TTIs as was the practice until 1973.       The present practice of giving refresher
courses every five years (para. 4.13) might b e too long an interval without
supervision and follow-up.     The quality of education could be improved by this
reactivated system of inspection/supervision.

4.52    Measures should b e taken t o provide increased use of libraries, and the six
vacant posts for generalist teachers and the seven for mathematics (three), science
(three), and home economics (one), teachers should b e filled as soon as possible.
One female school had had no specialist teachers in these three fields since its
three years of occupancy of the new premises.

                                   CHAPTER V


                          BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE



5.1     The Project concept and design were responsive t o the need t o increase the
supply of primary and middle school teachers, the objective was clearly defined
with proper emphasis on the target to b e achieved, the need t o supplement the nine
months of formal education at the TTIs with Itoutside teaching and study
assignments" was identified, and the importance of training teachers in t h e use of
new laboratory and audio-visual equipment with the view to providing the quality
of education inherent in the alternate curriculum was recognized by the assignment
of three man-years of short-term specialistst services.

5.2     Throughout the implementation period clear communication between the
Government and the Association was maintained, and some problems identif ied in
sufficient time were resolved.

5.3     The Association adopted a flexible attitude in its attempt to assist the
Borrower in meeting the basic project objective by: (I) permitti    the construction
of small TTIs as against its principle of large institutions;    72 ) approving the
reallocation of Technical Assistance funds for TTIs to be used for fellowships for
AT1 teachers; and (3) extending the deadline for the two major studies as well as
the completion and closing dates by one year and one-and-a-half                 years,
respectively.  The under-utilization of physical facilities was repeatedly pointed
out until the Government took appropriate steps to improve enrolment.

5.4     Details of the number and composition of supervision missions can b e found
under the Basic Data. Fifteen IDA supervision missions visited Pakistan during the
seven year life of the Project at an average interval of 5.1 months and a range of
4 - 1 .  A mission averaged 2.3 weeks in the country.       The missions consisted
mostly of a n architect (8) or an agricultural educator (7), or both.       Only two
missions had a full representation of all aspects of the Project  - an architect, an
agricultural educator, and a general educator. A general educator was included on
at least four missions, and was alone on one. For about three years ( ~ c t o b e r1979
to September 1982) no architect was included on the three missions.

5.5     The major error of t h e Appraisal Mission was its acceptance of the
projected number of required teachers submitted by the Borrower and the design of
the project based upon those projections, only to discover later that those figures
were not reliable and that an over-estimation of teachers had been made.
Consequently, the issue of low enrolment became a major concern throughout
project implementation, the gravity of the matter led to a supervision mission
raising the question, as to whether all of the facilities provided were actually
needed.   Supervision missions identified several problems which were negatively
affecting project implementation and made recommendations resulting in positive
actions for enhancing effective project implementation. These include: (a) causes
of implementation delays and under-utilization of facilities;      (b) t h e Borrower
speeding up the printing and distribution of teacherst guides to accompany the AC;
and (c) submission of audit reports by the Borrower.

5.6     The Credit was set very much in excess of Appraisal Estimates of the
foreign funding proportion, with a large unallocated component for which no plans
were developed and which remained undisbursed.

5.7     Although supervision missions reported the (slow) rate of take up of Credit,
forecasts showed ever-increasingly unrealistic disbursement always reaching 100
per cent by the closing date. ~ o c c a s tof
                                            s nondisbursernent shouldbe made. -

5.8     The implementation of the physical facilities of the Project, although
finally of an adequate standard, except for D. I. Khan Female TTI (para. 2.9 and
Annex 11.3) does reveal a need for improvements in IDA%procedures for monitoring
progress and quality. Future projects will benefit if note is taken of the lessons to
be learned and the points of recommendation which follow.

5.9     Because of the assumption of a boarding "Unit" of 36 places (nowhere
adopted), the Architects Worksheet Element for the boarding accommodation is
ambiguous and no one understood it.         It was, however, used as an excuse for not
building all required facilities a t D. I. Khan (F).

5.10    The PC-1 for each province should have been checked qgainst Appraisal
Estimates to reveal in-built anomalies, e.g. Punjab intentions to underspend, NWFP
"misinter~retation"of a ~ ~ r a i s areauirements.
                                        l              (The Se~tember1982 Mission
reported 'PC-1's were notsh line wil6 the schedule-l credit Agreement, but that
was a bit late).

5.11    An assessment of plans should be done to show usable and gross areas
provided. Drawings, in some cases only, showed plinth areas. At design stage some
very inefficient plans could have been avoided.

5.12    There was no effective scrutiny of designs to check for quantity,
(otherwise D. I. Khan (F) would have been picked up), or quality, to pick up unwise
planning or unreal specifications, e.g. bathrooms.      According to FCU, a circular
system of trust evolved in which the FCU architect and the World Bank each
thought the other had checked documents.           Responsibility for approval must be
positively located.

5.13    D. I. Khan (M and F) was never visited by a supervision mission, and there
is uncertainty of a visit to Larkana (F).

          The Worksheets were sent to Peshawar where PWD Architects prepared
sketch designs; these were not at first regarded as adequate and an FCU Architect
was to b e provided to assist.

          Plans were drawn up and approved by PIU, FCU and the World Bank.
However, these prov' ed for a Hostel of
                        9                         48 boarders instead of 144 in a net
usable area of 416 m instead of 1,370 m     5'nlyThis
                                             .        was not detected and the building
was thus built (item 2.1).

          No kitchen or dining facilities were built (item 2.2).

          Items 1.2 - 1.7 were not done.

          The building was completed and accepted by PWD.

          The TTI was visited by PCM on 4 October 1984 and the facilities were
inspected in the company of the Principal.




          A single storey building on 3 sides of a courtyard with an old hostel on the
fourth side.    Very poorly built, the structure showed failure at expansion joints,
renders were falling off, door and window frames loose, door furniture missing, and
no decoration apart from a poor quality distemper.

          Electrical wiring ran in ad-hoc fashion from the fuse box.

          Water supply was by hand pump in the courtyard, the rooftop tank did not
fill due to a broken pump.

          The hostel toilet block at a comer of the court was unusable with
collapsing partitions and falling doors and frames.       No piped water reached its
fittings, fortunately, since all were broken.     Drains were totally blocked.  These
facilities were supplemented by so-called "dry latrines" which consisted of open
cement platforms with low divisions, within which the students defecated. They
were being located within the perimeter wall of the hostel courtyard, between the
toilet block and the end of the old hostel. An open cement channel ran beside the
dry latrines and all faeces were cleaned out by a "sweeperesv much going into this
channel which was some 30 cms deep and full. Intended t o discharge through a hole
at the base of the perimeter wall, it had a backflow which took the effluent back
into t h e courtyard to the hand pump which also fed the open channel.

          The hostel was occupied by 156 students in the space for 48.    Rooms were
filled with beds edge to edge.     Several sick students were seen. The students had
to eat their meals on their beds. Flies were numerous.

          The mission concluded that the facilities constituted a health hazard of
serious proportions and so reported to the Project Director.

          In addition, the old hostel was used as a middle school for classes 1 and 8
and was said to have 400 children enrolled.        No toilets were available and the
building was in a dilapidated condition.

                                                                           Annex 11.3



Academic Buildings

        The previously existing buildings were largely out of use due to repairs to
leaking roofs and to dangerous ceilings.

        In the new building, the designated workshop was used for Home Economics
and as a minimal library.       The Science laboratory had no water or drainage
provision for four sinks, and was being used as a regular classroom.

        There were cracks in the structure and some evidence of foundations
sinking under load-bearing walls. Considerable termite activity was evident.

        Artificial lighting was inadequate.

        Equipment had included a 52-seater bus, too big for the roads of the town,
and which had reportedly never been used.


Followup to Site Visit

        Representatives from the PIU at Peshawar visited the FCU and met the
Completion Mission on 10 October 1984. All their records referred to the hostel as
built and they said they had followed the tlcapacityltcolumn which shows the figure
of 113611and had in fact exceeded this by providing a building for 48. They were
unable to explain why the "New Needed Boarding Capacity1'of 144 set out in the
Worksheet Summary Table had been ignored, nor why the specified usable and gross
area were disregarded.

        The FCU records showed approval of the NWFP PC-I in the correct
amounts and it was stated that there had been no approval for any alteration.

        The mission concluded that however the error had arisen, it would have
been detected if any of the NWFP documents or drawings had been checked or if
the site had been visited. Failure to build the required facilities had left the TTI in
serious difficulties and it is to be hoped that the comprehensive task of remedying
the situation will be vigorously addressed.

                     Disbvsement of Credit on Total ~ojectL/



       At Appraisal the total foreign funding for the Third Education Project was
estimated a t US$l 1.1 million, or 40.8 per cent of the total estimated project cost.
Of the foreign funding the allocation to the Basic Education Component was
uSS4.3 million, or 38.7 per cent of the total.        This sum includes estimated
contingencies. The Credit Agreement in the event provided for a total Credit of
US$IXO million, within the same total estimated project cost.        Page 4 of this
Appendix shows the Project Financial Plan reflecting the Credit Agreement.


        At closure, the total withdrawal of the Credit was USS11.4 million, or 76
per cent of the credit total.


        Page 5 of this Appendix gives comparisions of Appraisal Estimates and
Actual Disbursement of Credit by category and also compares the differently-
constructed Credit Agreement figures.


        Although the use of total available credit was only 76 per cent and the
whole project cost was 79 per cent of Appraisal Estimate, the actual disbursement
of Credit amounted to 104 per cent of Appraisal estimate for foreign exchange.
The under-spending was thus effected in the local funding element.        The major
extra expenditure of Credit was in the civil works category.



                  Rate of Disbursement of Credit (Total Project)


        The rate of disbursement was slow, reflecting delays in the implementation
of the civil works due to site acquisition problems, slow progress by contractors
and some delays in funding.    By the original closure date only 52 per cent of the
Credit total had been disbursed, this represented 71 per cent of total Appraisal
Estimate.   Page 6 of this Appendix shows Estimated and Actual Disbursement
Schedules. See page 7 for Graph Disbursement Curve.

           Dear Sir,

                       Ilhamk you very such f o r your l e t t e r of March 17,
           1986 alongwith pro3ect completion report for Third mucation
           Project of Pakistan, IDA Credit No,678-Oak,            I have gone
           through the completion report and my observations on the
            a r t of report pertaining t o Sind Agriculture University
           Bandojam ace a* under:

           1,          The Third Education Prodect provides for the
           following component8 for SAU Tandodam a s under:

                             aivii woske,

                             Procurement of Books & Scientific Equipment,

                       A s regards the component of civil works, it ma;l
           be mentioned that the works provided under IDA Credit have
           eucceesfully been completed without major change,             The
           buildings constructed under IDA C r e d i t are being used for
           the teaching and research purpoee,      It may be pointed out

that the major portion of the funds provided for c i v i l works
under Third Education Project was meant for campus development
of University t o include the addition and amelioration of
electric suppl~/distributian s~rstema t the campue, water supply
and distribution and drainage sewerage Sr&em,    It is observed
that due t o non-completion of above works within due date, the
original cost of works has escalated and thus the increased
portion of coet i e being met from the University's regular
grante instead of Third Education Project because the Third
Education Project has since been terminated on 304-1984,       The
position of original and revised cost and the size of hrndcr
spent from Universit%'s internal resourcee i e ae under;

Total:

          It could be seen from above position that inspite of
the fact that entire funding of above works wae t o be made by
World Bank, yet the actual funding position stande as under:




1, Addition & amelioration    3.700  3.099 83%    0.601     1%

Thus university spent i t s local resources t o the tune of
Rs,6,464 millions i,e, 4U$ of the cost, t o complete the
works provided under Third Education Project,                 This situation
has naturally affected the other development works of
University.

2.                The University has been able t o u t i l i z e the
f a c i l i t i e s provided under Fellowship Programme more
effectively,             According t o the original schedule, the
fellowship f a c i l i t i e s included; 10 f o r Ph,D,,     10 f o r M.Sc,
and 7 for short trainings,              The practical use of the
f a c i l i t i e s i s a s under:

                         PLDe             m e

                iii Short Trainings,
                 21                              6 NOS,

                   T h i s shows that a s against the provision f o r
M,Sc.      fellowships, the University has been able t o train
13 teachers t o the level of Ph,D, instead of M-SC, This
naturally necessitated more time allocation with the result
that the original fellowship programme of 57-Man Years was
revised t o 70.5-Man            Years,  A s regards the effect of training
of teachers on the quality of education, it may be mentioned
that the approved enrolment of University is 3000 f o r which
at least 300 Faculty members shall be appointed t o make the
teacher-student r a t i o of 1:10,           The foreign training of only
19 teachers i.e,             13 upto Ph,D, and 6 upto M,Sc, is totally
inadequate t o meet the requirement,              The fellowship.f a c i l i t i e s
provided under Third Education Project works out t o only 6.3?,?
of the t o t a l teaching strength,           Approximately 30 more teachers
have been got trained under other educational and cultural
programmes and Ce0.T- etc.              Thus the t o t a l qualified teachers
i n various disciplines are 49 only i,e. hardly 1% of t o t a l
sfmg-the           You w i l l kindly agree with me that it is d i f f i c u l t
for a profsssional science university t o maintain the quality
of education with only 1%              qualified staff,     Besides the
quality of education, one of the important function of SPU
is t o conduct research i n various disciplines of Agriculture
Science,           The conduct of sophisticated research a t University
level with such a minimum qualified staff is rather impossible.

                   This situation leads me t o the conclusion that until1
and unless a sufficient number of training f a c i l i t i e s is provided
f o r university teaching staff, there is no possibility of
improving the quality of education,               As such the investment
already made by Uorld Bank under TeEeP, f o r SBU w i l l either go
waste or under-utilized,

sent abroad for higher studies returned back at the time when
most of the equipment was either rsobived or was on the ww,
Under these circurmstences, the selection of equipment wae not
proper,   In order t o meet this deficiency, more funds are
needed t o procure latest and modern equipment,

           Taking into consideration the above aspects of
utilisation of facilities for Sl,U Tandojam, I suggest that
an other follo       prodect in continuity of TeEoP. may be
prepared by the7orld     Bank so as t o develop and improve the
facilities for agricultural education i n two important
provinces of Pakistan viz., Bind and Baluchistan,            I there-
fore i n the interest of quality of education and development
of research activities a t SAU Tando am, would suggest that
an other identifying technical miss on be sent to SlU Tandojam
                                      1
t o discuss and finalize the programme for recouping the
deficiencies explained above.
