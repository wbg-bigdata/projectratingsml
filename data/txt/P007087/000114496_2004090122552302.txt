maternal mortality rates in Health Service Areas by 10% by the third
quarter of 1996 and by 15% by the completion of the Project, as
compared to such rates in effect for 1991. The Borrower, through
MSP, shall likewise exert its best efforts to bring the percent of
children under three years of age and of pregnant women in Health
Service Areas who are malnourished to 35% by the third quarter of

interests of the Borrower and the Bank and to accomplish the
purposes of the Loan.
      Section 3.20. Each of the IEOS and CRM Agreements shall be for

                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to: (a) expand public basic
health care, nutrition and sanitation services, and improve already
existing public basic health care services, for the poorest sectors
of the population in Ecuador; and (b) achieve institutional
strengthening of the public entities involved in the delivery of
such services.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such

from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     Basic Health Care

among Health Service Areas; (b) equipping, upgrading, rehabili-
tation, repair and maintenance of approximately 130 existing health
subcenters, approximately nine existing health centers and approxi-
mately seven existing hospitals distributed among Health Service
Areas; and (c) equipping and maintenance of approximately 12
existing hospitals, distributed among Health Service Areas, which do
not require upgrading, rehabilitation or repair.

the basis of a basic health care services delivery model which
emphasizes the provision of preventative services at the community
level to family units; (b) training of staff of such MSP facilities
in techniques necessary for the proper implementation of such
services delivery model; (c) implementation of a mass media campaign
to disseminate information regarding such services delivery model to

supplies (including contraceptives) to MSP facilities in Health
Service Areas for use in treating patients served by such
facilities; (b) provision of technical assistance and training to
MSP and CEMEIM staff on stock management, warehousing, distribution,
accounting, procurement and cost recovery techniques associated with
supplying generic medicines and basic medical supplies; and (c)

           (ii)    Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                   the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                   documents and other evidence required pursuant
                   to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                   or payments in respect of which replenishment is
                   requested. On the basis of each such request,
                   the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
                   withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into
                   the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                   shall have requested and as shall have been
                   shown by said documents and other evidence to
                   have been paid out of the Special Account for
                   eligible expenditures.
      All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other
evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Page  26
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal
the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after andto the extent that 
the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure
or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the
Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
