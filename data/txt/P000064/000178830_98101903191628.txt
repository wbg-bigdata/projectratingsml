REPORT AND REC(I'TH,ENDATION OF THE P2ESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIREECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF DAHOMY
FOR A COTTON PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Dahomey in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to US$6,100,000 on standard IDA terms to help finance a project
for developing cotton production.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Dahomey has been independent since 1960 and a member of the
Bank Group since 1963. In 1966, the Government requested IDA assistance
for an agricultural development project in the Hinvi area of southern
Dahomey. The purpose of the project was to develop 6,000 ha. of oil
palms and 6,000 ha. of food crops. In 1969 the Association made a $4.6
million credit (144-DA), and Fonds dtAide et de Cooperation (FAC) of
France made a grant of the same amount, to finance a palm oil factory,
maize storage silos, palm plantings, food crop development and related
infrastructure. The difficulties encountered with this project and the
actions proposed to deal with them were reported to the Executive
Directors in my memorandum of September 13, 1971 (IDA/R70-63). Agree-
ment on those actions was reached in Washington in September of this year
with a delegation led by H.E. Chabi Mama, Minister of Rural Development
and Cooperation. Disbursements are much behind schedule, but they can
now be expected to accelerate.  (See Annex I for a summary statement of
IDA credits as of December 31, 1971).
3.        In 1967, the UNDP financed a survey of Dahomey's land transport
requirements and the Bank acted as Executing Agency. As a result of the
survey, a $3.5 million Development Credit (215-DA) for highway mainte-
nance and engineering was made in 1969. Execution of this project is
proceeding satisfactorily, including the engineering studies which are
expected to lead to a road project in 1973.
4.        A long-term program for cotton development has been carried
out since 1964 wfith financial support from FAC and the Fonds Europeen de
Developpement (FED) of the European Communities.  The proposed project,
which would be financed concurrently by IDA and FAC, -was identified by
the Bank's Permanent Mission in Western Africa (PMT14A) and appraised in
January/February 1971. The Development Credit Agreement and the other
legal documents were negotiated in TArashington in September 1971.
Representatives of FAC participated in the negotiations.

5.        Presentation to the Executive Directors was delayed because
institutional arrangements regaarding the marketing of cotton seed and
the management of credit had to be further discussed in December at the
request of the Government. Final agreement was reached with the
Government in mid-January. The credit has been increased by $400,000
over the amount originally negotiated to take account of the increase
in project costs in terms of US dollars resulting from the currency re-
alignments of 1971.
6.        As discussed briefly in Part II below and more fully in the
Economic Memorandum attached as Annex II, Dahomey faces serious economic
problems at two levels. The first is the fragile financial position of
the public sector. This is in part the result of ineffectual management,
aggravated by frequent changes of government. The need now is to re-
establish control over the volume and direction of public spending and to
increase revenues. The second is that the Government has not developed
an economic strategy which would make the best use of a narrow resource
base and has actually contributed to a growing disparity of incomes
between town and countryside. The two are of course interconnected. The
narrow resource base means a narrow revenue base; even with strong
financial management the scope for public savings will be limited for a
number of years. As it is, weak financial management has hampered efforts
to develop new resources. The Bank Group's approach must be tackled
together. In close collaboration with the IlF, Bank missions have been
discussing with the Government measures to regain control of expenditures
and improve revenue collection, to reorder spending priorities and to
introduce more effective development planning. By lending for projects
to increase production in the rural areas, as in the case now proposed,
the Bank Group, in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral sources
of financial and technical assistance, particularly the European Econo-
mic Community and France, can help to strengthen the resource base and
improve income distribution. In the course of the next two fiscal years
it is hoped to bring forward proposals for the rehabilitation and improve-
ment of the Parakou-Malanville road, which is part of the main North-South
artery and an integrated rural development project in the south. Also
under preparation is an education project that would be a first step
towards relating the education system to manpower needs.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
7.        Prior to independence in 1960, Dahomey was part of the large
French West Africa Federation, which provided part of the costs of public
services and offered wider prospects for employment than could be found
in Dahomey. Dahomey produced many of the educated elite of French West
Africa and provided many of the civil servants in both the federal and
other local administrations. In the years following independence they
became unemployed or unwanted and returned to Dahomey, a small country,
poor in natural resources, faced with latent regional antagonisms and
hard pressed to establish a viable political framework. In these circum-
stances, political instability has been reflected in an unsatisfactory use
of government resources and the lack of an effective approach to economic
development.



- 3 -
8.        Dahomey has virtually no mineral resources or manufactures
which could be a source of substantial foreign exchange earnings. The
only physical resource available at present is cultivable land. Progress
in the use of this resource has been slow and per capita income of
village people has been stagnant. The disparity between rural and urban
incomes has been growing, leading to rapid urban growth which constitutes
one of the main problems facing Dahomey.
9.        Efforts to accelerate agricultural development since independence
have focussed mainly on export crops. Oil palm, one of Dahomey's tradi-
tional assets, has received assistance from various foreign sources and
in particular was the main object of the first IDA-financed project.
Modern cotton cultivation was introduced around the middle of this
century. This crop is presently one of Dahomey's main assets. It gives
satisfactory returns, and the farmers are interested in its development.
Furthermore, modern cotton cultivation also benefits food crops grom in
rotation with it. However, the comparative advantage now enjoyed by
cotton is likely to diminish and greater attention will have to be given
to food crops such as rice and maize, some of which could be exported to
neighboring countries, and to cattle raising.  As indicated with respect
to the Hinvi project, there have been difficulties in developing a program
to encourage food crops production by subsistence farmers. Nevertheless,
such efforts are important and, in the project area, a study to be
financed under the proposed project is expected to lead to a crop diversi-
fication project. In the south, we hope it will soon be possible, in
the light of experience derived from the Hinvi project and its continuing
food crop program, to identify a project for agricultural development on
an integrated basis, and we are prepared in principle to assist the Govern-
ment in preparing and financing it. Finally, we also hope that livestock
resources in northern Dahomey can be developed.
10.       The development of human resources has been very poorly related
to the development potential of the country. Formal education, which
absorbs the bulk of a relatively large education budget, has been provid-
ing training almost exclusively for clerical employment and fostering hopes
of a different and better life in the cities. The number of literate
unemployed continues to increase and the Government is always under
pressure to create jobs for them. Uhat may be most needed as a basis
for sustained economic development is to provide manpower training which
would make possible a better use of available physical resources. That
would mean a major reorientation of the education system. In this pers-
pective, the first education project now under preparation would include
a manpower survey and curriculum development for primary and secondary
education.
11.       In infrastructure, due to the small size of the country and its
location, most projects have a regional aspect.  The improvement of the
North-South axis would yield appreciable benefits to both Dahomey and Niger.



-4-
It should, however, be followfed by smaller projects for the improvement
of feeder roads, which would be to the advantage of the rural areas. Some
investments may also be justified in regional telecommunications. Power
is imported from Ghana, which will remain the most economic source of
energy for some time.
12.       Additional sources of foreign exchange may be found some day in
off-shore oil, where exploration is actively underway.
13.       Great efforts will be required to improve the budgetary situation
and the use of government resources.  Government deficits have been a
cause for concern and IMF fiscal experts have suggested measures to increase
government revenues. The Government has implemented some of these suggest-
ions and has invited a new vJBF missiLon to discuss the implementation of
further measures.  However, a balanced budget cannot be achieved without
rigorous control over current expenditures, which requires in the first
instance that the Government be able to resist pressures for the continued
creation of new Jobs on the government payroll. The Government recently
informed the Association of its intention to recruit only for replacement
purposes at the higher levels and to defer salary increases, but considers
similar measures impossible in education at this time. Since it will be
some time before Dahomey can reasonably be expected to generate substantial
public savings, the immediate objective is to secure a better allocation of
resources and in particular a better maintenance of government fixed
capital, such as schools and roads, and more financing for those govern-
ment services which are related to productive developments, such as agri-
cultural extension services. The Government has agreed to discuss these
questions, as well as the level of government expenditures, with a forth-
coming economic mission.
14.       Since the Dahomean economy has a very limited capacity to
generate savings, even with improved fiscal performance by the Government,
foreign lenders should be prepared to finance part of the local costs of
productive investments. Due to Dahomey's poverty and difficult develop-
ment prospects, it is clear that external assistance should be provided as
far as possible on concessional terms.
PART III - THE PROJECT
15.       An appraisal report, entitled "The Zou-Borgou Cotton Project -
Dahomeyt" (PA-99a), dated January 21, 1972, is being distributed separately.
A credit and project summary is at Amnex III.
16.       The project area, located in the center and north of the country
(see attached map) enjoys favorable conditions for cotton cultivation, and
the quality of the cotton is good. The Government has maintained producer
prices at levels which at present world market prices leave room for large
surpluses by the marketing organization, even after the recent realignment
of currencies, but are attractive to farmers. The vast majority of the
Dahomean people (over 80 percent) draw their livelihood from agriculture,
although agricultural production has failed to keep pace with the growth
in population, and an increased effort is needed to raise productivity in
the food crop sector.



- 5 -
17.       The project aims at developing cotton production by extending
cotton growing areas in two large districts, the Borgou and the Zou,
from 29,000 ha. to 59,000 ha. over a four-year period. The number of
farmers growing cotton would increase from 29,000 to 41,000. Production
of maize and groundnuts, grown in rotation with cotton, is also expected
to double. In addition, rice production would be developed on some
3,300 ha. and rice milling facilities provided. This project would be
the culmination of a program supported up to now with financial and techni-
cal assistance from France and managed by CFDT and by SATEC (see para. 19
below). The present program, which started in 1966, represents the only
practicable means at this time of substantially improving the standard of
living of a large segment of the rural population and improving Dahomeyts
balance of payments.
18.       The project would cover the four-year period 1971-74.  Its
principal components would be:
a) the provision of staff and equipment to the "Societe Nationale
Agricole pour le Coton" (SONACO0), which will administer exten-
sion, credit and marketing services;
b) establishment of a revolving fund to provide cotton growers
with seasonal and medium-term credit;
c) construction of two ginneries in the project area to increase
annual ginning capacity from 43,000 tons of seed cotton to
67,000 tons and provision of six small rice mills to process
3,600 tons of paddy;
d) rehabilitation of about 620 km of feeder roads;
e) execution of field trials to adapt research results for
practical application;
f) provision of funds for the preparation of an agricultural diver-
sification project in the Borgou and Zou districts.
19.       The Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperation would oversee
project execution with the help of the following organizations:
- Societe Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SONACO), a government-
owned, autonomous corporation established in 1971 to develop
the production of cotton and other crops in the north and center
of Dahomey and to organize primary marketing; its statutes are
acceptable to the Association; the posts of General Manager,
Deputy General Manager and Financial Manager would at all times
be held by persons whose qualifications and experience are
acceptable to the Association; the Financial Manager would
initially be provided by CFDT;



- 6 -
- Compagnie Francaise pour le D6veloppement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT) is a French statutory corporation with public and
private participation (societe d'6conomie mixte) established in
1949 to provide assistance in the production, ginning and
marketing of fiber crops, particularly cotton. CFDT is financed
mainly by the French Government and has its headquarters in
Paris and regional offices in several French-speaking African
countries including Dahomey;
- Societe d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC) is a French
government corporation established in 1956 to provide technical
assistance for the development of production, particularly in
agriculture, also with headquarters in Paris and offices in
several African countries, including Dahomey;
- Direction des Travaux Publics (DTP) is a department of the
M4inistry of Public WJorks.
20.       The Government would, by a contract which is acceptable to the
Association, entrust SONACO with the development of production and the
organization of primary marketing, i.e., delivery by the producers to
the marketing organization (CFDT), or to the ginneries. For that purpose,
SONACO would provide extension services and credit.  Extension services
would be contracted to CFDT in the Borgou district and SATEC in the Zou
under terms which are satisfactory to the Association. Personnel employed
by SONACO, including government personnel seconded to SONACO, Dahomean
personnel heretofore employed by CFDT and SATEC, and foreign personnel
employed by CFDT and SATEC, would work in an integrated structure with a
single chain of command. The contract will provide for in-service training
of Dahomean personnel and lay down a timetabl- for their taiing over posi-
tions that have to be filled initially by expatriates. The Government
would undertake to make available the necessary financial resources for
the execution of these contracts.
21.       The organization of credit has posed a problem.  The Banque
Dahomeenne de Developpement (BDD), which might have been expected to
handle it, has an unsatisfactory record. It ceased agricultural credit
operations in 1963 and requires a thorough reorganization before it could
resume them. Credit operations in the project area are presently managed
by CFDT and SATEC with financial resources provided by the Fonds de Sta-
bilisation et de Soutien des Prix des Produits a l'Exportation (FAS).
Under the proposed project the I4inistry of Agriculture would establish an
agricultural credit fund for the project area, which SONACO would manage.
Short-term credit would be provided for seasonal inputs and medium-term
credit for agricultural equipment. Satisfactory credit procedures have
been agreed.
22.       For the purchasing and ginning of seed cotton and the marketing
of cotton lint, the Government would enter into a joint venture (associa-
tion en participation) with CFDT, the terms of which are acceptable to
the Association. Each partner would put at the disposal of the venture



-7-
its relevant capital assets (gimneries and storage facilities). Profits
and losses would be shared between the Government and CFDT in the ratio
4:1, except for losses attributable to government decisions, e.g. should
the producer price be set too high, or to CFDT, e.g. should there be
mismanagement.  CFDT's liabilitv would be limited to profits previously
received plus CFAF 5 million../ CFDT would also be contracted to design
and construct two ginneries to be owned by the Government and put at the
disposal of the venture. The terms of the contract are satisfactory to
the Association.
23.       Marketing cotton seed has been carried out since 1969 by OCAD),
a public marketing organization which has not proved efficient. In the
course of negotiations it was accordingly agreed that CFDT would take over
the marketing of cotton seed under the joint venture arrangements. The
draft Credit Agreement provides that any change in these arrangements would
be subject to the approval of the Association.
24.       Under the proposed project, 620 km of feeder roads would be
improved by the Department of Public TWorks (DTP), which would establish
a special unit, open a separate account and engage consultants for this
purpose. The list of roads to be improved each year would be drawn up by
SONACO in consultation with DTP and presented to the Association for
approval. The Government would also undertake to maintain satisfactorily
the feeder roads in the project area.

25.       The estimated project cost and respective contributions thereto
by IDA, FAC and the Government would be as follows:

Percentage of project
cost (including taxes)   48.0        24.5        27.5
Percentage of project
cost (net of taxes)       54.4       27.8        17.8
26.       The Government's financial contribution to SONACO to finance the
salaries of Dahomean personnel and other expenditures on extension services
should not give rise to budgetary problems since a large part is expected
to be provided from the Goverriaent's share in the profits of the joint
venture (see paragraph 28 below). Increased revenues expected to result
from the project, for example from export taxes, would more than cover the
remainder of the government contribution to project costs.
27.       The Government's share in the profits of the joint venture would
be applied in the first instance to setting up a special cotton price
stabilization account within the FAS and maintaining it at a level of
2!  Including taxes of about 12 percent, equivalent to about $1.5 million.



CFAF 500 million, and thereafter to meeting the annual costs of SONACO
for extension services in the project area. Any excess over these re-
quirements would be applied to the improvement of cotton extension
services outside the project area. The alternative would also be open
for the Government to raise the producer price, which under the draft
Credit Agreement-would be reviewed annually with the Association. -All- the
profits would thus remain in the rural sector of the economy.
28.       To illustrate the importance of the Government's 80 percent
share in the profits of the joint venture, the folloinTng table gives an
estimate of what it would be on the assumption of a projected decline in
the world market price for cotton of about 15 percent a year through
1975, an average annual increase of 5 percent in the cost of farm inputs
provided by the joint venture and an unchanged producer price.

29.       The Government would undertake to make sufficient funds avail-
able in advance on a quarterly basis to each of the project accounts:
SOMACO's account (for extension services), the agricultural credit fund,
the ginneries construction account, and the feeder road account of DTP.
30.       Procurement of fertilizers, insecticides, sprayers, farm equip-
ment, corrugated steel pipes, vehicles, ginnery and rice milling machinery,
etc., totalling about $8.0 million equivalent, would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Tenders for the construction of
stores, houses and offices (total cost about $330,000) would be let locally
since the individual contracts would be too small to justify calls for
bids outside Dahomey. Furniture and office equipment (total cost about
$45,000), for which there is adequate local competition, would be procured
according to the Government's procedures, which are satisfactory.
31.       Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made as follows:
a) 100 percent of the c.i.f. Cotonau costs of goods directly
imported for the project such as ginnery equipment and rice
hullers, corrugated steel, pipes and vehicles, estimated at
US$1.12 million;
b) 90 oercent of the cost of office equipment and furniture,
building and road construction, applied research, and the
feasibility study, about Us$1.99 million; and
c) 100 percent of the c.i.f. Cotonou costs of fertilizers, insecti-
cides, and agricultural equipment to be purchased before
December 31, 1972 and 15 percent in each of the following years,
about US$2.59 million.
32.       The project would be expected to raise substantially the cash
incomes of about 41,000 participating farmers (about 350,000 persons includ-
ing their families) of whom about 12,000 would be new. Total annual net



- 10 -
cash returns on the project would almost triDle between 1970 and 1975
from CFAF 580 million to 1,570 million, or an average increase of about
$95 per participating family.
33.       Dahomey's cotton exports during the project period (1971-74)
are expected to increase from 35,000 tons to 82,000 tons, mainly as a
result of the project, and the resulting foreign exchange earnings are
expected to double, from $10 million to $20 million. Dahomey's increased
cotton exports will, however, have only a negligible impact on the world
market.
34.       Assuming a project life of 10 years, the economic rate of return
on the project is estimated at 34 percent. No economic cost has been
attributed to farm labor in view of the extensive under-enrployment in
Dahomey and the lack of alternative employment opportunities. All labor
will be provided by participating families and no hired labor will be
required. The estimated rate of return would be reduced to 19 percent if
the benefits were 15 percent lower on account of a steeper decline in
world market prices than now forecast or of lower yields. Part of the
expected benefits arise from extension work and investments already
carried out in the project area.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Dahomey and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Societe Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SONACO),
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project
Agreement conform substantially to the pattern of agreement used for
this type of project.
37.       In addition to the standard conditions of effectiveness, we
have included the followi-ng conditions in the Credit Agreement: a) the
execution and delivery of the Project Agreement, the contract between
SONACO and the Government, the contracts betw,ueen the Government and CFDT
and SATEC, and the Convention de Mandat de Gestion establishing the asso-
ciation en participation between the Government and CFDT; b) the appoint-
ment of the General Manager, Deputy General Manager and Financial Manager
of SONACO who shall be acceptable to the Association; c) appointment by
FAS of an experienced accountant and carrying out by FAS of accounting
procedures satisfactory to the Association; d) completion of the necessary
action by the Government to allow SONACO to comply with the agricultural
lending procedures set down in the Credit Agreement; e) completion of the
necessary governmental measures for the marketing of cotton seed through
CFDT; and f) certification that there has been no material adverse change
in SONACO's condition since the date of signing of the credit.

ANNEX II
ECONOMIC E`4O?A1NXDUM
1.       lDahomey is one of the poorest countries in Africa and has
made little economic progress during the first decade of independence.
The production of goods and services has developed only slowly. External
trade and the government budget have been in deficit throughout these
years. However, partly owing to high export prices, there has been some
improvement in the country's economic position in 1970 and 1971. Part
of the country's economic difficulties has been due to political instabil-
ity and the inability of successive governments to impose austerity and
improve resource allocation.
Political and social aspects
2.        Since independence, in 1960, Dahomey has had a series of poli-
tical crises and eight changes of government which have reduced the
effectiveness of development planning in the public sector. The main
cause of that instability was regional affiliations and antagonisms
reflecting traditional rivalries between ancient kingdoms. The present
Presidential Council is an attempt to reconcile these differences, as it
is composed of Messrs. Hubert JIaga from the north, Ahomadegbe from the
center and Apithy from the south. Bach member will in turn hold the office
of Head of State for two years. Mr. Hubert Maga is serving the first
term and is due to be succeeded by  Lr. Ahomadegbe in 1972.
3.        From the economic vietpoint, it is important to note that the
political system is increasingly dominated by the urban class, made up
largely of public employees and private wage earners, two small but priv-
ileged groups which until now have successfully defeated all attempted
austerity measures. The gap between their standard of living and that of
rural people has been increasing, which largely explains the growing rural
exodus, despite the fact that employment possibilities in the modern
sector are seriously lagging. This problem is further aggravated by
Dahomey's education system which is almost totally unrelated to the rural
environment and largely irrelevant to economic realities.  By contributing
to the growing rural exodus of school leavers, the system is hampering
the development of the agricultural sector and is at the same time
contributing to increasing urban unemployment. This widening gap between
rural and urban areas is likely to loom ever larger in Dahomey's political
life, and to become one of the central problems of economic policy.
Recent economic and financial developments
4.        Between 1965 and 1970, the GDP at current prices grew by about
5.5 percent per annum. As prices appear to have risen at an annual rate
of about 2-1/2 percent, and population to have grown by around 2.8 per
cent per annum, per capita income has remained virtually unchanged over
the past five years. There are only provisional data for the years
subsequent to 1966; but indications are that there has been some



ANNEX II
Page 2
acceleration in the growth of GDP at current prices in 1969 (5.1 percent)
and 1970 (5.6 percent) compared to 1968 (3.6 percent). This modest
acceleration in growth is partly due to increased agricultural production.
Cotton production has risen from 9,000 tons in 1966/67 to 29,000 tons in
1969/70 and a further increase to 40,000 tons is expected in the 1970/71
crop year. There are plans to expand production to 80,000 tons by
197V/75. Oil palm is the other crop which is growing at a favorable
rate. The value of palm product exports rose from CFAF 3.7 billion in
1967 to about CFAF 6.9 billion in 1969. The area under cultivation for
oil palm has increased substantially over recent years (from about 9,000
hectares in 1965 to about 20,000 hectares in 1970) largely through the
planting program  of SONADE/ which is progressively replacing wild
palm groves with higher yielding trees. During the next four years this
program is expected to give rise to a 50 percent increase in production.
Export receipts will however increase less rapidly since the price for
palm oil is expected to decline from its present high level. Other export
crops such as coffee and tobacco have also increased over recent years
but remain of minor significance.
5.        The industrial sector in Dahomey is still small and does not
yet contribute much to economic growth. Manufacturing, mining and cons-
truction account for some 12 percent of GDP. Despite government measures
to promote industrialization, progress has been slow due to the small
size of the market and the lack of regional cooperation. On the other
hand, trade and transport have expanded more rapidly than the rest of the
economy. This is mainly attributable to the sharp increase in transit
trade with Nigeria (mainly consumer goods) after the outbreak of the
civil war. Similarly, unrecorded exports from Nigeria, especially cocoa
and groundnuts, have shown a sharp rise. This trade has considerably
boosted Dahomey's export and fiscal receipts. Now that the political and
economic situation in Nigeria is back to normal, these windfall profits
for the Dahomean economy are decreasing.
6.        Economic growth during 1970 and 1971 has also benefitted from
high prices for palm oil and cotton, the country's most important export
products. These high prices are probably the principal factor in the
marked increase in the country's foreign assets (from $12 million in
August 1970 to $23 million in August 1971, equivalent to about 5 months
of imports) and in the improvements in the budgetary situation, which
will be discussed below. Unfortunately, palm oil and cotton prices are
expected to decline again in the next several years. Unless the country's
structural problems are solved, this will lead to renewed financial
difficulties.

7.        These financial difficulties stem from large over-spending on
national account. Over the last five years, expenditures have totalled
113 percent of GDP - consumption 97 percent and investment 14 percent.
Domestic savings were only 3 percent and financed only a small proportion
of investment. This degree of dependence goes beyond the assistance
which Dahomey could expect to receive from abroad and serious diffi-
culties, particularly in government financing, have been the result.
When export prices return in the next few years to a lower level,!/ the
Governmentts financial weakness will again be in evidence, unless the
structure of government finance is improved in the meantime. The
improvement of resource mobilization will undoubtedly remain the most
pressing problem of the Dahomean economy.
Budgetary situation
8.        Since independence, Dahomey has suffered from budget deficits
which could be financed only with continued French budget support. The
main reasons for the deficits were on the expenditure side: the continuing
growth of personnel expenditures and the mounting outlays on education.
Partly because of its political instability, the Government has never
been strong enough to resist the pressure to absorb Dahomeans previously
employed in other TWestern African countries as well as new graduates.
Each new government created jobs to satisfy its political clientele.
During the last few years an average of about two thousand new positions
were created annually and the number of public sector employees amounted
to about 20,000.  Salary payments account for two-thirds of government
expenditure. At the same time, the growth of education expenditures
reflected an apparent belief in Dahomey that there can be no misspending
on education. One may hope, howfever, that in the future the Government
will be able to resist the pressures for government job creation, and
that education policy will be adapted to the economic realities of the
country.
9.        In recent years, government revenues increased rapidly, due
mainly to import taxes, and current expenditures increased more slowly.
In 1970, the current deficit was substantially lower than in previous
years (see table, p. 7 of this Annex). However, this improvement was
partly due to a change in budgetary presentation which included transfers
from the funds of government agencies and enterprises of CFAF 730 million
as a current budget item rather than as a financing item as in earlier
years. A consistent presentation shows an estimated current account
deficit in 1970 of about CFAF 440 million or 4 percent of revenue.
Furthermore, the increase in tax revenues from imports in 1970 was to
some extent due to higher import prices following the 1969 devaluation
and also to the rapidly expanded transit trade with Nigeria during the
civil war and its aftermath.
1/ During the recent currency realignment the relation of the CFA
franc to the French franc remained unchanged. The CFA franc has thus
been revalued upward vis-a-vis the US dollar.



AMTEXII

10.       The improvement of the budgetazr situation has continued in
1971. Budget accounts from January to September showTed a small surplus
(CFAF 0.5 billion - 5 percent of government revenue) and, although
expenditures in the last part of the year are usually rather heavy,
budget equilibrium for the full year 1971 is likely. This satisfactory
result is due to certain new tax measures (i.e. increase in import taxes
and transit taxes, and improved tax collection) but probably the most
important cause of the improvement is the increase in the volume of
cotton and palm oil exports and the high prices for these products
throughout 1971.
11.       The budget deficits prior to 1971 have been financed by French
budget subsidies, Central Bank advances, and, especially before 1966, by
deferment of payments to the private sector. During recent years, the
Dahomean Government has moreover increasingly used reserve funds of public
entities. These transfers have by now virtually exhausted the reserves
of these entities and impaired their borrowing and self-financing capacity.
12.       One reason for the increasirg use of the reserve funds of public
entities was that ordinary fiscal receipts have been increasingly ear-
marked for a number of special funds. The most important of these
special accounts is the "Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement"t, which was set
up to liquidate unpaid bills to the private sector accumulated before
December 1966. The "Caisse" has operated very successfully.  Because a
special tax has been made availab'le to it, an aggregate of CFAF 2 billion
in debts outstanding at the end of 1966 is now likely to be repaid by
the end of 1971. There has also been some reduction in the amount of
unpaid bills accumulated since 1966; the amount outstanding in 1970 was
CFAF 0.7 billion.  The Government is now considering a proposal to extend
the functions of the 1Caaisse" to debts incurred after 1966, and to entrust
it with the administration and service of long and medium-term external
public debt.
13.       At the end of 1969, Dahomeyts external -public debt (including
amounts contracted for but undisbursed) amounted to CFAF 12.1 billion,
of which CFAF 2.8 billion was owed to private sources, mainly on account
of suppliers' credits.  The remaining CFAF 9.3 billIon wzas held by
official creditors, mainly the governments of France, Canada, Germany,
the Ivory Coast and Zaire. Debt service payments will rise considerably
during the next twro years and reach betw--een CFAF 1.0 billion and CFAF
1.2 billion which is equivalent to 8 to 10 percent of 1970 exports.
Furthermore, one has to take into account Dahomey's unconsolidated debt,
wrhich amounts to about CFAF 3.7 billion, of which CFAF 2.7 billion is
owed to France.
Prospects and Bank involvement
14.       The main factors of growth in the next several years will be
the expansion of oil palm and cotton production and the increase in
domestic processing of these products. Groundnut production is also
likely to increase. Taking into account also the prospects for a few



ANNEX II
Page 5
minor crops, this expansion sho'ild lead to an overall growth rate of
export volume of six percent a year until 1975. However, in view of the
expected decline in palm oil,, cotton and groundnut prices from their
present high level, it is likely that the value of exports in 1975 will
hardly be higher than the value of 1971 exports. In view of the
importance of exports for the Dahomean economy, prospects are that
overall economic growth during the first half of the 1970's is also
likely to remain at a low level.
15.       These overall economic prospects provide the setting for the
Government's budgetary prospects. In the short term, the situation is
unlikely to improve and the Government's financial position may even
deteriorate during the coming two years, because of the probable reduc-
tion of transit trade with Nigeria, the increasing foreign debt service,
the less favorable wvorld market prospects for palm oil, cotton and ground-
nuts, the lack of important and immediately productive development
projects (besides cotton) and finally the continued pressure on the
Government's recruitment policy. This prospect, however, only enhances
the need for early action if the Government is to become able to parti-
cipate significantly in the financing of economic development. The
Government seems to be aware of these problems and the lines along which
action is required.
16.       The Bank has been discussing the situation with the Government
and has been seeking agreement on measures to improve budgetary per-
formance. The Government has declared its intention to take steps toward
a reduction of the current budget deficit and, in consultation with the
Bank, has taken or is considering the following measures:
a) At the end of 1970, the Government received technical
assistance from the Fund in the fiscal field. The Fundts
experts made a comprehensive study of Dahomey's present tax
system and concluded that improvements in assessment and
collection are the most promising means to raise revenue in the
immediate future.  Specific measures have been recommended which
would increase revenues by about CFAF 1265 million (16 percent
of 1970 revenue). In 1971, the Government consolidated the
income taxes on wages and salaries into a single progressive
tax to be withheld at source. It has also taken measures to
improve the staffing of the tax department, whose lack of
qualified personnel has been a major bottleneck. The Govern-
ment also should take new fiscal measures to compensate for
the loss of the solidarity tax. This tax, a special austerity
levy on salary incomes introduced in 1966, had an annual yield
of CFAF 1 billion (15 percent of 1970 revenue). This tax, which
was very unpopular, was abolished in 1970. So far, no new
taxes have been introduced which could yield comparable revenues.



ANNEX II'
Page 6
b) The Government has informed the Bank that it is strictly
limiting the hiring of government personnel to the numbers
that are required to replace those who retire from ser-
vice. However, the Government intends to continue hiring
additional personnel for education and tax administration.
vlhile we could agree with the need to strengthen tax adminis-
tration, we have serious doubts regarding further increases
in education ex3penditures which already appear too high.
The forthcoming economic mission will discuss the level of
education expenditures with the Government.
c) The Government has also stated that it intends to manage
government salary payments in such a way that the increase
in the cost of salaries will be slowed down considerably.
Since the abolition of the solidarity tax had led to an in-
crease in the disposable income of public servants, the
Government should be able to freeze salaries at the present
level.
17.       The Government has agreed to discuss these problems with the
forthcoming economic mission. The main purpose of this mission will be
to assess the country's long-term development prospects and investment
requirements and to give advice on ways in which the Government can
improve resource mobilization. The mission will try to formulate guide-
lines for a comprehensive budgetary program aimed at a better balance
between revenues and expenditures in the medium term and a re-ordering
of spending priorities. The results and recommendations of the mission
will be reviewed and discussed with the Government with a view to
achieving agreement on a program of budgetary improvement and reform.
18.       The mission will also examine the situation of public entities.
As already nouted, `.he reserve funds of these entities have beexi used
until 1971 to finance expenditures under the current budget. Although
such transfers might be temporarily justified, there is a danger that
this mi,ght become a standing practice.  To the extent that the savings
of public entities will be available to the central government without
detrir'K*nt to the financial position of these entities, they should be
used only for the financing of productive investment projects.
19.       Indispensable though the above measures are to improve Dahomey's
budget situation, it must be stressed, however, that in the lorng run
only a broader tax base is likely to bring about a more permanent improve-
ment in public finance.  Tn this respect, the proposed project would
contribute to improving the Government's financial position.
20.       Even if the Government takes the necessary steps to improve
resource molbiJ.izat.Lon, Dahomey has, at the present stage of its devel-
opment, only limited capacity to generate savings for investment purposes.
External lenders slould therefore be prepared to finance a high propor-
tion of project costs and to contribute to the financing of local costs
in high priority projects with a low foreign exchange coitiionent.
