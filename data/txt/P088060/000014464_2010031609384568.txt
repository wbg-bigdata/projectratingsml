equivalent of US$30,000,000. 
 
2. 
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the Bank requests for deposits into the Special 
Account at such intervals as the Bank shall specify.

5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into

equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts 
remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures.

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request, or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or,

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for
