I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Uganda has requested an IDA credit of
US$22.0 million to help finance a posts and telecommunications rehabilita-
tion project. The project mainly aims at urgently rehabilitating or
replacing telecommunications plant which was run down for lack of spare
parts or damaged in the 1978/79 war, improving the standard of postal
service in the country, and addressing selected areas of badly needed
institutional development within the posts and telecommunications sector.
In particular, the physical components of the project will restore to
working order telephone lines currently out of service, connect new
telephone lines to existing spare exchange capacity by repairing and
supplementing parts of the cable and subscriber networks, increase the
proportion of long distance telephone call attempts completed by repairing
long distance radio and carrier equipment, and connect new telex sub-
scribers by repairing a telex exchange and adding teleprinters. The
project also aims at achieving next day delivery in all head post offices
of letters posted in the same city; third-next day delivery among different
head and departmental post offices; and ten day delivery among most other
post offices. Institution strengthening will focus on establishing an
adequate legal framework within which the Uganda Posts and Telecommunica-
tions Corporation (UPTC, the state-owned entity responsible for all
domestic and international posts and telecommunications services) can
effectively operate as a commercial utility; starting up adequate
accounting procedures and financial control and management practices;
establishing technical plans for telecommunications system development
utilizing modern electronic digital technology; preparing a strategy for
the integrated development of postal and telecommunications services in
rural areas; and establishing a training facility and comprehensive
training program for both posts and telecommunications.
1.02      The project specifically addresses the urgent need for
rehabilitation, technical assistance, and recurrent imports for operation
and maintenance. The rehabilitation component mainly includes the supply
and installation of containerized automatic telephone exchanges for Mbarara
and Masaka; repair of and supplementary equipment for existing automatic
exchanges in six other towns; cables, telephones, spare parts and other
equipment and materials for repairing and supplementing telephone
exchanges, long distance facilities, and cable and subscriber installations
in Kampala and about 30 other places; parts and teleprinters to repair and
supplement existing telex exchanges in Kampala; equipment and materials to
extend basic telephone service to about 200 rural communities; assorted
postal equipment; vehicles for postal and telecommunications works and
operation; and materials and equipment to complete a postal and
telecommunications training school, and 110 manmonths of training experts
to help run it for two years. The technical assistance component of the
project comprises 90 manmonths of consultancy services in the area of



-2-
accounting and finances, 96 manmonths of experts in project implementation
and postal operations, and 48 manmonths of experts in telecommunications
system planning and future project preparation using new technology. The
recurrent purchases component provides for two years' consumption of spare
parts and materials for telecommunications operation and maintenance,
postal operation, and existing and new vehicles.
1.03      The project is expected to cost US$26.0 million equivalent,
including a foreign exchange component of US$22.0 million. The proposed
IDA credit would finance 100% of these foreign costs. Local costs will be
met from internally generated funds; under presently prevailing conditions,
no tariff increase during the project implementation period would be
needed. All procurement is in accordance with IDA guidelines. Procurement
of about 60% in value of goods and services to be financed by IDA are well
advanced to ensure early credit disbursement and timely project execution:
bids for the supply of all major equipment and materials have been invited
(or will have been invited before credit effectiveness); bids for financial
consultancy services have been received; job descriptions for all other
experts have been agreed between UPTC, IDA and UN agencies which will
recruit them; and contracts with the selected firm of financial consultants
and with the UN agencies will be signed before credit effectiveness. The
project is scheduled for completion in 1986.
1.04      The project is expected to yield a financial rate of return of
about 27% and a minimum quantifiable economic rate of return of about 37%.
It is a self contained, high priority component of UPTC's 1982-87
investment program of about US$115 million equivalent including a foreign
exchange component of US$95 million. The program as a whole is expected to
have a financial rate of return of 9% and a minimum economic rate of return
of 16%. During the period 1983-87, the net cash flow from UPTC to
Government will amount to about U Sh 5,100 million (US$48 million), of
which alutiut U Sh 2,900 million (US$27 million) will be taxes and duties.
1.05      The proposed IDA credit would be the first operation in the posts
and telecommunications sector in Uganda since the breakup of the East
Africa Community in 1977. Three loans had been made to the former East
Africa Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC), and a fourth was
appraised but did not materialize as EAPTC gave way to independent
corporations in each country. Since then, two loans have been approved for
posts and telecommunications in Kenya and one credit in Tanzania. In July
1982 an IDA mission visited Uganda and prepared a posts and
telecommunications sector memorandum. In October/November 1982 the project
proposed for IDA financing was preappraised. In January/February 1983, it
was appraised by a mission comprised of Messrs. B. Wellenius (senior
economist), G. Buttex (senior telecommunications engineer), D. Lomax
(senior financial analyst) and M. O'Driscoll (postal consultant).

II. THE POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background and Organization
2.01      Authority for the postal and telecommunications services is
vested in the Ministry of Power, Posts and Telecommunications (MPPT). The
Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (UPTC) is responsible for
the operation of all postal and telecommunications services. UPTC was
established in 1977 by presidential decree,!/ to take over in Uganda the
services until then provided by the East Africa Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) and the East Africa External
Telecommunications Corporation (EXTELCOMS), which broke down with the East
Africa Community (EAC). The decree which established UPTC gave it a
caretaker role in the framework of the EAPTC's Act of 1967. Under this
interim arrangement, postal and telecommunications tariffs are approved by
MPPT after cabinet clearance. MPPT also approves UPTC's annual operating
and investment budget. The 1977 Presidential Decree was expected to apply
for only one year, while more definitive legislation was enacted. This has
not materialized, and there is now evidence that the decree is an
inadequate framework for the operation of the sector on a sound commercial
basis.
2.02      UPTC provides all domestic and international telecommunications
services, at present mainly comprising telephone, telex and telegraph
services. UPTC is also responsible for the postal services, including
money orders and acting as agents for the government's postal savings bank
(the latter two services are at present not provided). The military,
police, civil aviation and railways authorities have limited
telecommunications facilities needed to meet specialized requirements.
Radio and television broadcasting are operated by the Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting. There is no domestic telecommunications
manufacturing at present. However, Cable Corporation of Uganda's electric
cable factory near Kampala, can produce telephone drop wire and PVC
internal wiring cable; total UPTC purchases of these materials would be
less than US$0.1 million per year in the near future. A plant to
impregnate wooden telephone poles of local production is being set up by
UPTC and will be completed as part of the project to be financed under the
proposed IDA credit.
B. Access to Service
2.03      In December 1982 there were in Uganda about 23,000 connected
telephone lines and 47,000 telephones, or 0.3 telephones per 100
inhabitants. This density is comparable to Sudan (0.3), but lower than
Tanzania (0.6), Kenya (1.2) and the average for African developing
countries (0.8). Annex 1 gives other international comparisons.

Furthermore Kampala, with only 4% of Uganda's population, has 58% of its
telephones, as shown in the table below:

Source: UPTC
Telephone service is available in only 27 of the 32 district headquarters
towns, in about 60 of the 145 county headquarters towns, and in less than
20 of the about 700 subcounty headquarters towns. Telephone density in
Kampala and district headquarters is over 100 times the average for the
rest of the country. There are only 2 public call office telephones and 35
radiocall stations in towns without exchange service. Overall, barely 7%
of Uganda's population live in towns where there is telephone service.
Annex 2 gives further details on the distribution of telephones and
population by categories of places.
2.04      There are about 520 telex subscribers in Kampala, Jinja and five
other towns. Telegrams are accepted and received in the 64 main post
offices, and transmitted using telex or telephone; no telegraph service is
available in the rest of the country.
2.05      There are a total of 360 post offices in Uganda, or about 660
square km per post office which compares favorably with about 1,200 square
km per post office in Kenya and Tanzania. Eight of these are head post
offices, one each in the largest towns (with 5 branch offices in Kampala
and one in Jinja) and 50 departmental post offices in smaller towns, all
staffed by UPTC. In addition, there are 296 subpost offices operated by
private agents, and approximately 300 stamp vendor licenses have been
granted to individuals, schools and hospitals. Mail correspondence is
delivered to a total of 39,258 post office boxes. There is no
house-to-house delivery service.
C. Use of Service
2.06      In Kampala, about 58% of telephone lines are connected to
business and government subscribers, and 42% to residences. Most of the
former are in the communications-intensive tertiary sectors of the economy,
mainly wholesale and retail trade (20% of all lines), services (15%), and
government administration (11%). These proportions vary from one town to



another, depending on population, economic activity and other factors. For
example, in Jinja (the second largest town in Uganda with about one-tenth
the population of Kampala, and main industrial center) there is a lower
share of residential subscribers and considerably higher proportions of
telephone lines in industries, services and government. Annex 3 gives
further details (see also para 4.02).
D. Quality of Service
2.07      Telephone service is very poor and under present operating
conditions is deteriorating from day to day. Damaged equipment and lack of
spare parts drastically reduces the traffic capacity in some strategic
points of the system causing bottlenecks and unreliable service. For
example, calls from Kampala to Soroti, Lira or Gulu take several hours
before they can be connected; countrywide, only 49% of operator-assisted
long distance calls are connected the day they are booked. The Jinja
telephone exchange is heavily congested; it can take more than five minutes
to obtain a dial tone in a busy time of day. During the rainy months,
widespread disruption of telephone service in Kampala is common. There are
about 5,000 subscriber lines out of service throughout the country (a high
22% of the total), of which 3,000 are in Kampala (25%) and about 500 in
Jinja (35%). In this respect, the situation has worsened since the first
ITU sector review in 1980 following the war, according to which 20% and 12%
of connected lines were out of order in April 1980 in Kampala and Jinja
respectively. Further, a sample of July 1982 showed that about 80% of
faulty subscriber lines in Jinja were out of operation for more than one
month because of UPTC's inability to undertake prompt repairs, and 23% of
them were waiting for more than one year to have service restored; 50% of
the faults were due to local cable networks (which is very high, indicating
a poor condition of cables), 45% to subscriber plant and 5% to switching
equipment.
2.08      Postal service is almost at a standstill.  Delays in the order of
two weeks are common among head post offices, and examples of delays up to
one or two months are frequent. Major bottlenecks develop, causing
additional widespread disruptions. For example, for lack of vehicles
almost ten days were recently needed to transport seven wagon loads of
incoming surface mail from the railway station to the postal sorting office
in Kampala. A wagon loaded with 300 bags of mail on its way to Kenya was
at Tororo railway station for 3 months awaiting the solution of an
administrative problem. The situation in smaller towns is even worse.
Partly this relates to attempts in the 1970s to expand service rapidly
outside the main centers, without a commensurate development of vehicles,
sorting office space and equipment, and other facilities. Problems with
control of operations and lack of adequate stationery also resulted in the
suspension of postal money order services in 1980. Telegraph service in
several of the main towns is not in operation due to lack of teleprinter
paper.



-6-
E. Existing Facilities
2.09      As of December 31, 1981, there were 112 telephone exchanges in
operation having an installed capacity of 36,700 lines with 20,479
connected subscriber lines, e.g., a relatively low exchange occupation of
56% although there is a substantial unsatisfied demand. Eighty-two percent
of all subscribers are connected to automatic telephone exchanges. Seven
of these exchanges, however, totaling 9,945 lines capacity including one
large exchange in Kampala, consist of obsolete step by step switching
equipment of limited traffic handling capacity and performance, which is
developing maintenance problems. The other automatic telephone exchanges
are of a crossbar type, most of which have been in operation for less than
ten years. The local cable networks follow the European pattern, with
division points in cabinets or distribution boxes. However, the
distribution (i.e., secondary) cables and subscribers installations have
not been sufficiently developed, impeding full utilization of the existing
capacity of local exchanges and primary cables. In particular, average
primary cable occupation in Kampala is only 61% and there is spare capacity
for the connection of about 5,500 additional subscribers before a practical
limit of 90% average primary cable occupation is reached. A rural radio
call system provides basic radiotelephone services among 35 rural places
and with Kampalae A microwave system linking Kampala, Jinja and Nairobi is
part of the Pan African Telecommunication (PANAFTEL) network; it carries
both domestic and international traffic with Kenya and Tanzania. A
microwave link has recently been completed between Kampala and Entebbe, and
a microwave system between Kampala, Masaka and Mbarara is under
construction. In the rest of the country, the trunk network consists of
VHF/UHF links and overhead lines with carrier equipment, most of which is
obsolete. However, except for segments damaged during the 1978-79 war, and
for widespread reduction in capacity due to lack of spares, the main trunk
routes appear to be in fair working condition.
2.10      International services are provided utilizing a standard A
INTELSAT earth station commissioned in 1981. An international
semi-automatic telephone exchange of recent design and a 500 line
electronic telex exchange were commissioned concurrently with the earth
station. A 300 line crossbar telex exchange commissioned in 1971 has been
temporarily withdrawn from service due to lack of spare parts.
Teleprinters linked to the telex exchange by means of VFT sytems are used
to provide public telegraph service through 13 offices at 10 locations
outside Kampala and telex service to 27 remote subscribers. Five telegraph
offices operate in Kampala, also connected by the telex network. Annexes 4
and 5 respectively present a more detailed description of existing
telephone installations and a summary of postal facilities. Annex 6 gives
selected postal and telecommunications statistics for the period 1970-82.
F. Facilities Destroyed during the War
2.11      From a total of 124 previously existing telephone exchanges, 21
exchanges totalling 3,995 lines capacity and 2,644 connected lines were



- 7 -
destroyed during the war; two of these exchanges, at Mbarara and Masaka,
were automatic with a total of 2,000 lines capacity and 1,466 connected
lines. The VHF links Kampala-Masaka-Mbarara, Masaka-Kigali (Rwanda) and
Soroti-Lira were also destroyed. The aerial cable along the route
Kampala-Entebbe was seriously damaged, and subscriber telephone and telex
apparatus including the 280 rural radio call stations in operation prior to
1979 were stolen. Six telegraph offices using VFT telex in five towns were
destroyed, 9 post offices were damaged, and most other post offices were
looted of equipment and materials; 75 post offices and agencies remain
closed. Parts of the destroyed plant have been or are being replaced or
rehabilitated with EEC and UNDP financing. This mainly includes the
microwave links in the routes Kampala-Entebbe and Kampala-Masaka-Mbarara,
35 subscriber stations and a base station for the rural radio call system,
and several 12-channel carrier units. Ten telephone exchanges, including
Masaka and Mbarara, have been temporarily replaced by small manual
switchboards; some subscribers have been connected to other exchanges.
Annex 7 gives more details regarding the facilities destroyed during the
war and their partial replacement.
G. Demand for Services
2.12      According to UPTC's official waiting list, by the end of 1982
there were about 22,000 outstanding applications for new telephone lines.
Added to 22,500 lines in service (estimated on the basis of mid-year
statistics), total expressed demand was about 44,500. The table below
presents forecasts of expressed demand for the period 1983-87 based on this
figure and assuming 10% annual growth (which was the rate observed in the
period 1971-77); the table also shows expected number of connected
subscriber lines in service in accordance with the specific rehabilitation
and development projects included in UPTC's 1982-87 program.

In the present circumstances, however, the waiting list does not accurately
reflect current demand. On the one hand, about 44% of the applicants have
been registered for more than three years. Taking into account that during
this period the country suffered from war and economic disruption, it is
likely that part of this registered demand is no longer valid. On the
other hand, during the seven-year period preceding the war, UPTC was only
able to increase the number of connected lines by 6.7% per year on
average. As a consequence of the war, the number of connected lines
dropped by 13.5% in 1979 and in the following two-year period UPTC was
barely able to reconnect to the network one-third of the lost subscribers.
Given these known acute service shortages, there probably is a large unmet
demand which has not materialized in applications to UPTC, and which will
emerge only as new connections and improved service are perceived by the
public to be available. Overall, the above forecasts are likely to
underestimate demand.2/
2.13      There is also a considerable unmet demand for telex connections
and post office boxes. At the end of 1982, there were about 140
outstanding registered telex applications and 10,050 outstanding registered
applications for post office boxes. No forecasts are available, but
expressed telex demand (i.e., the sum of connected lines and outstanding
applications) has doubled over the last two years, and averages 21% per
annum for the period 1976-82 despite the war.
H. Sector Goals
2.14      On the basis of discussions with Government, the objectives for
the posts and telecommunications sector as a whole can be expressed as
mainly to (a) ensure full cost recovery, including generation of a
reasonable proportion of the funds needed for service expansion and
improvement, and (b) extend services rapidly and at low cost outside the
main urban centers and into the rural areas. The inherent conflict between
the objectives of full cost recovery and rapid extension of service
coverage, however, is not well appreciated. For example, the financial
implications of a current project to introduce telephone service in about
200 rural places have not been assessed, nor have the alternatives between
providing small exchange service or only public telephones been analyzed in
terms of whether revenues are likely to cover costs in either case.
Ambitious plans to further develop rural services from 1985 have likewise
not been studied regarding financial viability and the extent of internal
cross subsidy that may be needed.
2.15       In the short term, the government's Recovery Program for the
period 1982-84 establishes that priority in the posts and
telecommunications sector should be given to restoring service in major

demand, UPTC has forecast for 1987 a total demand of about 92,000
lines.

population and business centers, and to improving UPTC's operating
efficiency and financial position; major expansion of capacity would come
later. In this context, it has been agreed that UPTC's priorities for the
period 1982-87 should be the following, regarding both postal and
telecommunications services:
(a) recurrent and occasional imports of goods and services,
required to operate and maintain existing services as well
as to carry out minor works;
(b) basic technical assistance, needed to overcome selected
major problems in UPTC's present operation;
(c) investments needed to recover telecommunications service
capability roughly to the level existing in 1978 and attain
acceptable standards of postal service;
(d) complementary investments which would result in utilization
of idle capacities existing or building up in the system;
and
(e) investments and institutional development required in order
to expand capacity towards further meeting demand and
extending service to new areas.
An investment program of about US$115 million equivalent (with contingency
allowance), including a foreign exchange component of about US$98 million,
has been agreed for 1982-87 by UPTC, MPPT, and the Ministry of Planning,
with IDA's concurrence, as the framework for proposed IDA lending and for
coordination with other prospective sources of external financing. This
program is responsive to the above priorities (paras 3.02-3.03 and 4.07-
4.08). With some technical assistance, the program is considered to be
feasible despite being considerably larger than what was achieved in Uganda
before the war, as shown in the table below:

I. Sector Constraints
2.17      The main constraints on sector development relate to the lack of
legal framework (paras 2.01 and 5.01-5.03), availability of foreign
exchange, financial procedures and management, and efficiency of work.
Shortage of foreign exchange represents a major problem, since maintenance
and development of telecommunications infrastructure require the regular
importation of spare parts, vehicles, and equipment. UPTC has not had
regular access to foreign exchange since it was established in 1977; this
has been a major factor contributing to the severe deterioration of
telecommunications services from lack of spares (para 2.07) and to
paralysis of the posts from lack of vehicles and stationery (para 2.08).
There is considerable waste of resources resulting from inadequate
financial controls: no accounts have been finalized after those for 1977,
billing is well behind schedule, accounts receivables for services rendered
to government amount to about six months' billing (para 5.11), updated
accurate records of UPTC's assets are not available, and stores control is
inadequate (para 6.04). Staff efficiency has been undermined by the very
difficult conditions prevailing in the country in recent years, sustained
lack of work materials, and very low remunerations that make it necessary
for staff to spend much of their energy on other activities to earn a
living (para 5.06); efficiency is further affected by overstaffing (paras
5.07-5.08) and lack of training facilities (para 5.09).
J. Role of the World Bank Group
2.18      The World Bank Group has been associated with the
telecommunications sector in the EAC since 1966. In February 1967, the
Bank approved a US$13.0 million loan (483-EA) to EAPTC to help finance a
project designed to increase local and long distance facilities. A second
loan (675-EA) for US$10.4 million was approved in 1970 to finance a project
to further extend telecommunications services. These projects were
satisfactorily completed in 1974 and 1975, respectively. A third loan
(914-EA) was approved in May 1973 for US$32.5 million; most of the works to
be undertaken in Uganda were completed in 1978, and those in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1981. The performance audit report on the first two projects
while holding an overall positive view of the Bank's achievements, pointed
out to large delays in project implementation caused by inadequate planning
and project management, problems in procurement, and excessive dependence
on expatriate staff.3/ A fourth project was appraised but did not
materialize as EAPTC gave way in 1977 to three independent
telecommunications corporations. Subsequently, the Bank approved two
telecommunications loans for Kenya (Loan 1680-KE of April 1979, for
US$20.0 million; and Loan 2155-KE of August 1982, for US$44.7 million) and
a credit for Tanzania (Credit 1173-TA of March 1982, for US$27.0 million).
There have been so far no separate posts and telecommunications loans or
3/ Operations Evaluation Department report No. 893 of October 21, 1975.



- 12 -
credits to Uganda; however, about US$2.3 million of urgent imports for
initial post-war operation of services were financed under the first
reconstruction credit (Credit 983-UG of 1979). A posts and
telecommunications sector memorandum was prepared following an IDA mission
to Uganda in July 1982.4/
2.19      In the framework of the Government's 1982-84 Recovery Program, a
posts and telecommunications rehabilitation project has been prepared which
addresses the most urgent sector needs and can be implemented expeditiously
(paras 4.02, 4.07, and 4.08). The proposed FY83 IDA credit would finance
lOOZ of the foreign exchange costs of this project; local costs would be
met by UPTC from internally generated funds. The IDA credit would ensure
the flow of foreign exchange needed to prevent further deterioration of
telecommunications services, rehabilitate telecommunications capacity back
to about pre-war levels, allow the utilization of some idle capacity
existing in the system, and attain acceptable standards of postal service.
It would also place the initial building blocks of institutional
development--sector legislation, accounting and financial control,
comprehensive training. IDA would help boost morale through prompt
financial and technical support, while also helping coordinate external
sources, reduce costs by resorting whenever possible to international
competitive bidding, provide guidance on technological and managerial
matters, and promote greater business discipline. With IDA pursuing the
issue of salaries and wages at the country policy level, and improved
sector legislation and financial performance being dealt with in connection
with the proposed IDA credit, the basis would be established for increasing
UPTC staff remunerations and eventually overcome this constraint on sector
productivity. All of this should result in considerable improvements in
sector performance. Finally, during this phase, IDA would help prepare the
sector for expansion of capacity in terms of projects amenable to
multilateral and other external financing in the immediately following
years. A second IDA credit is proposed to follow up on this first project
to complement expansion financed by other sources, continue support in the
area of finances, and provide technical assistance to undertake broader
institutional strengthening.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Program Concept, and Status of Preparation
3.01      UPTC expects to invest in the period 1982-87 about
US$114.6 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of
US$94.4 million, in the improvement and expansion of postal and
telecommunications services. The table in page 14 summarizes this
investment program. The costs shown should reflect mid 1983 levels and are
4/ Report No. 4107-UG of October 8, 1982, revised January 18, 1983.

based on actual contract prices (items A, B, D and E), ITU standard costs
adjusted to reflect recent purchases under competition with EEC and UNDP
financing (items F, G and H), recent quotations (items I and J), and recent
prices tendered under ICB or quotation for similar goods elsewhere in
Africa (items A and C). Annual program expenditures are given in Annex 8.

3.02      Items A, D and E of the investment program will complete by 1985
the process of rehabilitating postal and telecommunications services. Item
A and imports for operation and maintenance constitute the project proposed
for IDA financing and are further described in Section C below. The
Kampala-Entebbe microwave link (item D, completed in 1982) and
Kampala-Masaka-Mbarara microwave system (item E, under construction, to be
completed in 1983) replace facilities destroyed in the war (para 2.11) and
provide additional bearer capacity for subsequent expansion at low cost.
3.03      Program components B and C will result in major improvement and
expansion of telephone service in Kampala. Between mid 1983 and 1987,
about 10,000 lines capacity of mostly life expired step by step equipment
(para 2.09) will be replaced using modern technology, a further 20,000
lines capacity will be gradually added, and the cable and subscribers
plants will be renovated and expanded accordingly. With the execution in
1985-87 of items F and G of the program, all towns with about 10,000
inhabitants or more will have modern automatic local telephone service.
Also, a backbone national microwave network will be in place by about 1987,
providing high quality long distance communication to all these main towns
and a basis for efficient extension of services into smaller places.
Component F, to provide for 8,000 telephone lines in the towns of Tororo,
Mbale, Soroti, Lira and Gulu, and a microwave network connecting these
towns with the existing Kampala-Jinja-Nairobi system, aims mainly at
replacing and expanding facilities which were already included in 1975
under the proposed fourth World Bank telecommunications loan to the EAC,
which did not materialize (para 2.18). It is a firm component of the
investment program but requires detailed preparation. Item G mainly
comprises the installation of about 4,500 lines of automatic local
telephone exchange capacity in Fort Portal (a main town in western Uganda),
Kasese (the mining center), Mityana and Mubendo, and a microwave link
between Kampala and these towns. This project requires further analysis
(including consideration of alternative routes and possible leasing of
circuits from Uganda Railways Corporation) before firming up. Item I is a
provision for substantial expansion of services in small towns and rural
areas presently with very limited service, and extension of coverage into
new places, tentatively in the period 1985-87. The amount and timing of
investment, however, is subject to revision in terms of progress in
developing the backbone microwave network, experience in providing services
to about 200 rural places during 1983 and 1984 under the rehabilitation
project (item A), and detailed planning to be prepared by UPTC (para
4.08). Item H is a part of a regional project prepared by the Organization
for the Management and Development of the Kagera River Basin (KBO), which
aims at interconnecting the national microwave networks of Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda and possibly Zaire; detailed preparation including
drafting of bid documents has been carried out with ITU technical
assistance financed by BADEA. Execution of the Uganda segments
(tentatively scheduled for 1986) would be contingent upon coordinated
financing and implementation in all participating countries.



- 16 -
B. Status of Program Financing
3.04      The proposed IDA credit would meet 100% of the foreign exchange
requirements of the posts and rehabilitation project which includes item
A. This project with a total cost of US$26.0 million equivalent including
US$22.0 million in foreign exchange (para 3.06), has a high priority, is
self contained, and would be financially viable irrespective of whether
financing for the other program components materializes. Firm financing
is, however, already in hand for some of those other program investments.
A contract between the Governments of Uganda and France provides for the
full external financing of item B, including local costs and some
training. Items D and E are fully financed by the EEC and UNDP,
respectively. External financing for the remaining components is not yet
firm. Foreign exchange for item F has been proposed for financing by the
African Development Bank (US$15.0 million); bilateral aid is also being
considered. Bilateral or multilateral financing for implementation of the
KBO project (of which item H is a part) is being sought by KBO, but none
has been firmed up so far. Also, no external financing is in hand for item
C, which is required in order to connect waiting subscribers to the new
switching capacities to be made available in Kampala (item B) (para 4.07),
nor for components G, I and J which are scheduled for implementation from
1985. Provided that the rehabilitation project proposed for IDA financing
proceeds satisfactorily, the foreign exchange for some of these outstanding
items and some investments beyond 1987 could possibly be financed by a
second posts and telecommunications IDA credit.5/ In order to contain
UPTC's development within the bounds of a feasible investment program
responsive to government's priorities, assurances were obtained from
Government and UPTC during negotiations that UPTC will not incur capital
expenditures of more than US$5.0 million above the planned 1982-1987 level
(para 3.01) without a financing and implementation plan agreed with IDA.
C. Project Description
3.05      The project has three main components, namely services
rehabilitation, technical assistance, and recurrent purchases.
I. REHABILITATION
Part A: Telecommunications Services. Mainly comprises the supply and
installation of two 1,000 lines containerized automatic telephone exchanges
at Masaka and Mbarara; extension of existing telephone exchanges in Jinja,

network planning for the preparation of new projects.
III. RECURRENT PURCHASES
Part F: Two years' consumption of spare parts and materials for:
telecommunications maintenance and operation, postal operation, and
existing and new vehicles.
A more detailed list of items to be financed through the proposed project
is given in Annex 9. Terms of reference of the financial consultants under
Part E have been agreed upon and used to invite bids; terms of reference
for the experts under Parts D and E have been prepared in consultation with
ITU and UPU, who will recruit the experts.
D. Project Cost
3.06      The total cost of the project is estimated at about
U Sh 2,782.0 million (US$26.0 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange
component of about U Sh 2,354.0 million ( US$22.0 million equivalent).
Annual project costs during the project implementation period are given in

3.07      The foreign exchange costs of telecommunications equipment and
material suitable for ICB are based on prices for similar equipment and
material obtained in 1982 through international competitive bidding in
Sub-Sahara Africa. The foreign exchange costs of extension of existing
equipment which must be procured from the suppliers of the original
equipment are based on the prices of existing contracts. The foreign
exchange costs of postal equipment and other items are based on recent
quotations to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. The
estimated foreign exchange costs of the different project items are
somewhat above the worldwide average of ICB procured items, because these
estimates reflect the small size of the contracts. Local costs include
UPTC's cost of personnel necessary to realize the project, and also customs

duties and import taxes on all imported goods which are not subject to
exemption amounting to US$0.9 million equivalent.6/
3.08      Average base costs per manmonth for a firm of financial
consultants to be selected for implementation of Part E(r), including
salaries, various allowances, overheads and international travel, are
estimated at US$15,000 per month. These costs are considered normal for
the region, given the high level of specialized expertise required. For
the ITU and UPU experts in charge of project implementation, postal
operation and training in the postal and telecommunications fields and for
those in charge of technical planning and further project preparation (all
other items in Part E), average base costs are estimated at US$10,000 per
month, partly because ITU and UPU are non-profit organizations, and provide
limited headquarters support leading to lower overheads.
E. Contingencies
3.09      Price contingencies for goods and services financed by IDA amount
to 15.8% of the total base cost. They result from the year-to-year
estimated foreign cost increases for equipment and material of 8% in 1983,
7.5% in 1984 and 7% in 1985 and following years. No physical contingencies
have been included because of the nature of this project which does not
comprise construction or installation of complex new facilities nor
involves civil works. It is mainly limited to fully designed components
for which contracts or bidding documents are finalized (Masaka and Mbarara
exchanges, financial consulting services, ITU and UPU experts), and well
determined lists of parts and materials.
F. Project Financing
3.10      IDA's proposed credit to government US$22.0 million would finance
100% of foreign cost for equipment, material and consulting services. It
would be transferred to UPTC to be repaid to Government over a period of 15
years including 3 years of grace, bearing a charge of 15% per annum. UPTC
would carry the foreign exchange risk. Local expenditures, which
correspond to remuneration of UPTC's staff involved in project execution,
and to duties on imported goods which are not subject to exemption (para
3.07), would be financed by UPTC from internally generated funds.
G. Procurement
3.11      Goods would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for
Procurement under Bank loans and IDA credits. Supply and installation of
equipment and supply of materials, totalling US$11.1 million equivalent,
would be grouped to the extent practicable to increase competition in
6/ Mainly vehicles. UPTC's exemption of duties is established in the
Amendment of December 2, 1982 to the First Schedule to the Customs
Tariffs Act of 1970.



- 20 -
bidding, and packages of US$50,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Supply and
installation of equipment totalling US$2.6 million equivalent which is
proprietary in character and obtainable only from specified manufacturers
would be procured through negotiated contracts. IDA financing,
however, would be subject to the condition that the costs of the negotiated
contracts are reasonably in line with those obtained elsewhere under
similar circumstances. Small items and miscellaneous materials and spares
that cannot be grouped to form packages of more than US$50,000 equivalent,
totalling about US$2.9 million, would be procured through limited
international tendering. UPTC intends to continue to use the services of
Crown Agents for the procurement of postal and telecommunications
miscellaneous items. Vehicles would be procured on the basis of local
competitive bidding (LCB) among the international car manufacturers
represented in Uganda. This is to ensure that service and spare parts will
be available for vehicle maintenance. Procurement through LCB in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA, would amount to about
US$0.9 million equivalent. A local contract for the training school
building has already been awarded and completion would start as soon as
foreign exchange is made available through the proposed credit. UPTC would
procure most of the related building materials, equipment and furniture
through limited international tendering, and make these materials available
to the local contractor.
3.12      Consultants and Experts.  IDA's Guidelines would apply for the
selection of the financial consultants under Part E(r). The ITU and UPU
experts, who would be retained to carry out the remaining items under Part
E of the project, would be recruited internationally according to the
procedures of these two UN agencies; their selection, however, would be
made in consultation with IDA.
3.13      The following table gives the breakdown of project items
according to the procurement method to be used. All procurement procedures
are consistent with Bank guidelines.

3.14      Contract Review.  About 60 contracts are expected to make up the
estimated US$22.0 million in procurement of goods and services under the
proposed project. With a threshold of US$100,000 for prior IDA review of
procurement documentation, about 30% of the total number of contracts would
cover about 88% of the value contracted. On that basis about 20 contracts
amounting to about US$19.0 million over the two year procurement period
would be subject to prior review. Random checking of smaller contracts
would be carried out in the field during supervision missions.
H. Project Implementation
3.15      Implementation of the whole project would be UPTC's
responsibility. UPTC's organization (para 5.04) and manpower
(paras 5.06-5.10) to carry out the project are basically satisfactory. A
qualified senior staff member has been designated as project coordinator;
his main duties include day-to-day follow up of project preparation,
procurement and implementation in the framework of UPTC's existing
organization and liaison with IDA. The main difficulty in implementing the
rehabilitation project in a timely and efficient manner will be managing a
large number of relatively short works to be carried out in the field by a
mix of regional and headquarters staff. Although UPTC has the necessary
expertise to carry out these works, and will obtain assistance from
suppliers for the installation of new exchanges and extension of existing
ones, UPTC has not executed a project of comparable complexity in recent
years. Also, specific weaknesses have been identified by IDA's posts and
telecommunications missions regarding stores and transport. To help
overcome these problems, a total of 96 manmonths of telecommunications and
postal project implementation experts have been included under Part E of
the project (para 3.05). A telecommunications project implementation
expert will be attached to either the Managing Director or the Chief,
Planning Department, to assist in detailed planning, organization and
supervision of project execution as well as in procurement matters; the
project coordinator will be his local counterpart. A postal expert will be
likewise attached to the Chief, Postal Services Department. Both experts
will be with UPTC for two years (subject to possible extension); they will
derive their authority from the managers to which they will be attached,
and on a day-to-day basis will also work closely with all pertinent
departments at headquarters and in the field as may be necessary. Also,
two experts will be retained for two years each, to occupy regular line
positions in UPTC's organization. One of them will be a transport manager,
responsible for organizing and supervising the use and maintenance of all
UPTC vehicles, including setting up an appropriate repair facility. The
other one will be a stores superintendent, who will help set up new stores
and control procedures before the first goods to be purchased under the
proposed IDA credit are received. These four experts are expected to be in
place about three months after the proposed IDA credit agreement is
signed. They will be recruited-by the ITU and UPU, under terms of
reference already agreed. At negotiations, signature of contracts with the
ITU and UPU for the provision of these experts was agreed as a condition of
credit effectiveness.



- 23 -
3.16      Bid documents for the telephone exchanges of Masaka and Mbarara
have been finalized and approved by IDA. Invitation to bid has been
advertised in the February 28, 1983 issue of Development Forum.
Invitations to bid for cables, telephones, teleprinters, rural radio
communication, pole plant, air conditioning and vehicles are expected to be
issued by May 1983. Jointly, this amounts to about 46% of the CIF value of
imported goods to be financed by the proposed credit. Including technical
contracts being prepared with the ITU and UPU and financial consultancy
services for which proposals have been received, this advanced procurement
package amounts to about 60% of total proposed IDA financing. The
implementation schedule proposed by UPTC (Annex 11) appears realistic under
the condition that UPTC be relieved from undue constraints imposed by
government administration. In this respect, during negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that it will take the necessary
actions required for prompt issuance of import licenses, custom clearances
and all other approvals necessary to ensure timely acquisition and
importation of equipment and materials necessary for the project. Project
completion is scheduled for June 30, 1986.
I. Disbursement
3.17      The proposed IDA Credit of US$22.0 million would be disbursed as
follows:

Disbursements would be fully documented. The estimated disbursement
schedule is set out in Annex 12. It is based on Bank and IDA average
historical disbursement schedules for telecommunications projects in all
countries, brought forward to reflect the very advanced stage of all major
procurement (para 3.16). All disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1987.
J. Performance Indicators
3.18      During negotiations, it was agreed that progress in
implementation of the program, the project, and UPTC performance, will be
reported semiannually starting September 30, 1983. A set of selected
indicators to help UPTC's management and IDA monitor project implementation
and operational and financial performance were agreed upon during
negotiations and are shown in Annex 13. These indicators and their
expected annual variations represent agreed construction objectives and



- 25 -
operational and financial targets; they will be compared with actual
figures during the project period and will be included in UPTC's progress
reports to IDA.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
4.01      The analyses in this chapter mostly refer to UPTC's 1982-87
investment program as a whole (paras 3.01 to 3.03), of which the project
proposed for IDA financing is part. Nonetheless, the sections on return on
investment (paras 4.14 and 4.15) and risk (paras 4.16 to 4.18) examine the
economic justification of the IDA project alone.
A. Communications and Economic Development
4.02      Telecommunications and postal services benefit all sectors of
Uganda's economy. Compared with alternative means of communication,
telecommunications often are more efficient in terms of capital, energy
consumption, and user time. With adequate facilities, the level and
variety of productive communication can be increased considerably, and
activities which would otherwise not be feasible can be realized. In terms
of the specific constraints on Uganda's economic and social development,
telecommunications and postal services can be expected to play a
significant role especially in connection with:
(a)  increasing the efficiency of use of existing transport
infrast:ructure and vehicles as necessary to alleviate
domestic and international transport bottlenecks in the
delivery of inputs to agriculture and industry and of
produce to markets, and also resulting in energy savings
and/or greater efficiency of productive interactions for a
given level of energy consumption;
(b)  facilitating the supply to rural areas of priority items
needed for the rehabilitation of smallholder agriculture,
mainly including implements and inputs for production,
spare parts, packaging and building materials, fuel, and
basic consumer goods;
(c)  improving the working of the market mechanism by
expediting and extending access to information,
especially in relation to developing more efficient
marketing of agricultural products and supporting export
trade;
(d)  facilitating the movement of money throughout the
country, including the rural areas, by providing through
the posts a widespread system of money order and savings
banking;



- 26 -
(e) facilitating agricultural extension, nutrition and public
health programs, livestock disease control, and
implementation of a countrywide smallholder credit
program; and
(f) helping improve the efficiency of government and
parastatal administration, including extending the
coverage of advice and supervision by scarce middle and
higher level technical and management personnel and
reducing administrative bottlenecks and unnecessary
travel.
4.03      Case material on selected users of postal and telecommunications
services illustrate some of these statements. The investment required to
extend radiocall service to about 200 coffee and cotton cooperatives and
factories affiliated to the Busoga Growers Cooperative Union could be
recovered through about one year's savings from reduced travel of
executives for administrative purposes, and improved coordination of
transport to carry the produce. Improved long distance telephone service
could result in a considerable increase in the efficiency of utilization of
the fleet of long haul lorries operated by the Uganda Cooperative Transport
Union; by allowing better monitoring of trips, as much as a doubling of
effective vehicle utilization could be achieved in some routes. Faster and
more reliable postal service including a money order facility, and
extension of telephone service to district, county and subcounty
headquarters towns currently without it, would result in a considerable
reduction of travel by government officials to gather information, initiate
and follow up on administrative matters, and collect funds; only
considering personnel of local and urban authorities, and of the Ministry
of Local Authorities, over 200 manyears are currently spent annually by
senior personnel traveling mainly for these purposes.
B. Distribution of Benefits, and Resource Mobilization
4.04      In towns of about 10,000 inhabitants or more, it is expected that
the beneficiaries of both the rehabilitation and subsequent expansion of
telecommunications services under the 1982-87 investment program will
follow a distribution roughly along the lines of present urban subscribers
(para 2.06 and Annex 3). A sample of 25 smaller communities surveyed in
the 1970s suggests that in the rural areas the proportion of business and
government subscribers would be even higher (74%) than in cities, as shown
in the table below:

b/ Based on 25 rural communities drawn as a random sample among
about 250 communities surveyed by EAPTC mainly between 1972 and
1977. The sample comprises a total of 543 potential rural
telephone subscribers identified in the surveys. Data
processed by UPTC, January 1983.
4.05      In addition to mainly serving the needs of economic production
and distribution activities in both urban and rural areas, UPTC's 1982-87
investment program will result in a large net contribution of funds to
government for use in other sectors with less capacity to mobilize domestic
resources. In the period 1983-87, the net cash flowing from UPTC to
Government, comprising charges on loans and credits to Government made
available to UPTC, commercial transaction levy (10% added to all
telecommunications bills), corporation tax (about 40% of net income) and
custom duties received by government from UPTC, less interest paid by
government on funds transferred to UPTC, will amount to about
U Sh 5,100 million (US$48 million equivalent). Approximately 56% (U
Sh 2,900 million or US$27 million equivalent) of this is taxes and customs
duties. The scope for further increasing the sector's contribution to
government funds will be examined in 1985 (para 4.13).
C. Demand, and Size of the Investment Program
4.06      UPTC's 1982-87 investment program is far smaller than would be
needed to catch up with demand for postal and telecommunications services.
For example, by the end of 1987 only about 63% of conservatively forecast
expressed demand would be met, and the number of outstanding applications
would actually increase from about 22,000 in 1982 to 27,000 in 1987
(para 2.12). Telephone density at about 0.6 telephones per 100 inhabitants



- 28 -
in 19877/ would be well below what is planned in Kenya (about 1.8 in 1986)
and Tanzania (about 0.8 in 1984). Over 90% of population would still have
no access to even basic telephone or radiocall service. Average annual
telecommunications investment, equivalent to about 0.3% of Uganda's GNP,
would be in the low end of the range typically found in the developing
world (0.3%-0.5% of GNP, generally acknowledged to reflect underinvestment)
and far below the proportion of GNP planned to be invested in
telecommunications in countries with Bank or IDA assistance (e.g., Kenya
0.7%, Tanzania 1.0%). However, even the limited investments planned for
1982-87 require expanding services at a faster pace than UPTC ever achieved
in the past. For example, as shown in the table of paragraph 2.16, over
the period 1982-87 UPTC plans to connect on average three times as many
telephone lines as it did in the period 1972-78. Furthermore, before this
expansion can be undertaken, extensive rehabilitation as well as
improvements in operation and maintenance are needed to reverse the decline
of services experienced in the recent past, and set the bases for sustained
future development. Given these considerations and the constraints on
UPTC's development (para 2.17), the planned size of the 1982-87 investment
program is as large as can be undertaken by UPTC at present, with a
reasonable amount of technical assistance in project preparation and
implementation.
D. Program Composition
4.07      Within this limitation, UPTC's 1982-87 investment program is
overall responsive to the agreed priorities (para 2.15). However, two
components of the investment program need qualification. The project and
credit agreement to replace about 10,000 lines of telephone exchange
capacity in Kampala and expand it by a further 20,000 lines (item B of the
program), was signed between the Governments of Uganda and France before
the Recovery Program was established. This project, involving major
expansion of exchange capacity, is at least two years too early in terms of
government's now prevalent priorities for 1982-84. However, it is a
basically sound project addressed at meeting currently outstanding demand;
the technology chosen is well proven yet modern; main equipment unit prices
appear to be in line with those tendered elsewhere under competition; and
the agreement provides for full financing of both foreign and local costs
under subsidized terms. Hence it is a project worth supporting.
Furthermore, it is well advanced, with initial installation of equipment
scheduled for April 1983; postponing the project is not now a practical
proposition. Nonetheless, in order that the benefits from this project may
materialize, it must be supplemented by commensurate development of
Kampala's telephone cable network and subscriber plant, needed to connect
additional subscribers to the new exchange capacity at a reasonable pace.
This complementary project, which has been included in the 1982-87 program
(item C) and would be carried out by stages once the rehabilitation project
7/ Assuming the high present ratio of 2.04 telephones per line is
maintained.



- 29 -
is successfully implemented, will be prepared by UPTC in 1983/84 with
technical assistance provided under of the proposed credit.
4.08      In response to government's priority for extending services to
rural areas (para 2.14), equipment and materials to install additional
radiocall stations, public telephones and small telephone exchanges in
about 200 places have been included in the rehabilitation project proposed
for IDA financing. This represents a sensible short term solution to
urgent needs outside the main urban centers. From 1985, UPTC expects to
invest about US$10 million in further developing rural facilities.
However, before the size and timing of this second phase of rural
investment can be firmed up, it is necessary to assess its financial
implications on UPTC, and the alternatives between providing exchange
service or only public call office telephones must be examined in terms of
likely costs and revenues. Criteria have to be established for the
selection of places to be connected in terms of economic priority
considerations and UPTC's limited capacity to install and maintain
facilities in increasingly numerous and scattered places, and the choice of
mix of technical solutions must respond to a long-term plan. Furthermore,
since both posts and telecommunications serve related communication needs
of rural communities, and they are likely to share UPTC locales, staff, and
certain technical facilities, the development of rural postal services
should be planned together with that of rural telecommunications. During
negotiations, UPTC agreed to prepare by December 31, 1984 and under terms
of reference and with a mix of local and external expertise to be agreed
with IDA, a ten-year plan for the development of rural telecommunications
and postal services. This will yield a framework within which the proposed
second phase of UPTC investment in rural areas can be reviewed, and rural
projects for execution in 1985 and later can be identified and prepared.
E. Least Cost Solution
4.09      The least cost solution for providing telecommunications services
depends on (a) having made the correct technical and economic decisions at
the time of network planning, and (b) following the optimum path in the
design, dimensioning and timing of the installations which comprise
continuing system expansion as well as replacement of obsolete equipment
and plant. UPTC has decided to introduce electronic digital technology.
This technical choice is sound and in line with practice supported by IDA
elsewhere. It is likely to result in lower equipment costs, reduced space
and maintenance requirements, saving of cable plant capacity, more
efficient operation, improved service to the users, and flexibility in
system expansion.
4.10      The 1982-87 program has been designed taking this decision into
consideration, and replacement and expansion of Kampala telephone exchanges
is underway utilizing digital exchanges. However, a countrywide technical
framework within which the change from analog to digital environments can
efficiently take place, has not been fully developed. This would comprise



- 30 -
both a trunk network plan and a local and long distance switching plan, as
well as a revision of local cable network plans. While this does not
affect the IDA-financed rehabilitation project, the new plans must be in
place before other network expansions outside Kampala as included in the
program may be firmed up. Therefore, the project proposed for IDA
financing includes (Part E) provisions for UPTC to retain 30 manmonths of
experts in digital network planning (18 manmonths) and digital switching
(12 manmonths). These experts will be recruited by the ITU and are
expected to join UPTC in March 1984. Terms of reference for them have been
agreed. At negotiations, signature of contract with the ITU for the
provision of these experts was agreed as a condition of credit
effectiveness.
F. Tariffs
4.11      UPTC's tariffs are summarized in Annex 14.  They mainly follow
the structure of the former EAPTC tariffs, with some adjustments to reflect
changes in the foreign exchange components of costs resulting from
devaluation of the Uganda currency. The telephone tariff comprises mainly
a U Sh 2,100 (US$12 at the shadow exchange rate of 180 shillings per US
dollar) connection charge, U Sh 840 (US$6) quarterly rental, and call
charges (U Sh 4.60 or US$0.03 per untimed local call, or for a distance and
time dependent fraction of a long distance or international call). A 50%
reduced rate applies for off-peak long distance calls within Uganda and to
Kenya and Tanzania. Inland letter rates start at U Sh 5.00 (US$0.03);
reduced rates apply for postcards, printed papers, small packets, and other
categories. International airmail rates differentiate between destinations
in Africa (with the lowest charges), Europe/Asia, and the rest of the
world.
4.12      The Government has been responsive to IDA and IMF recommendations
regarding public utility pricing. Following initial devaluations of the
Uganda shilling, telephone and telex tariffs were increased from January
1982 by about 400% for domestic services and 600% for 'international
services. Nonetheless, UPTC tariffs are low relative to those of
neighboring countries; the partial data shown in the table below illustrate
this.

b/ Full rate, subscriber dialed three minute call.
In particular, international telephone and telex charges are only
approximately one-third of the levels agreed with other administrations;
for example, a three minute call from Kampala to London costs only U Sh 522
(US$2.90). This is likely to result in an excess of outgoing over incoming
traffic and the need for UPTC to make substantial payments in foreign
exchange to other administrations to settle the differences in revenue
participation. A revision of UPTC's international telephone, telex and
postal rates is being considered by Government. During negotiations, it
was agreed that revised international tariffs would be in force as a
condition of credit effectiveness. No additional increases in UPTC
domestic tariffs are envisaged at present.
4.13      A tariff study including cost structure, demand characteristics,
supply constraints, and financial requirements would be needed as a basis
for pricing policy formulation and related adjustments in tariff
structure. Although possible deficiencies in both postal and
telecommunications price structure were noted and discussed during project
appraisal and preappraisal, a meaningful tariff study cannot be carried out
before much better accounting information is available. Improvements in
data recording and accounting (para 5.11) will enable a tariff study to be
undertaken during the following period. During negotiations, it was agreed
that by June 30, 1985 Government and IDA will review UPTC's tariffs and
contribution to government funds, identify tariff adjustments that may be
made without further analysis, and establish terms of reference for a more
detailed tariff study.

G. Return on Investment
4.14      On the basis of projected incremental expenditures and projected
incremental revenues generated from increased numbers of telephone lines in
working order and connected telex lines, and reduced long distance
congestion, the financial rate of return of the rehabilitation project
proposed for IDA financing is about 27% (Annex 15). This figure
understates the economic benefits of the project, partly because the
traffic growth assumptions are conservative and because the benefits from
rehabilitation of the postal service, future use of spare capacities being
built into the telecommunications system, and technical assistance and
training that will benefit future expansion, are not included in the
calculation. Also, given the acute service shortages that prevail, there
is a large consumers' surplus. After partial quantification of the
consumers' surplus based on the assumption that telecommunications users in
the future will be willing to pay prices in real terms equal to those now
prevailing, and after adjustment for taxes and duties and the application
of a standard conversion factor of 0.60 to local costs and benefits, the
minimum quantifiable estimate of the project's economic rate of return is
37% (Annex 15).
4.15      On similar bases, the financial rate of return of UPTC's whole
1982-87 investment program is about 9%, and a minimum estimate of the
program economic rate of return is about 16% (Annex 15).
H. Risk
4.16      The main uncertainties associated with the program relate to
possible delays in implementation. The worst scenario is one where UPTC
makes most or all of the investments on time but fails to connect the new
subscribers promptly or otherwise precludes the benefits from materializing
(e.g., by poor operation). A sensitivity analysis shows that a one year
delay in all the benefits with no postponement of costs, would reduce the
minimum quantifiable economic rate of return of the project from 37% to
27%, or to 21% for a two year delay. This is satisfactory. A similar
analysis for the whole 1982-87 program shows that one and two year delays
of all benefits (but not of costs) would result in minimum quantifiable
economic rates of return of 12% and 9% respectively. Given that the
calculated rates of return greatly underestimate benefits, these results
are considered satisfactory (Annex 15).
4.17      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out which indicates that
a 10% increase in capital and operating costs, combined with a 10% decrease
in benefits, would reduce the minimum economic rate of return of the
project from 37% to 28%, and of the program from 16% to 10%. This is
satisfactory (Annex 15).
4.18      Delays in establishing a UPTC Act would not affect project
implementation. Improvement of sector legislation. although an important
matter being pursued by IDA (paras 3.01 and 5.03), is not a necessary



- 33 -
condition of project execution. Other risks relate to the country's
general condition. Security is a problem considered by IDA at the level of
overall country dialogue and programming of operations. A major increase
in workers' renumerations would affect UPTC's costs (especially operating
costs, of which the wage bill is the main component). Major changes in the
applicable exchange rate (the risk of which will be borne by UPTC) could
also affect costs. Developments in both fields are monitored at country
level by IDA regional management, and will be followed up also during
supervision of the proposed IDA project. Covenants on rate of return and
internal cash generation (para 6.12) provide the necessary instruments to
trigger a revision of tariff levels, should major cost increases make it
necessary. Given the acute shortage of services which prevails, the price
elasticity of demand for telecommunications is probably very low; even
fairly large tariff adjustments are therefore unlikely to reduce
significantly the use of new facilities.
I. Environmental and Health Aspects
4.19      The program is not expected to adversely affect the environment
or public health in any way. On the contrary, the program is likely to
lead to more efficient utilization of vehicles and fuel, and facilitate the
delivery of health services (paras 4.02-4.03).
V. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A. Legal Framework
5.01      The proposed beneficiary and implementing agency, UPTC, is a
government owned entity. The 1977 Presidential Decree which established
UPTC as caretaker of the EAPTC assets in Uganda was expected to apply for
only one year (para 2.01). A more definitive legislation has not been
enacted yet and the 1977 Decree is an inadequate framework for the
operation of UPTC on a sound commercial basis. UPTC's Board of Directors
has not been appointed, the Managing Director is in place only in acting
capacity, assets and liabilities are not well defined, and UPTC does not
have borrowing power. Under such circumstances, UPTC is a corporation in
name only, while in fact functioning more or less as a technical department
of the central government administration. This represents an institutional
constraint to effective development, operation and management of sector
resources. Government and UPTC are now aware that long overdue remedial
action should be taken towards promulgation of a UPTC Act.
5.02      An adequate Act should clearly establish the terms of business of
UPTC. In particular, it would prescribe the financial regime under which
UPTC will operate, including the principle of full cost recovery from
tariffs and internal generation of a reasonable proportion of the funds
needed for service expansion and improvement. The Act would allocate power
for determining tariffs and from time to time adjusting them as necessary



- 34 -
to achieve the prescribed financial objectives. It would also define the
responsibilities and functions of the Ministry in relation to those of
UPTC's Board of Directors and Managing Director, differentiating between
policy and overview responsibilities on the one hand, and day-to-day
management responsibilities and functions on the other hand. The Act would
also allocate authority for determining and changing UPTC's organization,
defining posts, setting salaries and benefits, and hiring and dismissing
personnel. Finally, the Act would define UPTC's initial assets and
liabilities, and establish UPTC's ability to enter into contracts and
agreements including domestic and external borrowing subject to approval by
prescribed government agencies.
5.03      A draft UPTC Act was prepared in 1981 patterned along the lines
of the former EAPTC Act, which was generally satisfactory. A second draft
was found by the IDA posts and telecommunications preappraisal mission to
be inadequate. A third draft was reviewed and discussed at appraisal.
This last draft shows substantial improvements regarding several of the key
aspects mentioned in paragraph 5.02 above. On this basis, a UPTC Bill has
been approved by the Government in April 1983 for submission to
Parliament. At negotiations, it was agreed that all necessary actions will
be undertaken to establish UPTC as a public utility with an adequate legal
framework by September 30, 1983. Agreement was also reached that within 90
days thereafter, Government and UPTC will enter into a subsidiary loan
agreement in terms identical to those under which Government will initially
make the IDA funds available to UPTC (para 3.10).
B. Organization
5.04      UPTC's main organization chart is shown in Annex 16.  It reflects
the structure inherited from the EAPTC, modified to include functions that
used to be located in EAPTC's headquarters. Five departments are
responsible for telecommunications services, postal services, planning,
finance and accounting, and personnel and training. Operation and
maintenance are partly decentralized on regional bases, with five
telecommunications regions and eight postal regions. Overall, UPTC's
organizational structure is adequate to sustain the rehabilitation of
postal and telecommunications services.
5.05      Project preparation, including the drafting of bid documents and
drawing up of execution plans, is the responsibility of the Planning
Department. The works are undertaken by the Telecommunications Services
Department; relatively minor tasks (e.g., repair of small manual exchanges,
operator consoles, and some carrier equipment) is done by maintenance
technicians stationed in the regions, whereas larger tasks are carried out
by major works teams from headquarters. The relationships among planning,
construction, maintenance and stores needed for project execution are in
place from EAPTC times. A committee of relevant managers, chaired by the
Chief, Telecommunications Services Department, oversees progress in project



- 35 -
execution and facilitates coordination among departments. These
organizational arrangements are satisfactory.
C. Staffing and Training
5.06      A number of UPTC's senior professional staff have achieved a high
standard of education in Uganda and abroad. However, the performance of
UPTC's staff is adversely affected by difficult conditions prevailing in
recent years (para 2.17). Nonetheless, the very positive response of staff
to IDA postal and telecommunications missions suggests that relief of
constraints on imports, the presence of foreign experts, and frequent
contact with IDA at the working level through supervision, is likely to
contribute to renew staff motivation at upper- and-middle management
levels. However, good performance cannot be expected until the
remunerations are substantially improved. UPTC (as other parastatals) is
in principle empowered to increase salaries and benefits from its own
resources; consolidation of UPTC's status as a corporation, as well as
improvements in billing, collection and financial performance, are pursued
under the IDA project through covenants, a side letter, and performance
indicators to be used in monitoring progress (paras 5.03, 5.15 and 6.13).
Since low renumerations are a countrywide problem, this is also a matter
dealt with in the context of national policy dialogue between IDA and the
Government. Gradual improvements at both levels are expected to provide a
basis for eventually improving UPTC staff salaries and benefits.
5.07      UPTC has a total of 4,071 workers.  The total number of UPTC
staff employed exclusively for telecommunications duties is 2,158 (53%),
and 469 (12%) are solely assigned to postal functions. UPTC management and
.support service comprise 1,444 staff members, or 35%. With the rough but
conservative assumption that no more than 50% of management and support
service staff may be attributed to telecommunications, the staff ratio
reaches the high level of 125 persons per 1,000 connected telephones lines;
this represents major overstaffing of the telecommunications branch,
particularly since mantenance is minimal and there has been no major
construction since UPTC was established. This staff ratio compares
unfavorably with about 80 in Kenya and Tanzania. As the 1982-87 program is
implemented roughly doubling the number of telephones, and manpower quality
is improved through training and retraining, UPTC expects to reduce this
staff ratio to about 65 per 1,000 telephones by end 1987. This is a
performance indicator (Annex 13) agreed upon during negotiations.
5.08      The total number of workers mainly occupied in the provision of
postal services is about 630. On the basis of observation in a small
number of post offices, this may be acceptable for the inadequate level of
service currently offered. However, there may be some imbalance in the
geographical distribution of postal manpower, with large post offices
running short of personnel and some overstaffing in small offices. The
situation will be reviewed by the postal expert to be retained by UPTC as
part of the project proposed for IDA financing.



- 36 -
5.09      For several years there has been no formal training of new staff
nor retraining and updating of established personnel. A modern building
for a training center near Kampala remains unfinished for lack of imported
window panes, hardware, and other materials. A training project for
telecommunications technicians and skilled workers, prepared in 1979 by the
ITU with UNDP financing, has not been implemented for lack of foreign
exchange funds to finance equipment, instructors and scholarships. An ITU
expert has been retained by UPTC for two months from April 1983 to be
financed under the proposed IDA credit, to revise the training project,
including the provision of facilities needed to also encompass postal
training, and update the list of training equipment as well as of materials
needed to be imported for completion of the building. The training
component of the project proposed for IDA financing includes the completion
of UPTC's training center, as well as 110 manmonths of experts to organize
and help implement a comprehensive training program in the
telecommunications and postal fields (para 3.06). These experts will be
recruited by the ITU under terms of reference that have been agreed with
IDA. They will join UPTC as soon as the training center building has been
completed, which is expected by July 1984. At negotiations, signature of a
contract with the ITU for the provision of these training experts was
agreed as a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.10      A possible constraint on physical execution of the rehabilitation
project is the availability of manpower for major works construction.
Established positions provide for a total of 19 construction parties in all
necessary areas of expertise. At present, only 57% of the skilled staff
required to man these parties are in place. This is not objectionable,
however, since there has been little construction activity recently. Also,
no major problems are foreseen in filling the vacancies. There is an
adequate in-house reserve of experienced personnel from which the current
vacancies for seven engineers and nine senior technicians can be filled
through promotion and reassignment. Some recruitment and accelerated
training may be necessary, in addition to internal reallocation, to meet
the deficit of about 40 junior technicians and craftsmen. There is no
shortage of unskilled labor within UPTC or for recruitment. The
construction manpower situation will be further reviewed by UPTC in terms
of a draft detailed implementation schedule which is being prepared by the
Planning Department. Progress will be monitored during supervision.
D. Financial Management and Accounting
5.11      Financial control is at present unsatisfactory.  No accounts have
been issued for any year after 1977, and an acceptable management
information system does not exist. However, the elements of organization
required for effective financial and accounting management are in place and
the eight highest positions filled in the Finance and Accounting Department
are occupied by qualified accountants. In order to make it possible for
financial and accounting staff to perform their functions well, it is
necessary to establish an adequate framework. To this end, the project
proposed for IDA financing includes provisions to retain a firm of



- 37 -
financial consultants, mainly to help (a) prepare a statement of affairs as
of December 31, 1982, (b) evaluate fixed assets, stores, and receivables,
(c) prepare draft 1983 accounts and projections up to 1990 separately for
the postal and telecommunications services, (d) establish a computerized
accounting and stores control system, (e) set up a simple management
information system, and procedures for budget preparation and cost
analysis, (f) set up a methodology for recommendations of tariff changes,
and (g) determine a training program for financial staff.
5.12      These financial consultants' services will be needed in two
stages. A first stage of analysis and design would require an effort of
about 30 manmonths, starting about three months after IDA credit
signature. UPTC has received proposals for the provision of these services
in accordance with IDA guidelines and under agreed terms of reference.
Completion of UPTC's evaluation of these bids is expected by May 15, 1983.
Contract signature with the selected firm was agreed during negotiations as
a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.13      Additionally, three financial experts will be needed to occupy
positions not currently filled in the Finance and Accounting Department.
The project includes provisions for about 60 manmonths for this purpose.
The final disposition of these experts would be determined during the
completion of the first phase of financial consultancy. During
negotiations it was agreed that UPTC will establish with IDA the terms of
reference for the financial experts and submit these for bidding to
selected firms of financial consultants, so that these experts will be
hired and in position not later than September 30, 1984.
5.14      UPTC maintains its accounts on a manual basis with the exception
of payroll and billing accounting which are computerized. Essentially what
accounts have been produced have been done on a cash basis. Because of the
lack of accounting information, during negotiations it was agreed that the
Statement of Affairs as at December 31, 1982, to be prepared by consultants
(para 5.11) on or before June 30, 1984, will be used as the basis for UPTC
accounting records. During negotiations it was also agreed that UPTC would
pay dividends to Government at a level not less than the existing debt
service commitments of debts relating to the telecommunications sector
currently being met by Government.
E. Billing and Collection
5.15      Telephone billing which in July 1982 was over nine months behind
schedule is expected by May 1983 to be only three months behind schedule
and by August 1983 is expected to be current. Telex billing which in July
1982 was over 18 months behind schedule is now expected to be current by
May 1983. The effort made by UPTC financial staff has been substantial.
There has also been considerable improvement over the last few months
regarding receivables. In July 1982 Government unpaid bills amounted to



- 38 -
about nine months billing which by February 1983 was down to six months.
Given steps being currently implemented, it is expected that by 1986 this
will be further reduced to two months. With respect to private subscribers
the record is somewhat better, with outstandings at February 1983 being
some three months of billings. During January/February 1983, UPTC
disconnected about 1,600 private subscribers representing about 25% of
total private outstandings. Within a period of two weeks approximately 80%
of these outstandings had been settled. In view of this it is expected
that from December 1984 private subscriber receivables would be maintained
at the two months billings level. Appropriate performance indicators on
billing and collection were agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 13).
F. Audit
5.16      The Auditor General is UPTC's external auditor.  The audit of the
1977 accounts was completed in 1981. Delays had occured both in the
presentation of draft acounts and in the auditing work. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that UPTC will continue to employ
external auditors acceptable to the Association and will conform to the
following timetable with respect to forwarding audited reports to IDA.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Past Financial Performance
6.01      The last audited accounts for UPTC are those for the fiscal year
1977. The audit report on these accounts was signed in June 1981. For
1977 the financial results were good, with an operating ratio of 52% before
taking into account reserves and provisions, and with a rate of return on
estimated net revalued telecommunications fixed assets in operation of
about 16%. The self-generated cash contribution to investment costs was
about 100%.
B. Present Financial Position
6.02      Since 1977 there have been no finalized accounts.  In order to
establish a base for financial projections, the appraisal mission together
with UPTC staff prepared a draft 1982 balance sheet together with a draft
profit and loss account for the fiscal year 1982. These are summarized
below:

6.03      For the 1982 draft financial results, the operating ratio is 62%
and the rate of return on estimated net revalued telecommunications fixed
assets in operation is about 23%. These results are good, but their
consideration should be tempered with the fact that the services provided
by UPTC have been of limited coverage and generally poor quality (paras
2.07, 2.08 and 2.10).
C. Valuation of Assets
6.04      Updated and accurate records on UPTC's fixed assets are not
available. The establishment of a value for fixed assets as at



- 40 -
December 31, 1982 forms part of the terms of reference for the financial
consultants (para 5.11).
6.05      To reduce possible distortions in asset values by price inflation
on the one hand and declining unit costs of telecommunications assets from
improved technologies on the other, UPTC's telecommunications fixed assets
in operation have been adjusted on a trial basis to reflect the current
value of the assets, by being revalued from the tentative 1982 estimated
base by 6% per annum. This was done for purposes of forecasting the
financial rate of return on net revalued telecommunications fixed assets in
operation.
6.06      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, not later
than September 30, 1984, UPTC will propose and agree with IDA a method for
the annual revaluation of its fixed assets. Assurances also were obtained
that UPTC will review the value of its fixed assets annually thereafter, in
accordance with the methods agreed with IDA for the purpose of calculating
the rate of return on such assets.
D. Financing Plan
6.07      The forecast of sources and applications of funds is based upon
UPTC's capital expenditure program and is shown in Annex 17. The following
is a summary of the financing for the period 1983 to 1987.

a/ A further US$0.8 million will be expended in 1988, being final
payments following satisfactory acceptance tests.
UPTC is projected to have a good net internal cash generation which
finances the equivalent of 42% of total program costs during the period
1983 to 1987.



- 41 -
6.08      Of the external program financing and including the currently
proposed IDA credit, 43% is confirmed. This confirmed financing ensures
that the project has no financial funding constraints affecting its
implementation. The African Development Bank has completed an appraisal of
the Jinja-Gulu project (item F in the investment program, para 3.01) and
proposals for financing also have been submitted to UPTC by bilateral
agencies. Given satisfactory progress under this rehabilitation project,
IDA would also consider additional financing in about 1985. Given this,
future financing is not at this time a cQnstraining factor. However,
during supervision the planning for and obtaining of external financing
will be closely monitored.
E. Future Financial Performance
6.09      Forecast financial statements for the fiscal years 1983-1989 are
given in Annexes 18 through Annex 21. A summary of UPTC's expected future
financial performance, assuming cumulative inflation of about 10% per
annum, is given below:

UPTC's projected financial performance over the project period is
reasonable. Up to 1987, the operating ratio, although high, is gradually
falling and the rate of return is considered satisfactory. In 1989 it is
presently forecast that a tariff increase will be required (para 6.12).
6.10      Over the period 1983 to 1987, internally self-generated funds
account for 42% of program investments and in any one year is not less than
30%. This is reasonable. Debt service coverage over the period falls from
a high of 2.8 in 1983 to 1.9 in 1987. Debt service charges for the program
reach a peak in 1990 at which time the coverage would be 1.4. This
coverage is acceptable.



- 42 -
6.11      Projections beyond 1987 become even more speculative.  However,
given the assumptions used, the projections indicate that in order to meet
the financial covenant (para 6.12) for rate of return on net revalued
telecommunications fixed assets, a tariff increase would be required. The
rate of return covenanted would automatically trigger the tariff increase.
This mechanism should not, however, be allowed to harbor UPTC
inefficiency. To prevent this, a set of performance objectives were agreed
at negotiations and attached to the credit agreement, to be used as
indicators in progress monitoring and reporting to IDA. These performance
indicators include measures of labor productivity, operating cost, and
billing and collection (para 3.18 and Annex 13).
6.12      For financial projection purposes no tariff increase other than
for international services (para 4.12) has been assumed. UPTC's rate of
return on tentatively revalued net fixed telecommunications assets in
operation remains acceptable, despite inflation, as does UPTC's net
internal cash generation. This is due to a more than doubling of the net
average working telephone lines during the program period and to an
increased utilization of the services. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that as from FY83 UPTC will maintain its annual rate of
return on net revalued telecommunications fixed assets in operation at not
less than 12% each year. This rate of return is adequate to meet UPTC's
future financial requirements. Assurances were also obtained that UPTC's
self generated cash as a percentage of each year's program investment costs
will as from fiscal year 1983 never fall below 30%.
6.13      All the above statements and forecasts on UPTC's present and
future finances are provisional and subject to revision as better financial
information becomes available, first with the assistance of consultants
included in the project, and thereafter as reliable accounts are prepared
on a regular basis.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Conditions of Effectiveness
7.01      Agreement was obtained during negotiations that as  conditions of
credit effectiveness, revised international tariffs shall be in force (para
4.12), and contracts shall have been signed with a selected firm for the
provision of financial consultancy services (para 5.12) and with UPU and
ITU for the provision of postal and telecommunications experts (paras 3.15,
4.10 and 5.09).
B. Covenants and Side Letters
7.02      During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government and
UPTC that:



- 43 -
(a) All necessary actions will be undertaken to establish UPTC
as a public utility with an adequate legal framework by
September 30, 1983 (para 5.03);
(b) Government will transfer the proceeds of the IDA credit to
UPTC, to be repaid over a period of 15 years including 3
years of grace, bearing an annual charge of 15%, with UPTC
bearing the foreign exchange risk (para 3.10);
(c) Within 90 days of new UPTC legislation coming into force,
Government and UPTC will enter into a subsidiary agreement
for on lending to UPTC the proceeds of the IDA credit (para
5.03);
(d) Capital expenditures for postal and telecommunications
services will not exceed US$5.0 million above the agreed
level of US$114.6 for the period 1982-87 (inclusive of
price contingencies and 5% physical contingencies for the
non project items) without a financing and implementatiion
plan agreed with IDA (para 3.04);
(e) Adequate actions will be taken for expeditious importation
and custom and other clearances of all equipment and
materials necessary for the project (para 3.16);
(f) UPTC will agree with IDA on terms of reference for the
second stage of financial experts and submit these for
bidding to selected firms of financial consultants, so that
these experts will be hired and in position not later than
September 30, 1984 (para 5.13);
(g) A ten year plan for the development of rural posts and
telecommunications will be prepared by UPTC not later than
December 31, 1984, under terms of reference and using a mix
of UPTC and external expertise to be agreed with IDA (para
4.08);
(h) Not later than June 30, 1985, Government and IDA will
review UPTC's tariffs and contribution to government funds,
agree on tariff adjustments that may be implemented without
further analysis, and establish terms of reference for a
more detailed tariff study (para 4.13);
(i) 'UPTC will semiannually report to IDA on progress in the
implementation of the investment program, the IDA financed
project, and UPTC performance; monitoring of a set of
selected indicators reflecting agreed construction
objectives and operational and financial targets will be
included (para 3.18 and Annex 13);



- 44 -
(j) A Statement of Affairs as of December 31, 1982, to be
prepared on or before June 30, 1984 by financial
consultants, will be used as the basis for UPTC accounting
records (para 5.14);
(k) Not later than September 30, 1984, UPTC will propose and
agree with IDA on a method for the annual revaluation of
postal and telecommunications fixed assets; thereafter,
UPTC will review the value of these fixed assets annually,
in accordance with the methods agreed with IDA for the
purpose of calculating the rate of return on such assets
(para 6.06);
(1) From fiscal year 1983, the annual rate of return on net
revalued telecommunications fixed assets in operation will
not be less than 12% each year, and self generated cash as
a proportion of each year's investment costs not less than
30% (para 6.12);
(m)  UPTC will pay to Government dividends equal to not less
than the telecommunications debt service commitments being
met by Government (para 5.14); and
(n) UPTC will continue to employ external auditors acceptable
to IDA, and submit audited financial reports to IDA in
accordance with a timetable agreed during negotiations
(para 5.16).
C. Recommendations
7.03      Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit to the Government of
Uganda of SDR 20.4 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) for a term of 50
years including 10 years of grace.

Return on Investment
Program
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1983-2003, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements
during the program period, excluding any preinvestments for future
programs.
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are based on the
expected increase in telephone lines in working order and in connected
telex lines, resulting from both the rehabilitation and expansion
components of the program. It has been assumed that without the program,
(a) the number of telephone lines in working order would gradually decrease
from the present 17,500 to 15,000 in 1987 and therefter remain constant,
and (b) the number of telex lines would remain as at present (520). With
the program, (a) the number of connected telephone lines would increase as
shown in the table of paragraph 1.12, (b) the proportion of these lines out
of service would decrease from the present 22% to 5% by end 1987 and remain
at that level thereafter, and (c) the number of connected telex lines would
increase from the current 520 to 1,600 by end 1985.  The growth rate of
traffic (revenue) per telephone line in working order is assumed to be 5%
per annum, both with and without the program, except that the program is
expected to result in two step increases of 25% in long distance traffic in
1984 and 1985 as a result of rehabilitating or replacing long distance
facilities. Operating costs without program are expected to remain
constant at 1983 levels.  Incremental costs excluding depreciation and
interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and staff requirements
expected from the program. All revenues and costs have been deflated to
bring them to their comparable 1983 price levels.
4.        A summary of the program's incremental cost and benefit streams
at 1983 price levels is as follows (in U Sh Millions):

a/ Investment costs from 1989 onwards represents an estimate of the
capital replacement costs of acquired assets (vehicles and other short
lived assets).
The financial rate of return for the above streams is 9%.
5.        This calculation understates the real benefits to be derived from
the investment program, partly for the following reasons. The assumed
traffic growth per telephone line (5% per annum) is very conservative,
based on UPTC's experience in recent years under stagnant and then
deteriorating service conditions. Also, benefits are not counted which
will accrue in the future as further expansions utilize spare capacity
built into some of the facilities to be provided under the program (e.g.,
microwave bearers). No benefits resulting from the rehabilitation of the
posts are counted. And given the acute scarcity of both postal and
telephone services, the consumer surplus is likely to be large.
6.        A better (although still very conservative) estimation of the
return on investment can be made by including some of the consumer surplus
by assuming that telecommunications users in the future will be willing to
pay for the services the same prices as they pay today, in real terms. A
portion of the consumer surplus is estimated by (a) tabulating over the
program period the prices in 1983 real terms, which the existing
subscribers and applicants have demonstrated a willingness to pay and (b)
assuming that the new applicants will also be willing to pay the same real
amount as existing subscribers and applicants have demonstrated a
willingness to pay. Given these assumptions, adjusting for taxes and
duties, and applying a standard conversion factor of 0.60 to local costs

and benefits, a minimum estimate of the economic rate of return is 16%.
Labor has not been shadow priced as UPTC employs skilled staff of which
there is no surplus in Uganda.
7.        A sensitivity analysis on the above rate of return shows the
following:

Project
8.        Financial and economic rates of return have also been calculated
for the project alone independent of the program. The project would give
by 1988 an increase of about 12,800 telephone lines in working order, and
280 telex lines. Other assumptions made for this analysis are as for the
analysis of the whole program. The financial rate of return for the
project under these assumptions is 27%. The minimum estimate of the
economic rate of return is 37%. This figure is likely to understate the
return on investment for reasons given in paragraph 5, and because the full
cost of technical assistance and training has been included although only a
relatively small part would be required to implement the project.
9.        A sensitivity analysis on the project's economic rate of return
shows the following:

2.        Rental revenue is based upon the average connected lines
multiplied by the average rental tariff. Connection revenue is calculated
as the number of lines connected during each year multiplied by the average
connection fee.
3.        Local revenue is based upon the average local revenue per working
line during 1982 increased by a cumulative 5% each year (based upon
historical actuals) multiplied by the average number of working lines in
use during the year.
4.        Long distance revenue is based upon the average long distance
revenue per working line during 1982 increased by a cumulative 5% each year
(based upon historical actuals). In addition in 1984 and also in 1985
there would be a 25% step increase as a result of program and project
investments. This annual revenue per working line is then multiplied by
the average number of working lines in use during the year.
5.        International revenue is calculated on the same basis as local
revenue. The 5% annual growth in revenue per line is considered to be
conservative.
6.        Telex rental revenue is based upon the average connected machines
multiplied by the average rental tariff. Connection revenue is calculated
as the number of lines connected during each year multiplied by the average
connection fee.
7.        Telex call revenues are calculated on the basis that revenue per
line will grow at 5% per annum.
8.        In Uganda a 10% tax charged is added to the consumers total
telecommunications charges for each month. In calculating revenues this
tax was included and therefore is deducted as a payment due to government.
9.        No tariff increase has been assumed in projecting revenues other
than the increase in international tariffs of about threefold as from
1984.
Operating Costs
10.       Staff costs are based upon the 1983 UPTC budget estimates which
incorporate elements of "catch up" increases as compared with the 1982
costs. It is also assumed that UPTC will hold its toLal number of staff
constant thus reducing its staffing level. Thus base costs remain constant
over the projected period.
11.       Maintenance costs are based upon the 1983 average budgeted cost
for maintenance per average connected line; this is then multiplied by the
average number of connected lines for each year.

12.       Vehicle operating costs are projected on the same basis as
staffing costs.
13.       Other costs are based upon the 1983 budget with a 10% uplift in
1984.
14.       To provide an element of conservatism a real cost increase of 10%
per annum cumulative is added to the annual cash costs.
15.       Inflation on operating cash costs is incorporated on an expected
increase of 10% per annum cumulative.
16.       Depreciation is based upon the following annual rates:  buildings
5%, equipment 7%, vehicles 20%, and other 20%. Other represents the
capitalization of technical assistance costs where the benefits are
expected to accrue over about a five year period.
17.       Interest and equivalent dividend charges are based upon the
average outstanding loan.
18.       Postal losses are assumed to remain constant at U Sh 20 million
per annum.
Balance Sheet
19.       As now to be incorporated into the UPTC Act UPTC is no longer
exempt from income tax but is liable to a tax of 40% on net surplus.
20.       Gross fixed asset increase is related to transfers from plant
under construction as the asset becomes revenue producing. Plant under
construction is transferred to fixed assets equally over the two succeeding
years following the year of expenditure.
21.       Plant under construction reflects the investment program and
transfers to fixed assets.
22.       Accounts receivable are projected assuming that (a) for each year
Government would account for 36% of revenues and private subscribers for
64%, and (b) the receivables percentage of revenues for each year would be
as follows:
1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987
Government             45       40       35       25      17       17
Private                 25      20       17       17      17       17
23.       Other assets represent technical assistance costs capitalized and
written off over a five year period.

24.       Investments represent pension fund investments.
25.       Stores increase is accounted for by transferring from investment
program about 6% of investments, this being deemed as spares.
26.       Opening outstanding loans are as follows:
Loan                           U Sh Millions
Uganda Government 3% conversion                       6
Uganda Government 5 3/4% Exchequer                 129
Uganda Government 6 1/2% Exchequer                  12

France           8%                                320
1,330
Increases in loans outstanding arrive from:
1. Proposed IDA Credit onlent at 15%.
2. Other potential donors (ADB, bilateral sources and
letters of credit) onlent at 15%.
27.       Creditors are based upon U Sh 19 million due to Cable and
Wireless and one month's cash operating costs.
28.       Tax due is based upon 50% of the annual charge for sales tax and
100% of income tax.
29.       Interest and amortization due is based upon 50% of the annual
interest charge.
