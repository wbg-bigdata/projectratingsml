1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     South Sudan with a land area of about 648,000 sq km and population of 8.2
million is endowed with abundant natural resources including a large amount of good
quality rain-fed agricultural land, potentially irrigable land, aquatic and forest
resources, and contains significant oil reserves. Yet more than 50 percent of the
population is poor and indicators of human well-being are among the lowest in the
world.

2.     South Sudan suffered over two decades of civil war before its liberation. The
transport network in South Sudan was highly impacted by the conflict which resulted
in absence of basic transport services. Similarly urban infrastructure in Juba and other
major towns that form the national and state capitals lacked adequate administrative
buildings and accommodation to support functioning of the transitional government.
The war ended in January 2005 with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) by the two parties. Government institutions and structures had to
be newly created and made functional and private sector capacity for even relatively
small scale economic activities was not to be found. These factors are significant
constraints to development.

3.        The strategy for meeting the priority development needs of Sudan and
Southern Sudan was initiated in 2004 by formation of the Joint Assessment Mission1
(JAM) for Infrastructure Needs Assessment Report (INAR). This assessment covered
eight infrastructure sub-sectors (i) roads and bridges; (ii) road traffic and transport;
(iii) railways; (iv) inland waterways; (v) ports and maritime; (vi) electricity; (vii) civil
aviation; and (viii) urban infrastructure and municipal services. It also covered cross-
cutting issues such as implementation arrangements, environment, gender, de-mining
and HIV/AIDS.

4.      The assessment identified the need for infrastructure development to respond
to peace-keeping operations, distribution of relief goods, return of refugees, urgent
rehabilitation needs and, more generally, contribute to the cohesion of the country.
Key constraints identified in responding to the needs included (i) inadequate
implementation capacity; (ii) ensuring adequate capacity to maintain and operate
existing and new infrastructure; (iii) ensuring services match internationally
recognized safety and security standards; and (iv) establishing clear priorities. The
report identified these constraints as most present in South Sudan where the need to
meet basic needs was greatest.

5.      The recommendations of the INAR2 were planned for implementation over six
years in two phases. Phase 1, covering a two-year period, was aimed at meeting the

and participation of the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM).

most critical needs whilst Phase 2 was aimed at scaling up of infrastructure
improvement activities and deepening of policy and institutional development and
capacity building activities. Given the critical and basic need for infrastructure
improvements in Southern Sudan, it was agreed that the Phase 1 recommendations of
JAM INAR be implemented as an emergency operation, and the Phase 2
recommendations using more conventional procedures.

6.      The Multi Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) for Sudan and Southern Sudan were
established to improve, and accelerate progress toward, development outcomes,
including reduction of poverty, increase in income and improved human development
and governance. The trust funds grew out of the JAM coordinated by the governments
of Sudan and Southern Sudan with support from the World Bank and United Nations
(UN). At a pledging conference held in Oslo, Norway, in April 2005, donors pledged
over US$500 million for the two MDTFs. It was a collaborative framework which
brought together several of Sudan’s key development partners and provided a one
stop point of contact and information on the reconstruction and development effort for
those of its partners providing assistance outside of the Multi Donor Trust Funds for
Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS) framework. It was therefore an efficient way for Sudan
to ensure good coordination of the development assistance it received.

7.     Donors of the MDTF included the Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom,
European Commission (EC), Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Iceland,
Greece, Canada, Spain, and Egypt. The World Bank made a historic contribution of
US$10 million from its net income. The trust funds were administered by the World
Bank, working together with UN partners, donors, civil society, and the respective
governments.

8.      The Southern Sudan Emergency Transport and Infrastructure Development
Project (SETIDP) was designed as among the first under the MDTF. It provided
support towards the achievement of the very basic strategic objectives of the GoSS in
roads, transport and urban development. The preparation of SETIDP was initiated in
May 2005. As there was no established government structure yet, the identification
mission started working with the Sudanese People Liberation Movement (SPLM)
team led by Head, Physical Infrastructure Secretariat and including four other officials
responsible for Housing, Urban Planning, Roads and Bridges, Survey and Lands. The
members of the Physical Infrastructure Secretariat were mobilized to Nairobi, and to
the site visits with funds made available by United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and logistical support of World Food Programme (WFP).

9.      It was after the commencement of project preparation that any formal
governmental structures and institutions were established. It was during project
appraisal that the former Secretariat for Physical Infrastructure and Town Planning
(with which project preparation started) was split into two ministries. A new Ministry
of Transport and Roads and a Ministry of Housing, Lands and Public Utilities
(MHLPU) were established. However, still there were no staff appointed in the
ministries and the task team had to continue working with the head of the Physical
Infrastructure Secretariat on all technical matters.

10.    The project was prepared during a period when the Bank did not have clear
operational guidelines on engagement in post-conflict areas, and the current Bank


                                           2
policy OP/BP8.0 was only enacted until later in March 2007. The other factor that
was challenging at the early stage of the project was the lack of a standard document
on how to engage UN agencies directly with the Bank and/or with the government.
The Interim Oversight Committee (IOC) approved the SETIDP in its meeting held on
December 11, 2005. Of the approved funding, US$ 50 million was coming from
MDTF-SS, and US$100 million to be contributed by GoSS.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

11.     The PDO as stated in the Grant Letter of Agreement (GLA) signed on
December 20, 2005 for TF 56051 were to, “(i) rehabilitate and develop critical road
and transport infrastructure in Southern Sudan; (ii) improve critical urban
infrastructure in the major towns of Southern Sudan; and (iii) build capacity for
planning, construction and sustainable operation, maintenance and management of
the infrastructure in Southern Sudan.? The PDO reflected in the Final Project
Proposal (FPP) dated December 12, 2005 however reads as follows, “to rehabilitate
and develop critical national and rural feeder roads and transport infrastructure,
improve critical urban infrastructure in the major towns that form the national and
state capitals of Southern Sudan (i.e. Juba, Wau, Malakal, Rumbek, Aweil, Warap, Yei,
Yambio, Torit, Bor and Bentiu) and build capacity for planning, construction and
sustainable operation, maintenance and management of the infrastructure in Southern
Sudan.? This difference in PDOs came about after the first grant funding request
approval at the IOC meeting of the MDTF held on December 11, 2005. The task team
with advice of the IOC revised the PDO in the GLA which was signed later as noted
above but with no material difference with that in the FPP. This was to make the PDO
consistent with the design of the project. However, the task team continued to use the
FPP PDO in all subsequent reporting including that on the Bank’s Operations Portal.
Hence the ICR Team adopted the FPP PDO to remain consistent with all the project
documents.

12.     The Key Performance Indicators as specified in the FPP Technical Annexes
included: (i) Visible rehabilitation activities completed signaling existence of peace
and security (Increased travel (vehicle-km) on roads around the country); (ii)
Functional national and state government administrative structures; institutional
capacity of sector ministries developed; framework for maintenance of key
infrastructure established; (iii) Improved livelihood and reduced isolation for the rural
and urban population through regional economic integration and improved year-round
access to markets and services; and (iv) Improved basic services in the national and
state capitals.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

13.    The PDO and Key Indicators were not changed during the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.   The key beneficiaries to the project were identified as GoSS in general, the
then Ministry of Housing Lands and Public Utilities now Ministry of Housing and


                                           3
Physical Planning (MHPP) and the then Ministry of Transport and Roads now
Ministry of Roads and Bridges (MRB), and the citizens of South Sudan.

15.     The project rehabilitated priority road network which was critical for the
country’s success in integration of its people, resettlement of displaced persons and
stimulation of economic growth after signing of the CPA. The improvement of the
main road corridors also contributed to the movement of goods from the neighboring
countries as well as within the country. The project also enabled the communities
living along the roads to benefit from growth in trade and various economic activities.
It benefited road users through improvements in accessibility to markets and social
services and reduction in travel time.

16.     The rehabilitation of the priority government administrative buildings
contributed to the improvement of government administration and service delivery to
the citizens of South Sudan. The project specifically benefited the MHPP and MRB
by building their institutional capacity. The project successfully supported the
governance structure of a newly born autonomous government to take shape, become
functional, and establish itself for the benefit of the country.

17.     The residents of Juba benefited from access to clean water, hospital services,
sewage and solid waste collection points. This was made possible through the
rehabilitation of water supply system having capacity to serve 250,000 persons, liquid
and solid waste management system including water care unit and skips for collection
points, and rehabilitation of the Juba teaching hospital.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

18.    The project consisted of three components, namely: (i) roads and transport
development; (ii) basic urban infrastructure improvements; and (iii) institutional
development and capacity building.

19.     Component 1- Roads and Transport Development. This component provided
support for the phased repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and maintenance of high
priority national and rural feeder roads to all weather gravel or paved standard.

       a.    Activities included: (i) emergency accessibility improvements of about
             100 Km of tracks and seasonal roads to provide all weather road access,
             the maintenance of about 820 km of already improved roads and de-
             mining of the roads to be improved, (ii) road upgrading to all weather
             gravel standard - about 250 km of roads under an Output and
             Performance-Based Road Contracting (OPRC) contract under which the
             contractor will carried out works relating to right of way clearance, de-
             mining, road building and road maintenance, the latter for a period of
             about 4 years.

20.     Component 2 – Basic Urban Infrastructure Improvement. This component
provided support for the rehabilitation of basic urban infrastructure and services in
the 11 towns that form the national and state capitals of Southern Sudan, namely, Juba,
Wau, Malakal, Rumbek, Aweil, Warap, Yei, Yambio, Torit, Bor and Bentiu; and the
establishment of a town planning and land administration institute in Juba. The basic


                                          4
urban infrastructure and services included priority government/public administrative
buildings and houses, water supply, sanitation, urban roads and drainage and power
supply.

       a.   Activities included: (i) rehabilitation of priority Government/Public
            Administrative Buildings and Houses, Hospital Infrastructure and
            provision of prefabricated Accommodation; (ii) rehabilitation of water

            (bitumen) standard including the drainage system and street lighting; and
            (v) augmentation and strengthening of street lighting for Juba.

21.      Component 3 - Institutional Development and Capacity Building. This
component provided support to institutional capacity building (Technical Assistance
(TA) and policy studies), and program implementation, including costs associated
with oversight and management of program implementation (including TA support
team and supervision of works), monitoring and evaluation and the preparation of
activities for implementation in the different phases of the Project.

       a.   Activities included: (i) supervision of the roads constructed under
            Component 1; (ii) provision of TA and policy support to the MRB and
            MHPP; (iii) conduct of baseline survey for the establishment of a

Component 3 - Institutional Development and Capacity Building – No Change

1.7 Other Significant Changes

23.      Project Restructuring. The project was restructured five times. Due to
difficulties in concluding the Management Services Agreement (MSA) between the
GoSS and WFP it was decided that the Bank would finance from the MDTF-SS some
activities under Component 1 of the SETIDP directly to WFP under a separate grant
agreement. The Bank directly entered into a Grant Agreement (GA) with the WFP
under TF056907 for US$30.11 million dated August 2, 2006 to implement the
emergency road repair works and maintenance on 842 km of the national road
network. Therefore, on August 29, 2006, the first restructure was done to reduce
financing to US$19.89 million.




                                        6
24.     The second restructure was on May 18, 2007 to allow for incremental
operational costs to be financed under the Grant. To respond to the global economic
crisis which impacted on GoSS’s budgetary resources, a third restructure was carried
out on September 15, 2009 to increase the grant amount to US$61.44 million to co-
finance the project from the MDTF-SS, and to reduce the GoSS’s contribution to
US$ 86.46 million.

25.     The fourth restructure was done to provide a six month no-cost extension of
project closing date from December 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011; which was approved
on October 05, 2010. This was done in order to: (a) complete the feeder roads study
that was interrupted due to insecurity in some of the project areas; (b) extend the
sealing works on limited critical sections (about 6 to 7 km) of the Faraksika -Yambio
road to avoid premature failure of the road and reduce health and safety hazards, with
the savings from the road contracts; (c) resolve outstanding claims related to the
Emergency Rehabilitation Works in Juba (ERWJ); and (d) to continue with the
provision of training and TA services to further strengthen implementation capacity.

26.    A fifth and final restructure was approved on June 15, 2011. It provided a no-
cost extension of one year, from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012 making the
cumulative extension of 18-months and allowed the Goss to (a) complete the claims
assessment and prepare final account, including compensations; (b) conduct claims
settlement negotiations; and (c) engage consultants that would support the
implementing institutions in conducting negotiations and additional claims review, as
required.

27.     No Revisions to Results Matrix. Due to emergency nature of the project, the
main indicators defined at preparation had focused on measuring and reporting of
output indicators. However, it became necessary during implementation to define and
measure key outcome indicators. Although some sub-components were revised or
dropped and changes were introduced in the results matrix, still the implementation
team did not modify it during the project restructurings.

28.    Final Project Cost. The final project cost at completion under MDTF-SS was
US$89.907 million comprising of US$59.797 spent under TF056051 and US$30.11
spent under WFP (TF056907). As of project closure on June 30, 2012, an amount of
US$1,637,000 was cancelled out of the TF056051 therefore revising the total amount
to US$59.797 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29.      Project Preparation. The project was prepared during a period when the
Bank did not have clear operational guidelines on engagement in post-conflict areas.
The team was only given the green light to prepare the SETIDP on the basis of an
Initial Project Proposal (IPP) by the IOC for the MDTF after its establishment. There
were no clear working procedures for the IOC, and the SETIDP was a testing ground
on how to process a project through the IOC. The engagement was not very clear with
the MDTF donors in the beginning, the country dynamics was ever evolving, and the
communication among the different partners was complicated. As the project was


                                          7
financed through trust fund, which were not processed and monitored through the
streamlined procedures then, it was highly subjected to the evolving changes in the
oversight mechanisms of the MDTF. This had a major impact on the project
preparation, and implementation and leading to frequent changes. Consequently, the
IPP was prepared for US$240 million and eventually the FPP included a financing
plan of US$777 million split in three phases by the decision of the IOC.

30.     At appraisal, the project implementation responsibility was assigned to a
Project Management Team (PMT) staffed with local professionals supported by a
Technical Assistance Support Team (TAST). The PMT reported to an inter-
ministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC). At the state level, project activities
were the responsibility of a state level PMT located in the state ministry of physical
infrastructure (SMoPI)/ engineering affairs. The PSC role was to oversee the activities
of the PMT and was the final decision making body with regard to policy and overall
project implementation issues. It also provided guidance on setting project priorities
and approved the work plans and budgets of the PMT. It was also responsible for
donor coordination for road and other specified infrastructure works. Its members
included the Ministers/ Heads of: Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MoFEP); MHPP; Ministry of Roads and Transport; Ministry of the Environment and
Wildlife (MoEW); Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF); and Office of the
Attorney General. The Head of the PMT was an ex-officio member of the PSC and
the head of the Legal Unit of the PMT served as its ex-officio Secretary. The
Chairperson of the PSC was either from the Ministry of Transport and Roads or
MHPP with the other ministry acting as co-chair. In discharging its duties, the PMT
related closely with other donors/implementing agencies such as the USAID
particularly active on roads development, United Nations Mine Action Services
(UNMAS) on de-mining activities, United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) on
access for peace-keeping operations and the WFP who were implementing the
Emergency Road Repairs Program (ERRP).

31.      Assessment of Project Design. The project design was complex in that both
transport and urban infrastructure sectors were combined into a single infrastructure
project. The design was to be implemented in three components with some of the
activities to be implemented in partnership and/or with support of other
donors/implementing agencies. The USAID, EC, WFP, UNMAS, and UNMIS were
then active in the roads sector, and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) was participating in the urban infrastructure sector. All the project
components were spread over the ten (10) states of South Sudan. Though this design
was very bold given the challenges of the time, it was also necessary in a sense
keeping in view that SETIDP was among the first major projects of MDTF-SS in a
fragile environment. The choices were very limited and the project was under
pressure to include priority activities in support of a newly born transitional
government. It was imperative to understand and incorporate the limitations of the
government capacity and that of the human resource gaps and shortage of skilled
oversight within the GoSS institutions. The task team was truly challenged even in
identifying and sustaining the desired government counterpart support during project
preparation.

       a.    Unperceived weaknesses in Project Design. There were two clear
             weaknesses not fully identified and mitigated for. First, the project had


                                          8
             envisaged two-third of financing as counterpart funding in a post conflict
             fragile environment. This was a major risk in its own right which in
             hindsight was easy to identify and was not properly mitigated for.
             Second, the project design was using Output and Performance-based
             Road Contracting (OPRC) under component 1, rehabilitation of roads.
             However, other details as well as implementation outcome show that the
             OPRC concept was little understood and eventually was abandoned
             without making any attempt as the sub-component was directly
             contracted to the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)
             for implementation (see section 2.2 below).

32.      Risks and Mitigation. Risk assessment and classification was carried out and
the project was classified as a high risk operation reasons being the new government
institutions, general security risk, and fiduciary risk. The key risks were though
adequately identified at preparation, some mitigations measures proposed were also
relying on the activities happening in parallel under other donor financed projects.
That appeared to be a sensible approach considering the enormity of country and
sectorial challenges which could not be mitigated under a single project alone.
However, any negative outcome of such external factors and their influence on the
effectiveness of risk mitigation remained beyond the control of this project. Key risks
factors and proposed mitigation are examined as follows:

       a.    Lack of capacity and experience in managing large scale projects. The
             mitigation measures were two-folds. First, there were the institutional
             and capacity building activities that were on-going under the USAID
             supported capacity building program to help develop complementary
             systems, procedures, standards and policy guidelines for road
             administration and the implementation of road projects. In continuation
             of those, under the SETIDP, staff from MoHPLU and MRB were given
             training in the areas of urban development management, procurement,
             contract management, human resources development and social and
             environmental assessment (EA). Second, an empowered PMT was
             established, which was staffed by selected specialists from the two
             ministries, responsible for project implementation.

       b.    Very weak presence and capacity of local private sector in South Sudan.
             Under the capacity building program supported by USAID, measures
             were included that supported the growth and capacity building of the
             private sector consulting and construction firms in South Sudan. Local
             firms were selected and trained in road maintenance activities. This weak
             private sector capacity and its impact were visible in the numerous
             challenges arising during implementation (see section 2.2 below).

       c.    Fiduciary risk. Given its size, geographical spread and multiple
             contractual arrangements the fiduciary risk was high. The mitigation
             measures adopted were successful by establishing a streamlined
             disbursement procedure in South Sudan. This was accomplished by
             recruiting a Project Accounting Agent (PAA) who took responsibility for
             MDTF-SS and counterpart funds. The PAA was an integral part of the
             Treasury of the GoSS and was responsible for providing fiduciary


                                          9
             assurance regarding use of these funds. The internal audit and
             expenditures were monitored by a Monitoring Agent (MA) hired by the
             Bank for the MDTF-SS. The project was audited by an independent
             audit firm according to international standards.

       d.    General security risk. This could have been in resumption of significant
             conflict within South Sudan and was largely outside the control of the
             project. However, any conflict would have reduced interest by reputable
             international firms in doing business in the country, cost escalation and,
             indeed cessation of works on on-going contracts. During appraisal, this
             issue was discussed with the government. To mitigate the impact of this
             risk, a pipeline of projects was prepared such that should hostility
             prevent works in a particular part of the country, works could be initiated
             in other parts. The proposed approach was rational enough should such
             an eventuality had occurred.

33.    The project’s Quality-at-Entry was not reviewed by the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG).

2.2 Implementation

34.    Project Effectiveness. It should be noted that WFP had originally agreed (at
approval of the project) to work through the government financing which did not
materialize, as explained in section 1.7 above. Once the Bank entered into a direct
agreement with the WFP, one of the conditions of the original GLA requiring signing
of a Management Service Agreement (MSA) between WFP and GoSS was amended,
and the project was made effective on August 24, 2006, about 9 months delayed after
signing of the original GLA.

35.     Engagement of the UNOPS. The Bank had a close working partnership with
other donors in preparing the project. Accordingly, a joint implementation approach
to the planned road improvements included an important corridor of Faraksika-
Yambio-Wau connecting two important food deficit areas (Western Bahr el-Ghazal
and Juba) with a food surplus area (Western Equatoria). The corridor had been
divided as follows; (i) Faraksika to Maridi to Yambio (MDTF); (ii) Yambio to
Tambura (USAID); and (iii) Tambura to Wau (EC). UNOPS was engaged by other
donors using their own funding and by the GoSS under the grant TF056051 to provide
project management services for the planned works on Faraksika to Maridi to Yambio
(170 km) at a contract value of US$38,431,639. The Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA) between the UNOPS and the Ministry of Transport and Roads was signed on
April 10, 2007 after Bank’s no-objection. Of the total contract value an amount of
US$29,247,576 was provided for the civil works contract managed by UNOPS.

36.     Mid-term Review. It had been proposed at project appraisal that activities at
state level would be the responsibility of a state level PMT. However, during the
MTR conducted in November/December 2007 it was found that no state level PMT
was established though due to impact of project activities on the states, there was an
increase in cooperation between the national PMT and the SMoPI. Furthermore,
under the urban infrastructure development component, the rehabilitation and



                                          10
improvement of 60 km of urban roads in Juba to asphalt standard, including drainage
system and street lighting was dropped because the Bank declared mis-procurement.

37.     Construction Claims. The implementation of the contracts for the ERWJ as
carried out under component 2, was not smooth and the project had to deal with major
claims on all contracts. The total amount of claims initially submitted by the
contractors to the MHPP was US$61.26 million which were mainly due to delays.
The primary reason for those delays was lack of full access to the facilities being
rehabilitated during the start of implementation that resulted in extension of time.
Then the design and supervision consultant (Project Manager) for the project
abandoned their services in April 2009 citing non-payment of their services. This
resulted in lack of and/or delayed instructions to the contractors as the MHPP was not
fully capable of performing the role of the Project Manager in the interim. The other
reasons that resulted in extension of time for all the ERWJ contracts included
relocation of the Water Care Works, exceptional bad weather, revised specifications
of new pumps for the urban water supply, accommodation of variation orders and
delays in issuance of drawings. A replacement Project Manager was hired in
November 2009 to complete the measurements of the works as well as to give
recommendations on the appropriate extension of time (EoT) and settlement of the
claims. The replacement consultant recommended a total claims settlement for all the
ERWJ contracts to be US$9,940,055.49. The last of the works under this component
(Lot 1) was completed in May 2010. The Bank hired an independent individual
consultant to review the claims assessment reports prepared by the replacement
Project Manager. After a repeated round of documentation and clarification by GoSS,
the Bank review recommended a claim settlement amount of US$8,292,271.22 in
June 2012. However, the actual final payment made is higher due to high exchange
rate of the Euro to the US$ for Lot 2, component 2. The final total claim amount paid
out was US$8,519,212.91.

38.     The project implementation has been rated as Satisfactory in the Operations
Portal (starting June 2008) in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISR).

39.     The supervision of the project was not reviewed and evaluated by the QAG.

2.2.1   Major factors Affecting Project Implementation

40.     Insecurity and landmines. Some project sites especially roads experienced
security issues at the time of project implementation. This often resulted in delays
which mainly affected the Faraksika –Yambio road rehabilitation project. There was
also danger of landmines in the roads projects which affected both civil works and
feasibility studies. In the case of the civil works the roads had to be demined in order
to enable activities to proceed.

41.    Inadequate logistics arrangements and slow staff mobilization. Contractors
had to mobilize both their equipment and project staff mainly from the neighboring
countries of Uganda and Kenya. Inadequate arrangements slowed down resource
mobilization. However, projects were able to pick up progress after mobilization of
resources.




                                          11
42.     High Construction Costs. There was an ever increasing cost of construction
and the scope of works during project implementation. This is evident with the sharp
rise in project completion costs for the ERWJ and the road rehabilitation works
implemented by UNOPS among others. These can be attributed to insufficient input
based design documents and weak oversight that resulted in variation of volumes
under the re-measured contracts, uncertainties in site access, and revision in
specifications.

43.    Limited Capacity of the Construction Industry. There was very low
construction industry capacity in South Sudan at the time of both project appraisal and
implementation. This was coupled with limited financial and technical capacities of
contractors. All contracted firms were foreign and often hired workers from outside
the country. This required special consideration and concessions in the bid documents
to support the private in-country construction industry considering the FCS
environment.

44.    Funding Shortfall under MDTF-SS and GoSS. There were delays in the
mobilization of the expected funds from MDTF-SS sources. This was coupled with
lower than expected revenue of the GoSS which greatly affected the speedy
implementation of the project. The project was designed such that GoSS provided
two-thirds of project funding. However, due to the global economic crisis of 2008
GoSS was not able to meet its commitments and more funds had to be provided by the
MDTF-SS. This was a major risk as subsequent event proved it.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.     M&E Design. Based on design of the project, monitoring and evaluation
focused on outputs as well as results, which were to be carried out by project and
contracted specialists. The project was to utilize existing data sources, supplemented
by regular routine project data collection, and special surveys and assessment updates
carried out by contracted specialists. The key performance indicators in the original
project design were identified and a baseline survey was conducted midway through
the project for use to determine benchmarks. Baseline data could not be available
during project design due to lack of information on the infrastructure sector in South
Sudan given the long period of civil war. The indicators and the reporting framework
were sufficient to meet the need to report on the project’s overall achievement in
relation to the Results Matrix for the JAM INAR.

46.      M&E Implementation. The MA was deployed and responded to the specific
requirements under SETIDP and the MDTF-SS in general. The implementing
institutions also had timely access through supervisions and inspections to project
activities in order to facilitate the evaluation of the results and any impact during
implementation.

47.     M&E Utilization. Most of the monitoring activities were carried out by the
MA who submitted regular progress reports to the Bank and made regular
presentations at the Oversight Committee meetings held for the MDTF-SS. Those
reports and presentations outlined the various implementation challenges, issues, and
also reported on the overall results framework progress. GoSS, however, was not



                                          12
successful in developing any sustainable mechanism during the course of the project
to enforce the M&E design through its PMTs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.     Environmental and Social Safeguards. Based on the design, the project
triggered safeguards policies on environmental assessment (Operational Policy (OP)
4.01), cultural properties (Operational Policy Note (OPN) 11.03, being revised at that
time as OP 4.11) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) and was classified as
environmental impact category A. An Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was prepared by the government, reviewed by the Bank and
disclosed in the country and Infoshop within 6 months of effectiveness. The
Framework incorporated policies, regulations and guidelines for the selection and
design of sub-projects and the planning and management of mitigation measures,
monitoring and institutional responsibilities. Given that land acquisition for physical
works was to be undertaken under this Project a Resettlement Policy Framework was
prepared to articulate the principles and procedures for land acquisition in order to
ensure fair and transparent compensation. Environmental Assessments (EAs) and
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were prepared, particularly for the roads upgrading
projects. This process was facilitated by preparing environmental guidelines for the
road sector which were reviewed by the MoEW and USAID who were undertaking a
Programmatic Environmental Assessment for the Road Rehabilitation Activities in
South Sudan.

49.      During project implementation, an Environmental Protection Unit was
established in the office of the Undersecretary of the MRB. It was staffed with an
Environmental Specialist whose role covered all subsectors of transport. Draft
environmental guidelines were produced and are being applied to all transport
projects which includes roads and bridges, airports, rivers and railways. MRB had
also prepared a comprehensive Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment
Framework (ESSAF). The implementation of the road repairs and maintenance
activities did not result in any major environmental and social issues. However, the
major environmental challenge on the roads had been dust which became a risk for
road safety. The major safeguard issues involved location and use of borrow pits,
solid waste disposal and location of camp sites. Borrow sites along the roads were
reinstated and there were no displacements of people or losses to their livelihood
since borrow areas were located away from human settlement.

50.     Procurement. An assessment of the implementing institutions (MRB and
MHPP) noted that there was no or little experience of working under Bank procedures
and guidelines. At project design the PMT was responsible for all procurement
aspects. All procurement arrangements were carried out in accordance with relevant
World Bank Procurement Guidelines and Procedures for emergency operations. The
project mainly included the procurement of Works, Consulting Services, and Goods.
The major contract administration issue dealt with in SETIDP was the assessment and
settlement of claims under the ERWJ, design services and Feeder Roads Study
overseen by the MRB. There was one Bank declared mis-procurement under the
urban infrastructure development component. The rehabilitation and improvement of
60 km of urban roads in Juba to asphalt standard, including drainage system and street



                                          13
lighting was dropped because no agreement could be reached between GoSS and the
Bank on the recommendation of the bid evaluation report.

51.     Financial Management. The project was assessed as a high risk project at
design, given the weak institutional arrangements, the regulatory environment, the
lack of capacity and the absence of financial rules and regulations. There was added
fiduciary risk involved in this project, given its size, geographical spread and multiple
contractual arrangements. During the first six months all project accounting and
disbursement related work was the responsibility of an Interim Project Accounting
Agent (PAA) recommended by GoSS. Thereafter and up to project closure, this
function was carried out by the Project Financial Management Unit situated in the
MoFEP and responsible for financial management of all MDTF-SS projects. Given
the weak institutional structure at the time for both MRB and MHPP, the size of fund
flows and the wide geographical spread, the PMT and TA support team was given the
responsibility for building capacity for putting in place effective fiduciary systems for
these two ministries.

52.      Audit reports and Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were prepared regularly
during the project. The final audit report has been received. Disbursement was slow
from 2007 and improved from 2010 until project closure. The project is fully
disbursed and all donor funds fully expended. As of project closure on June 30, 2012,
an amount of US$1,637,000 was cancelled out of the TF56051 therefore revising the
total to US$59.797 million. The WFP, TF56907 was fully disbursed at closure with an
amount of US$30.11 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.     The SETIDP was originally designed to be implemented in three phases.
Phase 1 was aimed at meeting the most critical needs whilst Phases 2 and 3 were
aimed at scaling up of infrastructure improvement activities and deepening of policy
and institutional development and capacity building activities. However, due to
limitation of funds from both the MDTF-SS and GoSS, financing for the
implementation of Phases 2 and 3 could not take place and the subsequent programs
were not implemented.

54.      Given the need to improve road access and maintain the roads earlier repaired
under the SETIDP, the Southern Sudan Roads Maintenance Project (SSRMP) was
prepared and implemented from May 2010 and ran in parallel with SETIDP at closing
stages. The SSRMP became effective in March 2010 as a roads maintenance
operation which also co-supported the capacity building of local contractors and the
institutional strengthening and capacity building of the MRB.

55.     The GoSS is working with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) on the expansion of the water treatment plant in Juba which was rehabilitated
under this project. The government has also planned to provide additional facility to
increase the capacity of the existing water care unit constructed under the SETIDP.
Furthermore, the Bank and GoSS are considering some of the policy measures such as
the establishment of the Road Fund (RF) to be financed by the South Sudan Rural
Roads Project (SSRRP) under the South Sudan Transition Trust Fund (SSTTF). This



                                           14
is aimed at supporting the government on the establishment of RF and capacity
building.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.      The Project Development Objectives are highly relevant now as they were
during preparation of the project. The project components were well connected with
the PDO. Given the highly inadequate transport network and poor condition of urban
infrastructure in all the towns of South Sudan, rehabilitating and developing the
critical road and urban infrastructure was in line with the JAM’s recommendations.
Furthermore, improving the performance of the transport and urban infrastructure as
well as building the capacity of MRB and the MHPP were among the top priorities of
the Government. This therefore shows a clear linkage of the project objectives to the
strategic development objectives of GoSS to link all its major towns, improve
connectivity with Sudan, establish transport connections with its neighboring
countries, restoration or provision of basic urban infrastructure and services, and
institutional development and capacity building.

57.      In regards to the linkage to the PDO the project components of the SETIDP
focused on roads and transport development, basic infrastructure improvements, and
institutional development and capacity building. The first component of the project
which is roads and transport development is PDO indicator 1 and focused on increase
in size of rehabilitated roads and transport infrastructure network size. Therefore the
absence of basic transport and urban infrastructure and services were addressed
through implementation of Phase 1of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.      The project’s objective of infrastructure improvement through rehabilitating
and developing critical national and rural feeder roads and transport, improving
critical urban infrastructure in major towns, and building capacity of MRB and MHPP
has been substantially achieved. Key interstate and regional roads have been reopened
to traffic, the detailed design of asphalt and feeder roads have been completed and
ready for implementation. The ministerial buildings and Juba hospital are functional,
and the water treatment plant in Juba is completed and providing clean water to about
250,000 people. The water care unit in Juba has been completed and in use. The
project has also contributed to capacity building of MRB and MHPP in core areas that
include urban development, roads management, procurement, contract management,
and social and environmental assessment.

59.    The above achievements are based upon the following project components
which are presented in detail in Annex 2, Output by Components.

60.     Component 1 - Roads and Transport Development. The implementation of
the physical works and studies under the project were completed and the
achievements included: (i) repair and maintenance of 864 km of roads; and (ii)
rehabilitation of the Faraksika to Yambio road (170 km) to gravel pavement.



                                          15
61.     Component 2 - Basic Urban Infrastructure Improvements. The building
rehabilitation and water and sanitation projects for Juba town have been completed
and the achievements included: (i) the rehabilitation of 67 GoSS buildings
comprising the ministerial buildings, the national assembly, presidential palace,
presidential office, and Juba Hospital which are all fully functional; (ii) rehabilitation
of Juba water treatment plant with a capacity of 7200 cubic metres per day, which is
now providing clean water to about 250,000 residents of Juba; (iii) construction of
water care unit in Juba which is now in use by the Juba commission; and (iv) delivery
of solid waste collection items in Juba.

62.     Component 3 - Institutional Development and Capacity Building. The
project contributed to the creation of core capacity of the MRB and MHPP and
achievements are: (i) MRB and MHPP established, transport sector policy developed
and adopted, PMTs established, draft Road Agency Act established, road material
laboratory established; (ii) 175 staff of MRB and MHPP trained in urban development
management, roads management, procurement, contract management, human
resources development, and social and environmental assessment (Details of training
courses attended by the staff of MRB and MHPP are presented in Annex 2); (iii) TA
provided in the areas of procurement, materials testing and claims management; (iv)
guidelines for Environment Monitoring for the road sector has been developed; (v) the
feasibility studies and detailed design for 560 km of the Nadapal to Juba and Kaya to
Juba roads; (vi) preparation of feeder roads development plan; (vii) the design of 1400
km of feeder roads; and (viii) preparation of the designs for the rehabilitation of
power in four towns (Yambio, Bor, Rumbek and Wau) and water supply systems in
three towns (Torit, Bentiu and Aweil).

3.3 Efficiency

63.     There was no detailed economic analysis conducted during project preparation
due to the emergency nature of the operation. However, the project activities were
delivered and supported the opening up of interstate roads, rehabilitating critical
infrastructure, and creating mass of human resource in the MRB and MHPP.

64.     The rehabilitation and maintenance works, design services and institutional
development activities have all been completed. All claims have been successfully
resolved and cleared. The completion of the above activities facilitated the
achievement of the project objectives of roads and transport development, urban
infrastructure rehabilitation and institutional development and capacity building of the
Ministry of Transport and Roads and MHPP.

65.     Unit costs comparative analysis (with WFP-ERRP 2003-2006). The project
had three categories of road works and these are repairs, maintenance and
rehabilitation. The base repair cost for the selected roads without supervision costs
was estimated at about US$11.85 million to repair 263km of road length. At project
completion the repair cost increased to US$17.39 million and actual length of road
covered was 285 km. The average unit cost per km of road repaired therefore
increased from a base of US$47,945 to US$60,783 at completion representing a rise
of 27 percent. This was largely due to lower estimated quantities and costs than
actual. The details of the analysis are presented in Annex 3.



                                           16
66.     The roads maintenance was estimated to cost US$3.54 million and cover 579
km of road length. The maintenance cost increased to US$6.08 million at project
completion with 579 km of road length maintained. This indicates a rise in average
unit cost per km from US$6,100 to US$10, 571 representing a 73 percent increase.
Similar reasons above are accountable for the sharp increase in the unit cost.
Similarly, the rehabilitation cost of the selected road increased from the estimate of
US$20.16 million to US$29.43 million at completion. The average unit cost per km
therefore increased from US$ 120,000 to US$173,107 representing a rise of about 44
percent. This rise is as well attributed to the lower estimated quantities and costs.

67.     The comparative analysis of roads projects implemented under the SETIDP
with those under the ERRP clearly shows that there is a big drop in roads maintenance
unit costs. Under the ERRP the unit cost per km for roads maintenance was US$40,
372 by November 2005 and US$10,571 under SETIDP by December 2007. This
represents a drop in maintenance unit cost of 282 percent over a period of about 2
years. Similarly, road repair cost varied in SETIDP from those of ERRP. The average
unit cost per km of road repair was US$56,017 by November 2005 under ERRP and
US$60,783 under the SETIDP by May 2009. This indicates an increase in road repair
cost of about 8.5 percent over a period of 3.5 years.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The project objectives, design, implementation, and outcomes were highly
relevant to the development priorities and strategic objectives of South Sudan. The
strategic objectives included (i) roads and transport development which was regarded
crucial for achieving key development goals by linking major towns, improving
connectivity between Sudan and South Sudan and as well as establishing adequate
transport connections with neighboring countries; (ii) urban development to restore
and/or provide basic urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) institutional
development and capacity building to restore government institutions and structures
which had their capacity depleted after over two decades of civil war.

69.      The PDO of the project was achieved given that the physical targets were
achieved and the project activities were completed within the range of the initial cost
estimate. These included opening up of about 1,034 km of key interstate and regional
roads to traffic, design of 560 km of asphalt roads and 1,400 km of feeder roads. The
ministerial office buildings, assembly, presidential palace, presidential office and Juba
teaching hospital are fully functional. The water treatment plant now provides clean
water to the residents of Juba and the water care unit in Juba is being used by the Juba
commission. Solid waste collection bins have been delivered to the Juba commission
and in use. The project has contributed to the creation of core capacity for the MRB
and MHPP in the areas of urban development, roads management, procurement,
contract management, social and environmental assessment. The key physical works
of the project were completed within the original project closing date other than the
resolution of claims submitted by contractors and consultants that spread beyond the
initial closing date.

70.    The overall project outcome is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?. It was
noted that the project design was complex with two separate sectors merged into one


                                           17
project i.e., transport and urban, and it did not consider the weak private sector
capacity. This resulted in constant challenges during implementation as would be
expected in such low capacity post-conflict country environment. Though the project
focus was reasonable and linkages to the existing donor programs were commendable,
the planned implementation arrangements were not what would have been expected in
a situation as the Bank found in South Sudan.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.     Poverty Impact. The project was delivered in areas where roads rehabilitated
and maintained have high agricultural production. The improvement of these roads
enhanced the economy along these corridors through increased agricultural
production. The rehabilitation works in Juba also created job opportunities by
enabling the government to employ civil servants in various positions in the ministries.
The project also enabled the provision of reliable and cheaper transport services for
the population living within the influence areas of the improved road corridors,
enabled the creation of employment and businesses for people during and after the
implementation period. Therefore the interconnectivity within South Sudan boosted
the local economy and supported the overall reduction in poverty.

72.      Gender Aspects. The project presented no evidence on gender mainstreaming
in all the activities. No data was collected on gender for example, the percentage of
women employed in the newly formed ministries and female staff trained under the
institutional development component. Therefore, it was not possible to assess how the
project benefited men and women in South Sudan.

73.     Social Development. The project was able to provide better access to schools,
health centres, village markets and social services which improved development of
business activities. The project also facilitated the resettlement of displaced persons
and the return of refugees from the neighboring countries to South Sudan. There were
no safeguard issues as no human settlements were displaced during the road
improvement activities of the project. The immediate socio-economic impact has been
positive on the restoration of travel and livelihoods in areas served by the improved
roads, with visible increases in traffic volumes on the key roads on which
improvements have been carried out

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.    MRB and MHPP were fully involved in the implementation of the project
which significantly contributed to the institutional capacity of the two ministries.

75.     The institutional development also enabled the following: (a) establishment
and staffing of the MRB and MHPP with key personnel; (b) development of
Transport Sector Policy; (c) establishment of the PMTs of the MRB and MHPP; (d)
establishment by Presidential Order a Draft Road Agency Act; and establishment of a
roads material laboratory. 175 staff of MRB and MHPP were trained and acquired
experience in various areas which included urban development management,
procurement, contract management, human resources development, and social and


                                          18
environment assessment. TA services were also provided to the two ministries in the
areas of procurement, material testing and claims management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

76.    Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

77.    The project was implemented by two newly formed institutions that had no
exposure to project management. This often resulted in delays in procurement and
inadequate reporting. However, the creation of capacity of the two institutions in
planning, project management and sustainable maintenance greatly contributed to the
development of human resource. The MHPP and MRB have acquired modest capacity
in planning roads and urban development. The South Sudan Roads Authority (SSRA)
which is a core institution to ensure the sustainability of the road network in South
Sudan has been established by an Act of Parliament in January 2011 and its
operationalization is in progress.

78.     The sustainability of the project especially the roads component remained a
challenge. The roads that were rehabilitated and maintained during the project
deteriorated and a follow-on project, the SSRMP was created with the aim of
improving access. There is still however a challenge of roads maintenance funding by
the government. The budgetary constraints highly contributed to the sustainability of
maintenance of the improved infrastructure as well as the capacity that was built
during the project. Therefore, the risks to the development outcomes are considered
“Substantial?.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The project design provided for the phased approach to implement the
SETIDP. The design was relevant and appropriate to the key infrastructure
development priorities of GoSS, which included roads and transport development,
urban development and institutional development and capacity building. The project
design also supported the recommendations of the JAM which identified the need for
infrastructure development. This was crucial at the time to respond to peace keeping
operations, distribution of relief goods, return of refugees, urgent rehabilitation needs,
and contribute to the cohesion of the country.

80.    There were adequate fiduciary arrangements provided at project design. Given
the weak fiduciary systems at project preparation due to limited capacity of GoSS, the
project provided for the use of services of firms to manage the financial and


                                           19
procurement aspects of the projects at the initial stages of the project. These interim
measures were designed to be in place until the PMTs of the Ministry of Transport
and Roads and MHLPU were established and ready to discharge fiduciary roles with
the guidance of TA.

81.     The overall project risk at appraisal was assessed as high given the several
risks that were anticipated under the project. Adequate mitigation measures were put
in place through institutional and capacity building activities supported by the USAID
and the establishment of an empowered PMT staffed by experienced specialists.

82.     The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as “Moderately
Satisfactory?. The project costs varied substantially from design, no contingencies
were kept, rehabilitation was underestimated and the monitoring indicators were not
properly identified. While the involvement of WFP was already envisaged, the
engagement of UNOPS in the project in 2007 appeared to have evolved later and was
likely as a result of difficulties in implementation that were not envisaged during
project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.    The Bank supported the MRB and MHPP to oversee the award and
supervision of contracts managed by UN agencies and project management
consultants which included: (i) two major road rehabilitation contracts implemented
by the UNOPS; (ii) four major road repair and maintenance contracts implemented by
WFP; and (iii) five urban rehabilitation contracts in Juba which included water supply
and sanitation, Juba hospital and government buildings. The Bank also further
supported the MRB and MHPP in the award and supervision of: (i) three major
consultancy services for the design of roads to paved standard as well as the
preparation and design of a feeder roads development plan; and (ii) four small
consultancy assignments and a major TA contract for capacity building.

84.    The Bank was significantly involved on day to day basis during project
implementation. The Bank Task Team had been based in the field during project
implementation. They provided great handholding, as they were able to interact
closely with the Borrower, implementing agencies and partners, and visited all the
project sites. As such the project’s financial management, procurement and
achievement of PDO have been rated Satisfactory in the last ISR No. 9. The Bank
conducted regular supervision missions during implementation and prepared aide
memoires which provided highlights of key issues together with follow-up actions.

85.    The Bank performance at supervision is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.
Despite the project being consistently rated as satisfactory during implementation,
there were huge implementation issues especially under component 2 which could
have sunk the project. There was also no formal restructuring done when the PDO
was changed at GLA, amendments were made to the GLA, and project components
were revised and/or dropped.




                                          20
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.    Considering the Moderately Satisfactory rating at both at entry and during
supervision, the overall Bank Performance is rated “Moderately Satisfactory?.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.      The GoSS was committed to the project right from inception and was fully
involved during the project preparation and implementation. Hence the government
had a strong ownership of the project. The SETIDP at inception looked at the long
term engagement with the project to be implemented in three (3) phases, with the
government contributing two-thirds of the investment as a counterpart funding.
However, following the financial crisis of 2008 the government was not able to avail
these funds. Furthermore, pledges by donors towards the MDTF-SS could not be
fulfilled. Due to lack of sufficient funding for maintenance and operation, the
rehabilitated road infrastructure deteriorated further. The financing gap resulted to
great sustainability challenges as well as institutional capacity development.

88.      The performance of the government is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.
This is based on the commitment and ownership of the project from inception and the
failure to provide adequate maintenance funding.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.     The Implementing Agencies (IAs) for the SETIDP were the Ministry of
Transport and Roads, MHPP and WFP. When the Ministry of Transport and Roads
was split in September 2011, the MRB took over responsibilities of the roads
development aspects of the project. In spite of the limited institutional capacity, the
two agencies were fully committed to implementation of the project activities. WFP
was already implementing road repairs since 2003 and had the capacity necessary to
execute the project. The MHPP successfully resolved and settled claims that arose
from the ERWJ projects. The financial management and procurement systems were
adequately managed by the IAs and payments promptly made in all contracts. At
project closure, the MRB and MHPP were able to improve the skills of their staff
through trainings, TAs and on-the-job training.

90.     Despite the commitment of the IAs in the implementation of the project and
the capacity improvements, there were project delays, mis-procurement issue, cost
increases, and contractual claims. Based on the above, the performance rating for the
IAs is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.




                                          21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     Based on the commitment to the project, failure to provide adequate funds for
sustainability of the project, delays, mis-procurement and cost increases in the project,
the overall performance of the Borrower is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.

6. Lessons Learned

92.     Sustainability of the Road Network. The flow of funds from the government
for road maintenance had to compete with emergency and security road construction
and other government priorities. Road maintenance had always been minimal
compared to the need. Therefore, the call for establishing a stable and sustainable road
maintenance financing scheme remains an urgent issue, without which the
sustainability of road maintenance is unlikely.

93.      Capacity Building Challenge of Fragile and Conflict Affected States (FCS).
The project has greatly contributed to addressing the principal challenge of capacity
limitation to deliver results in the post conflict and newly emerging country. The
direct involvement of the PMTs has helped it to climb-up the learning curve faster and
this approach has to be encouraged. On the positive count, the PMT has acquired
experience in applying Bank procurement procedures, and implementation of future
projects could be smoother and faster. Going forward TA has to focus on
institutionalizing capacity development by adopting appropriate systems and
standards for planning, procurement, contract administration, environmental and
social impact assessment and financial management. Further, training of staff only by
itself is not adequate in building institutional capacity and it appears that direct
engagement of staff during procurement and contract management processes in the
form of on the job training is essential.

94.     Limited Capacity of the Construction Industry – was a major constraint
during implementation and required special consideration and concessions in the bid
documents to support the private in-country construction industry considering the
FCS environment. The capacity of the construction industry in South Sudan was very
low during project preparation and implementation. All contracted firms were foreign
and often hired workers from outside the country. Such considerations should be part
of project preparation in FCS environments, and proper mitigation measures such be
analyzed.

95.     Working with and the use of UN Agencies – was an adequate choice that the
task team had made during design and implementation. Given the weak capacity of
the IAs and the local construction industry in a new country environment, the
engagement of WFP and UNOPS enabled good oversight controls and fast tracked the
maintenance, repair and rehabilitation works. However, as the local construction
industry picks up, there is need to support its development to be able to participate
fully in Bank financed projects.

96.     Caretaker Approach by Donors. A caretaker approach by donors adopting
particular sectors for development across the 10-states could have better served the
unique challenges in development rather than designing standard format projects


                                           22
trying to deliver a multi-sectoral scope. Southern Sudan was a newly emerged country
literally neither having any governance structures nor any private sector capacity; and
the specific challenges were exceptional to this environment not very common in
most other FCS.

97.     The Delivery Mechanisms. The latest innovative implementation methods in
such FCS may be considered only after gauging some prerequisites. The project
abandoned concept of Output and Performance-Based Road Contracting (OPRC)
though it was part of the design. Lessons emerging from other places suggest
including some maintenance funding in the project to ensure sustainability in medium
term. For that OPRC is an innovative approach, however, it is important also to make
an assessment on the willingness of reputable construction companies to take on such
long term contracts in an extremely high risk environment. Examples used in other
FCS suggest use of international and national roadshows that provide project specific
details and cover other country and sector related aspects.

98.    Detailed Evaluation of Massive Claims. More specific institutional support
planned at preparation and during implementation could have helped reduce the
negative exposure that the newly established MHPP went through. The project
experienced massive claims under Component 2 due to delays affected by
externalities indifferent to project activities, weak reporting structures, and
inexperience of the implementing agencies. The Bank’s due diligence significantly
helped to reduce the amounts paid during final closure.

99.     PDO and Results Framework. The SETIDP was designed to be implemented
over three phases. As previously mentioned, this ICR reports findings for the first
phase only. However, the design of the project provided the same PDO for all the
three phases. In order to avoid underrating the outcome of the project, the formulation
of the results framework should have attempted to include specific objectives for each
phase rather than establish a general PDO for the whole project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Agreed. The performance of the government is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?
based on the commitment and ownership of the project from inception to completion,
though the failure to provide adequate maintenance funding due to financial crisis of
2008 affected the overall government performance.

6. Lessons Learned

Agreed.

The sustainability of the project especially the roads component remained a challenge.
The roads that were rehabilitated and maintained during the project deteriorated due
to lack of funding from the Government. The budgetary constraints highly contributed
to the sustainability issues as well as the limited capacity that was built during the
project. Establishing a stable and sustainable road maintenance financing scheme
remains an urgent issue to the government

The project has greatly contributed to addressing the principal challenge of capacity
limitation to deliver results in the post conflict and newly emerging country. The
direct involvement of the PMTs has helped Government agencies to acquired
experience in applying Bank procurement and financial management procedures,
thus, the implementation of future projects could be smoother and faster.
