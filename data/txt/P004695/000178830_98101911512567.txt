APPRAISAL OF THE
ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Accelerated Rural Electrification Project of the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA) consists of the first stage of its rural electri-
fication program which is expected to electrify all remaining villages in
Thailand in about 20 years. The project will provide power to 4,567 villages
located in 16 provinces in the northeast of Thailand and in 4 other provinces.
It would bring power within reach of about 675,000 households with a total
population of about 5 million. Primary lines aggregating a total length of
1,660 km of 3 phase and 9,800 km of 1 phase would be constructed and an
additional 1030 km reconductored; 7,340 km of secondary lines would also be
built and 5400 distribution transformers installed; 381,000 kWh meters and
31,300 street lights would be installed; and auxiliary fuses, switches,
feeder reclosers together with the necessary vehicles, equipment and tools
for construction and installation, would be provided.
ii.       PEA has never borrowed from the Bank in the past but eight loans
have been made to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. PEA is
a well organized and operated utility. It electrified 2,200 villages in 1976.
iii.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$110 million
equivalent of which the Bank would finance US$25 million, 63% of the foreign
cost. The balance of the foreign cost of US$8 million would be financed by
the Canadian International Development Agency and US$7 million by the OPEC
Special Fund. The local cost would be financed by PEA.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would be applied against the foreign ex-
change costs of distribution line accessories; transformers; switching, pro-
tection and regulating equipment; meters and wiring; construction, test and
communication equipment; tools and vehicles; and electric pumps and motors.
All equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank would be procured on
the basis of international competitive bidding.
v.        Responsibility for the power supply in Thailand rests with three
authorities--all wholly Government owned: the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT), responsible for generation and transmission;
the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), responsible for distribution in
the provincial areas outside Metropolitan Bangkok; and the Metropolitan
Electricity Authority, responsible for distribution in Bangkok and the
surrounding area.
vi.       PEA's planned expansion program FY77-83, includes the electrifica-
tion of about 19,000 villages and the total investment contemplated is about
US$763 million; the proposed project would account for about 14% of this
amount. It is proposed that PEA would be assisted in financing the program



- ii -
by having a rationalized tariff structure for the whole of Thailand and
transferring the surplus funds generated in MEA to PEA, by EGAT continuing to
charge PEA less for power than MEA. The estimated average sector tariff in
FY83 required to enable PEA to finance its contribution to Thailand's rural
development, is about US 3.8 cents per kWh at 1977 prices, a modest figure
compared to the tariff levels in neighboring countries.
vii.      The project is estimated to have an internal economic rate of
return of 12% which is about the opportunity cost of capital in Thailand.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$25 million for a
period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years with the guarantee
of the Kingdom of Thailand.

APPRAISAL OF THE
ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA), for the extension of distribution facilities to
4,567 villages located in the northeast region and in the provinces of
Chiang-mai, Chonburi, Nakhon Sawan and Songkhla.
1.02      The project covers the first 5 year phase of PEA's Accelerated
Rural Electrification (ARE) program. The project consists of the supply of
materials for high tension and low tension distribution lines and ancillary
equipment.
1.03      The estimated cost of the project is B 2,255 million (US$110 mil-
lion). The Bank has been asked to finance part of the foreign exchange
component in an amount of B 512 million (US$25 million). The balance of
the foreign cost, B 164 million (US$8 million) would be financed by a loan
from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and B 144 million
(US$7 million) by a loan from the OPEC Special Fund. The local cost component
of B 1,435 million (US$70 million) would be financed by PEA from local
borrowings.
1.04      The borrower would be PEA and the proposed loan would be the first
which the Bank has made to this organization. In the past, PEA has received
loans from Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KFW), the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development and from the Overseas Economic Corporation Fund (OECF)
of Japan. It has always endeavored to obtain loans on concessional financing
terms; but in view of the size of the ARE and its other rural electrification
programs (para. 3.20), it has been unable to raise all the funds required on
soft terms and has sought the assistance of the Bank.
1.05      PEA was established as a Government enterprise in 1960 and is
an efficient organization. It is responsible for distributing electricity
throughout all provinces of the country except in the Bangkok Metropolitan
area where the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) has the franchise.
PEA's rural electrification program aims at electrifying about 38,000 villages
over a 20-year period; MEA also has a rural program to electrify all villages
in its area by 1981. A Bank Power Sector Report (September 1976) concluded
that the program could be financed by increasing average tariffs by the
amounts necessary to cover the finance gap between borrowings and construction
costs with MEA transferring surplus cash to PEA to help support its expansion
program.



- 2 -
1.06      About 11,000 villages had been electrified in PEA's area by the
end of 1976. In addition to the proposed Bank loan, PEA has already obtained
financing for approximately 300 villages in the southern region, financed by
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, and for 346 villages under the
North-East Rural Development Project in part financed by the Bank (Loan 1198-TH).
During the three years 1974, 1975 and 1976, PEA electrified 940, 1,440 and
2,200 villages respectively, under its electrification program. In view of
the fact that 22 kV construction presents no technical difficulties and that
the annual rate of village connections will not exceed 3,300 for the whole
program, PEA should have no difficulty to electrify the 4,567 project villages
within the 5 year period.
1.07      The project now proposed will provide electricity to about 20%
of the villages in the northeast region of the country and the four additional
provinces.
1.08      This report is based on a feasibility study prepared for PEA by its
consultants, R.W. Beck & Associates of Seattle, on information provided by
PEA and on the findings of Bank missions which visited Thailand in January/Febru-
ary and from October 26 through November 21, 1976; the latter mission
comprising Messrs. B. Abadian (Economist), A. Hasan (Young Professional), K.
C. Ling (Power Engineer) and J. M. Sneddon (Financial Analyst).
II. THE COUNTRY, THE ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The Kingdom of Thailand is 514,000 sq km  in area and had a
population of 43.2 million in 1976, which was growing at a rate of about
2.7% per year. Per capita GNP was about US$380 in 1976. Economic growth was
substantial in the 1960s, the increase in real GDP averaging 8.0% per year.P
Growth slowed to 6.5% during the period 1970-75 largely due to weak export
demand in 1970-71, a drought in 1972 which severely restricted agricultural
production and then the slowdown in economic activity following the world
energy crisis and recession in 1974. The rate of growth of real GDP rose
from 4.6% in 1974 to 5.5% in 1975, 6.3% in 1976 and between 6.0-7.0% estimated
for 1977. The Government's Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) establishes a
target of 7.0% per annum.
2.02      Thailand is well endowed with land and water resources for agricul-
tural production. Agriculture is the major economic activity, contributing
about 29.9% of GDP, employing 75.7% /1 of the labor force and providing about
71.3% of merchandise export earnings in 1976. Industry contributed about
24.8% of GDP, 14.3% /1 of merchandise exports and 7.9% /1 of employment.
Significant tourism development is also taking place, and tourism is a major
source of foreign exchange.

The Power Sector
General
2.03      The power sector consisted of three state enterprises and 53 private
franchises at end-FY76. The state agencies are the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Electri-
city Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Highlights of MEA, PEA and EGAT
operations are shown in Annex 1.
The Provincial Electricity Authority
2.04      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly owned Government
Corporation under the Ministry of Interior with the responsibility of providing
and distributing electricity in all provinces of the country except in the
area served by MEA. PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from EGAT but
also generates electricity in areas not yet connected to the grid. In FY76,
2,617 GWh were sold to 927,400 consumers.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority
2.05      MEA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government Corporation
under the Ministry of Interior with the responsibility of supplying electricity
to the Bangkok Metropolitan area covering the provinces of Bangkok, Thon Buri,
Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In 1976, 5285 GWh were sold to 544,700 consumers.
All MEA's power is purchased from EGAT.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
2.06      EGAT was established in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government Corpora-
tion for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the electricity supply
throughout the country and coordinating the generation and transmission
systems. It reports to the Office of the Prime Minister. EGAT generated 91.4%
(9,414 GWh) of all power (10,295 GWh) in Thailand in FY76; the balance was
generated by PEA, private utilities and self-generating industries.
Private Franchises
2.07      The 53 private franchises had an installed capacity of 9.2 MW in
diesel plant at end FY76 and generated 5.8 GWh for that year. About 30
franchise holders purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA and the remainder
generate their own requirements. Following the fuel crisis and Government's
policy of restricting tariff increases, most of the self-generating franchises
have asked to be taken over by PEA. The takeover is scheduled to be completed
in the near future at a total estimated cost of B 220 million (US$10.7 million)
in compensation.



-4-
Government Agencies
2.08      Coordination in the power sector is being strengthened.  In addition
to EGAT, MEA, PEA and the Ministries to which the utilities report, several
Government agencies also have a direct interest in the power sector. These
are:
Tariff Rate Committee;
-    National Economic and Social Development Board;
-    Ministry of Finance;
-    Budget Bureau;
-    National Energy Administration (NEA); and
-    Rural Electrification Board
These agencies review: tariff recommendations, capital project proposals and
budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual financial perform-
ance; and Government equity and loans. None of them has overall policy respon-
sibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after all the agencies
including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system has worked well
to ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly controlled, but the
fiscal emphasis of the approval process has constrained sector development.
However, a major step towards improving coordination has been taken by the
formation of the Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD)in March 1977
under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister.
Demand and Supply of Electric Power
2.09      Information about the generating capacities, energy production
and sales of EGAT, MEA and PEA is given in Annex 1. Salient features of
electric utilities at end-1976 1/ were:
Maximum Demand (MW)                    1,763
Generation (GWh)                       9,826
Sales (GWh)                           8,623
2.10      Sector growth has been considerable; since 1968, GWh sales have
grown from 2,520 GWh to 8,623 GWh in 1976, a growth rate of 16.6% per year.
2.11      Thailand's per capita consumption of power in 1976 was 199 kWh
compared to 300 kWh in the Philippines, 480 kWh in Malaysia, 565 kWh in
Korea and 40 kWh in Indonesia. Regional imbalances currently exist and per
capita consumption varies as shown below:

43,214         8,623            199
The degree of electrification by regions is shown in Annex 2.
2.12      The percentage of households connected in the country at end-1976
was 24.6% as shown below:
Population (000)                   43,214
Total households (000)              6,173
Households connected (000)          1,520
Households connected (Z)               24.6
Consumption (GWh)                   8,623
2.13      The percentage of households connected in the Bangkok Metropolitan
area (MEA's) was about 70.7% and in the provincial areas (PEA's) about
17.7%. MEA also has a rural electrification program for the remote parts
of its franchise area and plans to have total coverage by the end of FY81.
2.14      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Growth in these areas has been rapid,
an annual average growth rate of 11.1% in numbers of consumers and about
24.4%, on average, in kWh sold since FY68. However, rapid as the growth
has been, the degree of electrification in PEA's area increased only from 9.5%
to 17.7% between FY68 and FY76, due both to the relatively high population
increase (2.7% per year) and the fact that PEA had to concentrate its efforts
initially on connecting urban and semi-urban areas to the grid and is only
now in a position to launch a major effort to give power to rural areas. The
annual rate of village connections rose from 940 in 1974, to 1,440 and 2,200
for 1975 and 1976 respectively.
2.15      Government recognized that village electrification was proceeding
too slowly to meet the needs of villagers. To accelerate the distribution
development gains more equitably, PEA was asked in 1973 to plan an Accelerated
Rural Electrification program and give priority to the more backward and
unstable areas, namely the northeast and the south.
III. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be PEA, a state enterprise.  PEA is organized and
functions as a modern public utility with a considerable degree of autonomy.
It is charged with the distribution of electricity throughout all the provinces



-6-
of the country except in the Metropolitan Bangkok area, which is served by
MEA. PEA was established in September 1960 under the Provincial Electricity
Act (BE 2503) and functions under the Ministry of Interior. The Act empowered
PEA to generate, acquire and sell electricity in provinces outside the area of
MEA's operations, but it cannot generate power in the area covered by YEA, the
predecessor of EGAT. Inter alia, the Act also provides that:
(a) the property of PEA shall not be subject to judicial
process;
(b)  the Board shall fix rates for the sale of energy so that
revenues cover operating expenses, interest and depre-
ciation; and amortization when it exceeds depreciation,
providing reserves adequate to meet contingencies, and
financing a substantial portion of expansion expenditures;
and
(c) PEA may erect transmission lines across any person's land
subject to the payment of fair compensation.
3.02      The Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers
and consists of a Chairman (currently, the Minister of Interior) and nine
other members who are senior officials of the Government agencies and depart-
ments concerned with power distribution. The General Manager is also an
ex-officio member of the Board as well as the authority's chief executive
(see Annex 3 for list of Board Members).
3.03      Since its establishment in 1960, PEA has grown rapidly to become a
large, well-organized utility. By the end of FY76, it had 8,028 employees,
927,400 consumers, and was operating 11,200 km of high tension lines at
various voltages with 1430 MVA of transformer capacity. The management and
staff are able and well-qualified; 600 are university graduates; 964 are
graduates of technical institutes; and 2,545 from vocational schools (see
Annex 4 for the Organization Chart).
3.04      PEA purchased 92.4% of its power from EGAT in FY76, about 3.5%
from MEA and NEA and generated the balance of 4.1% from 302 diesel plants
installed in areas beyond the reach of EGAT's transmission grid. The
combined capacity of these plants was 90 MW at the end of FY76. The number
of diesel plants is falling, however, as PEA follows a deliberate policy of
connecting diesel-supplied distribution systems to the grid to reduce fuel
costs.
Training
3.05      PEA operates a training school for lower level staff; higher level
staff have been sent overseas both on academic scholarships and for shorter-
term training with utilities in Germany. The training programs are adequate
to cater for all PEA's manpower needs.



-7-
Consultants
3.06      PEA's staff is able to undertake all its design and engineering needs
and will carry out all the work of the project without the assistance of consul-
tants. Consultants have been used in the past for supervising and advising on
projects financed by KFW and OECF. Consultants have also been used for the
economic and feasibility studies required to launch the ARE program.
Accounting and Audit
3.07      The accounting system is good and the staff are competent.  Account-
ing, including consumers billing, is carried out at 12 regional accounting
centers in a highly efficient manner.
3.08      The annual audit of PEA's account is performed by the National Audit
Council (NAC) of Thailand, the Government institution responsible for auditing
all state enterprises in the country. NAC's procedures have been modified
and strengthened on the Bank's recommendations and are now generally satis-
factory. The Bank and the NAC would consult on any improvements in the audit
of PEA's accounts if this should be necessary.
Tariffs
3.09      The PEA Act provides that the Board of Directors has the power and
duty to fix rates for electric energy. In effect, the Cabinet decides on the
tariff adjustments that may be required based on the recommendations of the
Tariff Rate Committee (see para 2.08).
3.10      Prior to 1975, MEA's tariffs for each consumer category were differ-
ent from those of PEA and tariff levels were based on the needs of the separate
entities. The rates were higher in provincial areas than in Metropolitan
Bangkok because of the higher costs of distribution and lower load factors.
In 1975, PEA's residential rates were reduced to MEA's level to promote rural
electrification. About 63% of PEA's revenue losses for that year were
compensated by increases in EGAT's and MEA's tariffs for their industrial
consumers. Since the reduction, funds have been channeled to PEA by EGAT
charging MEA higher tariffs for bulk power than those charged PEA. By end
1976 rising operating and construction costs were causing MEA and EGAT to be
short of funds and a tariff increase was necessary for all three entities to
maintain a sound financial position.
3.11      This situation required an average increase of a minimum of 29% to
enable each of the utilities to continue its construction program without
interruption, to remove the fuel oil subsidy and to accommodate the last fuel
oil price increase of December 1976. As recommended by the Bank, the Council
of Ministers approved a sector tariff increase of 29% effective from August 1,
1977.
3.12      Government and EGAT have agreed to incorporate a fuel adjustment
clause in EGAT's tariff schedules to compensate for any change in fuel oil
prices. About 70% of PEA's operating costs will comprise bulk power



-8-
purchases from EGAT. Therefore, PEA-requires protection by the incorporation
of a similar clause in its tariff schedules so that increased bulk power costs
arising from the operation of EGAT's fuel adjustment clause, can be passed
immediately to consumers. The Government has agreed that it will make adjust-
ments in PEA's and the sector's electricity tariff to reflect fuel price
fluctuations and fluctuations in the cost of purchased power.
3.13      A Bank mission made a study of Thailand's power tariffs in 1974 and
prepared a research working paper (P.U. Report No. RES4 of December, 1974).
The report recommended inter alia, that a thorough investigation of the levels
and structure of marginal costs and of load characteristics should be carried
out. In addition, PEA's rural electrification programs need support within a
rationalized tariff structure applicable to both PEA and MEA. Accordingly,
the Loan 1485-TH (Pattani hydroelectric project) includes a tariff study of
the entire power sector on a marginal cost basis. The study should be
completed by early 1979 and PEA and MEA should provide the consultants with
all necessary facilities and data to ensure completion of the study (see
Annex 5 for Terms of Reference).
Insurance
3.14      Insurance is adequate for a distribution utility, covering fire
and other risks for buildings and contents, marine and stores.
Taxation
3.15      PEA pays customs and excise duties at an average rate of about
40% on purchases of imported materials and equipment. Its Act also provides
that any surplus funds be remitted to Government in lieu of corporation
tax. Due to the size of PEA's expansion program and its need for funds, PEA
has not made any remittance but the tariff study will explore the implications
of making PEA liable to corporation tax.
Existing Facilities
3.16      The energy sold to PEA from EGAT's 75 substations is distributed by
PEA in 68 provinces by radial type distribution systems of 11, 22 and 33
kV design. PEA steps the high tension voltage down to low tension at 400/230
volt, 3 - phase, 4-wire; 230 volt, 1 - phase, 2 - wire or 460/230 volt,
1-phase, 3-wire for supplying the energy to customers. Medium sized business
and industrial loads are supplied at the voltage levels of 11, 22 or 33 kV.
3.17      At the end of FY76, the electric distribution systems in PEA ser-
vice areas comprised a total of 11,184 circuit-km. of high tension lines
at various voltages as follows:
3.5 kV system                      145 km
11 kV system                   1,364 km
22 kV system                   6,939 km
33 kV system                   2,736 km
Total             11,184 km



- 9 -
22 kV has been selected as the standard voltage of the high tension distri-
bution system. 33 kV is used in the southern and northern areas where
distribution lines are extremely long. The 11 kV system is limited to
Chiang Mai, two other neighboring provinces in the north and some provinces
in the central area.
Development Strategy
3.18      The electrification of PEA's area has proceeded at a rapid pace
since PEA was established; sales have grown from 165 GWh in 1965 to 2,617 GWh
in 1976, an average annual growth rate of 24.5%; the number of consumers
supplied has grown from 290,300 to 927,400 over the same period, an average
annual grown rate of 11.5%.
3.19      PEA's policy is to connect all provincial capitals, followed by all
district centers, TAMBON centers, and villages. Currently, all provincial
and district centers are connected; about 11,000 (23%) out of a total of
48,000 villages had electricity at end-1976.
3.20      PEA's overall program for rural electrification is currently
scheduled to be carried out under 3 separate projects: Accelerated Rural
Electrification, the TAMOBN project 11 and normal village electrification.
The differences among the three projects are that: (i) the Accelerated Rural
Electrification project confines itself to a specific region for each time
slice of the program and the project is coordinated by PEA's Office of Accel-
erated Rural Electrification; (ii) the TAMBON project is intended to give
power to all TAMBON headquarters and surrounding villages that can be connected
at a reasonable cost; the project will be implemented by PEA's provincial
offices; (iii) the village electrification program is carried out by the
provincial offices connecting distant villages, which are required to make a
capital contribution of about 25-30% of initial cost.
3.21      The speed of future electrification will depend on PEA's ability
to raise the required finance. In the past, PEA's financial policies have
been conservative -- PEA has never borrowed at interest rates greater than
4.5% unless subsidized for the excess; accordingly, demands on the Government
budget, because of tariffs being inadequate, have been high and only a small
part of rural Thailand has benefitted from such assistance. These policies
have constrained growth. To enable growth to be accelerated, PEA has begun to
drop its interest rate ceiling and government assurances have been forthcoming
that tariffs will be fixed at a level that will provide the required funds.
PEA and Government have agreed that those recommendations arising from the
on-going tariff study (para. 3.13) and mutually accepted by the Government
and the Bank, will be implemented by June 30, 1979.
/1   This has no connection with the 1975 TAMBON program and no funds are
available from the program for the project.



- 10 -
3.22      During negotiations, Government and PEA agreed that the overall
rural electrification program of about 19,000 villages through FY83 will be
implemented in a timely manner, substantially as follows:
- about 1,800 villages in FY77 (completed)
- about 2,700 villages in FY78
- about 2,900 villages in FY79
- about 3,100 villages in FY80
- about 3,300 villages in FY81
- about 3,100 villages in FY82
- about 2,100 villages in FY83
IV. THE PROJECT

4.01      The proposed project will comprise the first stage of PEA's Accel-
erated Rural Electrification Program involving the electrification of 3,825
villages in 16 northeast provinces and 742 villages in 4 other provinces.

contingencies for foreign costs were derived by applying the following

rates of escalation: 7.5% for 1977-79 and 7% thereafter. The price contin-
gencies for local costs were assumed to be 6% per annum based on the current
rate of inflation in Thailand. Price contingencies represent about 25% of
basic cost at end 1976 price levels. Given the short lead time required for
distribution projects the price contingency provisions are considered
reasonable. A unit cost analysis is given in Annex 7.
Financing Arrangements
4.05      The Government has completed arrangements to obtain a loan from the
OPEC Special Fund equivalent to about US$7.0 million to finance the foreign
exchange costs of concrete poles. The Government has also contracted a loan
from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) of about US$8.0 mil-
lion equivalent to finance the foreign exhange cost of aluminum ingots for
conductor and copper ingots for house wiring. These loans will be relent to
PEA on the same terms and conditions as to Government. The proposed Bank loan
of US$25.0 million would finance the foreign exchange costs of distribution
line accessories; transformers; switching, protection and regulating equipment;
meters and wiring; construction, test and communications equipment; tools and
vehicles; and electric pumps and motors required to convert existing equipment
to use electricity under the load promotion program. Local costs of about
US$70 million equivalent, would be financed by PEA through local borrowing.
Assumed terms of local borrowing are shown in Annex 15.
4.06      The proposed financing plan is summarized below:
Source of                                             Amount (US$ million)

4.07      Effectiveness of the loan agreements between the Government, the
OPEC Special Fund and CIDA and the agreements for relending from the Govern-
ment to PEA would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Procurement
4.08      All equipment and materials to be financed by the proposed Bank
loan would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines. A preference of 15% of the c.i.f.
price of imported goods, or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers.



- 13 -
Disbursement
4.09      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made against (i) 100%
of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and materials; (ii) 100% of
total expenditures ex-factory net of duties and taxes, for equipment and
material manufactured locally; and (iii) 65% of total expenditures for
imported equipment and materials procured locally. A disbursement schedule
is given in Annex 8.
Implementation
4.10      The engineering and construction of the project will be coordinated
by PEA's office of Accelerated Rural Electrification. There will be 20 crews,
one for each province. Each crew is expected to be able to complete 50 villages
per year by constructing approximately 125 km of primary distribution lines,
80 km of secondary distribution lines, installation of 60 distribution
transformers and connecting 4,000 houses. If necessary, part of the work
such as pole erection could be done by subcontract. PEA has the necessary
design and construction capacity, and no outside consulting services would be
required.
4.11      Most of the distribution lines would follow main or village roads.
For lines which cross private land no compensation is paid although provided
for in PEA's Act, as the villagers welcome the provision of electric services.
PEA has experienced no difficulties in obtaining easement over farmland and
no right-of-way problems are therefore anticipated.
Construction Schedule
4.12      The total construction period will be about 4.5 years.  Some construc-
tion may begin using inventory materials that will be replenished with
materials financed from the proposed loan. Procurement and other preliminary
works will take up the first six months. Full construction can be expected
from mid-1978 through end-1982, averaging about 1,000 villages a year. The
annual rate of village connections for the whole of PEA's program should not
exceed 3,300 per year through 1983, which is well within PEA's implementation
capacity.
Environmental Effects
4.13      The rural electrification project would not cause any significant
environmental problems.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
General
5.01      Since the early sixties PEA has been extending electricity supply
to rural areas at an annual rate which has grown from 940 villages in 1974,
to 1,440 in 1975 and 2,200 in 1976.



- 14 -
5.02      Until 1975 the number of villages being electrified was barely
sufficient to keep up with the number of new villages being formed each
year because of PEA's policy of supplying a village only after it had con-
tributed about 30% of the investment cost and endeavoring to cover the
remaining 70% from internal cash generation. During FY75, the Government
provided special funds for use by Tambons for general rural development
purposes. These funds helped increase dramatically the rate of village
electrification. Thus, of the 48,000 villages in Thailand, about 11,000
villages, or 23%, were electrified as of the end-1976; most of the remaining
37,000 were in PEA's service area.
The Power Market
5.03      The project will electrify one of the least developed and more
unstable areas of Thailand--the rural northeast (3,825 out of 4,567 project
villages are in the northeast). The region was chosen by Government as
a priority area for rural electrification for these reasons and because
of the social impact the project should have on the people of the region.
About 2040 out of 20,200 villages (10%) in the region had electricity
in 1976. Electricity is in most cases the least-cost method of supplying
energy to the project areas both for domestic and industrial purposes.
5.04      The load forecast for project villages made by PEA and its con-
sultants (R. W. Beck of Seattle) and reduced by the Bank as being opti-
mistic, was based on forecasting energy sales and demands for residential,
commercial, industrial and other loads (mainly water pumping) through 2012.
(Details are given in Annex 10). Residential energy demands were forecast
by analyzing historical connection /1 and power use growth rates in 274
villages covering 26,500 households in the project area. Commercial indus-
trial and other loads such as water-pumping, schools and health centers,
were forecast based on the number of rice mills, shops, pumps, schools,
health centers and industries in each village, and assuming various time
lags for their connection.
5.05      Peak demand in project villages is expected to increase from about
2 MW for 1978 to about 375 MW in 2012, an average annual growth rate of 16%;
energy sales are expected to grow from about 4 GWh for 1978 to about 840 GWh
in 2012, an average annual growth rate of about 17%. Growth is rapid in the
early years then tapers off as connection of the majority of premises (about
97% of houses in 2012) is achieved.
Return on Investment
5.06      The internal economic rate of return (IER) of the project was
calculated using EGAT's and PEA's marginal capital and operating costs of
providing the additional generation, transmission and distribution capacity
/1   Electrified houses as a percentage of the number of houses in energized
villages.



- 15 -
over 35 years; and, on the other hand, the direct revenues and the economic
benefits additional to direct revenues. These additional benefits, net of
electricity charges, are: savings in providing energy for domestic needs
compared to kerosene and batteries (light, TV, refrigerators, pumps, fans and
small generators); savings in the cost and acquisition of irrigation pumps;
increased labor productivity at peak periods; and, savings in capital and
operating costs of rice mills. The IER derived from comparing the cost and
benefit stream is 12%, (see Annex 11 for benefits and costs and Annex 12 for
IER calculation).
5.07      However, the internal financial rate of return of the project
based on forecast revenues and capital and operating costs of the project
over 35 years at 1977 price levels is minus (-) 3%. Revenues were derived
from forecast Gwh sales using PEA's average price per kWh sold after the
tariff increase in August 1977. Costs were derived from EGAT's cost of
bulk power to PEA after the 1977 tariff increase and PEA's forecast marginal
costs of investment and operation less taxes for the project at 1977 prices.
5.08      The negative IFR is in part attributable to an unavoidably arbi-
trary definition of the project. The investment and operating costs allo-
cated to project villages will also establish a main grid which would serve,
in the future, to connect, at comparatively small cost, many additional
villages and consumers which, at this stage, cannot be shown as the bene-
ficiaries of the project. The arbitrary allocation of costs to a particular
geographical portion of the grid and to villages within the grid therefore
understates the IFR. The 12% IER quoted above is also a conservative estimate
of the economic return.
5.09      In order to draw conclusions as to the adequacy of pricing policy,
the foregoing suggests that it would be more realistic to use the whole PEA
program as a basis for calculating an IFR. In this calculation, the cost
comprising PEA's investment program 1977-83, operating costs for that program
over 35 years and EGAT's average price for bulk power to the sector after the
1977 tariff increase, were compared to the incremental revenues attributable
to the PEA program. The IFR so calculated is 8%.
5.10      While this return is below the opportunity cost of capital in
Thailand (about 12%), Bank Report No. 517 "Issues in Rural Electrification"
states that "Where the economic content of rural electrification projects
is large, it may seem reasonable to expect satisfactory financial returns -
electricity increases energy use in the area, often reduces energy costs
and is far superior in quality to the alternatives. But there are three
reasons why this is not the case, at least for a period of years:
(a) the high initial investment cost associated with low density
populations, often remote from the main networks;
(b) low initial demand levels in relation to the capacity of networks
(which have large indivisibilities); it may take over 10 years
for demand to develop fully in relation to capacity; and
(c) the arguments for keeping tariffs low in relation to costs to
meet the social aims of cheap energy to low income households and
small businesses."



- 16 -
5.11      Government has adopted a policy that tariffs for a given class
of service, e.g., residential, should be uniform throughout the country as
it would be unrealistic to have a separate tariff for each community or part
of the grid. Some cross subsidy is unavoidable and the subsidy to be uIti-
mately incorporated in the tariffs is being evaluated in the ongoing study
of power sector tariffs included in the Pattani project loan to EGAT, which
was agreed during 1977.
Social Benefits
5.12      Most of the benefits accrue to the population with the lowest per
capita income in Thailand. Rural per capita income in the northeast was
B 1100 (US$54) in 1971 1/ compared to B 4670 (US$228) in northeast urban
areas and B 1970 (US$96) for the northern region which has the second lowest
rural per capita income in the country. The project therefore has a high
social content due to the foregoing, and the following:
(a) 43% of the indirect 2/ benefits result from house connections;
80% of households are expected to have power by 1990;
(b) 35% of the indirect benefits accrue to farmers who with electricity
can do more chores at night and therefore can work longer hours on
their farms, particularly during the peak season;
(c) 3% of the benefits result from the improved use of social infrastruc-
tures: piped water; use of schools at night for adult education;
health center use for emergencies; and
(d) increase in labor productivity, improvement in product quality,
and reduction in product costs with consequent expansion in the
number of off-farm jobs.
Load Promotion
5.13      The project is of a pioneering nature; it would provide electricity
to rural areas having limited potential loads and could prove a catalyst for
rural development, provided vigorous load promotion efforts are made. PEA's
load promotion program would have the following objectives:
(a) connect houses faster than envisaged by lending for house-
wiring and initial connection charges;
(b) promote the establishment of irrigation pumps in cooperation
with the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) and the Accelerated
Rural Development Department;
(1 Source - household income and expenditure survey 1971-73.
/2 Indirect benefits are all benefits other than tariffs revenues and
connection charges.



- 17 -
(c) electrify existing pumps by lending for their conversion from diesel
power;
(d) electrify village industries by lending for the conversion of diesel
engines to electric motors and to acquire additional machinery;
(e) promote piped water supplies by liaising with the appropriate
department;
(f) promote vocational and adult education in schools at night in coopera-
tion with the education and other appropriate departments; and
(g) educate the public in the various uses of electricity.
5.14      During negotiations, it was agreed that PEA will by September 30,
1978 prepare and adopt a load promotion program acceptable to the Bank and
by September 30, 1979 make appropriate administrative arrangements for the
implementation of such a program.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Results and Financial Position
6.01      The provisions of the Act governing PEA's activities and the poli-
cies followed by Management enabled a sound financial position to be main-
tained. Over the past seven years, rates of return on average net fixed
assets in operation /1 varied from a minimum of 8.8% in FY71 to a maximum
of 16.1% in FY73; for FY76 the rate of return was 12.8 %. Debt service
coverage on an annual basis was better than 4.0 times each year; self-
financing averaged 76% and for FY76 was 59.2%; the debt equity ratio at end
FY76 was 48/52 having increased from 31/69 in FY75. Long-term debt more than
doubled during FY76 as PEA borrowed locally to finance its village electri-
fication program.  PEA's financial position was sound at the end of FY76.
Income, Funds Flow Statements and Balance Sheets FY70-76, and those of EGAT
and MEA together with Consolidated Statements are shown in Annex 13.
Financing Plan
6.02      PEA's expansion program is much larger than what has been accomplished
in the past and under the rural electrification program - 19,000 villages are
scheduled to be supplied with electricity in the seven year period through
FY83, and as a result the FY77 asset base will multiply three times by FY83.
Capital expenditures to meet the required construction program are estimated
to amount to about B 15,649 million (US$763 million); B 4,788 million (US$234
million) or 30.5% would be borrowed abroad; B 4,934 million (US$240 million)
or 31.5% would be borrowed locally; B 416 million (US$20 million) or 3.0%
would come from Government equity; and B 5,198 million (US$253 million) or
33.0% would be financed from internal cash generation. It is also assumed
/1   At historic cost and after deducting average consumers contributions.

that sector tariffs will be fixed at a level to help finance both PEA and
MEA's construction programs on a rationalized tariff structure for all of
Thailand; and that surplus funds generated in Metropolitan Bangkok (MEA's
area) will be transferred to PEA by EGAT charging PEA a lower price for
purchased power than MEA. Based on these assumptions, the financing plan is
as follows:
Financing Plan: FY 1977-83
(Millions of baht and US$)
B       US$        %
Internal cash generation                              8,268      403

Capital investment                                   15,649      763     100.0
6.03      PEA and MEA have always paid customs and excise duties which amount
on average to about 40% of materials and equipment costs. The financial
forecasts therefore assume that customs duties will continue to be levied.
Continued exemption from corporate taxes as presently provided in PEA's
charter (para 3.15) is assumed. The desirability and consequences of a
decision to make the sector liable to corporate income tax will be assessed
as part of the tariff study, the recommendations of which will be discussed
by the Bank and the Government for implementation by June 1979 (para. 3.21).
Given these assumptions, PEA and MEA average tariffs per kWh are forecast to
increase by 19%, /1 5%, 9%, 4%, 6% and 6% for FY78, FY79, FY80, FY81, FY82
and FY83 respectively. The resulting average prices per kWh to be charged to
consumers will be about:

average tariff levels of neighboring countries as shown below:

Rates of Return
6.05      During negotiations it became clear that PEA was not in a position
to commit itself to any absolute numbers for an earnings covenant, whether a
rate of return or contribution to construction, as Government controls the
level of tariffs. It was therefore agreed that rate of return levels would
be incorporated in the Guarantee Agreement for the sector as a whole (see
para 6.06) and that PEA would earn a rate of return consistent with these
levels as follows:
(a)  PEA shall from time to time take all such measures (including,
without limitation, seeking the Government's authorization for
adjustments of the structure or levels of its electricity tariffs)
as shall be required to permit the achievement of an annual rate
of return on the average current net value of its fixed assets
in service consistent with the achievement of the Government's
obligation set forth in the Guarantee Agreement. To that end,
before April 30 in each of its Fiscal Years, PEA shall on the basis
of realistic forecasts, acceptable to the Bank, review the adequacy
of its tariffs for the current and the next following Fiscal Years
and shall furnish to the Bank a copy of such review upon its
completion;
(b) For the above purpose:
(i) the annual rate of return shall be calculated by dividing
the PEA's net operating income for -he Fiscal Year in question
by one-half of the sum of the current net value of PEA's fixed
assets in service at the beginning and at the end of that
Fiscal Year, expressed as a percentage;
(ii) the term "net operating income' means gross revenues from
all sources related to PEA's electricity operations less all
expenses of electricity operations., including administration,
adequate maintenance and taxes or any payments in lieu of
taxes, and provision for depreciation. Interest and other
charges on debt are not considered to be operating expenses
for the purposes of determining said. net operating income;
and



- 20 -
(iii)  the term "current net value of the PEA's fixed assets in
service" means the gross value of the PEA's fixed assets in
service less the amount of accumulated depreciation and
consumers contributions, all valued annually in accordance
with the fixed capital formation deflator for public investment
in the Government's annual accounts.
(c)  without limitation or restriction upon the generality of the
foregoing paragraph (a) of this Section, except as the Bank shall
otherwise agree, PEA shall at all times maintain in its tariff
schedule a provision for fuel and power purchase adjustment to
increase or decrease the energy charges to its consumers to compen-
sate for changes in the cost of fuel and purc:hased power.
6.06      The cross-funding of PEA from MEA and the dependence of both these
utilities on EGAT for the provision of power makes it necessary that the
sector as a whole earns a rate of return that will ensure consumers are
charged a reasonable price for power and at the same time generate sufficient
funds from internal cash generation to enable the sector development program
to continue unhindered. It was therefore agreed that the sector as a whole
would earn rates of return of 7% for FY78 and FY79 (based on 29% tariff
increases implemented in August 1977) and 9% thereafter based on the defini-
tions included in 6.05. To this end it was also agreed that:
(a) Before April. 30 in each of its Fiscal Years, the Government
shall:
(i)  cause CPPD (A) to review, on the basis of realisitic forecasts,
the adequacy of- tariffs to produce for the current and next
following Fiscal Years such agreed annual rate of return, and
(B) on the basis above, to determine (1) electricity tariffs
charged to consumers at levels sufficient to produce the
agreed annual rate of return and (2) electricity charges made
by EGAT to JEA and MEA at different levels calculated to
enable PEA, EGAT and MEA each to carry out its investment
program for each Fiscal Year through 1983 at levels satisfac-
tory to the Government and the Bank; and
(ii)  furnaish to the Bank a copy of such review and determination
upoll their completion.
(b)  The Government shall continue to maintain CPPD (or such other body
as it may appoint to replace CPPD) under such terms of reference as
shall be necessary to enable CPPD (or its successor) properly to
carry out the review and determination referred to in subsection
(a) of this Secti.on.
Level of Self-Financing
6.07      The forecasts asE;ume thiEt EGAT will charge PFA and MEA for purchased
power at the following prices:

MEA        0.553   0.668   0.657   0.750   0.791   0.847   0.901
6.08      Based on all the foregoing assumptions PEA is estimated to self-
generate the following percentages of construction expenditures:
1977   1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983

average               23.3    28.2    46.4    35.8       -        -
The corresponding rates of return on a revalued rate base 1/ are 8.9% for
FY77, 9.0% for FY78, 9.3% for FY79 and 9.0% thereafter.
Future Operating Results
6.09      PEA's energy sales are estimated to increase from 3,185 GWh in FY77 to
7,924 GWh in FY83, an average annual growth rate of 16.4%. Based on the tariff
increases detailed in paragraph 6.03, energy revenues are forecast to increase
from B 2,237 million (US$109.1 million) in FY77 to B 8,815 million (US$430.1
million) in FY83, an average growth rate of 25.7% per year; operating expenses
after escalation at 6% p.a. are expected to grow from B 2,191 million
(US$106.9 million) to B 8,347 million (US$407.2 million) an average annual
growth rate of 25.0%.
6.10      The operating ratio remains at around 89.5% through the period of
the forecast.
6.11      PEA's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt/equity ratio will vary between 54/46 (FY78 and
FY82) and 59/41 (FY79 and FY80).
6.12      The current ratio has varied in the past from a minimum of
1.0 (FY75) to a maximum of 1.9 (FY70); it was 1.3 for FY76. Consumers
receivables at end-FY76 were about 2 months billing and they have been fore-
cast at this level through the forecast period. Inventories were about 22%
of gross plant at end-FY76, a very high level; they are expected to fall to
about 5% of gross plant by the end of the forecast period; payables are
forecast at 25% of power purchased and 30% of construction, the FY76 levels;
year-end cash balances are adequate throughout the period of the forecast.
The current ratio varies from 0.7 (FY83) to 1.5 (FY77); the relatively low
levels are due to receivables being outstanding for two months on average and
/1 Revalued average net fixed assets in operation less average consumers
contributions.

PEA being allowed three months for payment to EGAT. Estimated Income, Funds
Flow Statements and Balance Sheets, FY77-83 together with those of MEA, EGAT
and Consolidated Statements are shown in Annex 14. Annex 15 shows the
assumptions used in the financial forecasts.
Debt Control
6.13      Debt service coverage on an annual basis varies between a minimum
of 1.5 times (FY83) and 4.8 times (FY77). PEA is a well-operated utility
whose management follows conservative financial policiep.  A debt-limitation
covenant is therefore required that will give adequate treedom to enable PEA
to manage its debt without undue consultation with the Bank while providing
for Bank review of borrowings when debt reaches a level that could affect
the future financial position of the Authority. During negotiations it was
agreed that PEA will only incur debt to an aggregate amount that will
maintain the debt/equity ratio at 60/40 or below. Medium-term debt which
matures within five years, will be limited to 10% of total debt.
Receivables
6.14      PEA's consumers' receivables at end-FY76 were equivalent to about
2 months energy billing. Private consumers bills are normally paid within
about a month; Government departments pay late and cause outstanding accounts
to be larger than necessary. The Government has undertaken to pay or cause
to be paid all electricity bills on a current basis.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:
(a)  fuel and purchased energy adjustment clause (para. 3.12);
(b)  tariff study (para. 3.13 and 3.21);
(c)  rural electrification program (para. 3.22);
(d)  effectiveness of loan agreements (para. 4.07);
(e)  load promotion (paras. 5.14);
(f)  rates of return (para. 6.05, 6.06 and 6.08);
(g)  debt/equity ratio (para. 6.13);
(h)  medium-term borrowing (para. 6.13); and
(i)  receivables (para. 6.14).

Tariff Study - Terms of Reference
General
1.        Before decisions on policy can be taken by Government, the costs of
supplying and distributing electric power should be known so that the conse-
quences of any decisions made by the Board are revealed.
Objective
2.        The purpose of the study should be to derive a tariff structure
which reflects as closely as possible the costs to the economy of meeting
the demand for electricity, subject to any constraints imposed by the revenue
requirements necessary to meet sector's financial objectives and by any income
distribution objectives (e.g., subsidizing poor consumers) which the electric-
ity tariffs may be required to serve.
Analysis of Costs
3.        The relevant costs are not the financial costs to EGAT, MEA and PEA
of expanding and operating their systems to meet the demand, but the incre-
mental costs to the economy. Strictly speaking, therefore, shadow prices
(for capital, labor and foreign exchange) rather than actual prices should be
used as appropriate for measuring costs and any taxes on sector inputs should
be deducted and subsidies added back. In this case, however, exclusion of
taxes and subsidies from the costs already available within the sector will
suffice, although it is suggested that the opportunity cost of capital should
be taken as 12%.
4.        The first step would be to analyze the marginal costs of generating,
transmitting and distributing electricity at different places, times and volt-
age levels to different consumers over the next few years, defined for this
purpose as the period 1977-83. Due attention would be required for the daily
and seasonal variations in forecast system demand, and to the extent possible,
in forecast demands of various consumer classes. The basis for the estimates
of marginal costs would be the development program for the period 1977-83 at
constant prices, all of which formed the basis of the forecasts used by the
appraisal mission for the Pattani and ARE projects.
5.        For time periods when demand does not come up against the system
capacity constraint (allowing for the reserve margins to maintain security
of supply already agreed), marginal costs would be simply marginal costs
grossed up to allow for losses at the different voltage levels. The rele-
vant losses are incremental losses, even if they can be estimated only
approximately, not average losses.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        At periods when an increase in generation would bring the system up
against the security constraint, the marginal cost of meeting demand would be
the addition to all system costs resulting from adding to generation capacity
and/or storage, transmission and distribution, in order to provide the in-
creased supply with an unchanged probability of failure.
7.        Incremental costs attributable to poor power factors should also be
studied for those types of consumer (the larger ones) who can be expected to
improve their power factor in response to suitable tariff incentives. The
most important cost is the extra MVA capacity required to cater to those
poor power factors.
Existing Tariffs
8.        The next step would be to examine the existing tariff structures
and compare them with the structure of marginal costs of supply derived from
the foregoing analysis. Large differences between the two may be an indica-
tion that the existing system is giving the wrong price signals to consumers.
Examination of the existing system should pay particular attention to what
types of tariffs are feasible.  Other features to look for in examining the
existing system are whether it is difficult to administer, conducive to dis-
putes or conducive to fraud, since these will provide useful pointers to im-
provement in devising the new tariff structure.
9.        Examination of the existing tariff structure would embrace the cur-
rent levels of consumer contributions and whether the criteria used to assess
these contributions is appropriate in view of the launching of the accelerated
rural electrification program.. All forms of consumer contributions should be
studied including village contributions, charges for connection including
house wiring, payments for service lines and security deposits.
New Tariff Proposals
10.       With the information thus collected, it should be possible to make
a first set of proposals for changing the existing tariff system so that the
incentives (and disincentivesl it provides to consumers correspond more
closely to the schedule of marginal costs derived. These proposals would
consist of a classification of consumers and a tariff (or set of tariffs)
for each class, together with any connection charges for reactive power
which can be justified. Both Government and the authorities are then in
a position to decide the tariff policies to be adopted. The tariffs can
then be modified to take accotnt of these policies and the following:
(a)  any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs
because of price distortions (e.g., of substitutes for
public electricity supply) elsewhere in the economy
which are likely to affect electricity sales in the
absence of such slanting;



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(b) the desirability of the three power authorities paying
taxation on the same basis as any other commercial entity;
(c) the need for EGAT, MEA and PEA collectively, and private
franchises individually, to generate sufficient funds to
meet the demands in their areas without fiscal assistance.
This would generally mean raising those elements of the pro-
posed tariffs where price elasticity of demand is least, if
the revenues based on marginal cost pricing are insufficient.
Rates of return and contributions to construction levels
should be considered within the study and should generally
be fixed at levels which will provide revenues sufficient
to cover:
(i) operating costs;
(ii) debt and equity servicing;
(iii) working capital requirements;
(iv) a contribution to construction costs sufficient
to bridge any gap between construction costs
and possible consumers contributions, borrowings
and additional equity.
(d) any income redistribution objectives (e.g., through sub-
sidiary power consumers) to which electricity tariffs
may be required to contribute in Thailand; and
(e) practicality and cost. There is a trade-off between the
cost of administering any tariff structure (which largely
depends on the cost of metering and billing) and the
extent to which it can reflect the structure of marginal
costs. Complex metering, for example, is likely to be
worthwhile only for larger consumers, since the response
of small consumers to the extra incentives (or disincen-
tives) it offers would not justify the expense.
11.       Modification of the strict "marginal cost" tariffs should be de-
signed to cause the least possible disturbance to the incentives they offer
to consumers in relation to the cost of supplying them.
12.       The new tariff schedule should provide for the automatic adjust-
ment of rates in the event of increases in the price of fuel for thermal
and diesel plants. The price level at which the fuel adjustment comes into
effect should be defined.

A Project Village
1.        The main features of a project village are:  a high population
growth rate (over 2.5% a year); a moderate income growth rate (4-5% a year);
a relatively large farm size (over 5 hectares a family); low land yields;
absence of multiple cropping; and skewed income distribution (low Gini
coefficient). Table 1 gives highlights of a project village:

2.        The following paragraphs show how electricity can greatly enlarge
rural development potential. To use power effectively villagers need know-
how, which means RTG ought to embark on promoting power use vigorously.
3.        A Thai household needs energy for lighting, cooking, and water
supply. Electricity is more economical than kerosene lamps. A household,
which on average has about 3 lamps, uses two of them 4 hours at night (6-10
p.m.), and one hour in the morning, consuming some 90 liters (3.3 million BTU)
of kerosene a year. If we substitute two fluorescent tubes (25 watts each)
for the lamps, 91 kwh of power would be used a year (1.6 million BTU, assuming
a 20 percent thermal efficiency), which means a 50% economy in energy use.
4.        For cooking needs charcoal (or wood) is cheaper than kerosene, al-
though off-peak electricity remains quite competitive. 1/ But, once farmers
develop village woodlots and manage them effectively, wood and charcoal will
become cheaper than off-peak power. This is because the fuel need (cooking)
of a village is about 150 tons 2/ of wood a year, which a 35 hectare village
woodlot can supply cheaply (yields can also be raised to 10-15 tons a hectare),
with farmers working on the lot during slack season at probably one-half of
peak-season labor cost. Electricity can, however, reduce pressure on the
overexploited national forests, which ought to be preserved to save the
country's watershed.
5.        Rural households also need piped water, which has to be pumped
to a water tower. Electric pumps provide more cheaply than, say, gasoline
engines a households' water needs (40-70 liters, per capita a day).
6.        To get more out of their land, farmers also require more energy
than they now have. First, they need energy to prepare their land, and to
plant and harvest it. In a project village farmers cultivate about 600 hec-
tares a year. They need, at least, 0.7 3/ of one horsepower (520 watt) per
hectare, or about 500 4/ kwh a year.  Current energy supply is much less
1/   Energy need for cooking is about 600,000 BTU (net) a year which is
equal to using 450 kg of charcoal, or 80 liters of kerosene or 250
kwh of electricity. Assumed fuel efficiencies are: 5% wood; 20%
kerosene and 15% electricity - 70% at end use. Costs are: charcoal
B 248 (B 0.55 a kg.); kerosene B 266 (B 3.33 a liter); and electricity
B 175 (B 0.70 a kwh).
2/   A household uses about 450 kg of charcoal (27,500 BTU a kg) or about
one ton of wood (12,000 BTU a kg) a year; with 145 households in a
project village, annual need for wood is about 150 tons.

Foundation, 1975, p.17.

(365 1/ kwh a year); 80 kwh from manpower and 285 kwh from animal-power).
Second, farmers need energy to irrigate more land. Because many project
villages are close to perennial sources of water, pump-irrigation can greatly
develop multiple cropping and increase land yield by expanding pump irriga-
tion. Since it is cheaper to energize irrigation pumps with electricity than
with petroleum products, electric pumps increase farm incomes more than diesel
engines.
7.        Moreover, in a village workshop as manpower is aided with horse-
power, labor cost will be reduced, and labor output increased. This is because
a horsepower, operating 8 hours a day uses 1,790 kwh a year, and costs B 895
(B.0.50 a kwh, off-peak). In contrast, the yearly wage of an eight-man crew
(one hp) is at least B 35,000. This also means that those who use power
can produce more than those who do not. Also, gain in labor productivity
results in qualitative improvement in output. Modern tools and techniques
that use power diversify and upgrade local products; they also save input and
increase output values. Thus, in a village rice mill, an electric motor runs
more smoothly, with less cost, than a diesel engine. Compared with the
latter, an electric motor yields more unbroken rice, which fetches more than
if sold as residual rice brans.

THAILAND
PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Demand for Power
1.        The mission reviewed demand for power by:  rural households;
existing facilities in project villages; and facilities most likely to be
established during 1978-2012. In addition, possible growth of income and
population in the project area were also examined. The following review
focuses, therefore, on: income and population growth rates; residential
demand; potential demand by existing units; other potential demand; and
peak demand.
Income
2.         Generally, the project villages are closer than other unelectri-
fied villages to transport and power networks. This means industrial growth
in urban centers would pull income in project villages more than in other
unelectrified villages, a trend to be further reinforced by rural electrifica-
tion and the possibility that RTG develop these centrally located and high
density villages more than others. Moreover, further income growth could
result from efforts to eliminate income gaps through more investment in rural
areas than in the past, improved terms of trade for rural products, and
the creation of off-farm jobs and incomes.  Based on these assumptions
Table 1 gives the mission's projection of income growth rates. As compared
to past growth performance (see Table 4) and a 6-7% future growth prospect,
the mission estimates are realistic:
Table 1
Annual Growth of Income in Project Areas

Population
3.        To arrive at total population NESDB's medium projections were used.
By assuming a 5% yearly increase in urban population, the mission arrived at
growth rates for rural households.
Residential Demand
4.        To determine residential demand, the mission assessed:  demand
level; connection rate 1/; and demand growth rate. As for demand level and
connection rates, information was obtained on residential power use in
274 villages in the project area, with over 26,500 energized households.
Table 5 highlights the results. Since power consumers in these villages
are richer than those in project villages, consumption figures were scaled
down so as to forecast power use in project villages (see Table 6).
5.        In addition, to assess the growth of demand, we reviewed historical
trends and conducted some cross-section analyses. During 1963-76 in Bangkok,
for instance, the yearly rate of increase in per household income was less
than 3% and that in a household's power use, over 8%-demand for power increas-
ing from 600 kwh per energized household in 1963 to 1,700 kwh in 1976.
Experience in the PEA area also confirms that power use increases faster than
income. Furthermore, the mission related residential power consumption in
1975 in the 274 villages to their income levels. This analysis suggests an
income elasticity of 1.23 for the Northeast, and 1.1 for other four provinces;
these elasticity coefficients were then used to forecast demand in project
villages.
6.        Households use electricity for various purposes:  light, refri-
gerator, TV, fan, and iron, in particular. To determine benefits and peak
demand, results of Thailand's socioeconomic survey were reviewed from
which was inferred ratios of households that could buy electric appliances
(see Tables 7 and 8).
Demand Potential - Existing Units
7.        As for demand potential by existing units, the mission collated
information on village facilities (see Table 2) and then assumed: shops
to be energized as soon as power lines reach a village; rice mills to be
electrified as diesel motors wear out--with mill capacity remaining unchanged;
25% of machine-operated pumps are for artesian wells and were assumed
to be energized after a two-year time-lag; a 5% annual increase in number was
also assumed after 1985; schools and health centers to be connected (with no
time lag); and power use by industrial establishments to be related to
increases in their labor productivity (3% a year), one-half of which was
attributed to power use (expressed in hp and, then in kwh).

Potential Demand - New Facilities
8.        PEA identified about 22% of project villages as being close
to major rivers. Once multiple cropping comes into vogue, many of these
could use electric pumps for irrigation. The mission assumed that power use
for this purpose would be modest and occur only after 1981. Thus we assume
that by the year 2012 only 9% of planted land in project villages will
raise a second crop. Again, safe water is inaccessible to most village
inhabitants; it is assumed they will have it before 1990.
Peak Demand
9.        Finally, peak demand and load factor projections (Table 9) are
based on the following ratios:
Table 3
Peak Demand as Ratio of Total Demand
Purpose
Light                               0.80
Refrigerator and fan                0.17

Benefit and Cost of Rural Electrification
1.        Benefit.  Many rural electrification benefits are nonquantifiable.
Power tariffs recover some quantifiable benefits which we call direct (30%).
Other quantifiable benefits, indirect, (70%), stem from: kerosene and other
fuel cost savings; increased farm and industrial output; sale of refrigerated
products and ice; and social benefits.
Table 1 summarizes quantifiable benefits and costs.

2.        Residential consumers benefit by substituting electricity for
kerosene in at least two ways:



ANNEX 11
Page 2
(a) by savings in fuel cost, and
(b) by using nights productively on: studies; farm-tool
repairs; mending shoes and clothes; stitching; spinning,
weaving, and producing other home made goods. Benefits
of the latter type are, however, difficult to quantify.
3.        Electricity helps agriculture in various ways.  First, an irrigation
pump, which is one of the best ways of supplying water, operates more cheaply
by electric motors than by diesel engines. In addition, because manpower and
draft animals provide a small part of additional energy needed to supply water,
mechanical energy becomes essential to multiple cropping and improved land
yields.
4.        Second, electricity relieves labor shortages during peak agricul-
tural seasons; it mitigates household chores and drudgery at workshops, and
also extends work periods (nights and early mornings). Labor shortages,
during busy seasons, have a high economic cost. Since the availability of
busy season labor is essential to increase farm output, villages tolerate
off-peak unemployment more than they would do otherwise. In addition, be-
cause of busy season labor shortages, innovations and crop area extensions
that require peak labor are hampered. Also, families directly affected by
such shortages could opt for expanding their size, which is an uneconomical
way of meeting critical energy needs.
5.        Moreover, electricity in workshops saves fuel cost (rice mills,
in particular). It increases labor productivity by substituting horsepower
for manpower, the former being much cheaper than the latter. Furthermore,
domestic industries that make electrical appliances and fixtures gain because
of an increase in demand for their products.
6.        Electricity also introduces refrigerators and ice to village shops.
Consequently, rural people will have access to many perishable products, to
medicines that have to be refrigerated, cold drinks and sherbets. Village
shops also gain by using power for pumping water and illumination.
7.        Electricity has many other benefits.  It introduces, through mass
media (especially TV), extension services, informal education, good hygienic
practices, child care, and family planning methods. Also, it reduces ur-
banization costs; with an improvement in rural life style and greater work
opportunities in villages than before, urban influx may slow down; these
benefits cannot be quantified. The mission has tried, however, to partially
quantify the benefits of piped water and of the greater use of facilities
such as schools and health centers.
8.        Cost.  To provide electricity, EGAT and PEA incur capital and
current costs. Broadly speaking, EGAT invests in generating capacity and
in transmission lines, and PEA in subtransmission lines that link villages
with the main grid system. The program has been charged with the capital cost



ANNEX 11
Page 3
of additional peak demand (marginal cost), which is B 18,500 a kw (1976
prices).  Similarly, we have charged the program with the subtransmissic-
cost -- B 412,000 a village (1976 prices).
9.        In addition, EGAT's current cost (marginal) for one kwh of delivered
energy is B 0.38 (1976 prices), and PEA's costs are based on past experience.

ANNEX 11
Page 5
Notes
I.   Benefits.  Direct benefits are equal to projected consumption
(see Annex II) times tariffs: B 0.7 (US 3.5 cents) per kwh, peak energy,
and B 0.50 (US 2.5cents) per kwh for off peak energy.
II.  Indirect Benefits (quantifiable)
A. Residential. Households' benefit from electric light is due to
cost saved by not using kerosene; from such savings were deducted
fixed and running cost of wiring, fixtures and fluorescent
tubes. TV benefits are due to cost differences between a battery
operated TV set and one run by electricity times the number of
potential users. In unelectrified villages if it becomes con-
venient to recharge batteries, once or twice a week, many people
would acquire TV sets; accessibility to service centers rather than
cost is what essentially hampers the use of TV. A similar approach
is followed to measure potential benefits from refrigerators. The
capital cost of a kerosene-run refrigerator is about four times that
of one powered with electricity; the former's running cost is,
however, about one-half of the latter's. Hence, benefits represent
the potential capital saving in capital cost (after adjusting for
the higher cost of running an electric refrigerator); only 30%
of benefits accruing to potential users of electric refrigerators
are taken into account. The 30% is a rough measure of benefits
that would accrue to families who would have acquired kerosene
refrigerators had the latter's capital cost been, say, 60-65% of its
current value. As for fans, since the alternative cost of energizing
them (for example, by a small generator) is much higher than PEA's
tariffs, the same measure of benefit was applied as that used for
electric lights.
B. Agricultural. Since farms need more energy than they have currently
(see Annex I), additional labor input during peak season is the
principal benefit. Farmers in the electrified households are
assumed to work one hour more than others, for 60 days in one
year. The ensuing benefits stem from the difference between
subsistence and peak labor costs, the former measuring the cost
of additional supply and the latter the value of additional
output. Benefits of irrigation pumps are caused by savings
in capital and fuel costs.
C. Industrial. Rice mill benefits are due to savings in capital and
fuel costs; mill engines are assumed to be replaced by electric
motors as they wear out. Benefits of other village industries
reflect part of the increase in labor productivity that can be



ANNEX 11
Page 6
attributed to power use; in other words, value added attri-
butable to the increase in labor supply and technological
improvement, is deducted from increased output. In addition,
because of increases in sale of electric appliances and
fixtures, industries producing such items would expand;
such benefits represent a part of increase in domestic
value added.
D.   Commercial.  Sale of refrigerated products (ice, sherbet
and cold drinks) increase shop incomes. To arrive at net
benefits, the capital and running cost of refrigerators
are deducted from gross benefits. Other benefits are
mostly due to kerosene cost savings.
E.   Social.  Households are assumed to have piped water avail-
able before 1990 (40-70 liter, per capita a day). Since
water has to be pumped to a water tower, mostly from wells,
benefits represent savings in fuel and other costs of pump-
ing water with electric motors, rather than with gasoline
engines. Other benefits are mostly cost savings (light).
Since some schools will run a second shift at night, savings
in construction cost are also included as part of the benefits.
III. Costs. All costs are marginal costs. Para 8 of this Annex gives some
of the unit costs. PEA's current cost is based on (a) operation and
maintenance cost; (b) customer accounting; and (c) general administration.
(a) is estimated at 3.7-4.5% of system assets for this program at the
end of each year; (b) and (c) are each based on an annual charge of
B 55 per customer.

ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Economic and Social Rates of Return
1.        To evaluate the project the costs and benefits of the two major
components (North-east and other) were estimated. After adjusting for in-
direct taxes internal rates of return (IRR) were derived from the net bene-
fits. Table 1, Annex II, shows the present value of benefits and costs
discounted by the IRR. Second tradable benefits and costs in domestic
prices were expressed at border prices. After calculating net efficiency
benefits (E) 1/ by using shadow wage rates for unskilled labor (assuming,
initially, n to be zero) the internal economic rates of return (IERR) were
calculated. Third, we used some income distribution weights - d = (c/c) -
for wage-earners and for project village consumers (based on field visits
and project data) so as to evaluate net social benefit (or cost) of the in-
crease in private sector consumption 2/ that would stem from wage payments
and a part of indirect benefits 3/. Then, after adjusting net efficiency
benefits (E) for benefits (or cost) of increased private sector consumption 4/
the internal social rates of return (ISRR) were derived.
2.        The social rate of return calculations assume that the value of
an additional unit of income is less for a consumer with a higher income,
and that this rate of decline is constant. We have used three different
assumptions about the rate of decline in the marginal utility of income:
(a)  a slow decline (n = 0.5) - giving a low priority to
income distribution;
(b)  a moderate decline (n = 1.0) - placing a moderate emphasis
on income distribution; and
1/   For notations see Economic Analysis of Projects by Lyn Squire and
Herman G. van der Tak, The John Hopkins University Press, 1975.
2/   C (B-W).
3/   80% of ARE's quantifiable indirect benefits and 100% of wage payments
are assumed to be consumed; direct benefits are public funds and were
therefore expressed in terms of the numeraire.
4/   E - C (B-W).

(c)  a rapid decline (n - 1.25) - according a high priority to
income distribution.
To carry out the analyses a number of parameters were used which are summar-
ized in Table 1.
3.        As shown in Table 2, the project's ISRRs are higher than the social
accounting rates of interest; particularly the northeast component.

ACCELERATED RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
General
1.        The finances of EGAT, PEA and MEA are interdependent, therefore the
assumptions used for all three authorities are covered below.
Revenues
2.        Revenues have been forecast as follows:
(a) FY77 thru 79: Revenues for all three authorities, separately
and consolidated, are based on the annual revenues required to
cover all operating costs (including depreciation), debt service,
working capital and the finance gap between construction
expenditures and estimated borrowings and equity from sources
external to the power sector;
(b) FY80 thru 83: Revenues were forecast at the level required
to produce a rate of return for the sector on revalued net fixed
assets of 9.0%. As a first approximation the same average selling
price per kWh was used for PEA and MEA, without adjustments for
load factor. EGAT's cost of purchased power each year was then
decreased for PEA, and increased for MEA, so that PEA's and MEA's
revenues separately cover the costs and expenditures of the
utilities. EBAT is therefore acting as a channel for the transfer
of surplus funds from MEA to PEA. In addition, EGAT revenues were
forecast at the level required to meet the covenant established in
the Loan Agreement of the Pattani Project (contribution to construc-
tion of 15% for FY78 and FY79).
Fuel
3.        Fuel costs have been assumed as follows:
(a) EGAT: Fuel oil has been forecast at B 1.66 per liter (US 8.1 cents)
the 1977 price, with an escalation of 6% per year.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
(b)  PEA: Diesel fuel as forecast by PEA, with a 6% ner yvr escr.1-`"-.
(c) MEA: Purchases alL energy required from EGAT.
Operating Expenses
4.        Operating expenses have been based on the 1976 costs as under:
(a) EGAT: For increases in plant capacity at the 1976 cost per
MW of installed capacity and for increases in transmission
lines, based on the 1976 cost per km for operating and main-
tenance. Escalation has been taken at 6% per year.
(b)  PEA and MEA:  Operating costs of PEA and MEA have been fore-
cast at the 1976 unit costs per kWh, per consumer or per
employee as appropriate to the type of expense. Escalation
at 6% per year has been included.
Depreciation
5.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method at the following
percent rates:
Plant category                               EGAT      PEA
Steam plants                                   4
