F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The program development objective is the establishment of an appropriate policy
framework for an efficient national safety net system.

The proposed DPC support falls under pillar III of the CAS: supporting the poor and
vulnerable. The CAS recognizes that the existing social assistance programs cover a very
small fraction of the poor, provide negligible benefits, and suffer from ineffective
targeting, weak administration, and a lack of monitoring and evaluation. To this end, the
CAS notes that the Bank's support will include support for safety nets that will (i) help
the chronic poor cope with poverty, and where possible; (ii) help the poor escape poverty,
e.g., via conditional cash transfers; and (iii) help families and households cope with
seasonal shocks.

The proposed DPC is fully consistent with the PRSP 2, which identifies assisting the poor
and the vulnerable as a key objective of Government's poverty reduction strategy. The
proposed DPC is also consistent with the National Social Protection Strategy that
supports the development of an effective and financially sustainable safety net system to
promote the re-distributive goals of society

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Over the decade preceding the Social Safety Net Development Policy Credit
(SSN DPC), Pakistan had experienced relatively high levels of growth and a gradual
decline in poverty. However, chronic poverty still remained high at some 22 percent in
2004/2005 (the most recently available data at the time of project preparation).
Vulnerability to income shocks was also high: economic ones such as the global food,
fuel and financial crises; natural disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts and floods; and
idiosyncratic shocks such as illness, injury and unemployment. Existing publicly
financed social protection programs were limited in their ability to provide adequate
protection to the chronically poor and in their ability to respond to shocks. The public
safety net essentially consisted of two weakly targeted cash transfer programs providing
low benefits and irregular benefit provision – Zakat, a cash transfer that was managed by
the Ministry of Religious Affairs and implemented by local committees with financing
from individual contributions; and Bait-U-Mal, a public food support program
administered by The Ministry of Social Welfare. Spending on the two programs was a
low 0.14 percent of GDP (2004/2005). 
2.       Recognizing the need to strengthen the country’s social protection system, the
Government, with support from the Bank and other donors, had started a collaborative
process in 2006 to develop a national social protection strategy that was approved by the
Cabinet in 2007. A central feature of the strategy was the development of a poverty
targeted cash benefit. This resulted in the establishment by the Government of the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in 2008 as its flagship cash benefit program
which was to evolve into a national safety net platform that would either integrate or
harmonize with other programs. The BISP would apply a poverty scorecard (a proxy
means test) for selecting beneficiaries; it would also serve as a multi-purpose national
targeting system. A pilot phase was launched in early 2009 to draw lessons for
subsequent scaling up to the national level. At the same time, the Government increased
its safety net spending from 0.14 percent of GDP in 2004/2005 to 0.6 percent in 2008 and
1 percent in 2010. Safety net spending was to be maintained for the medium term and
possibly longer. 
3.      The Bank had supported the strengthening of safety nets in Pakistan for several
years, gradually widening the engagement to include: (i) analysis of the efficiency of
social protection expenditures; (ii) technical assistance to formulate the national social
protection strategy; (iii) analytic work on the targeting performance of existing social
assistance programs and the development of the poverty scorecard; (iv) policy dialogue
with provincial governments on social protection policy and programs; (v) support for
social care services for the disabled; and (vi) technical assistance to support the design
and implementation of a pilot CCT. 
4.       The introduction of the BISP launched an ambitious agenda of institutional
reform, and the Bank chose to support it through a programmatic mix of interventions. In
order to provide effective assistance to BISP in the short term, technical assistance was
initially provided through DFID financing (a Trust Fund managed by the Bank) that
served to test the poverty scorecard and set up the initial organizational and operational

                                            1
systems for the program, as well as to pilot the CCT. Subsequently, the Bank approved a
Social Safety Net Technical Assistance project in June, 2009 (SSN TA) to be
implemented over a four-year period 2010 – 2014. That project was designed to support
the establishment of the national targeting system, strengthen BISP operations,
management, accountability, and monitoring and evaluation systems, as well as to
advance analytical and data work for implementing and monitoring the national social
protection strategy. The SSN DPC was approved in September 2009 as a further means
of supporting the reform and providing budgetary assistance to the Government. 
5.       All these initiatives fell fully within the framework of the CAS. The CAS
recognized the weaknesses of existing social assistance programs and noted that the Bank
financing would include support for safety nets that could (i) help the chronic poor cope
with poverty, and where possible, help the poor escape poverty, e.g., via conditional cash
transfers; and (ii) help families and households cope with seasonal shocks. The
initiatives were also fully consistent with the Pakistan’s PRSP and its national social
protection strategy. 
6.      At SSN DPC appraisal (April 2009), the country had an adequate macro-
economic framework. Pakistan’s economic performance had been strong for part of the
decade, but in 2007/2008, a sharp rise in international food and oil prices, in combination
with internal political uncertainties, had led to rapidly expanding macroeconomic
imbalances, and spending overruns had led to a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit, as the
Government tried to protect households and businesses from rising food and oil prices
through subsidies. Simultaneously, increased import bills and strong domestic demand
contributed to a widening current account deficit. Recognizing the need to correct the
imbalances, the Government introduced a stabilization program which included a
medium-term macroeconomic framework that envisaged fiscal and monetary tightening.
The program was supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) that was put in
place in November 2008. At the time of appraisal, the program, slightly revised to take
into account effects of a deteriorating global economy, was on track. In its assessment at
the time, the Bank team recognized the macroeconomic downside risks, but at the same
time noted that the IMF SBA was likely to mitigate such risk by committing the
authorities to specific fiscal and current account deficit targets. Moreover, policy-based
Bank lending was seen as a critical element of the Government’s financial planning as
reflected in the SBA. To this end, an initial policy loan – the Pakistan Poverty Reduction
and Economic Support Operation (PRESO) - was approved in March 2009, and followed
by the SSN DPC. At the time, other donors had also committed significant resources,
with the international community pledging more than US$5 billion to Pakistan at a
donors’ conference in April, 2009. The resources were to be utilized over the subsequent
two years, primarily to expand social protection and enhance human development
spending. 
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.       The objective of the DPC was to support the establishment of an appropriate
policy framework for an efficient safety net system, including the development of sound
institutions for the effective implementation of the Benazir Income Support Program
(BISP). It was conceived as a single DPC with two tranches. 
8.     A set of quantitative outcome indicators for the DPC were specified for the year
2010, as follows:  
                                            2
   1) Increase in the share of beneficiaries enrolled in the BISP program using the new
      targeting mechanism from 0 to at least 30 percent of total beneficiaries.
   2) Increase in the share of total benefit expenditures reaching the poorest 40 percent
      of the population from 46 percent to at least 55 percent.
   3) Increase in program applicants receiving a response on whether they qualify for
      the program within 3 months from scorecard form submission, from 0 to at least
      50 percent of total applicants.
   4) Increase in benefit payments audited from 0 percent to at least 50 percent o f total
      payments under the new payment system and improvement in reconciliation time
      lag from the present indefinite period to two months.
   5) Increase in percentage of participating (poverty-scorecard) districts in which
      beneficiary lists are publicly available, from 0 to at least 30 percent.
9.     In addition, a set of medium term process-related objectives and milestones were
defined, reflecting the broader goal of building a national safety net. They provided the
link between the DPC prior actions and the subsequent institution building that was
necessary in order to implement safety net reform. Those objectives and milestones were
pursued under a companion TA project (see “Other Significant Changes? and “Program
Performance? below). 

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

Neither the PDO nor key indicators were revised during implementation.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
10.      The reform of the safety net included three complementary policy areas: (i) the
development of a targeting system that would be transparent and serve to identify the
eligible poor (the poverty scorecard); (ii) the establishment of a legal, policy and
institutional framework to ensure sound management, governance, monitoring and
administration of the program, including exit policies to help the poor and vulnerable
graduate from the safety net program; and (iii) the expansion of coverage and provision
of adequate benefit amounts, within a framework that would ensure fiscal sustainability;
and benefit payments to the poor delivered on time and with adequate governance and
control mechanisms in place. 
11.     The policy reforms had been initiated under PRESO which supported the
adoption of the poverty scorecard as the targeting instrument for BISP, and included the
preparation of a plan for its roll-out. The DPC supported all three policy reform areas,
grouped into three “pillars?. Each pillar contained prior actions, medium term objectives
for reform and medium term milestones. Table 1 summarizes the pillars and relates them
to the reform areas and the medium term objectives. (See Annex 7 for a detailed Policy
Matrix).

12.    The DPC included seven prior actions under 3 pillars for the release of the first
tranche (US$ 150 million) and two triggers for the release of the second tranche (US$50
million), as follows: 
First Tranche Prior Actions
Pillar I: Improve the targeting efficiency of safety nets programs




                                                     4
1) A national targeting system established to implement the poverty scorecard method,
   through contracting of separate agencies for scorecard data collection and eligibility
   determination.
2) Policy decision on improving BISP targeting mechanism and transition of BISP
   enrollees under the parliamentarian-based system taken by the BISP Board,
   removing existing beneficiaries from the program if they do not complete the
   scorecard targeting form or qualify under the new targeting system.
Pillar II: Establishing an institutional framework for safety nets program
implementation
3) BISP established as an autonomous statutory safety net authority to implement safety
   net programs through adoption of a legal ordinance with (i) clear financial and
   administrative autonomy; and (ii) distinction in roles of the Board, the Chairperson
   and the Secretary for the oversight and management of program implementation.
4) Administrative policy guidelines for effective BISP program implementation adopted
   by BISP, as approved by its Board.
5) Policy decision to remove overlapping mandates of BISP and PBM in delivering
   unconditional cash transfer programs taken by the Prime Minister.
6) Child Support Program (a conditional cash transfer [CCT] pilot) expanded, using a
   poverty score-card based targeting method.
Pillar III: Enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthening the fiduciary environment
7) Independent payment agency appointed, and policy guidelines and procedures for
   ensuring timely delivery of payments agreed.
Second Tranche Triggers
Pillar I: Improving the targeting efficiency of safety nets programs
1) Poverty scorecard data collection completed in selected pilot districts.
2) The BISP has (i) implemented the policy decision to remove beneficiaries of the
   parliamentarian based system who do not complete the scorecard form or qualify
   under the poverty-scorecard based system; (ii) adopted a transition policy including
   but not limited to grievance mechanisms, definition of cut-off score for eligibility,
   plan for national roll out and communications strategy.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

Policy areas were not revised during implementation.

1.6 Other significant changes
13.    While the policy triggers for both first and second tranche release were met, the
second tranche of the credit was cancelled, as macroeconomic developments were not
considered satisfactory for tranche release. Fiscal performance had been weaker than
expected, as large fiscal expansion derailed the IMF Stand-By Arrangement, and
devastating floods in mid-2010 further aggravated the situation. Instead, the funds tied to

                                             5
the tranche (US$ 50 million) were included in a scale-up and restructuring of the DPC
companion SSN TA project, resulting in a US$ 150 million Additional Financing
(P125793), which was approved by the World Bank Board in February 2012. The
project, renamed as SSN and converted into a SIL, covers the period 2012 – 2016 and
continues the development of the national targeting system and supports a further
strengthening of (i) program operations, (ii) management and governance, including
building up program evaluation capacity, (iii) expansion of coverage of the cash benefit
program (the BISP platform), and (iv) scaling up of the pilot CCT. In parallel, the
Government allocated US$2 billion to BISP for the 2011-2014 period.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
15.   The following factors contributed to the successful implementation of the
program: 
    1) There was (and continues to be) strong Government commitment to reforming
       the safety net as a first step in shaping a viable national social protection system.
       This is reflected in the prominent role that safety net reform had in the PRSC
       (May 2007) and the efforts that have gone into articulating an operational social
       protection strategy, including with donor assistance. It is also reflected in the
       unanimous approval by Parliament of the law establishing BISP in 2010, and
       endorsing the institution as the country’s national safety net authority under the
       Prime Minister’s office. Lastly, Government commitment is reflected in the
       steadily increasing budget allocations for the safety net program.
    2) The Government has pursued a program design that combines international best
       practice by putting in place separate agencies to conduct the enrollment process,
       determine program eligibility and pay benefits, all under the BISP umbrella. It
       has included extensive monitoring, evaluation and other control and
       accountability mechanisms as integral elements of the reform. Finally, it has
       adopted the poverty scorecard as an objective national targeting instrument to
       identify safety net beneficiaries.
    3) A strong governance structure with broad representation ensures a high degree
       of national consensus about the program. In particular, the governance structure
       includes a Board advised by a council headed by the President and the Prime
       Minister, and consisting of representatives of government agencies, non-
       governmental organizations and technical experts, all with relevant experience in
       the field.
    4) IDA support was based on prior analytical work that included (i) a report on
       social protection in 2007 which spelled out the main pillars of intervention 1 ,
       subsequently reflected in the SSN DPC and the related TA project, and now in the
       ACR project, (ii) a study on the design and implementation of effective safety

   nets (2008), (iii) a child support program rapid assessment (2009), and (iv) a
   poverty and social impact assessment (2009).
5) The pairing of the SSN DPC with the SSN TA project was an effective means
   of maintaining reform momentum in implementing policy initiatives and
   facilitating continuity of themes that were supported under the SSN DPC. The
   SSN TA project has a particular focus on objective targeting, monitoring and
   evaluation, governance, and innovations in payments and graduation paths for
   beneficiaries out of poverty. The Additional Financing provided for that project
   will allow continued support for the expansion of the basic cash transfer program
   to eligible poor families, and the introduction of CCT for BISP beneficiaries
   linked to primary education, as well as further strengthening of the program
   institutions.
6) As a national platform, BISP has been able to attract other donors’ participation
   (DFID, USAID and ADB) and harmonize their support with that of IDA around
   the common objective of putting into place a coherent national program.
7) The political, economic and implementation risks to the SSN DPC that were
   considered substantial at the time of appraisal did not materialize.
      The main political risks to project success were deemed to stem from the
       volatile country situation including security concerns that could impede the
       nationwide roll-out of the targeting process, as well as organizational and
       institutional risks pertaining to the newly created implementing agency (BISP)
       and potential drawbacks to the institutional changes supported by the project –
       in particular the introduction of a new beneficiary selection mechanism (the
       poverty scorecard) to replace earlier targeting mechanisms, and the
       harmonization and consolidation that establishing a national platform implied.
       So far, to a large extent these concerns have not materialized: there has been
       bipartisan consensus about the need for an effective safety net program; and
       the institutional reforms to the safety net have been accepted, to a significant
       extent as a result of the transparency that was introduced into BISP
       operations. However, continuing reluctance of Punjab to participate in the
       CCT program is a concern, signifying the continued relevance of the
       highlighted political risks.
      Economic risks arising from fluctuations in the international economy and
       their transmission through the fiscal system might have had an impact on the
       availability of budget resources. While the macro-economic situation stopped
       disbursement of the second tranche of the SSN DPC, the Government has so
       far maintained (and even increased) allocations to BISP, including committing
       resources into the medium term that would maintain the safety net at 1 percent
       of GDP. This is, moreover, consistent with the fiscal costs of safety net
       programs in other countries with comparable levels of income, as well as with
       other countries in the region.
      Implementation risks related to the introduction of the new targeting system
       (the poverty scorecard) and BISP administrative capacity. So far, these risks
       have not materialized. The poverty scorecard has been generally accepted as
       the template for the national targeting mechanism and plans on its roll-out are
       proceeding. The building up of BISP administrative capacity is still underway
                                        9
           with the support of the SSN project and other donors, and this support should
           mitigate significantly any risks in this area.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
16.     The program was monitored using several mechanisms. The administrative
records and the BISP MIS (which is continuously being improved), combined with the
NADRA id database and post-office payment reconciliation system provided timely
information on the distribution of beneficiaries and the status of payments. The status of
progress on various policy actions, such as the submission of the BISP law to the
parliament (and its subsequent approval) were certified by competent authorities
identified for each such prior action. Utilizing primarily DFID trust funds, the Bank team
also commissioned several third party assessments including spot checks to confirm the
accuracy of the collected poverty scorecard data. Third party process evaluations also
provided timely inputs to the partner organizations in the collection of data.  
17.     The M&E efforts continue, building on the work done to date. A comprehensive
results framework and monitoring and evaluation system is being put into place gradually
with the help of the SSN project and DFID. It will consist of a broad set of measures
designed to provide timely and accurate information on program implementation. The
program will have internal monitoring systems as well as external third party
mechanisms. Internal systems will include (i) an integrated management information
system that, when fully functional, will allow BISP to access information on applicants
and beneficiaries, generate payment lists, handle grievances and reconcile payments; and
allow BISP to share and cross-check information with partner agencies; (ii) a dedicated
monitoring and evaluation unit to support the monitoring of its programs; and (iii) a
computerized appeals and complaints system and social accountability mechanisms. To
enable BISP to undertake its monitoring role effectively, it is strengthening its capacity in
the head office to undertake field supervisory missions. Impact evaluations are planned
that will focus on the effects of cash transfers on the socio-economic conditions of
beneficiary families. They are structured in two phases – the first to focus on evaluating
the test phase of implementation processes (which is ongoing) and consists of a series of
operational audits; and the second to focus on the impact of the program on beneficiaries. 
18.     In their current state, the M&E systems are designed to monitor the effectiveness
of the various program processes and correct inefficiencies before they are rolled out on a
national scale. Once the operations are up to scale, the M&E systems should allow
monitoring of all aspects of the safety net program on a continuous basis and provide
transparency and accountability to system operations, as well as to undertake evaluations
of processes and the effects of the program on beneficiary households. The systems
should also allow the Bank and other international organizations to target future
assistance to critical features of the safety net.    At this time spot-checks, process
evaluations and beneficiary assessments are being undertaken on a need basis. The
baseline survey data collection to document the impact of the program on beneficiary
households has been undertaken in 2010/11. The first follow-up survey is currently being
fielded, with a second follow-up being scheduled for 2013.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

                                             10
19.    IDA will continue to provide assistance to the implementation of the safety net
program under the new SSN project until end-June 2016. This will also allow IDA to
continuously monitor progress in the program. 

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
20.    The PDO was and continues to be highly relevant. It is fully consistent with the
country’s objective to build up an effective safety net, and it supports current Country
Assistance Strategy. The actions supported under the DPC and the mechanisms being
developed and implemented under the companion SSN project are in turn are fully
consistent with the DPO objective. 

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
21.     The prior actions under the DPL served to put in place the legal and regulatory
framework for the organization and institutions necessary to implement the safety net
reform program. The implementation of the program and the establishment of the safety
net are being undertaken with the help of were and continue to be assisted by resources
from the SSN project as well as related assistance from DFID, the EU and the ADB. A
time horizon of mid-2016 has been set for having an operational safety net at the national
level in place, consisting of a poverty-targeted cash benefit, an education-focused CCT
and the related organizational structures in operational shape. This support has served to
ensure steady progress in developing the system, which might not have been the case in
the counterfactual: neither Pakistan nor the other donors individually have the necessary
capacity or experience or financial resources for such an undertaking. 
22.    In addition to all the prior actions, the outcome indicators specified for 2010 were
also met, as follows:  
   1) Increase in the share of beneficiaries enrolled in the BISP program using the new
      targeting mechanism from 0 to at least 30 percent of total beneficiaries.

       This outcome was met. According to the BISP database, as of December 31
       2010, the BISP had 1.11 million beneficiaries identified through the poverty
       scorecard survey. The number of first-phase beneficiaries remained at 2.2 million
       at that time. Thus 34 percent of total beneficiaries were identified through the
       new targeting mechanism. The universal application of the new targeting
       mechanism nationwide was achieved by the summer of 2011. In other words, the
       stated goal for 2010 was met as planned and the previous system was completed
       phased out by the summer of 2011.

   2) Increase in the share of total benefit expenditures reaching the poorest 40 percent
      of the population from 46 percent to at least 55 percent.
       This outcome was met, which is a direct consequence of the targeting efficiency
       of the new instrument. Furthermore, as a result of the nationwide application of
       the new targeting mechanism, by the summer of 2011 the share of benefits
       reaching the poorest 40 percent of the population is estimated to be 75 percent.

                                            11
   3) Increase in program applicants receiving a response on whether they qualify for
      the program within 3 months from scorecard form submission, from 0 to at least
      50 percent of total applicants.
       This outcome was met. BISP administrative data indicates that in 80 percent of
       the cases all eligible beneficiaries receive a letter from BISP within 3 months of
       scorecard data collection.
   4) Increase in benefit payments audited from 0 percent to at least 50 percent of total
      payments under the new payment system and improvement in reconciliation time
      lag from the present indefinite period to two months.
       This outcome was met. As of December 31 2010, the number of poverty
       scorecard beneficiaries receiving funds through smartcards was about 172,000
       (while 938,000 beneficiaries received funds through Pakistan Post). The
       reconciliation of the new (smartcard based) payment system was always within 2
       months.
   5) Increase in percentage of participating (poverty-scorecard) districts in which
      beneficiary lists are publicly available, from 0 to at least 30 percent.

       This outcome was met, with beneficiary lists being publicly available in all BISP
       field offices, on demand. These lists are often not posted however, due to display
       space constraints and the need to update benefit receipt information frequently
       (e.g., beneficiaries who do not have NADRA IDs do not receive payments until
       an ID is issued). The BISP website also provides poverty score and eligibility
       status information through the submission of CNIC or the survey form number. 
23.       The following describes the achievements made with regard to the three project
pillars: 
Pillar 1: Improving the targeting efficiency of safety net programs
1. The establishment of a national targeting system. A national targeting system has
been introduced. As a prior action, the Government approved the poverty scorecard as
the basis for a national poverty targeting system and introduced the necessary legal and
regulatory measures to that effect. The poverty scorecard was also piloted. Under the
SSN TA project, the instrument was applied nationally, resulting in the establishment of a
national data registry and the development of data sharing protocols for broader
application of the registry.
Pillar 2: Establishing an institutional framework for program implementation
2. Institutional arrangements for safety net administration developed. As a prior action,
BISP was established as an autonomous national safety net authority, and policy
guidelines for its operation were approved. In addition, the Government confirmed its
intention to expand a fledgling CCT program and place it under BISP auspices. Under
the SSN TA project, cutting edge technology in payment and grievance redressal
mechanisms were introduced, including testing of mobile phone and smart card based
payments as alternatives to postal delivery. Third party monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms including process, spot check and impact evaluation were launched to
support a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for active
management of targeting, payments, and grievance redressal. The process evaluation and
                                           12
spot checks are underway and the baseline survey for impact evaluation has been
completed. These elements are critical to understand program effectiveness, improve
accountability and assist with resource allocation. The SSN project will support the
expansion of the CCT program and development of a fully functional Management
Information System down to the local office level that will facilitate local information
sharing and grievance management and introduce the necessary information systems for
the CCT. The SSN will also support further monitoring of BISP activities, including an
additional round of impact evaluation measurement, as well as revise the scope of the
evaluation to include CCTs. Spot checks and process evaluations will be expanded over
time and scope as well. The revised scope of the evaluation will specifically look into the
enrollment, compliance monitoring and related grievance systems designed for the CCT.
The project will continue to support the costs of BISP‘s additional human resource
requirements for the duration of the SSN project.
Pillar 3: Enhancing Fiscal Sustainability and Strengthening the Fiduciary
Environment
3. Ensuring adequate and sustainable safety net spending consistent with the
macroeconomic framework. Maintaining a viable macroeconomic framework was an
underlying condition for the disbursement of DPC tranches. At the time of approval and
disbursement of the initial tranche of the DPC, IDA had evaluated and judged the
macroeconomic framework to be appropriate, and this view was endorsed by the IMF.
Subsequently, fiscal sustainability was threatened by shocks to the international economy,
and the second tranche disbursement was cancelled, even though the second tranche
conditions had already been met. The cancelled resources were subsequently included in
the ACR project that replaced the TA project. Since that time, and as a result of the fiscal
and monetary policies subsequently followed by the Government, and improved external
environment as the crisis receded, the macroeconomic situation has stabilized.
The cancellation of the second tranche did not end up affecting the process of building
the safety net, since the Government counterparts understood the reasoning behind the
cancellation and continued their strong investment in the program. In terms of ensuring
sufficient funds, the Government met the prior action of allocating the necessary funds to
pay benefits to 3.4 million households (the total number of eligible households at that
time) and still remain within the medium-term macroeconomic framework. Subsequent
increases in budget allocations allow coverage of some 4.5 million households. However,
the nationwide roll-out has indicated that there are some 7 million eligible families,
which exceeds affordable levels for the Government. In part, this may reflect the effects
of the financial and commodity price crisis. It is unlikely that the Government will be
able to cover all eligible households: so far it has allocated some US$2 billion to BISP for
the 2011-2014 period. This raises government spending on safety nets to 1 percent of
GDP, but remains inadequate to cover all poor households. It is expected that the SSN
project and other donors will provide the necessary resources to cover all 7 million
potentially eligible households.
4. Control and accountability of BISP payments improved. As a prior action, BISP
signed a partnership agreement with the postal service for the delivery of cash payments
(the BISP is now relying increasingly on smartcard system for the delivery of payments).
As noted above, an MIS system has been put into place under the SSN TA project (and
will be further developed under the SSN project) that will facilitate local information

                                            13
sharing with the public as well as handle grievances. The grievance management module
has already been tested and is ready for implementation. Nation-wide roll-out will be
undertaken with the help of the ACR project, as will an electronic payment system.
These elements play a critical role in advancing greater transparency and accountability.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly satisfactory

24.      The objective was to support the establishment of an appropriate policy
framework for an efficient safety net system, including the development of sound
institutions for the effective implementation of the Benazir Income Support Program
(BISP). This objective has been fully met. The DPC has helped to set the basis for a
safety net system consisting of both an unconditional and conditional cash benefit
overseen by an evolving national organization, applying a targeting mechanism based on
a survey-based proxy means test. The regulatory foundation for transparency and
accountability has been laid, including a management information system. At the same
time, the Government has allocated significant resources to the program, amounting to 1
percent of GDP. That said, it still remains to be seen if the Government will have the
resources to reach the targets set for the program reaching 7 million families, plus the
additional resources required as top up for the CCT. So far, this appears to be possible
only with continued donor, including IDA, support. On its own, the Government would
have to limit the number of beneficiaries to available resources. This would still include
a significant number of households, some 4.5 million families. The combination of
intensive sector work, development policy lending and technical assistance has proven to
be an approach that has moved the process forward efficiently and effectively towards the
institutional objectives that had been set at the beginning. 
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development:  
25.     While the cash benefit is a flat benefit at a relatively low level, its introduction
into poor households is likely to have positive benefits: it provides additional income for
consumption and, as recent studies of money management at low and very low levels of
income have shown, for saving and investment, and managing shocks, as well as
providing predictability in household income flows, which tends to facilitate planning
even among very poor households. The introduction of a CCT should have a positive
effect on school attendance overall, and especially by girls. While these effects are
unlikely to have a significant poverty reducing impact, they should nonetheless serve to
raise well-being among chronically poor households. To the extent that the BISP
program offers scope for flexibility – which it will do due to the extensive household
information registries that a full MIS will provide – it should also be an effective tool in
addressing temporary poverty resulting from environmental and external economic
shocks. 
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening:  
26.      It has already been noted above that the project has brought about significant
institutional changes in safety net processes – targeting, selection, beneficiary
administration – for both unconditional and conditional cash transfers. Since BISP also
                                            14
will serve as a national platform for safety nets, it can further facilitate the  harmonization
of programs at national as well as sub-national levels.  
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
None were undertaken.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High
27.     Political risks. At appraisal, the main political risks related to the effects on the
roll-out of the targeting process of a volatile security situation, as well as the potential
effects of a new government coming into power. The former risk has not materialized,
and roll-out is proceeding as planned. The latter risk remains a possibility even as the
program continues to have broad support at this time.  
28.     Financial risks. The Government has steadily increased budget allocations to
BISP with the intention of raising budget support for the safety net to 1 percent of GDP
over the medium term, possibly covering some 5 million households. However, a
number of factors need to be considered: (i) recent economic events (see below) point to
considerable economic and fiscal volatility; (ii) the nationwide roll-out of the poverty
scorecard has resulted in some 7 million eligible households, a number the Government
cannot afford to cover at least in the medium term, and donor support is being sought to
help finance broader coverage (the SSN project is currently financing some cash
benefits); (iii) the coverage can (and should) be adjusted to available fiscal resources. 
29.     Economic risks. External shocks and the effects of natural disasters impose risks
on the Pakistan economy. The economy was badly destabilized by the turmoil in the
international commodity and financial markets in 2007-2008. The devastating floods in
2010 and recent increases in international oil and food prices exacerbated the problem:
the country saw a slowdown in economic growth and an increasing budget deficit. Weak
revenue mobilization and significant power sector subsidies.. Overall, it is believed that
the challenge for the Government is to satisfy a wide range of competing demands and
pressing needs over the medium term. A new sustained pro-poor growth strategy is
under preparation.  
30.     Institutional risks. These relate to the development of an autonomous safety net
agency – BISP; and the introduction of a new targeting system. As a result of significant
technical assistance (still ongoing, as the CCT program is being introduced and the local
BISP office network expanded), the BISP central office is adequately staffed and has well
documented institutional arrangements and systems in place. The introduction of the
poverty scorecard has so far been successfully undertaken. Significant institutional risks
remain however, since the implementation of conditional cash transfers for education
necessitates the support of provincial governments. At this time, Punjab Government has
not made a commitment for collaboration with BISP to implement the CCT component
of the program. 

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

                                              15
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
31.     The operation was developed drawing on the knowledge and experience that had
been gathered through prior analytical work and collaboration with the Government on
developing a national social protection strategy. This ensured that the actions supported
by the operation were consistent with needs and the country’s long term development
goals. The operation was further strengthened through discussions that led up to the
introduction of a companion Technical Assistance project. Efforts to collaborate with
other key donors, such as DFID and the IMF also contributed to the timely preparation
and relevance of the operation.  
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly satisfactory

32.     The Bank supervision of the operation was continuous. Since all DPL prior
actions were completed before the operation was submitted to the Board, the
implementation of the program was supervised in the context of the companion SSN TA
project, and this will continue under the SSN project. These projects provided a results
framework with indicators to monitor progress on the various elements of the program, as
well as continuous technical support on key issues. Despite the cancellation of the
second-tranche due to an unfavorable macroeconomic assessment, the Bank was able to
come up with an arrangement (additional financing in the form of the SSN project) to
support the program. The fact that the same IDA team oversaw all three operations
provided an additional level of insight into issues, and continuity and credibility with
Government authorities.  

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
33.     The overall Bank performance is judged to be satisfactory on the basis of
satisfactory quality at entry and the highly satisfactory quality of supervision. 
34.     The operation supported relevant development objectives, introducing a flexible
safety net system. It used the combination of development policy lending and technical
assistance to build the necessary institutions. It drew on the support of other donors,
when needed. It provided continuity in the relationship with the Government and
technical authorities in maintaining the same team – a strong combination of
understanding of the political environment, operational knowledge, and technical know-
how. Finally, the monitoring and evaluation systems put in place allowed both the
Government and the Bank to continuously track and ensure progress towards target
outcomes. 

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

                                            16
Rating: Satisfactory
35.     With high levels of chronic poverty and weak safety net programs, the
Government recognized the need to reform the safety net. It had a long term vision for
social protection set out in its PRSP and Social Protection Strategy, and the establishment
of BISP represented the start of an ambitious reform agenda for the safety net. The
Government was quick to proceed with building the institution: the poverty scorecard
was adopted; and a targeting system with separate agencies for enrollment, eligibility and
payment was agreed on – both firsts in the South Asia region and in line with
international best practice. It also included monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to
inform policy. These elements provided structures of transparency and accountability to
the reform which made it broadly acceptable in the political environment. Moreover,
support for the program was early on expressed at the highest political level in the form
of the prime minister. In the process, only maintaining of a satisfactory macroeconomic
performance proved difficult, in part reflecting external forces (the financial and
commodity crises) and the 2010 floods. All triggers and prior actions were met,
however, which would otherwise call for a highly satisfactory rating.  

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
36.      The key implementation agencies were a Government Management Board to
oversee the implementation of the project and BISP itself. The former was able to
address policy issues as they arose, and BISP was able to introduce and absorb necessary
institutional changes and changes in its business processes in a timely way, and continues
to do so as it evolves.  

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
37.      The rating is “Satisfactory?. All triggers and prior actions were met, and a rating
of “highly satisfactory? would have been appropriate but was not considered because of
the cancellation of the second tranche (due to the Government’s inability to maintain a
stable macroeconomic environment). The shocks to the macroeconomic framework were
partly external and should not diminish the Government’s performance in taking the
initiative to develop the system, in seeking outside expert support, and in creating an
environment that has allowed significant progress on difficult institutional issues in a
volatile environment. Risks – political, institutional, and economic – were recognized
from the beginning of the progress, and the Government was able to address the risks
over which it had influence – the political and institutional ones – without endangering
the objective.

6. Lessons Learned

   1. A very strong Government commitment and political will has been instrumental
      in moving the safety net reform agenda forward in Pakistan. The Government has
                                            17
   taken politically difficult but necessary decisions, including phasing out
   parliamentarian-based beneficiary identification in favor of an objective, poverty-
   scorecard based beneficiary identification. The payments to parliamentarian-
   identified beneficiaries were discontinued as the new system rolled out
   nationwide. In its desire to achieve broad-based approval of the program, the
   Government also appointed non-political members to the BISP Board.
2. A National ID Database had already been established by NADRA, which the
   BISP utilized for defining families in a manner that is operationally relevant. The
   BISP was then able to build on this database by linking poverty scorecard data to
   it.
3. The BISP’s partnerships with three different organizations (PCO, PPAF and RSP)
   for the implementation of the poverty scorecard survey helped in building the
   credibility of the resulting database. The decision to undertake program
   implementation in two phases ensured better quality data, since third-party spot-
   checks and process-evaluations of the test-phase provided valuable lessons-learnt.
4. A relatively strong analytical basis (in particular the documentation of the weak
   performance of existing safety net programs and the development of a proxy-
   means-test for Pakistan) and prior collaboration between IDA and the
   Government is important in facilitating operations of this nature, in particular the
   relatively rapid introduction of reforms that involve difficult institution-building
   challenges.
5. Linking a DPL to technical assistance or investment operations with a strong
   emphasis on TA ensures that decisions underpinning a DPL do not remain “dead
   letters?. Instead they provide scope for developing and implementing a detailed
   roadmap for putting a reform program into place.
6. Maintaining an IDA team with necessary operational knowledge, technical
   expertise and political sensitivity throughout the process of preparation and
   implementation of a program facilitates things for IDA as well as the
   Government: the knowledge that the IDA team is able to build and the inter-
   actions that develop between the team and the Government counterparts facilitate
   the development of complex institutions.
7. Coordination with other donors can be particularly useful if well done and timely.
   In this case, DFID support was important in getting early traction on developing
   the poverty scorecard and providing rapid technical assistance, which was central
   to advancing the overall effort.
