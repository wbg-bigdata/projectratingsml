ProgramDevelopment       The program development objective i s the establishment o f an
Objective(s) and         appropriate policy framework for an efficient national safety net
Contributionto CAS       system.

                         The proposed DPC support falls under pillar 111 o f the CAS:
                         supporting the poor and vulnerable. The CAS recognizes that the
                         existing social assistance programs cover a very small fraction o fthe
                        poor, provide negligible benefits, and suffer from ineffective
                        targeting, weak administration, and a lack o f monitoring and
                        evaluation. To this end, the CAS notes that the Bank's support will
                         include support for safety nets that will (i)help the chronic poor
                        cope with poverty, and where possible; (ii)help the poor escape
                        poverty, e.g., via conditional cash transfers; and (iii)help families
                        and households cope with seasonal shocks.

                        The proposed DPC is fully consistent with the PRSP 2, which
                         identifies assisting the poor and the vulnerable as a key objective o f
                        Government's poverty reduction strategy. The proposed DPC i s also
                        consistent with the National Social Protection Strategy that supports
                        the development o f an effective and financially sustainable safety
                        net system to promote the re-distributivegoals o f society.

Risksand RiskMitigation The risks to the proposed Pakistan Safety Nets DPC are substantial.
                         Several risksattend the proposed Social Safety N e t DPC operation:

                             Political risks: Attaining a sharp reduction in the fiscal and
                             current account deficits will require political leadership and
                             cohesion. The scale and speed o f the required economic policy
                             response to the macroeconomic imbalances to improve
                             economic growth and poverty reduction prospects in the long
                             runcould intensify social tensions inpart o fthe population. The
                             sustainability o f the program could also be undermined by
                             possible differences among Pakistan's main political parties on
                             other issues, including constitutional reforms and the security


                                         V

 situation. The development o f a well- governed and targeted
safety net could help mitigate the economic and social impact o f
necessary structural reforms on the poorest segments o f the
population, promoting social peace. The BISP has been
established as an autonomous agency under presidential
Ordinance IX o f 2009. The Pakistan Constitution provides for a
 sunset clause for all Ordinances. Ordinance IX o f 2009 will
eventually require the Parliament's adoption to remain in force.
The chances o f the Ordinance being repealed are deemed slim.
Nevertheless, the association o f the safety net program with the
current government could lead to its disbanding under a new
and different government in the future. In addition, the
 involvement o f parliamentarians in the initial beneficiary
 selection could also pose a major risk to its governance, and
pose a reputational risk for the Bank.        The development o f
effective institutions and strong monitoring and evaluation
systems that can provide information on program performance
and gain the confidence o f the public could mitigate this risk.
The consensus across the political spectrum on the need for a
safety net program will also ensure continuity o f the program
(though the name or institutional home may change).

Economic risks:       On the external side, a renewed rise in
international energy and commodity prices, a reduction in
foreign remittances especially from the countries o f the Middle
East, and a further deterioration in the world economy and
international financial markets could weaken the export sector,
reduce household transfers,        lower capital inflows, limit
economic growth and reduce flexibility for policy reforms.
Owing to these reasons, the external imbalances may continue
to widen despite the short-term measures taken. On the internal
side, the inability o f Government to restore fiscal and external
balance as agreed could reduce business and consumer
confidence.    This could cause a fundamental shift in market
expectations and a loss o f confidence at home and abroad,
leading to a sudden reversal o f financial assets held in
Pakistan's stock and bond markets.         This could generate a
vicious cycle between weakening financial markets, stalling
economic activity, and a worsening fiscal position. The IMF
Stand-By Arrangement will mitigate these risks by committing
the authorities to fiscal and current account deficit targets.

Implementation risks:       A successful implementation o f the
reforms will be critical for an effective safety net system.
Among the risk factors           that   would    influence reform
implementation performance are (i)the low administrative
capacity o f BISP, which is a newly established organization; (ii)
continued enrollments to BISP under the old system; (iii)over-
ambitious and unrealistic roll out o f the safety net system, which
would have negative implications on the quality o f program

implementation- (iv) inadequate financing of the-program that


            vi

                         could result in insufficient coverage o f the poor; (v) delays in
                         funds release to safety net programs arising from the current
                         fiscal crunch and the need to reprioritize public spending; (vi)
                         fraud and corruption that could undermine the ability o f the
                         programto deliver benefits to the poor in circumstances of weak
                         internal controls; and (vii) transition to a new targeting system,
                         which may lead to dissatisfaction from beneficiaries o f the old
                         system who no longer qualify for the benefit. The mitigating
                         factors are (i)Bank supported technical assistance to build
                         capacity for the implementation of the reform program; (ii)roll
                         out o f the new targeting system with a strong M&E component
                         to demonstrate its effectiveness;      (iii)the use of a pilot
                         enrollment phase to fine tune and adjust program parameters
                         prior to a national roll out;         (iv) Government's      strong
                         commitment to establishing and implementing a modern safety
                         net system as evidenced by its adoption o f an objective national
                         targeting system; (v) the establishment o f separate agencies for
                         data collection, eligibility determination and benefit payments;

 INTERNATIONALDEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRAMDOCUMENT FOR A
       PROPOSEDSOCIAL SAFETY NETDEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT TO

                          THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OFPAKISTAN


                                    I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      This Program Document presents the proposed Social Safety Net Development Policy
Credit (SSN DPC) in the amount o f US$200 million to the Islamic Republic o f Pakistan to
 support the Government o f Pakistan's Safety Net Reform Program. The broad objective o f the
 safety net reform program i s to support inclusive growth through the development and
implementation o f a fiscally sustainable, efficiently targeted, and well-administered national
safety net system in Pakistan. The safety net system will provide the chronic and transient poor
with both basic income support and access to opportunities for graduating out o f poverty.
 Specifically, the credit will support the establishment o f an appropriate policy framework for an
efficient national safety net system, including the development o f sound institutions for the
effective implementation o f the Benazir Income Support Program, the Government's new
national safety net program. This objective is consistent with the goals o f the Pakistan's Second
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-11) and the National Social Protection Strategy of
Pakistan (NSPS).

2.      Pakistan's economy grew rapidly during 2003 to 2007 but its growth has been
compromised by both internal and external shocks. Average economic growth between 2003 and
2007 was 7.3 percent, but growth declined to 5.8 percent in 2007/08 and the growth target for
2008/09 i s only 2.5 percent. The fiscal deficit also increased in 2007/08, and is estimated to be at
7.4 percent o f GDP. The economic slowdown is in part due to external events including price
increases in international oil and food commodities, reduced demand for Pakistan' exports due to
a stagnant global economic environment and the reduction in the supply o f credit as a result o f the
deterioration in international credit markets.       During the same period, internal political
uncertainties also had a negative impact on growth by reducing investor confidence, which inturn
resulted in capital outflow, rising macroeconomic imbalances and reduced creditworthiness rating
by international agencies.

3.      While economic growth had reduced the incidence o f poverty in the country, recent
economic shocks have likely reversed this trend. Irrespective o f the methodology deployed,
economic growth reduced poverty between 2001/02 and 2005/06. The official poverty estimates
suggest that the national poverty rate fell by more than 11 percentage points in these four years.
However, despite these declines in poverty, nearly a quarter o f Pakistan's population remains
poor. Aside from low levels o f income, Pakistani households are also subject to income shocks-
both aggregate, e.g., the recent global food, fuel and financial crisis and natural disasters and
idiosyncratic, e.g., health and unemployment-can impose significant costs on households,
particularly for the poor. As a result, the poor often have to reduce their food intake (both quality
and quantity), increase labor supply, sometimes by withdrawing their children out o f school.'
Thus, income shocks can have negative impacts on welfare, particularly for the poor, and also
perpetuate inter-generational poverty.

4.      Existingpublicly financed social protectionprograms inPakistanare limited inadequacy,
targeting efficiency, and ability to respond to shocks. Until the introduction o f the Benazir

 Income Support Program, Pakistan's safety net system comprised o f two cash transfer programs,
 namely, Zakat and the Food Support Program administered by the Bait-ul Maal, covering
 approximately 3.2 million households in 2006/07.2 Both programs are weakly targeted to the
 poor: only 46 percent o f total expenditures o f Bait-ul-Mal (and 43 percent o f total Zakat
 expenditures) reached the poorest 40 percent o f the p~pulation.~Pakistan also implements social
securityprograms for the formal sector workers (largely non-poor), comprising about 10 percent
 o f the labor force, to mitigate risks o f income loss in old age, disability and survivorship. Social
 protection expenditures remained about 3-4 percent o f pro-poor PRSP spending between 2004/05
 and 2006/07, before sharply increasing to 13.4 percent in 2007/08. However, this recent increase
 in spending reflects an increase in social security expenditures and a significant increase in food
 subsidies, both likely targeted to the non-poor. Given that a large share o f total social protection
 expenditures comprise social security spending (75 percent in 2007/08); and the sizeable leakage
 o f safety net benefits to the non-poor, a significant share o f social protection spending (excluding
 food subsidies) inPakistan likely accrues to the non-poor.

 5.       Duringthe second half of 2008, the Government o f Pakistan launched the BISP as its
main national social safety net program. The short-term objective o f the program i s to cushion
the adverse impact o f food, fuel and financial crises on the poor, but its broader objective is to
meet the re-distributive goals o f the country by providing a minimum income support package to
the chronic poor and those who are highly vulnerable to future shocks. The program will provide
cash transfers o f Rs. 1000 [$12] per month to the eligible families and i s expected to cover 3.4
million families in 2008/2009.4 The 2008/09 budget allocation o f Rs. 34 billion doubles the
federal Government's social safety nets spending from 0.3 percent in 2003/04 to 0.6 percent o f
GDP.' The Government intends to increase the coverage o f the safety net program, with safety
net spending expected to reach approximately 0.9 percent o f GDP in 2009/10 and the BISP
serving as the national safety net platform for the country.

6.        The Social Safety Net Reform Program, which this proposed credit would support, is
based on three complementary pillars. The first pillar aims to improve targeting efficiency of the
safety net programs by establishing a national targeting system through the appointment o f
separate agencies for data collection and eligibility determination and adopting sound policy on
transitioning from the old to the new targeting system. The objective o f the second pillar is to
establish an institutional framework for program implementation through the development o f
legal, institutional, administrative institutions for the safety net system, including the
establishment o f an independent safety net agency to provide a uniform platform to implement
rationalized safety net programs, the development o f administrative policy guidelines for program
implementation; the rationalization o f overlapping safety net programs to improve fiscal and
administrative efficiency; and the development o f graduation and exit strategies to facilitate
households' movement out o f poverty. The objective o f the third pillar is to enhance fiscal
sustainability and strengthening the fiduciary environment through ensuring adequate budget
allocation for benefit payment and program administration consistent with the macro-economic
framework; and developing a reliable and transparent payment system, through the appointment

sector programs, rehabilitationcenters for children and vocational training centers.

  This level of coverage is approximately equal to about 25 percent of the population-around the 2005106 national
poverty headcountrate-according    to the most recent estimates.
  Inaddition, the provinceofPunjab is allocatingabout 0.2 percentof GDP to its income supporticashtransfer program
in 2008109. A higher level of spending does not translate into more coverage for the poor if safety nets programs are
poorly targeted.

o f a separate payment agency governed by strong fiduciary and social accountability controls on
benefit payments.

7.       The Government is committed to developing a modern social safety net system as the
first step in developing a viable social protection program for the country. The Government's
strong commitment to the safety net reform agenda is evident from the rapid introduction of the
BISP to address chronic poverty and to protect the poor from the adverse impacts o f the recent
global economic crisis. The Government's commitment is also evident in the formal adoption of
a poverty score card (or Proxy Means Test) as an objective instrument to identify safety net
beneficiaries-a   first in the South Asia regions6 Consistent with international best practice, and
again for the first time in South Asia, the Government is developing a targeting system with
separated agencies to conduct the enrollment process and determine program eligibility and is
starting to institute reforms to develop a transparent and timely payment system.              The
Government has also included monitoring and evaluation o f the program to inform policy as an
important element o f the reform agenda. More recently, the Government has shown commitment
to the new targeting system by requesting the main eligibility determination agency to no longer
accept forms under the old targeting system. The Prime Minister has also publicly requested
households to comply with the teams carrying out the door-to-door scorecard census for the new
targeting system.

8.       An effective social safety net program can promote human capital development and
contribute to inclusive economic growth in Pakistan. First, poor and vulnerable households will
receive some relief to cope with adverse income effects o f the recent crisis. The program will
also provide basic income support to the chronic poor, consistent with the Government's re-
distributive goals. Second, Pakistan will have an established safety net systemthat can be scaled-
up in response to future adverse economic or agro-climatic shocks. Third, in the long term the
program can promote access to graduation strategies such as micro-finance, skill development
programs, or basic health and education services that can help households accumulate human
capital and eventually contribute to economic growth. The institution o f an effective safety net
system also allows policy makers to undertake much needed structural reform measures (e.g.,
reduction o f subsidies) while protectingthe poor and promoting dynamic efficiency.

9.       Pakistan has undergone rapid political changes in the past year and a half. On November
3, 2007, President Pervez Musharraf, acting as the Chief o f Army, imposed a state o f emergency
and suspended the Constitution. At the end o f November 2007, Mr. Musharraf relinquished the
Army Chiefpost and took oath as a civilian President for another five-year term. Soonthereafter
the emergency was lifted, and Parliamentary elections announced. However, the elections had to
be postponed, as the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated at the end o f
December 2007.

10.     The Parliamentary elections held in February 2008 were widely considered to be free and
fair. The main opposition parties won the elections by a wide margin, and a new coalition
government comprising the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan's People's Party
(PPP), led by Mr. Asif Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (N), led by former Prime
Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif was formed, with Mr. Yousaf Raza Gillani as the Prime
Minister. In August 2008, Mr. Pervez Musharraf resigned as the President o f Pakistan. In
September 2008, Mr.Asif Zardari was elected President.

11.     Pakistan i s a frontline state in the war on terror, which has adversely impacted its
economic and security environment. The security situation inthe country remains unstable.

                         2.      Economic Developments through 2006/07

12.     Pakistan's development record was strong for part o f this decade. The economy grew at
7.3 percent on average per year during2003/04 through 2006/07, driven by solid performances in
the services and industrial sectors (see Figure 1). The manufacturing sector grew fast duringthe
earlier part o f the period, but slowed down considerably later in the period due to capacity and
infrastructural constraints.   At the same time, the services sector, catering primarily to the
domestic demand, grew steadily throughout the period. The factors that contributed to growth
included a benign external environment availability o f external financing, political and
macroeconomic stability. Key measures include renegotiation o f external debt with Paris Club
creditors, pre-payment o f extensive debt, greater reliance on concessional borrowing for new

13.     However, this growth was in part explained by heavy reliance on external financing and
on expansionary fiscal stance, while revenues and savings remained stagnant. A surge o f capital
inflows from abroad allowed the government to finance rising fiscal deficits at a low cost. The
consolidated fiscal deficit increased from 2.3 percent in 2003/04 to 4.3 percent o f GDP in
2006/07, while domestic tax collection remained weak.

14.     The effect o f expansionary fiscal policy was compounded by loose monetary policy,
which together led to a sharp increase in the domestic demand from 2002/03 onwards. While
until2003/04, economic growth had been sustained by external demand, it became consumption-
driven thereafter until 2006/07 (Figure 2). Strong growth in money supply contributed to the
acceleration o f inflation from 3.5 percent in 2001/02 to 7.8 percent in 2006/07. Pakistan's savers

                                                    4

continued to receive low returns, below the rate o f inflation. L o w returns on bank deposits
discouraged private savings and fuelled asset-price bubbles as households sought higher returns
by buyingshares andproperty.

                            3.       EconomicDevelopmentsin2007/08

16.     In 2007108, the sharp rise in international oil and food (specifically wheat) prices, in
combination with policy inaction and internal political turmoil, led to rapidly expanding
macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan.            Both fiscal and current account balances widened
significantly. Inthe absence o f adequate remedialpolicy measures to address the imbalances-in
particular not passing on the international price increases to domestic consumers-the          economy
begun to adjust through a slowdown in growth and rising inflation.


17.     Spending overruns led to a sharp increase in the 2007108 fiscal deficit to 7.4 percent of
GDP, compared to the budget target o f 4.0 percent of GDP (see Table 1). Expenditures exceeded
the budget target by about 2.9 percent o f GDP, while revenues fell short of the target by about 0.6
percent of GDP.

18.    About 80 percent o f the fiscal deficit increase was driven by international oil and
commodity price increases. The sharp increase in the budget deficit was mostly caused by the
overrun of 2.7 percent o f GDP in budgetary subsidies (from the budget target o f 1.1 percent o f
GDP to 3.8 percent of GDP) owing to the rise in international commodity and oil prices (see
Table 2).7 From 2006107 to 2007/08, the domestic price o f Pakistani oil imports increased by
about 60 percent on average. Yet, in an attempt to protect households and businesses from
domestic price adjustments, Government kept domestic petroleum prices unchanged until March
2008. This resulted in overruns o f 1.4 percent o f GDP inthe petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL)

account deficit in 2007/08. Pakistan's current account deficit reached 8.4 percent o f GDP in
2007/08, compared to 4.8 percent in 2006/07. Over 50 percent o f this increase (1.9 percent o f
GDP) was on account o f a 38 percent increase in the import price o f petroleum per barrel. The
trade deficit increased by about 58 percent year-on-year to 9.1 percent o f GDP, mainly owing to
sharp increases in the import bill. The import bill rose by about 31 percent, far higher than the
targeted growth o f 6.5-7.0 percent for 2007/08. The oil import billjumped by about 56 percent,
and the food import bill rose by about 46 percent on account o f a sharp increase in the wheat
import bill. Pakistan's gross national saving declined from 18.1 percent o f GDP in 2006/07 to
13.2 percent o f GDP in 2007/08. Gross capital formation declined more moderately, dropping
from 22.9 percent o f GDP to 21.6 percent o f GDP.

21.      Pakistan's foreign reserves declined rapidly due to the large current account deficit, a
reduction in net capital inflows, and inadequate adjustment o f the exchange rate. While FDI
flows remainedrelatively robust at US$5.1 billion (albeit lower than in 2006/07) and remittances
increased to US$6.5 billion, portfolio investments declined as investor confidence plummeted.
Also, donor inflows significantly dropped as the macroeconomic framework went o f f track, and
the privatization process came to a halt in 2007/08. Furthermore, given the large spread on
Pakistan sovereign bonds, borrowing from international capital markets was not an option. As a
result, foreign reserves were drawn down to pay for imports. By endJune 2008, the State Bank
o f Pakistan (SBP) foreign exchange reserves dropped to US$8.6 billion, a fall o f about US$5.7
billion since October 2007. An additional US$950 million was drawn from the now-depleted
sinkingfund. The decline in international liquidity is reflected inthe sharp decrease o f the ratio
o f SBP reserves to broad money duringthe second half o f 2007/08 (see Figure 3).

discount rate by a total o f 200 bp by end-June 2008, but real interest rates remained negative by a
large margin.

25.      In response to the widening imbalances and supply side shocks, real GDP growth
declined from 6.8 percent in 2006/07 to 5.8 percent in 2007108. In agriculture, floods and pest

attacks depressed rice and cotton production, while industrial production and services were
constrained by acute power and gas shortages.

26.      Pakistan's risk rating worsened as the economic situation deteriorated. Both Standard &
Poor's and Moody's downgraded Pakistan's sovereign debt ratings in May 2008 (from B+ to B
and from B1 to B2, respectively) owing to the sharp erosion in the fiscal position and the
inadequate policy response to the worsening macroeconomic situation.

                                  4.      Towards Stabilization

27.      Recognizing the need to correct the macroeconomic imbalances, Government embarked
on a concerted effort to stabilize the economy starting with the 2008/09 budget. The budget,
among other things, envisaged sizeable fiscal consolidation through power and fuel subsidy cuts
and increased revenue effort. However, by November 2008 it was apparent that the budget
measures were inadequate to containthe economic slide, aggravated by the global financial crisis,
and to restore the investor confidence. The foreign exchange reserves o f SBP had dropped to
US$3.3 billion (about three weeks o f imports) by mid-October 2008, the nominal exchange rate
had depreciated to Rs/US$84, Government had borrowed additional Rs. 356 billion from SBP
duringJuly-November 2008, the average CPI had risen to about 25 percent and core inflation to
18.9 percent at end-November 2008, and the EMBI Global Bond spread o f Pakistani sovereign
bonds had climbed above 2,000 bp. In response to these developments, Moody's had further
downgraded its ratings outlook for Pakistan sovereign bonds from stable to negative in September
2008 and the rating from B 2 to B3 in October 2008.             Similarly, Standard & Poor's had
downgraded Pakistan's rating further from B to CCC+ in early October 2008 and to CCC in early
November 2008.

28.      To avoid a balance o f payments crisis and default on foreign debt payments, the
authorities developed a home-grown stabilization program, which was supported by the IMF
through a 23-month SBA in November 2008.                  The program includes a medium-term
macroeconomic framework, which envisages fiscal and monetary tightening to bring down
inflation and reduce the external current account deficit to sustainable levels.       The 2008/09
program framework supported by SBA builds on the 2008/09 budget, modified to account for
higher inflation projections and greater exchange rate adjustment than envisaged at the time o f the
budget. The framework was revised during the first program review in February 2009 to take
into account the impact of significantly deteriorated global economy, resulting lower exports,
foreign inflows and growth prospects in the short and medium term, as well as the change in the
terms o f trade through lower international oil and food prices. Table 3 summarizes the revised
framework, and compares it with the initial November 2008/09 program framework for 2008/09.

29.      The revised framework is built around the following economic parameters for 2008/09:

            Real GDP growth of 2.5percent: the target was lowered from 3.4 percent owing to
            sharper than anticipated economic slowdown;

            Thefiscal deficit (excluding grants) of 4.3 percent of GDP: the initial fiscal deficit
            target remained unchanged in nominal Rupee terms, but owing to the moderated GDP
            growth projection, the target as a share o f GDP increased from 4.2 to 4.3 percent;

            The current account deficit of 5.9percent of GDP: the initial target o f 6.5 percent o f
            GDP was revised downwards due to a larger than anticipated decline in imports; and

                  Annual average consumerprice inflation at 20percent: the annual inflationtarget was
                  adjusted downwards from 23 percent, as a resultof falling food and energy prices and
                  lower economic activity.

30.         The fiscal deficit reduction is to be achieved by a combination of expenditure cuts and
revenue increases, with the burden of adjustment falling primarily on expenditures, Overall
revenues (excluding grants) are to be increased from 14.3 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 15.2

                                                                         9

percent o f GDP in 2008/09 through a rise in tax revenues. Further, the reduction in the fiscal
deficit relies on a consolidation o f overall expenditures by about 2.5 percent o f GDP to 19.3
percent o f GDP. About half o f the reduction is to come from current spending-primarily          from
cuts in fuel and power subsidies-and          the other half from rationalization in development
spending, while ensuring productive social and infrastructure spending is protected.

31.      On the external side, the 2008/09 revised program framework projects a rapid decline in
import growth (14.5 percent contraction) due to decreases in international commodity and oil
prices and the slowdown in economic activity. The decline in imports i s expected to outweigh
the projected 5.5 percent contraction in exports, leading to a strong improvement in the trade
balance. Both gross national savings and gross capital formation are predicted to further decline,
with capital formation decreasing withthe economic downturn.

32.      The 2008/09 program assumes that Government's net borrowing from SBP will be zero
on a quarterly basis from November 1, 2008 onwards, and Government will rely increasingly on
non-bank borrowing and external financing. This, in addition to a sharp decline in aggregate
demand duringthe second half o f 2008/09, is expected to bringdown average annual inflation to
the program target.

33.      At the first quarterly review of SBA in February 2009, the stabilization program
remained on track.8 The rapid decline in international commodity and oil prices since August
2008 has reduced the risks, facilitated improvement in the external position and the achievement
o f targets. Table 4 highlightsthe developments in select recent economic indicators by month
during2008/09.

34.      Fiscal consolidation was on track at end December 2008 (see Table 5). The end March
2009 actual fiscal data will be available only in early May 2009. The estimated half a year fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) was 1.9 percent o f GDP against the target o f 2.0 percent o f GDP set in
November 2008. Savings on non-essential development spending and a reduction in power and
fuel subsidies, facilitated by rapidly declining international oil prices, helpedthe fiscal deficit stay
within the target, despite o fweak revenue performance.




8The second review of SBA will be carried out inearly May 2009.

35.              DuringJuly-December 2008, recurrent and development expenditures were below their
targets by 5 and 18 percent, respectively. On the recurrent side, the bulk o f savings accrued from
federal subsidies. Expenditure on federal subsidies (at 0.9 percent o f GDP) was only 36 percent
o f the budgeted amount, as expenditure on fuel and food subsidies fell substantially short o f the
(pro-rated) budget targets. The authorities started passing on the international fuel price increases
to consumers in March 2008, with the aim to eliminate fuel subsidies by end December 2008.
The parity with international fuel prices was reached already in mid-October 2008, helped by
rapidly declining international oil prices. The authorities are also committed to eliminate the
power sector subsidies by end June 2009. To achieve that, they increased electricity tariffs on
average by 9 percent in February 2008 and 18 percent in November 2008. In parallel, stringent
expenditure controls measures adopted by the federal government and the impact of political
transition inthe provinces contributedto smaller than targeted development spending.

36.              However, inter-corporate debt in the energy sector increased sharply from Rs. 51 billion
in mid-October 2008 to about Rs. 147 billion at end January 2009. While there are several
reasons for the debt, including delayed payments to energy companies, this highlights the
continued need for fiscal adjustment.

37.       Revenue collection has been falling short o f targets. During July-December 2008,
national revenue collection reached Rs. 834 billion, which was 0.3 percent o f GDP below the
initial program target o f 6.5 percent o f GDP. The relatively weak performance was due to lower
tax collection o f the Federal Board o f Revenue (FBR), as the sharp economic slowdown reduced
the buoyancy o f Pakistan's two main tax bases o f manufacturing and imports. In response, the
FBRrevenue target was revised downwards from Rs. 1,360 billionto Rs 1,300 billion duringthe
February 2009 program review. In addition, Government decided to compensate the shortfall in
FBRrevenues through higher petroleumdevelopment levy (PDL) collection. The PDL collection
reached Rs. 29 billion during the first half o f 2008/09, exceeding by over 100 percent the fiscal
year target o f Rs. 14 billion. Instead o f passing on the international price decreases to consumers,
Government has maintained a premium above the import parity levels to cover part o f the tax
revenue shortfall. However, since December 2008 tax revenues have continued markedly
underperforming, and even the downward revised tax revenue target i s unlikely to be met. From
July 2008 to March 2009, FBR tax revenues reached Rs. 810 billion, an increase o f only 19
percent year-on-year compared to the downward revised program target o f 29 percent.

38.       The external imbalances have been narrowing on the back o f a lower oil import bill (see
Table 4). The monthly current account deficit dropped sharply from the peak o f 1.3 percent of
GDP in October 2008 to 0.1 percent o f GDP in March 2009, bringingthe July 2008-March 2009

decline further as Pakistanreapsthe benefits from lower internationaloil prices.

 financing needs mainly
through non-bank borrowing. The T-bill market has responded well to changes in the policy
 discount rate. The policy discount rate was increasedby 200 bp to 15 percent in mid-November
 2008, but reduced by 100 bp at end-April 2009. The increase in T-bill placements since mid-
November 2008 has enabled Governmentto reduce the level of net borrowingfrom SBP by end
 December2008 to belowthe ceiling stipulated.

 41.     Improved aggregated demand management and lower commodity and oil prices have
 begun to reduce inflation. The monthly year-on-year CPI declined to 19.1 percent in March
 2009, and food inflationto 19.7 percent (see Figure 7). However, core inflation (nonfood, non-
 energy CPI) remainedhigh, andreached 18.5 percent.

43.     Despite     favorable
trends in the agricultural sector, domestic production and sales declined during the first half o f
2008/09 compared to the previous year, due to power shortages, increased input costs, lower
domestic demand, decreased private sector credit growth, and worsened prospects for exports. In
particular, the growth o f the large-scale manufacturing sector during the first seven months o f
2008/09 turned negative 5.4 percent. Owing to these trends, the real GDP growth target for
2008/09 has been reduced to 2.5 percent.

                                 5.        Medium-TermOutlook

44.     Given global economic crisis, the medium-term outlook presents significant downside
risks. The external environment is expected to deteriorate further, with global growth turning
negative and a gradual recovery starting only 2010.

45.     Pakistan's real GDP growth is projected to remain low in 2008/09 and 2009/10, and
increase gradually from 2.5 percent in 2008/09 to 6.5 percent by 2012/13, although longer-term
projections are particularly uncertain inview o f the volatile global economic environment. Aided
by increasing public investment-among        other things in infrastructure, power, and transport-
gross capital formation is projected to rise and contribute to growth recovery and facilitate private
sector activity. In parallel, gradually increasing private sector credit growth is projected to help
economic activity. Agriculture is showing good growth prospects, while manufacturing and
services are expected to recover only gradually as the domestic aggregate demand picks up and
the availability o f power improves as a result o f investments in power generation. With the
global recovery, exports are also projected to improve gradually and reduce Pakistan's external
vulnerability over time. Further analysis o f Pakistan's growth prospects and possible sources of
growth i s currently being carriedout by the Bank.

46.     Over the medium term, Government's revised macroeconomic framework targets
projects a decline in the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) from 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2008/09 to
2.3 percent o f GDP in 2012/13. The cornerstone o f this outlook is a significant increase in FBR
tax revenues which are projected to rise by 3.1 percentage points o f GDP to 12.7 percent o f GDP
by 2012/13. Excluding grants, overall revenues are to rise from 14.3 percent o f GDP in 2007/08
to 17.3 percent o f GDP in 2012/13.




                                                      14

47.       To meet the ambitious revenue targets, the authorities plan to implement bold and
comprehensive tax policy and administration reforms.         This will include quick and decisive
implementation o f value-added taxation (VAT) o f goods and services, elimination o f tax
exemptions and zero-ratings, and revamping o f the tax administration. The work on the new
VAT law has started, with the aim to get it ready for implementation inthe 2010/11 budget. This
will be the key measure to expand the tax base and revenues, since currently services, which
account for about 60 percent o f GDP, currently remain outside the tax net. Inthe meantime, as
part o f the 2009/10 budget, Government expects to adopt significant legal changes to the current
General Sales Tax (GST), moving it closer to VAT by minimizing exemptions and zero-ratings,
and thereby broadening tax base and revenues. In parallel, steps are taken to strengthen tax
enforcement and audits o f taxpayers. This includes measures to control stop filers, short filers,
and detect under-reporting via cross-checking. Significant untapped revenue potential-such         as
property and property transfer taxes, motor vehicle tax, agricultural income tax-remains       also at
the provincial level, which would warrant attention.

48.       Owing to this sizeable revenue effort, total expenditures are projected to slowly climb
back to about 20 percent o f GDP in 2012/13. In line with current projections o f low oil and
commodity prices, and following the elimination o f power and fuel subsidies and maturing o f the
remainder o f high interest-yielding Defense Savings Certificates, current expenditures will
decline as a share of GDP and make space for a steady increase in development spending from
3.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 5.6 percent of GDP in2012/13.

49.       Lowering inflation remains a challenge. Headline inflation i s projected to decrease from
20 percent in 2008/09 to 5.5 percent in 2012/13. The economic downturn is, however, likely to
put stress on banks' financial positions and close monitoring will be warranted.

50.       The external current account deficit is projected to decline to about 4.2 percent o f GDP
by 2012/13. Foreign exchange reserves are expected to build-up from US$9.1 billion by end-
June 2009 to about US$11.9 billion by end-June 2012/13. The sharp decline in international
commodity prices, reduced private sector credit growth, and the economic recession are expected
to curtail import growth in 2008/09 and 2009/10. Exports are projected to start recovering from
2009/10 onwards with gradual global recovery and imports from 2010/11 onwards, but the
growth o f both remains moderate during the medium term. Remittances are projected to grow
over the medium term. FDI, after a drop in 2008/09, is projected to start gradually recovering in
2009/10 with the re-launch o f the privatization process, and portfolio flows are predicted to turn
positive only from 2010/11 onwards.

5 1.      Inthe medium term, increased productivity and export competitiveness are necessary to
generate growth and reduce external vulnerability. To this aim, structural reforms to strengthen
the investment climate and competitive environment are required. These will include measures to
ease firm entry and exit, reduce barriers to competition and trade, and enhance the labor market
flexibility. Inaddition, efforts to improve the financial sustainability and efficiency o f the power
sector will be essential to attract investment innew power generation.

52.      Protecting the poor and vulnerable is essential during the stabilization process.
Recognizing this, the federal Government and the Punjab province increased spending on social
safety nets by total o f 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2008/09. Further spending increases are projected in
2009/10. The federal Government launched the Benazir Income Support Program in the fall
2008, with the objective to provide cash grants to the poorest families in Pakistan. Inparallel, the
province o f Punjab established its own income support program to protect the poor and
vulnerable o f Punjab.

                                                  15

53.      In conclusion, despite a highly uncertain external environment, Pakistan is now in a
better position to attain the projected medium-term recovery path. Over the last few months, the
stabilization efforts together with a decline in international commodity prices have succeeded in
reducing external imbalances, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, narrowing fiscal overruns
and lowering inflation. However, the sharp deterioration in the global economic and financial
outlook poses significant risks to exports, remittances and external financing, notwithstanding the
fiscal stimulus packages prepared in a number o f countries. Even though projections in these
areas as well as forecasts about the speed o f real economy recovery were significantly moderated
duringthe first program review in February 2009, they may still turn out to be optimistic. This
highlightsthe need for a rigorous implementationof reforms, while protecting core development
spending, in particular social spending, to ease the adjustment for the poor and vulnerable people.
Duringthe Pakistan donor conference held inTokyo inApril 2009, donors pledged about US$5.2
billion in additional financing, but actual disbursements are likely to be lower. There i s a risk that
the sharper than anticipated economic downturn will lead to social tension as business activity
slows down and firms shed labor. Also, the risks to the domestic financial sector may increase.
To mitigate this latter risk, SBP has adopted a problem bank management and contingency plan
for dealing with problem banks, and measures to improve banking resolution and banking
supervision are being implemented.

54.      The medium-term revenue projections are ambitious and there is a risk that they will not
be met. However, the authorities want to retain the stretch targets in order to maintain the
pressure for reform. Recognizing the need to substantially raise the tax to GDP ratio, they are
keento seize the opportunity for bold tax reforms, and are committed to take compensatory action
incase revenues fall short o f targets. This will include cutting o f expenditures, but inan orderly
manner ensuring productive social and infrastructure spending is protected.

55.      Stringent implementation o f the economic program will be critical to success, and timely
responses o f fiscal and monetary authorities to emerging risks will be essential to ensure it
remains on track.      In the current economic environment, any medium-term projections are
uncertain and regular adjustments are necessary in response to changed circumstances. The
quarterly monitoring o f the IMF and the Bank's proposed programmatic operation will mitigate
these risks through continued policy dialogue with the authorities on a proper adjustment path.

                                        6.       Governance

56.      Pakistan exhibits problems in many dimensions o f governance. The delivery o f public
services is adversely affected by leakages, difficulties with bureaucratic structure and quality, and
opaque decision-making. Government recognizes that corruption constitutes a threat to Pakistan's
development agenda, undermining revenue collection and service delivery, and eroding
Government's credibility. Public pressure to tackle corruption under the democratic government
i s increasing.

57.      The authorities have made progress in public sector accounting and auditing reforms, and
in improving regulatory structure for public procurement. The accounting and audit functions
have been separated and the Office o f the Controller General o f Accounts established.
Government has made significant progress in transitioning to the international public sector
accounting standards using a computerized integrated financial management information system.
The timeliness and reliability o f financial reports o f Government have improved. A new Chart o f
Accounts for budgeting, accounting, and financial reporting, which is consistent with
international standards, has been rolled out across federal, provincial, and district governments.
The overall quality and reliability o f Government financial statements has also improved, and

                                                  16

unidentified expenditures reduced. There i s a significant reduction in "pay-bill" processing time
as computerization has minimized manual processing and human discretion, and financial reports
are disclosed. Expenditure irregularity has been reduced with monthly budget execution reports
generated electronically and made available to spending agencies for budget monitoring and with
pre-audit activities. Internal management practices, while still weak and a source o f corruption,
are being strengthened. Some progress has also been made in public procurement. In 2003, the
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority was set up to provide efficiency and transparency in
public procurement. In 2004, public procurement rules consistent with good practice were
prepared and notified. However, several challenges remain to be addressed, including an effective
appeals process and monitoring and evaluation system (see paragraphs 124 and 167-174). Since
enhancing accountability, transparency, and reducing opportunities for corruption are core
elements o f improved governance, these and other related actions will need to be strengthened
and deepened as part o f ongoing reforms.

58.      Government has strengthened key regulatory institutions, deregulated, and proceeded
with privatization to reduce opportunities for corruption. In 2007, an Anti-Money Laundering
bill was promulgated that allows the authorities to seize property derived from or invested in
money-laundering and impose penalties, and a National Commission for Government Reform
presented in 2008 a proposal for civil service reform and restructuring o f government processes.

                          7.       Status of IMFActivitiesinPakistan

59.      The IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded in
December 2004, and the Government o f Pakistan did not request a successor IMF program.
Between 2005 and October 2008 Pakistan was on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule.
The Article IV consultations concluded in December 2007 highlighted the widening current
account deficit as the economy's main vulnerability. The IMF carried out its bi-annual Staff Visit
in May 2008, and concluded that a major fiscal adjustment effort accompanied by a substantial
tightening o f monetary policy (including the elimination o f central bank financing o f government)
and further exchange rate depreciation would be needed to contain inflation while reducing the
large current account deficit. At the request o f the Pakistani authorities, an IMFtechnical mission
visited Islamabad during September 2008 to provide technical input to quantifying the economic
stabilization package being developed by the authorities and preparing an updated medium-term
macroeconomic fi-amework.

60.      In light o f the rapidly deteriorating balance o f payments position and substantial
financing needs, the authorities entered into an IMF-supported 23-month SBA in late November
2008. The program supports the macroeconomic stabilization program in 2008/09 and 2009/10 to
reduce inflation and the external current account deficit to more sustainable levels. The pace o f
adjustment aims to balance the need to address the macroeconomic imbalances with protecting
social stability. The medium-term macroeconomic framework presented earlier is supported by
the SBA. The first review o f SBA was carried out in February 2009, and the program is on track.

34.5 percent o f the population to 22.3 percent o f the population, equivalent to over 17 million
people moving out o f poverty. Even the more conservative estimate suggests that the national
poverty rate fell by close to six percentage points."                   The effect o f growth on poverty reduction
between 2001/02 and 2004/05 was dampened by increasing inequality over the same period.
Though lower than in many regions o f the world, the Gini coefficient increased from 0.283 to
0.303 over the period 2000-05.

62.       Aside from low levels o f income, Pakistani households remain vulnerable to income
shocks, both economic crisis such as the recent global food, fuel and financial crises; and natural
disasters such as earthquakes and droughts, and from idiosyncratic shocks such as health and,
unemployment. These shocks have the potential to reverse recent gains in poverty reduction. A
recent simulation o f the welfare impact o f the fuel price found that poverty rates may have
increased between 2.3 and 3.6 percent, depending on the growth assumption used."                                   Earlier
studies have also documented the negative impact o f shocks on household welfare.                                      The
clustering o f a large share o f the population around the poverty line means that small changes in
income can translate into large changes in poverty. For example, between 1998-99 and 2001-02,
the drought in Sindh caused a sizable movement o f the population in the middle part o f the
consumption distribution to its lower end. The Pakistan social protection report12 also provides
some insights into the specific shocks that affect households and household risk-coping strategies.


lo Poverty estimates depend on how the poverty lines are updated. The official poverty rates are estimated based on
poverty lines updated with CPI-based inflation rates. According to the official estimates, the overall poverty declined
by more than 12 percentage points, from 34.5 to 22.3 percent between 2001/02 and 2005/06. Poverty in urban areas
declined from 22.7 to 13.1 percent and in rural areas from 39.3 to 27 percent. If a survey based price index (SBPI) is
used to update the poverty line since 2001-02, the overall poverty declined by a little less than 6 percentage points,
from 34.5 to 28.8 percent over the same period. Both CPI and SBPI have pros and cons. CPI is constructedwith price
data from major cities only; thereby it might not properly reflect inflation in rural areas where poverty is the greatest.
By contrast, the survey-based price index collect price data in both urban and rural areas, but, it suffers from the limited
coverage of items-covering only food and transport prices, which may be unrepresentative of the items households
purchase.
'' Vishwanath et. a1(2009).
   World Bank (2007), ibid. These results presented in the report are from a representative sample of safety net
recipients/applicants collected in 2005, and are therefore not nationally representative. The sample is predominantly
poor. Over half of the sampled households (54 percent) are ultra poor (those with consumption below the food poverty
line), about a quarter (23 percent) are poor (between the food and national poverty lines), while the remaining were
non-poor.

                                                             18

The report found that nearly two-thirds o f safety net applicants and recipients (about 80 percent
of whom were poor) surveyed suffered from one or more major shocks in three years before the
survey, comprising both idiosyncratic (health, unemployment) and aggregate shocks (economic
and natural disasters). While income shocks imposed major costs on all affected households, the
poor were the hardest hit (cost o f the shock as a share o f annual household consumption for the
poor was twice that for non-poor households). Nearly 33 percent o f these households lowered
their food intake, 10 percent put a child to work, and 8 percent pulled a child out o f school in
response to the shock. While these households also received private assistance, its concentration
in time and geographic space made it difficult to use for smoothing consumption against
aggregate shocks. These results are consistent with findings on risk-coping strategies from other
countries inthe region, and reveal that income shocks can both impoverish households at the time
o f the shock and, by adversely impactinghuman development, can also perpetuate poverty across
generations.

63.      The release o f the 2007/08 PSLM, expected in mid 2009, will provide an opportunity to
establish the latest poverty trends.

                  C.       SAFETY NETS:OVERVIEW AND CHALLENGES

Overviewof SocialProtectioninPakistan

64.      Pakistan's social protection system comprises safety nets, social security and
employment promotion and protection. The country's safety net system includes three main
federal cash transfer programs: Zakat, the Food Support Program (FSP) and the recently
established (2008) Benazir Income Support program (BISP).           Other small, scattered programs
provide social welfare and care services to persons with disabilities, child laborers, and others.
Although Pakistan has earlier implemented public workdworkfare programs, no large workfare
program i s currently in place. To address aggregate economic (price) shocks, till recently,
Pakistan implemented a wheat subsidy program. Although no permanent program i s in place to
help individuals cope with aggregate disasters, Pakistan has used a combination o f cash transfers,
housing and social care service programs to help those affected, for example, by the 2005
earthquake. The country also implements several employment promotion programs, e.g., micro
credit programs and skills and training. Employment protection institutions (e.g., labor laws)
cover workers in the formal sector. Pakistan's social security system offers pension benefits to
formal sector workers (old age, survivor and disability). Public sector workers are provided civil
service pensions, while private sector workers have access to pensions from the Employees Old
Age Benefits (EOBI) as well as also provincially-based pension and non-pension programs such
as the Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) and the Employees' Social Security Institutions (ESSI).

65.      Duringthe last four years, the overall social protection expenditures have fluctuated as a
share of total PRSP/pro-poor expenditures.          Specifically, expenditures pertaining to social
protection (food subsidies, Bait-ul-Mal, Tawana school meals, social security, and low-cost
housing) remained between 3-4 percent o f total PRSP spending between 2004/05 till 2006/07 but
then sharply increasedto 13.4 percent o ftotal PRSP spending in2007/08 (Table 6). This increase
in social protection expenditures is largely due to the increased spending on food subsidies and
social security, both o f which are likely not well targeted to the poor. The share o f food subsidies
inPRSP "pro-poor" social protection(SP) spending has increasedfrom 51percent in2004/05

to 68.4 percent in 2007/08. In comparison, the expenditures on the Food Support Program
steadily decreased from 25.8 percent of SP-PRSP expenditures in 2004/05 to 5.4 percent in
2007/08. Since 75 percent of Pakistan's social protection spending (excluding food subsidies) is
devoted to social security spending (likely received mainly by the non-poor), these expenditures
largely accrue to the non-poor.

66.       Untilthe introduction of the BISP in 2008 (see description in section V), the two main
cash transfer programs in Pakistan were Zakat and the Food Support Program (FSP) o f Pakistan
Bait-ul-Mal (PBM). Although similar in terms of their overall objective and target population,
these programs have different histories and are operated and funded in substantially different
ways. Zakat is managed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and implemented by local
committees with financing from individual contributions. Incontrast, the FSP is administered by
the Ministry of Social Welfare and Special Education (MoSWSE), through PBM, and is funded
through public resources.

Challengesfor Safety NetDeliveryI3

67.       Expenditures:Prior to the institution of the new safety net program, expenditures on
safety net programs were low relative to neighboring countries and declining over time in
Paki~tan.'~Safety net spending on the two main safety net programs (Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal)
declined sharply, from 0.4 percent of GDP in 1991/92 to less than half of this level, or 0.14
percent of GDP in 2004/05. Contributions to Zakat have declined significantly (from 0.3 percent
of GDP in the 1980s to 0.08 percent in 2002/03, and 0.04 percent in 2006/07) as more people
have opted out from paying contributions by either withdrawing funds before the day that Zakat
is levied or by filing a declaration of exemption, leading to concomitant declines in expenditures
on Zakat programs. Fiscal allocations for Bait-ul-Mal have increased in recent years, from 0.02
percent in 2002/03 to roughly of 0.04 GDP in 2006/07, but not enough to compensate for the
decline in Zakat expenditures. In 2006/07, the PBM Food Support Program and "regular" Zakat
programs together covered 3.2 million households corresponding to about 13 percent of




l3This section is based on World Bank (2007), ibid. The report defines households whose consumption falls below the
 overty lineas poor, while the ultrapoor are households whose consumption falls below the food poverty line.
p4Safety net spending (most recent estimates; as a share of GDP) is approximately 0.6 percent in Bangladesh, over 2
percent in India. The level of social safety nets expenditures is not an indicator of program efficiency in targeting the
poor, however.

population in a country where poverty estimates range from 22.3 percent to 28.8 percent
depending on which price index is used to take into account inflati~n.'~

68.       Benefit adequacy and timing: Zakat guzara transfers represent 14 percent o f average
recipient household income while PBM's Food Support benefits are equivalent to 11 percent o f
household income among the ultra-poor, and to 8 and 5 percent among the poor and the non-poor
respectively.      In comparison, conditional cash transfer programs in Mexico and Nicaragua
provide benefits that amount to 21 percent o f average household consumption. Furthermore, the
stipulated amounts are often not receivedby households. For example, the average Zakat guzara
cash transfer beneficiary during the 12 months before the survey was equivalent to 5-6 monthly
installments, rather than the stipulated 12, and payments occurred in 6-8 months intervals. Given
the small size o f program benefits and non-poor targeting in Pakistan, poverty and inequality
decline only slightly inresponse to transfers.

69.       Benefit payment:Benefit delivery systems are weak with negative impact on program
efficiency. Major issues with Zakat and PBM's service concern the long response time for
payment activation after program registration, the costs associated with cashing program benefits
and the irregularity and lumpiness o f benefit payments. While 20 percent o f all applicants
received their first payment within a month o f application, 50 percent had to wait 1-6 months and
8 percent had waited more than a year. One in ten households had difficulty getting their funds.
Beneficiaries on average made 1.6 visits to the payment center to obtain funds; one intwenty had
to go three times or more. Moreover, one in ten beneficiaries declared to have paid a bribe to get
their benefit at some point, with bribes averaging 10 percent o f the transfer. Finally, beneficiaries
complain about small, lumpy, and infrequent installments. Even so, all said and done, program
beneficiaries found the transfers useful in providing some poverty relief.

70.       Benefit Incidence:Although both Zakat and Bait-&Mal                         display elements o f pro-poor
targeting, they could still perform better. The current fiscal allocation to cash transfer programs
could be more efficient in covering the poor if program expenditures were better targeted. A
sizeable share o f benefits reaches the non-poor while many o f the rejected applicants are poor.
Nearly 46 percent o f total benefit expenditures o f Bait-&Mal reach the poorest 40 percent o f the
population, while 43 percent of total Zakat expenditures reach the same population group. This
performance could be improved. For example, 80 percent o f expenditures on conditional cash
transfers reach the bottom 40 percent o f the population in Honduras; and 62 percent o f total
expenditures reach this group inMexico.

71.       Governance: Weak governance and lack o f transparent eligibility conditions reduce
targeting effectiveness. The main reasons for poor targeting include (i)the lack o f an objective
targeting instrument: Both Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal target the `deserving needy' and poor, but no
objective targeting tool is used; (ii)the lack o f an operational definition o f poverty or targeting
mechanism that leaves eligibility decisions inthe hands o f the chairmen and members o f the local
Zakat committees or o f local authorities in the case o f Bait-ul-Mal; and (iii)systematic


''The  PBM Food Support Program delivered cash transfers to 1.46 million households in 2006/2007. When all PBM
programs are considered (FSP, individual financial assistance, national centers for rehabilitation of child labor,
vocational training centers and institutional rehabilitation) then the total number of beneficiary households is estimated
to be 1.7million in 2006/2007. Similarly, "regular' Zakat programs (guzara allowance, educational stipends, stipends
for students of Deeni Madaris, health care, social welfare rehabilitation and marriage assistance to unmarried women)
covered 1.7 million households but this number increases to 2.5 million when other zakat programs are considered(eid
grant, leprosy patients, emergency relief operations, national level health institutions, national level Deeni Madaris,
technical educational stipends and permanent rehabilitation scheme).          For more information, see PRSP I1 and the
PRSPAnnual ProgressReport2007/08.

differences in program access and eligibility, which favor the non-poor-programs         tend to be
located in better-off localities and benefits to increase with household income.

72.      Graduationmxit: Currently, safety net program recipients are not linked to income
earning opportunities or access to education and health services. Globally, there is a trend for
cash transfer programs to include incentives to help children in beneficiary households acquire
human capital and avoid inter-generational poverty. These conditional cash transfers have
successfully increased enrollment, improved health outcomes and reduced child labor. Pakistan
is also piloting and evaluating similar programs: (i)     provincial stipend programs, including the
Punjab Secondary School Stipend Program targeted to girls; (ii)Bait-ul-Mal's Child Support
Program, a pilot conditional cash transfer program targeted to the poorest households; and (iii)   a
cash transfer program that targets improvement o f health status (TB) alone.          Microfinance
programs also provide opportunities to the poor to exit poverty. Even though Pakistan had the
lowest penetration o f microfinance in South Asia with less than 2 percent o f poor households
covered (vs. over 60 percent o f the poor in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) in early 2000s, micro-
credit disbursements have increased consistently from Rs. 1 billion in FY02 to Rs. 9.9 billion in
FY07. Duringthe same period, the number o f beneficiaries increased from 100 thousand in FY02
to 906 thousand inFY07.

73.      Coping with Shocks: Safety net programs also are not able to expand to cope with
shocks. The recent earthquake exposed the gap in the ability o f the government to cope with
natural disasters.    Since no safety net structure existed that could be rolled out quickly,
interventions had to be designed from scratch.        The final relief package combined short-term
income support (cash support) with long-term aid for reconstruction (housing).          Community-
based rehabilitation services housed in four resource and information centers for persons with
disabilities in the earthquake-affected areas are planned to complement this program. Pakistan
has also implementedworkfare programs to build infrastructure and offer temporary employment
to the poor, but no major program currently exists. Past programs include workfare for Afghan
refugees and the Khushal Pakistan Program, though their overall impact on poverty reduction i s
not known. Currently, no public works program exists to target the poor through low wages or
conditions on public works contracts to employ local labor.

      111.    THE GOVERNMENT'SSOCIAL SAFETY NETREFORMPROGRAM

74.      Pakistan's Social Protection Reform Program, including its safety net reform program, is
outlined in three key policy documents: the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP I,2003
and PRSP 11, 2009); and the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS, 2007). These documents
are the outcome o f a comprehensive consultative process that involved key stakeholders from
federal, provincial and local governments, civil society organizations, the private sector and
development partners. They provide a consistent policy framework to develop the country's
social protection system with a particular emphasis on consolidating and improving the
effectiveness o f the country's safety net programs, moving from disparate safety net schemes to a
modern national safety net system. The proposed Social Safety Net DPC is fully aligned with
these strategies.

75.      The PRSP I : A strategy for poverty alleviation and economic development was
articulated by the previous Government in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) o f
December 2003 entitled "Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty: the Road
Ahead." PRSP-I focused on second generation reforms to: (i)       achieve and sustain a high growth
rate with macroeconomic stability, and translate this high growth into reduced poverty; (ii)
improve governance and consolidate devolution, as a means o f delivering both development

                                                   22

 results and ensuring social and economic justice; (iii)invest in human capital, with emphasis on
 effective delivery o f basic social services; and (iv) target the poor and vulnerable, and bring the
 marginalized sections o f the population and backward regions into the mainstream o f
development. An important component o f the fourth pillar was the modernization o f the safety
 net system. The strategy was fully aligned with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
 focused on raising incomes, achieving universal primary enrollment, reducing gender disparities,
 lowering child and maternal mortality, combating communicable diseases, and eradicating
 poverty. The strategy was implemented and, as mentioned earlier, the economy grew rapidly,
poverty incidence declined, and many human development indicators improved duringthe PRSP-
 Iperiod.

 76.      The PRSP 11:The current administration recently finalized the second PRSP (PRSP-11).
 The new strategy is also fully aligned with MDGs. It focuses on regaining the macroeconomic
 stability and structural reforms required to support the recovery o f strong and sustainable growth.
 The strategy envisions an economy with competitive enterprises, productive employment
 opportunities, transparent governance and low poverty. The PRSP I1outlines the priorities o f the
 present government with particular emphasis on social safety nets.           Pillar I1 o f the PRSP
 "Protecting the Poor and the Vulnerable" outlines an assistance framework for the poor and the
vulnerable as a key objective o f Government's poverty reduction strategy. It recognizes that due
to the rapid escalation o f food prices in FY2007/08, a significant part o f the population may have
been pushed below the poverty line. In view o f recent economic shocks, it sees a particular
urgency to expand existing programs and to institute new measures to protect the disadvantaged
population. The stated policy objective o f the new programs is to reach the poorest and the most
vulnerable segments o f the society. The menu o f the proposed programs ranges from direct cash
transfers to employment programs. The amount projected to be spent on these programs in
FY2008/09 i s more than Rs. 148.6 billion (about 1.1 percent o f GDP and 3.74 percent o f total
budgetary expenditures for the current FY) -more than double o f the previous year's allocation.
The PRSP I1suggests that as the country systems for delivering safety net programs improves and
more fiscal space becomes available, the programs could be further expanded.

77.      Pakistan's National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) was developed and approved
by Cabinet in 2007, consistent with the provisions o f PRSP, and is presently under revision to
reflect the new federal and provincial initiatives (for example, the Punjab Food Support Scheme)
ensuring their coordination, as well as the new institutional arrangements for program delivery
and monitoring.

78.       The Goals o f the NSPS are: (i) support chronically poor households and protect them
                                           to
against destitution, food insecurity, exploitation, and social exclusion; (ii)to protect poor and
vulnerable households from the impacts o f adverse shocks to their consumption and well-being
that, if not mitigated, would push non-poor households into poverty, and poor households into
deeper poverty; and (iii)to promote investment in human and physical assets, including health,


                                                  23

nutrition, and education, by poor households to ensure their resilience in the medium run,
interruptingthe intergenerational cycle o f poverty.

79.      The NSPS recognizes that even though there are a number o f programs inPakistan which
tackle poverty and vulnerability directly or indirectly, but due to the lack o f a holistic strategy,
these individual programs remain ad hoc fragmented and duplicative. The strategy concludes that
in order to fulfill their mandate, existing safety nets programs will need to strengthen their
implementation and targeting to ensure that they efficiently reach the intended beneficiaries. In
the absence o f monitoring, evaluation and accountability mechanisms to assess the performance
o f the existing programs, program designs are rarely improved. Finally, the NSPS observes that
the total government spending on social protection is both very low and inadequate for meeting
current needs, given the large number o f poor and vulnerable people in the country and in
comparison to international benchmarks.

80.      Given this overall context o f social protection programs, the NSPS identifies priority
areas for action and outlines a broad reform agenda aimed at improving targeting, coverage,
implementation, and monitoring o f the safety net programs. The NSPS's priority actions to
achieve the main short-term objective o f protecting the poorest families are: (i)ensuring good
performance o f existing programs and effecting a transition to better and more comprehensive
systems; (ii)introducing new means testing and development o f databases through some pilots
across chosen rural and urban areas; (iii)scaling up successful pilots across the country following
assessment and generation o f lessons learned; (iv) extending the current level o f benefits to the
target population o f the poorest o f the poor; (v) introducing pilot Conditional Cash Transfer
(CCT) programs; and (vi) scaling up successful pilots to the whole target population. The NSPS
identifies public works programs, social protection measures for the informal sector and social
security as other potential interventions that deserve consideration, in addition to the two key
pillars that the SSN DPC supports: cash transfers and conditional cash transfers targeted to the
poor households.

81.      The Bank has supported the development o f the National Social Protection Strategy,
through its technical support for safety net systems in Pakistan over the past several years. This
engagement included the completion o f the Pakistan Social Protection Report entitled "Social
Protection in Pakistan: Managing Household Risks and Vulnerability" which (i)evaluated risks
and vulnerability facing households; (ii)evaluated the existing social protection programs; and
(iii)providedrecommendations on improvement intheir efficiency. The Bankalso provided
technical assistance to formulate a National Social Protection Strategy; provided technical
assistance to improve the targeting and administration o f existing social assistance programs,
including the development of a poverty scorecard based on a Proxy Means Test (PMT) formula;
conducted policy dialogue with provincial governments on social protectionpolicy and programs;
supported social care services for the disabled; and provided technical assistance to support the
design and implementation o f a pilot Conditional Cash Transfer Program, the Child Support
Program (CSP).

82.      The introduction o f BISP as the Government's main national cash-transfer program is
consistent with the National Social Protection Strategy's objective o f creating a national safety
net program to provide minimum income support to the chronic and transient poor; that could
also serve as a common platform for other safety net programs. As noted above, the BISP was
rolled out in fall o f 2008 with the objective o f covering 3.4 million families in 2008/09 with a
benefit o f Rs. 1000 [$12] per month, increasing program expenditure on safety net from 0.3 to 0.6
percent o f GDP. The main vehicle for targeting o f the program was through the distribution o f
forms to parliamentarians who, inturn, encouraged their constituents to apply for benefit. By late

                                                24

April 2009, over 3.185 million forms have been receivedout of which 51.18% have been found
eligible and roughly 1.7 million families have been paid. The approximate amount disbursed is
US$147.83million. However, recognizingthe needfor a more objectiveandtransparenttargeting
method, the Government adopteda povertyscorecardfor improvingthe targetingperformanceof
the program. The Government is now inthe processof reformingthe program to transform it into
a modernwell-administeredand-targetedsafety net system.

     IV.      WORLD BANKGROUP STRATEGYAND THE PROPOSED SSNDPC

               A.      LINKTO THE COUNTRYASSISTANCE STRATEGY


83.     The FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board in April 2006.
The strategy was designed to assist the Government of Pakistan to consolidate the economic
turnaround that began in 2000 and to lay the foundation for increased competitiveness and
sustained growth and poverty reduction. The CAS was organized around three inter-linkedand
mutually reinforcingpillars corresponding to the strategic priorities of the PRSP: (i)sustaining
growth and improving competitiveness; (ii)improving government effectiveness and service
delivery; and (iii) improvinglives and protectingthe vulnerable.The periodcovered by the CAS
comes to an end on June 30, 2009. Preparation of the new CAS (FY10-14) is underway and
managementplansto discussthe new CAS with the Boardduringthe latter half of the year. The
proposed Social Safety Net DPC is consistent with the CAS, although timing and type of
instrument has beenadjustedin line with the requirements of the evolvingcontext.

84.     The program of support inthe CAS endorsed by the Boardenvisioned a flexible lending
program of up to $6.5 billion over the four year period (approximatelyUS$3.1billion IDA and
US$3.4 billion IBRD). Within this envelope an immediate priority was to assist inaddressingthe
impact of the October 2005 earthquake. In addition, the CAS targeted expanded lending in
infrastructure (primarily energy, water, and transport) and human development. Cross-cutting
reforms, both at the national and provincial level were to remain a key focus and a substantial
share of IDA lendingwas expectedto take the form of PRSCs and provincialdevelopment policy
credits.

85.      Since the CAS was discussedthe Bank programhas evolvedto meet the requirementsof
a changingstrategic context. Lendingfor earthquakereconstruction, education and infrastructure
was delivered largely as plannedduringthe first two years of the CAS. Thereafter Bank support
slowed as the political transition introduced a degree of policy uncertainty and as the
macroeconomic situation deteriorated. Front-loadingof IDA utilizationand limitationon IBRD
access due to creditworthinessconcerns combined to shift lendingtoward the first two years of
the CAS and reduce aggregate financing. Overall lendingunder the CAS period is projectedto
reach a total of $4.9 billion, about 25 percent below the upper bound for lendingset in the CAS.
IDA lendingwill exceed the CAS target as a result of the higherthan anticipatedIDA available
under IDA 15. rSRDlendingwill fall short ofthe volume foreseeninthe CAS.

86.     The past two years have been a time of change, uncertainty, and economic crisis for
Pakistan. The ruling coalition that came to power through parliamentaryelections in February
2008 split in August. In September, Asif Zardari assumed the presidency following the
resignationof PervezMusharraf. Meanwhile, in 2007/08, the sharp rise in internationalprices of
oil and food combinedwith policy inactionand internalpoliticalturmoil, ledto rapidlyexpanding
macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan. Under these circumstances, the focus of the Bank's
dialogue was increasingly on improving macroeconomic management, averting a balance of


                                                25

payments crisis and restoring stability while seeking to mitigate the impact o f adjustment on the
poor. Planned policy based operations were delayed during this period while the Bank focused
on enhancing programs in education and social services and strengthening its dialogue on
infrastructure, particularly energy.

87.      After a period o f inaction, Pakistan started to take decisive steps to stabilize the economy
following election o f the current Government.          The Government entered into a Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF in November 2008, and has been able to sustain difficult reforms so
the program remains on track. The Government also finalized its second PRSP which was
discussed by the Board on March 26, 2009. The strategy focuses on regaining macroeconomic
stability and structural reforms required to support the recovery o f strong and sustainable growth
and will serve as an anchor for the next CAS. The strategy also emphasizes the importance o f
protecting the poor and sets as a goal the establishment o f an efficient, well-targeted nationwide
social protection program. The proposed Social Safety Nets DPC is fully aligned with the new
strategy.

88.     N o w that the macroeconomic situation has improved the Bank has quickly resumed
preparation o f policy-based lending, the first o f which was the Pakistan Poverty Reduction and
Economic Support Operation (PRESO) approved by the Board o f Executive Directors on March
27, 2009. Other donors have mobilized additional resources for Pakistan, notably with the
international community pledging more than $5 billion to Pakistan at the Donors Conference in
Tokyo, Japan on April 17, 2009. These resources will be utilized over the next two years
primarily to expand social protection and enhance human development spending.

89.     Including PRESO, the Bank will provide up to $800 million in development policy
operations in FY09, including this proposed Social Safety Net DPC and a proposed $100 million
Higher Education DPC.         Policy based lending, including PRESO, is a critical element o f
Government's financing plan embedded in the IMF Stand By Arrangement. We will also present
a Safety Net TA loan to support program implementation as well as two provincial education
investment operations and a project to support livelihoods and basic service delivery in the
poorest regions o f the country.

90.     The proposed Social Safety Net DPC is fully alignedwith the CAS while also taking into
account emerging needs and opportunities.          Specifically the operation builds on the social
protectionpolicy directions outlined inthe CAS while assisting the government to scale up social
protection in order to mitigate the impact o f an unforeseen macroeconomic adjustment program
as well as dramatic changes in the global economic environment. As outlined more fully in the
CAS, Pakistan's PRSP recognized that existing safety net systems suffer from a variety o f
shortcomings including inadequate spending, weak administration, targeting, and delivery
mechanisms, lack o f coordination between agencies, and poor monitoring and evaluation. The
CAS strategy was centered on helping the government to develop a comprehensive social
protection strategy to guide policy reform over the medium and long term. The CAS lending
program was to support reforms through the PRSCs, a standalone Social Protection operation,
and social protection components in provincial DPCs and emergency operations. However,
Government's decision to launch the BISP presented a significant opportunity to accelerate safety
net reforms while dramatically scaling up safety net spending for the poor.

B.       COORDINATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DEVELOPMENTPARTNERS

91.     Coordination with IMF:Bank and Fund staff collaboration in Pakistan continues to be
effective with consultations on macroeconomic issues and technical assistance. The Bank and

                                                  26

IMFteams have coordinated closely both the SBA and PRESO-supported reform programs. The
MEFP indicates that an expanded and effective social safety net constitutes an integral part o f the
authorities' program. The Bank has continued participating inthe IMF missions as an observer.

92.      Coordinationwith other development partners: The Bank is collaboratingwith DFID
on select reforms supported by the SSN DPC and TA operations. A DFID-financed trust fund
has generously supported the analytical work and technical assistance that i s underpinning a
number o f supported reform measures in social protection. DFID is providing bridge financing
for technical assistance to implement the measures supported under the SSN DPC until the
proposed Social Safety Net Technical Assistance loan becomes effective. The specific activities
covered under this DFID trust fund are (i))      the roll out o f the poverty scorecard; (ii)the
development o f a communication strategy; (iii)improvement o f the management capacity o f
BISP; and (iv) analyticalwork and data collection for M&E.

                 C.      RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

93.      The proposed SSN DPC is closely linked to several ongoing and planned Bank
operations. This operation follows from the PRESO, implementing a broader social safety nets
reform program. PRESO supported the adoption o f the poverty scorecard as the new targeting
instrument for BISP and preparation o f a plan for its roll out.     This operation supports the
development o f institutional systems to support the implementation o f the safety net program,
which includes support for the implementation o f the targeting method through identifying
institutions for enrollment, eligibility determination and payment processing; as well as
rationalizationo f safety net programs.

94.      A Social Safety Net Technical Assistance (SSN TA) project is being prepared inparallel
with the proposed SSN DPC, both for Board approval inthe fourth quarter o f FY08/09. The SSN
TA project is designed to build institutional capacity and systems to implement and sustain the
reforms supported under the SSN DPC. Specifically, over a four year period, the proposed SSN
TA project would provide support to (i)establish the national targeting system, (ii)strengthen
safety net program operation, (iii) enhance program management, implementation, accountability
and evaluation, and (iv) advance the analytical underpinnings o f the social protection agenda,
facilitate the dialogue for the National Social Protection strategy and support better monitoring
and evaluation o f selected safety net programs.

95.      The current DFID Trust Fund would provide bridge financing till the Safety Net TA
operation i s effective.    Finally, the reforms supported by the proposed SSN DPC are
complementary to the PPAF 3's livelihood protection and livelihood improvement components,
in particular, the activities that involve the provision o f microcredit and training to facilitate
exit/graduation from poverty.


                 D.      LESSONSLEARNEDFROMPRIOR OPERATIONS
96.      Country Assistance Evaluation: In 2005, IEG conducted an evaluation o f Bank
assistance to Pakistan during 1994-2003, The report rated the effectiveness o f Bank's assistance
mixed, with the overall outcomes o f Bank's assistance program rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.    Bank support for macroeconomic management and growth was rated as
moderately satisfactory, while the Bank's assistance was found to be unsatisfactory in poverty
reduction, social sector development, governance, agriculture, natural resource management,
fixed infrastructure,    revenue mobilization, and expenditure management.              The key
recommendations o f the evaluation were: (i)the Bank should continue its strong support o f

                                                27

analytical work, while translating analysis into implementable actions, taking into account
political economy constraints; (ii)Bank interventions should have a greater focus on building
sustainable institutional capacity; (iii)projects should be more focused and scaled to fit the

97.      Lessonsfrom other operations:Key lessons from ongoing sector DPC operations in the
country, the prior experience with provincial adjustment programs, the long-standing experience
o f sector investment projects in Pakistan, and broader Bank-wide experience with development
policy operations are:

    Strong political commitment and ownership are critical for successful steering o f a sector
    reform program and for addressing governance constraints to effective service delivery.
    A reform program that combines sector reforms with cross-cutting fiscal and fiduciary
    reforms is more likely to yield results and to be sustained. It also contributes to increased
    ownership o f sector reforms beyond the line department.
     Uppont actions combining governance reforms with reforms that visibly and quickly improve
    outcomes increases credibility and acceptability of reforms. This can lay the foundation for
    the more complex institutional reforms that come with considerable challenges and resistance
    from vested interests.
     The success of sector reforms is dependent on collection and dissemination of credible data
    and information. Establishment o f baselines at the onset, followed by intense monitoring and
    verification is essential to provide credibility for the reforms, to monitor progress and to
    support the necessary analysis for design.
     Weak capacity to plan, manage and implement reforms requires careful sequencing of
    reforms   combined with appropriate capacity building efforts.                Capacity for the
     implementation o f policy reform is often weak and calls for focused capacity building efforts
    to be built into the program. It also calls for a reform agenda that i s implementable, and
    developed in line with existing capacity.
    Programmatic, policy-based lendingprovides theflexibility needed to support reforms while
    managing risks. Multitranche DPCs help support a complex reform agenda while providing
    a mechanism to adjust to the pace o f reforms. Social protection policy reforms supported
    through a development policy credit have more impact if accompanied by a capacity building
    technical assistance credit. Given that reforms take time to implement, continuity o f support
    to SP reforms is important.
    Analytical support includingjust-in-time demand-driven notes adds considerable value. The
    development o f a strong analytical base that allows a full understanding o f sector specific
    issues and identifies policy reform areas help develop ownership and capacity for reforms.

     V. THE PROPOSEDSOCIAL SAFETYNET DEVELOPMENTPOLICY CREDIT

                                   A.         OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

99.       Objective: The broad objective o f the safety net reform program is to support inclusive
growth through the development and implementation of a fiscally sustainable, efficiently
targeted, and well-administered national safety net system in Pakistan. The safety net system will
provide the chronic and transient poor with both basic income support and access to opportunities
for graduating out o f poverty.16 Specifically, the proposed credit will support the establishment o f
an appropriate policy framework for an efficient safety net system, including the development o f
sound institutions for the effective implementation o f the Benazir Income Support Program, the
Government's new national safety net program. This objective i s consistent with the goals o f the
Pakistan's Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-11) and the National Social
Protection Strategy o f Pakistan. The proposed tranching i s well suited to Pakistan's current
situation and needs, since it provides the Government with predictability o f IDA'Ssupport to
social safety nets untilthe new CAS is available and serves to mitigate some risksassociated with
the program.



l6 This objective is fully consistent with the recommendationsof the 2007 World Bank report titled "Social Protection
inPakistan:ManagingHouseholdRisksandVulnerability".

                                                            30

 100.      The Safety Net Reform Areas: During the second half o f 2008, the Government of
Pakistan launched the BISP as its main national social safety net program." The program
provides cash transfers o f Rs. 1000 [$12] per month to the eligible families and i s expected to
cover 3.4 million families in 2008/2009.'8 The 2008/09 budget allocation o f the Rs. 34 billion,
doubles the federal Government's social safety nets spending from 0.3 percent in 2003/04 to 0.6
percent o f GDP." The GoP intends to expand the budget for the BISP in the coming fiscal year
2009/10 to cover around 5 million families with the ultimate goal over the medium term to
expand coverage to 7 million families to all provinces o f the country, Azad Jamnu and Kashmir
(AJK) and Northern Areas. In line with the National Social Protection Strategy, the short-term
objective o f BISP i s to cushion the adverse impact o f the food, fuel and financial crises on the
poor, but its broader objective i s to establish a safety net platform for the chronic poor and those
affected by future shocks as a first step towards a more comprehensive social protection system.
In particular, the Government's vision is to gradually implement poverty-exidgraduation
programs (such as conditional cash transfer programs) to enable desired education, health and
employment outcomes for the poor. As the BISP program expands under the new targeting
mechanism, the Government intends to shift resources from untargeted or poorly targeted
programs (such as wheat subsidies), which would aid the fiscal sustainability o f the targeted
safety nets programs inthe long term.

 101.      The introduction o f the Benazir Income Support Program is evidence o f the strong
commitment o f the Government to develop a modern safety net system with strong institutional
underpinnings. The adoption by the Government o f an objective national targeting method based
on a poverty scorecard for this program, a first in the South Asia region, to replace the
parliamentarian based targeting process is another evidence o f this commitment to developing an
effective safety net system (Annex 4 provides detailed information on this Proxy Means Test).
Most recently, the Government has informed the eligibility determination agency to no longer
process the old targeting forms. To facilitate the transition to the new system, the Prime Minister
has made a public announcement through media asking the households to participate in the new
poverty score card data collection process. As targeting improves under the BISP, it will be
possible to support a social policy platform that can potentially align other human development
and poverty-focused programs to achieve the goal o f establishing accountable and sustainable
systems in the country.

 102.     However, the adoption o f an objective targeting method is only the first step towards the
development o f an effective safety net system. Inaddition to this measure, the key policy reforms
that need to be taken to improve the functioning o f the safety net include, inter alia, (a) the
development o f a targeting system that is transparent and serves to identify the eligible poor; (b)
the establishment o f a legal, policy, and institutional framework to ensure sound management,
governance, monitoring, and administration o f the program, including exit policies to help the
poor and vulnerable graduate from safety net programs; and (c) the expansion o f coverage and


"Similarly,provincialgovernmentsareengagedinthe formulationofnew socialprotectionprograms.Forexample,
the Government of Punjab has announced the Punjab Food Support Scheme (PFSS) originally designed as providing
food stamps for the poorest households, but later converted to a cash transfer program of RslOOO per household per
month. The allocation for PFSS in the current year provincial budget was Rs. 21.60 billion to cover 1.8 million
families. According to PFSS design and agreement with the federal government, it will ensure that PFSS beneficiaries
do not overlap with the BISP. Hence, PFSP will target an additional 1.8 million beneficiaries on the top of around 1.7
million likely to be covered under the BISP in Punjab.
I* This level of coverage is approximately equalto about 25 percent of the population-around the 2005106 national
poverty headcount rateaccording to the most recent estimates.
l 9 Inaddition, the province of Punjab is allocating about 0.2 percent of GDP to its income supportlcash transfer
program in 2008109. A higher level of spending does not translate into more coverage for the poor if safety nets
programs are poorly targeted.

program, benefit incidence o f safety net spending (percent o f safety net expenditures targeted to
the poor), and adequacy o f benefit (benefit as a share o ftotal consumption) could be measured to
evaluate program performance. The long-term outcomes o f the Government's safety net reform
program would include the poverty impact o f program (percent poverty incidence reduced among
beneficiaries) and, where conditional cash transfer programs or other graduation strategies are
included, outcome indicators such as the impact o f the program on children's school enrollments
and nutritional and health outcomes would be an appropriate metric o f program performance.

106.      Expected outcomes of the SSN DPC: The measures and reforms supported by this
single tranche operation are expected to lead to the following outcomes in2010:

     Increase in the share o f beneficiaries enrolled in the BISP program using the new targeting
     mechanism from 0 to at least 30 percent o f total beneficiaries.
     Increase in the share o f total benefit expenditures reaching the poorest 40 percent of the
     population from 46 percent to at least 55 percent.
     Increase in program applicants receiving a response on whether they qualify for the program
     within 3 months from scorecard form submission, from 0 to at least 50 percent o f total
     applicants.
     Increase in benefit payments audited from 0 percent to at least 50 percent o f total payments
     under the new payment system and improvement in reconciliation time lag from the present
     indefinite period to 2 months.
     Increase in percentage o f participating (poverty-scorecard) districts in which beneficiary lists
     are publicly available, from 0 to at least 30 percent.

                          Box 2. GoodPractice Principles for Conditionality
 Principle 1:Reinforce Ownershit,
 The proposed operation supports the Government's reform program, which is aligned with the National Social
 Protection Strategy and the PRSP2. It has wide ownership among key stakeholders at all levels of government
 and political leadership. Bank support to the Government program takes into consideration the political
 economy o f reform, as reflected in the sequencing o f reforms (e.g., implementation of the poverty score card
 based targeting gradually, through implementation in 10 districts to start with). Given the wide scope of the
 reform program, there are some areas that require analytical work. The Bank has worked closely with the
 Government to prepare a comprehensive review of the social safety nets, the results were published as the
 Social Safety Nets Report, which in turn provided inputs into the National Social Protection Strategy. More
 analytic work is plannedunder the TA support that the Bank is providing, incollaboration with DFID.
 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
 accountability framework
 The Policy Matrix of Reforms, based on Government's overall program, provides the framework for
 coordinating support of all development partners. Specifically, support from the DFID is already being
 provided through Bank executed Trust Funds. The ADB is also planning to support the process through the
 proposed "Accelerating Economic Transformation Program".         The results framework is derived from the
 GovernmentProgram, and it would continue to coordinatedonor support aroundthe same set of results.
 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
 circumtances
 The DPC series have in the past benefited from Bank's overall fiduciary work at the country level. The related
 actions supportedby the proposedDPC are consistentwith Pakistan's overall fiduciary reforms.
 Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
 The program framework is ambitious as the Government's reform program is fast-moving. The criticality of
 the seven prior actions for meeting Program Objectives is explained below. The prior actions are derived from
 the Government's reform program and are required for meetingthe program outcomes.
 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financialsupport
 Apart from formal missions, the program is reviewed by the Task Team through continuous dialogue with
 policy makers (departmentlevel, finance and planning, and senior administrative and political leadership), and
 through field visits. Regular reviews will be conducted both by the Government and by the Bank, based on the
 framework of outcome indicators listed by the Policy Matrix.


                                         B.       POLICYAREAS
107.      The Social Safety Net Reform Program, which this credit seeks to support, is based on
three complementary pillars. The first pillar aims to improve targeting eflciency of the safety
nets programs by establishing a national targeting system through appointing separate agencies
for data collection and eligibility determination; and adopting a sound policy on transitioning

                                                      34

 from the old to the new targeting system.                  The second pillar aims to establish an effective
 institutional j-amework for safety nets program implementation through the development o f
 legal, institutional, administrative institutions for the safety net system including the
 establishment o f an independent safety net agency to provide a uniform platform to implement
rationalizedsafety net programs, the development o f administrative policy guidelines for program
 implementation; the rationalization o f overlapping safety net programs to improve fiscal and
 administrative efficiency, and the development o f graduation and exit strategies to facilitate
households' movement out o f poverty. The third pillar aims to enhancefiscal sustainability and
strengthen the fiduciary environment through ensuring adequate budget allocation for benefit
payment and program administration consistent with the overall macro-economic framework and
by developing a reliable and transparent payment system, with a separate payment agency
 governed by strong fiduciary and social accountability controls on benefit payments.

 108.      The following sections describe in further detail the actions proposed to be supported by
the SSN DPC that have as their objective developing the institutional structures to ensure
effective implementation o fthe BISP.

Pillar I:Improvingthe targetingefficiencyof safety net programs

Establishing a national targeting system

 109.      Key Issues: The targeting performance o f the BISP has been a major concern. Given the
need to rapidly roll out the program, the beneficiaries o f BISP were initially identified by
Parliamentarians (Members o f the National Assembly and Senators). By early March 2009, over
2 million such forms have been received by BISP for processing o f payments. Out o f these,
roughly 1 millionapplications have been identifiedas eligible under the initial selection criteria.

 110.      The recent adoption o f an objective targeting instrument-the                    poverty scorecard*'-has
been the critical first step to ensure the benefits reach the poor and vulnerable. The poverty
scorecard is a synthesized form o f proxy means test (PMT)-a                    targeting tool that is usedinmany
countries to identify the poor for provision o f social assistance. The poverty scorecard or P M T
includes a limited number o f indicators that correlate well with poverty along with a simple
scoring system to help identify the program beneficiaries.                        The proposed scorecard-based
targeting will be an improvement over the previous system in a number o f ways: (i)                        a transparent
and fair enrollment process that allows all to apply for it; (ii)objective and transparent criteria for
determining the eligibility; (iii)adoption o f verification tools to reduce exclusion and inclusion
errors,

111,       To finalize the design o f the nationwide scorecard roll out, the BISP has launched a test
phase o f the scorecard roll out in at 16 selected districts; in all o f the provinces and in Azad
Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Areas. This exercise will enable the BISP to finalize the
design for the nationwide roll out by learning from the field including logistics and monitoring
requirements. The Government proposes to use a census approach for collecting scorecard
information, which requires that each household in the covered area will be visited door-to-door
and requested to fill out the forms. For the national implementation, the targeting center approach


20 The poverty scorecard is a Proxy Means Test that includes a limited number of indicators that correlate well with
poverty along with a simple scoring system to help identify the program beneficiaries. The proposed scorecard-based
targeting will be an improvement over the previous system in a number of ways: (i)a transparent and fair enrollment
process that allows all to apply for it; (ii)transparent criteria for determining eligibility; (iii)adoption of verification
tools to reduce exclusion and inclusion errors.

                                                            35

is also likely to be employed, which requires families to approach the center and fill out the forms
themselves. This process will require training o f those both approaching households and filling
out the forms in the targeting centers. An effective public information campaign will be a key
element for both phases to inform the potential beneficiaries locally about the objectives and
implementation o f the program. Inorder to closely monitor the implementationo f the test phase
and quickly learn from this valuable experience, BISP will use a series o f control instruments to
evaluate data collection experience. Based on the test phase results, including evaluations, BISP
will initiatethe transition o f beneficiaries to the new targeting system.

112.      The SSN DPC will support the following reform actions to improve the targeting
efficiency o fthe BISP (prior actions are bolded).


0    A national targeting system established to implement the poverty scorecard method,
     through contracting of separate agencies for scorecard data collection and eligibility
     determination. The Government will establish a targeting system that separates the
     enrollment o f beneficiaries from the determination o f their eligibility for the BISP to improve
     administrative efficiency. Specifically, the Government will select a separate agency/
     agencies for national data collection for the poverty score card. This selection will be based
     on the performance o f several agencies that will implement data collection during the test or
     pilot phase. These agencies, or partner organizations (POs), include the Pakistan Poverty
     Alleviation Fund (PPAF), the Rural Support Program Network (RSPN) and the Population
     Census Organization (PCO). The rationale for selecting these partner organizations i s to
     capitalize on their outreach and ability to galvanize the community to apply for the program
     by completing the scorecard applications duringthe targeting process. The Government will
     also establish clear criteria for evaluating their performance o f each organization regarding
     efficiency, maintaining confidentiality o f household information, quality of trainings and o f
     information campaigns, and the methodology o f approaching culturally and geographically
     diverse populations. After the test phase, BISP will engage in similar partnerships with these
     and if needed other organizations that have the capacity and capability o f managing the
     scorecard data collection process (e.g., inurban areas). The targeting system will also include
     the appointment o f a separate institution for the processing of the poverty scorecard data for
     eligibility determination, including the provision o f CNICs to eligible families in a
     coordinated manner. The agencies for poverty score card data collection will be required to
     transfer the scorecard information to this entity who will then undertake the data entry,
     processing, validation, o f the list for determining their eligibility to the program. Based on
     the eligibility thresholds, this entity will determine and transfer the final list o f eligible
     beneficiaries to a separate payment agency for delivery o f benefit to eligible households.
     Eventually, the BISP, as the main safety net agency, will also provide data to the entity for
     eligibility determination from other organizations like PBM, PFSS and Zakat to minimize
     duplication o f benefit. Since BISP intends to make payments to families, it will work with
     the relevant entity to include provisions for CNICs to be provided in a fast track mode to
     eligible beneficiaries.


0    Policy decision on improving BISP targeting mechanism and transition of BISP
     enrollees under the parliamentarian-basedsystem taken by the BISP Board, removing
     existing beneficiaries from the program if they do not complete the scorecard targeting
     form or qualify under the new targetingsystem. Giventhat the Government is committed
     to rolling out the scorecard-based targeting system at the earliest, under the proposed reform,
     it has had to make a policy decision on status o f beneficiaries inthe old targeting system post
     the poverty scorecard roll out. Specifically, the Government has decided that if the


                                                    36

     beneficiaries o f the old system do not apply or qualify under the new targeting system, their
     benefits will be discontinued.

    Povertyscorecard data collection completedinselected pilot districts.'l To implementthe
    new targeting system, the Government will collect poverty-scorecard data in select districts in
     Pakistan during a test phase through the three partner agencies noted above. There are 16
     districts where the test phase poverty scorecard data will be collected, covering about 17
     million individuals. The data will be collected using a census method, with survey teams
     obtaining information from each family residing inthe pilot districts, which will then be used
     to determine their eligibility for BISP benefits.

     The BISP has (i) implemented the policy decision to remove beneficiaries of the
     parliamentarianbasedsystemwho do not completethe scorecard form or qualify under
     the poverty-scorecard based system; and (ii)adopted a transition policy including but
     not limited to grievance mechanisms, definition of cut-off score for eligibility, plan for
     national roll out and communications strategy.22Once data has been collected from the
     test districts, it will be processed by the eligibility determination agency to determine whether
     or not a family qualifies under the new targeting system. Those families in the district who
     were previously receiving benefit but did not apply or do not qualify under the new targeting
     system will have their benefits discontinued. To implement this decision, the eligibility
     determination agency will inform the payment agency to discontinue benefits o f these
     particular beneficiaries. In order to ensure smooth transition to the new poverty-scorecard
    based targeting system, a comprehensive policy will need to be adopted and implemented by
    the Government, including but not limited to grievance mechanisms, definition o f cut-off
     score for eligibility, plan for national roll out and communications strategy. This transition
     policy will be informed by among others, the results o f a rapid-assessment survey that will
     provide information inter alia, on the overlap between the parliamentarian based targeting
     and the poverty-scorecard based targeting.

      Effective mechanisms to ensure the quality of data collection for the test phase of poverty
    scorecard based targetingprocess adopted. In order to closely monitor the implementation
     o f the test phase and quickly learn from this experience, BISP's monitoring policy for poverty
     scorecard data collection will be based on using a series o f control instruments to evaluate the
     performance o f this process. First, according to this policy, Partner Organizations will be
     requiredto establish a cascade system for the supervision o f the data collection as outlined in
    the targeting guidelines. Second, a process evaluation for the test phase will provide insights
     into the adherence of data collection institutions to the established processes. Third, BISP
    will receive timely information from third party random spot checks onthe quality o f the data
     collection by the Partner Organizations. The results from these spot checks will be
    communicated to BISP management and the Partner Organizations to ensure learning and
    midcourse correction if necessary. The spot checks will also suggest a threshold level for
     errors on the basis o f which the area can be re-surveyed for improving the quality o f data.
    This policy will be critical for helping to ensure that exclusion and inclusion errors under the
    new system are reduced.

113.       Medium-Term Milestones: Over the medium term, the Government will finalize the
institutional policy arrangements for enrolling beneficiaries for the nationwide roll out based on
test phase results, taking into account their performance. Based on this institutional arrangement,

*'This  i s the first (of two) triggers o f the secondtranche
22This is the second(of two) triggers for the secondtranche.

                                                        37

the score card enrollment would be rolled-out nationwide (at least 80 percent o f districts in the
country). In the medium term, the spot checks for monitoring the quality o f scorecard roll out
and ensure mid-course correction will need to be taken; and appeals emanating from the
scorecard-based selection will have to be addressed to minimize inclusion and exclusion errors.
Policy decisions regarding the long-term enrollment process will also be critical: the key
decisions include whether to make enrollments open or closed; and whether to collect information
via a census approach or a targeting-center approach.

114.     Expected Results: A well-targeted safety net system will ensure that the eligible
households benefit from safety net programs, and will improve the efficiency o f public benefit
expenditures on safety net programs.        The policy supporting an institutional framework o f
independent agencies for collecting data, determining eligibility, and for payment will improve
the governance o f the system. Grievance procedures, once in place, can also minimize targeting
errors, increasing the efficiency o f public expenditures. A well-established targeting system can
then be extended to other cash transfer and pro-poor programs, further improving the efficiency
o f public expenditures on the poor.

Pillar 11:Establishingthe Institutionalframeworkfor Safety Net Implementation

DevelopingInstitutional Arrangementsfor Safety NetsAdministration

115.     Key Issues: BISP was originally established to be headed by a National Program
Coordinator under the Ministry o f Finance. A National Steering Committee headed by the
Minister for Finance was also established at the same time. Later in 2008, the Program was
transferred to the Cabinet Division and a Special Secretary was appointed along with a National
Program Coordinator. Moreover, the Special Secretary was declared as the Principal Accounting
Officer with all administrative and financial powers as given in the Rules o f Business o f Pakistan
for Federal Secretary, in charge o f a Division. The Special Secretary was later replaced by a
Managing Director enjoying the same powers as o f a Federal Secretary.23 Thus, BISP remains a
temporary institutional arrangement compromising its governance and administrative efficiency,
and a more formal institutional arrangement for the agency is required to minimize political
interference and ensure sound governance and effective program implementation. Such an
arrangement would also allow fragmented safety net programs to be consolidated and rationalized
under one platform and through one agency, resulting in more consistent safety net policy
formulation and improvements intargeting and administrative efficiency o f safety net spending.

116.     As its legal base is formalized, a critical role for the implementing agency will be to
develop the administrative policy, structures, and procedures to successfully implement the
program. The main administrative policies and processes will include the targeting process,
payment procedures, monitoring and information systems, evaluation strategies and programs.
The agency will need to implement a monitoring policy that will focus on improving monitoring
information to evaluate program performance in order to inform and fine-tune program design
and effectiveness. Public outreach and public information will also be important for
communicating program information to eligible groups and reducing exclusion errors.
Administrative policies and procedures would also include attention to staffing, both recruitment
and training o f BISP professionals.




23After the promulgation of the BISP Ordinancethe ManagingDirector title will be replacedby the title of
Secretary

                                                 38

117.     The rationalization and consolidation o f the safety net programs will improve their
effectiveness overtime. Currently, as noted above, Pakistan has two other cash transfer programs
that are nationally implemented. To avoid duplication and develop a common social protection
policy platform under the BISP, specific measures to ensure coordination between the two
programs, including their level o f benefit, coverage, targeting, and outreach will need to be
considered. Finally, in an even broader context, the NSPS will need to be revisited, both interms
o f its design and implementation, given the initiation and need for coordination o f the new safety
net programs both at the federal and provincial level, and its potential role as a platform for other
safety net programs.

118.     The SSN DPC will support the following reform actions for improving the
institutional framework o f the BISP for effective administration o f the safety net system; for
rationalizing the existing safety net; and for reducing benefit dependency (prior actions are
bolded):


0     BISP established as an autonomous statutory safety net authority to implement safety
      net programs through adoption of a legal ordinance with (i)clear financial and
      administrative autonomy; and (ii)distinctionin roles of the Board, the Chairperson and
      the Secretary for the oversight and management of program implementation. The
      Government o f Pakistan has decided to transform BISP from a temporary agency into a more
      permanent structure by submitting a law for its creation to Cabinet and later to Parliament.
     Under the law, BISP would become an autonomous statutory authority with financial and
      administrative autonomy that would be responsible for the design and implementation o f the
     main safety net program, and would provide a unified platform for implementing other safety
     net programs currently operating in the country.        To ensure strong governance o f the
     program, the law would also define the composition and roles and responsibilities for the
     BISP Board and BISP management. The main provisions would ensure that the Board would
     have overall oversight o f the program, would set the policy directions and review program
     performance on a regular basis, while the Management o f the BISP would have the
     responsibility o f operating the program: ensuring that the program i s administered in a
     transparent and well-governed manner, hiringand firing o f staff, etc.

0    Administrative policy guidelines for effective BISP program implementationadopted by
     BISP, as approved by its board. The successful administration o f the BISP requires the
     adoption o f transparent and accountable administrative policy guidelines for the effective,
     coordinated, and efficient delivery o f income support to eligible beneficiaries.        These
     guidelines to be contained in the program Operational Manual will include detailed
     operational and implementation provisions for the roles and responsibilities o f all
     implementation partners (BISP, MOF, Planning Commission, Pakistan Post, Partner
     Organisations for enrolment and for eligibility determination, provincial and local
     governments, beneficiary households, etc.). They also include the guidelines for targeting,
     enrolment, payments, organisational structure, and monitoring and evaluation arrangement, as
     well as fiduciary rules governing the program. Specifically, effective administration o f the
     BISP program will also require policy guidelines for the development o f a comprehensive
     Monitoring and Evaluation system. This system would include an integrated Management
     Information System (MIS) with core functions managed by BISP and satellite systems
     managed by the data processing agency and the payment agency. In addition, a set o f
     evaluations (process evaluation, impact evaluation (qualitative and quantitative) and
     beneficiary assessments) will be carried out periodically to ensure effective feedback to
     policy makers and to facilitate further improvements in the program. Furthermore, spot
     check reports as well as audit reports will provide valuable inputs for effective monitoring o f

                                                 39

    program implementation.      To administer programs, BISP will also require well-qualified
    staff. BISP i s in the process o f filling key positions at the central offices to implement the
    test phase o f the program. For the nationwide rollout, BISP will also fill the necessary
    positions at the provincial and district levels. These policy guidelines will be critical for the
    implementation o fthe program and will be codified in a program implementation.

    The update of the National Social Protection StrategV (NSPS) initiated to include program
    rationalization and establish the institutional pamework for enhanced coordination and
    delivery of social protection programs. Although the general framework provided in the
    NSPS is entirely consistent with the social safety net reforms that are being introduced by the
    new government, the Government will revise the strategy document to adequately reflect the
    latest policy developments and institutional arrangements. In particular, the updated NSPS
    will include program rationalization and will establish the institutional framework for
    enhanced coordination and delivery o f social protection programs. For this purpose, under
    the proposed reform, the Government i s expected to notify a Committee under the Planning
    Commission to steer the revision o f the NSPS through a consultative process. The committee
    will have specific responsibilities and stipulated time frame for completion o f the review.
    Consultations at the federal as well as provincial level will be undertaken to ensure
    coordination o f safety net reform initiatives, and the revised NSPS will be placed before the
    Federal Cabinet for adoption.       The revised NSPS will thus adequately reflect the new
    government's vision and priorities in social protection and the reforms in particular to be
    undertaken to establish systems.        It will also outline the institutional framework for
    monitoring and implementation o f the NSPS with social safety nets as one o f the priority
    areas for action.

    Policy decision to remove overlapping mandates of BISP and PBM in delivering
    unconditional cash transfer programs taken by the Prime Minister. The Government
    intends to make BISP the central safety net program o f the country and to this effect; a law is
    being adopted to define its mandate as well as parameters for governance. However, given
    that the Pakistan Bait-ul M a l (PBM) is also a federal safety net agency and i s implementing a
    large unconditional cash transfer program, i.e., Food Support Program (FSP); a policy
    decision is required to clarify its future role with delivery o f the FSP being similar to BISP.
    This policy will require P B M to discontinue the FSP in order to remove the duplication.
    However, the P B M will continue to implement the CSP (CCT) pilot until its successful
    completion and evaluation.

DevelopingExit and GraduationStrategies

119.    Key Issues: A key issue in program design and implementation is to ensure that the
program does not induce benefit dependency; but rather facilitates the graduation o f beneficiaries
from poverty status. Thus it is critical that benefit levels are established to ensure work
disincentives are minimized. InPakistan the benefit amount corresponds to 16 percent o f average
monthly male adult earnings, and i s therefore unlikely to create disincentives for work. It i s also
important to link beneficiaries with income earning opportunities such as skills and training
programs or micro-credit opportunities. Incentives can also be included in the program to reduce
the inter-generational poverty among program beneficiaries, through, for example, conditional
cash transfers. These programs provide poor households with incentives to send their children to
school and to avail health and nutrition services. The Government plans to initiate analytic work
on potential exivgraduation strategies during the updating o f the National Social Protection
Strategy, and planned projects such as the PPAF 3 will focus on skills training and micro-credit
programs to promote exit o f adults from the safety net system. The Government also plans to


                                                  40

expand the pilot o f the CCT pilot being undertaken by the Bait-ul Maal to reduce inter-
generational poverty.

 120.     The SSN DPC will support the following action to promote long-term poverty reduction:


0    Child Support Program (a conditional cash transfer [CCT] pilot) expanded; using a
     poverty score card based targeting method. The CSP has already been implemented in
     three districts on a pilot basis by PBM, in order to promote the investment in human capital
     for poverty reduction by increasing attendance and reducing dropout rates in primary schools
     inthe targeted districts. The CSP provides additionalcash incentives, as a top-up benefit, for
     PBM's FSP program beneficiaries with children between five and twelve years old. A rapid
     assessment o f this pilot program has been carried out, among other things indicating the need
     to increase the CSP payment amount and to better coordinate with the Provincial Education
     Departments during the implementation o f the program. The Government is expected to
     expand the CSP to further districts, in a manner that incorporates lessons-learned from the
     first phase implementation into the program design. The expanded pilot program will also
     utilize the poverty-scorecard information to increase the targeting performance o fthe CSP.

 121.     Medium-Term Milestones: In the medium term, the government is expected to
consolidate select federal safety net programs under the safety net authority adopted by the
federal cabinet, as reflected in its revised National Social Protection Strategy. To be effective in
implementing programs, the agency would need to be staffed with qualified professionals at the
federal, provincial and divisional levels in accordance with the Organizational Structure outlined
inthe BISP Operational Manual. As monitoringand evaluation results become available, a wide
dissemination o f these will ensure a broad-based debate about the effectiveness o f BISP in
providing basic income support to the poor. Finally, BISP would be modified to ensure that
program beneficiaries are able to access selected human development services (e.g.
healthhtrition, education, training) and selected/existing activation programs (e.g., skill
development, income generation, employment, cash for work) to promote exit from poverty. In
particular, the results from the CCT pilot will be used to assess how BISP and P B M can
coordinate their programs to ensure better human development outcomes among the poor.

122.      Expected Results: As a result o f strong administrative policies and procedures, BISP
will be able to deliver benefits to the eligible poor. A strong evaluation focus will help the
program to showcase its positive results and identify areas for improvement in order to increase
its performance. The efficiency o f public expenditures on safety nets will be increased if safety
net programs are rationalized and managed through a single agency. Finally, the introduction o f
graduation strategies into the program should help the current poor and their children escape
poverty.

Pillar 111.EnhancingFiscalSustainabilityand Strengtheningthe FiduciaryEnvironment

Adequacy and Sustainabilityof Safety Net Expenditures

123.     As noted above, despite economic growth, social protection (including safety net)
expenditures have been declining in recent years. To support the roll out o f the program, in
addition to ensuring that public expenditures on safety nets are well targeted, it will be important
to provide sustained financing for the safety net program that is also consistent with the medium-
term macro-economic framework. The SSN DPC will support the following action to promote
the fiscal sustainability o f the safety net programs.


                                                   41

 124.    BISP budget allocation for FY08/09 is consistent with medium term macroeconomic
j-amework and adequate to pay the agreed benefit amount to at least 3.4 million families. In
2008109, the Government increased safety net spending considerably from 0.3 to 0.6 percent o f
GDP. The increase in spending in 2008109 mainly reflects the institution o f the new national
 safety net program (BISP), which is ultimately intended to cover the bottom 25 percent o f the
population. The initial budget allocation for the safety nets programs i s indicative o f the
Government's commitment to protect the poor and the vulnerable. In the medium term, a well-
targeted social assistance program would allow policy makers to reduce budget allocationto other
poorly targeted schemes (such as the price subsidies for wheat products) that are meant to assist
the poor families.

Improvingthe ControlandAccountability of BISP Payments

 125.    Key Issues: Consistent with best practice, the Government will appoint an agency for
delivering payments that is separate and independent from the agencies that enroll beneficiaries
and determine their eligibility. Specifically, the policy o f the Government is to deliver benefits to
eligible beneficiaries (female representatives o f the family) through postal money orders.
However, there are currently no policies or procedures for evaluating or improving the
effectiveness o f the payment system-that    is, whether payment reach beneficiary households, full
or in part, on time or later than stipulated, and whether there is any pressure on the post office
staff to divert payments intended for beneficiaries or any side payments or required by the poor
households to avail their benefits. This information will be required to strengthen the payment
system.

 126.    The SSN DPC will promote the following actions to ensure that benefit payments are
transparent, timely and delivered with adequate control and accountability:

    Independent payment agency appointed, policy guidelines and procedures for ensuring
    timely delivery of payments agreed. Under the proposed reform, the Pakistan Post will be
    appointed as an independent agency to pay benefit to eligible beneficiaries. The agreement
    will require the periodic provision o f eligible list o f beneficiaries by the selected eligibility
    determination agency to Pakistan Post. According to the Government policy, the Pakistan
    post will be required to print money orders and deliver the money at the door steps to the
    beneficiaries after verifying their CNICs. Pakistan Post will also maintain a record o f the
    delivery o f payments and will periodically submit it to BISP in a specified format. This data
    will then be uploaded in the MIS, with the record o f each transaction serving as the financial
    management, reporting and reconciliation mechanism and will allow regular tracking o f
    payments.
    Based on PPRA 2004,procurementguidelinesfor BISP developedand approved by the BISP
    Board. To address a weak regulatory framework governing public procurement, a Public
    Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was created in 2002, PPRA rules are based on
    international best practice and are followed by Sindh and Balochistan. Punjab is in the
    process o f implementing a procurement reform strategy, and technical assistance is being
    provided to NWFP on amendment o f its existing procurement law and making it consistent
    with international best practice. The management o f BISP also recognizes the importance o f
    establishing the appropriate procurement procedures in accordance with the federal Public
    Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance 2004.
    Independentoperational audit arrangementsfor BISP adopted. The independent operational
    audit arrangements will provide a systematic assessment o f the efficiency and effectiveness
    o f BISP by focusing on structure, controls, procedures and processes. Under the proposed
    reform, BISP will put in place organizational arrangements for instituting operational audits,

                                                 42

     including their functional relationship with the Secretary, being the Principal Accounting
    Officer, as well as with the Board, with the latter being responsible for policy and
     implementation oversight. The operational audits will include audits o f the payment system,
    from the time the post office receives the list to the time when benefit is supposed to be
    received by the eligible beneficiary. This exercise will help identify the constraints to benefit
    delivery as well as requisite measures for improving its effectiveness such as the posting o f
    beneficiary lists inthe village, community verification, etc. Inorder to ensure that the correct
    beneficiaries o f the BISP safety nets get the benefits in a timely manner and operational funds
    are appropriately utilized, the operational audits will also look into the efficacy o f and
    transparency in the financial management system within BISP. This will involve an analysis
    o f the entire payment process from generation o f the beneficiary list to the receipt o f cash by
    the eligible beneficiary. The operational audit reports will provide specific recommendations
    to enhance control and accountability mechanisms in BISP's overall operations thereby
    enabling BISP not only to meet the program objectives in a transparent manner but also to
    avert any financial risks.

127.     Medium-Term Milestones: To provide sustained financing for the program and expand
its coverage, the Government proposes to increase spending on BISP to nearly 1 percent o f GDP
in 2009/10. Inthe medium term, fiscal sustainability will be ensured ifbudgets to the safety net
programs are adequate, with the number o f families chosen through corresponding cut-off scores
(determined in part by making use o f the firstho11 out phase implementation experience o f the
poverty scorecard) to ensure program consistency with the overall macro-economic framework.
To ensure benefit payments are made efficiently, both accurately and on time, the FM system will
be fully functional, FM audit reports regularly available and observations fully settled.         The
reconciliation process o f payments will be functional in accordance with the administrative policy
guidelines; the procurement procedures will be fully implemented; and the third party ex-post
review o f sample procurements will have been completed.                Over time, however, BISP
management will evaluate and adopt, if feasible, alternative payment options using modem
technology (e.g., smartcards). Social accountability systems will also be in place and will allow
the assessment o f payment processes, which would include, inter alia, the publication o f
beneficiary lists at the appropriate sites, systematic oversight by local stakeholders, and a
mechanism for complaints and confidential allegations. Finally, grievance system for payments
will be in place to ensure that beneficiaries are able to obtain their full benefits in a timely
fashion.

128.     Expected Results: The implementation o f these policies will help ensure adequate and
sustainable financing o f the safety net system that will increase the coverage o f the poor. The
reforms will also ensure that benefit delivery has sufficient in-built control and accountability
mechanisms to provide timely delivery o f stipulated benefits to the eligible poor.

                           VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                           A.       POVERTY AND SOCIALIMPACTS


 129.    The proposed operation is expected to help the poor cope with both chronic and transient
poverty. The operation supports the development o f a well-targeted cash transfer program (Le.,
BISP), which will cover a significant portion o f the poor population nationwide. The provision o f
income support to the poor should help provide for the basic needs o f the poorest populations.
The establishment o f a national targeting system based on objective and transparent criteria,
supported by strong and transparent institutional structures for collecting enrollment data,
determining eligibility, benefit payment, and for addressing grievances, with a strong emphasis
on monitoring and evaluation, has the objective o f ensuring that benefits reach the poor, with
minimuminclusion and exclusionerrors.

130.     The new targeting system relies on the use o f a poverty score card, which is developed as
a Proxy Means Testing (PMT) method using Pakistan Living Standard Measurement Survey
(PSLM) data. This targeting tool consists o f a limited number o f simple indicators that correlate
well with poverty (as measured by a household consumption aggregate) along with an intuitive
scoring system that helps identify program eligibility (see Annex 4 for detailed information on the
poverty scorecard instrument). Under this system, if the poorest 25 percent o f the population is
set as the target group, about 52 percent o f the poor would be excluded while 37 percent o f
beneficiaries would be non-poor. However, a more detailed analysis reveals that many o f these
non-poor beneficiaries would be families that are vulnerable to becoming poor because
approximately 85 percent o f these beneficiaries come from the third, fourth, fifth and sixth deciles
o f household expenditure distribution (with per adult equivalent less than Rs. 1,436, around 150
percent o f the official poverty line).

131.     There is a tradeoff between the breadth and depth o f the coverage. The current benefit
amount is Rs. 1000 per month per family, and it would take Rs. 63.4 billion to cover about 18.7
percent o f the population, provided all the program budget is allocated to the benefits. However,
ifthe monthly payment is reduced from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 750, it would take the same amount of
budget (Rs. 63.4 billion) to set the cutoff score at the poverty line (score o f 17) and cover about
24 percent o f population, again provided all the budget is allocated to the benefits. However, the
increase in the coverage is at the cost o f the reduction in benefit, which will have impact on
poverty alleviation. At this time, with benefit amount set at Rs. 1000 per month per family, the
BISP is expected to reduce poverty headcount rate by 6.4 percentage points if a cutoff point that
leads to a coverage rate o f 16.6 percent o f the population is selected.24

132.     Basic income support to the poor is also expected to have a positive impact on human
development outcomes. First, the provision o f income support through an effective safety net
will help ease household budget constraints, allowing an increase o f food consumption for both
adults and children. Given that the cash transfer will be provided to the female head o f the
eligible families, the cash is more likely to be spent to increase nutritional intake for children.
Second, with income support it is expected that beneficiary families are likely to rely less on child
labor and at the same time have more resources to be spent on children's schooling. Evidence
from Pakistan suggests that many poor families do not send their children to school because o f

24These statistics are based on simulations which use a poverty rate of 21.9 percent (as suggested by the
PSLM 2005/06 data), and utilize the inclusion and exclusion errors of the poverty-score-card based
targeting approach. Thus these estimates do not reflect the poverty reduction impact o fthe parliamentarian
basedselection approach.

                                                   44

limited facilities but also because o f lack o f resources. Third, the operation will support linking
program beneficiaries with current income opportunities such as skill training activities, micro-
finance and other programs, but also support the development o f conditional cash transfer
schemes that provide incentives to poor households to send their children to school (and in the
future nutritional and health services) thereby breaking the inter-generational cycle o f poverty.
Evidence from Latin America indicates that well-designed and -administered conditional cash
transfer programs reduce poverty but also have positive impact on school enrollment, a critical
ingredient for improving welfare o f the future generation.

133.     This operation will also promote gender equity. The cash transfers supported by this
operation are provided to the female head o f the eligible families, which i s expected to increase
women's autonomy and their perception o f self and social status within family, as suggested by
the international evidence from other cash transfer programs or conditional cash transfer
programs. The empowerment o f women inturn may have some positive impacts on the children's
human capital. There i s some international evidence that cash transfers when received by women
had a large impact on the anthropometric status (weight for height and height for age) o f girls;
this was not the case when men receivedthe allowances, suggesting that the efficiency o f public
transfer programs may depend on the gender o f the recipient.25 Though more evidence is needed
to support the hypothesis that female heads are more likely to spend more resources on girls in
Pakistan, it i s reasonable to hypothesize that girls' overall welfare, nutrition, and educational
opportunities will improve as a result o f the program. There is also a risk that in some o f the
traditional tribal areas, communities may object to women receiving the benefit. However, at this
time, this issue has not emerged as a significant obstacle for program implementation other than
in few isolated areas where there may be a need to undertake additional measures to ensure that
the program benefits reach the poorest and most vulnerable families.

134.     The provision o f ComputerizedNational Identity Cards (CNICs) to recipients o f benefits
under this programwill also benefit the poor includingwomen. This provision o fthe CNICs will
indirectly facilitate access to various services such as opening o f Bank accounts, etc. The
government has already launched a campaign o f providing free o f charge CNICs through
NADRA's offices as well as the mobile teams. Inthis context, there is an accelerated campaign
in the poverty scorecard test phase districts preceding the poverty-scorecard data collection so
that maximum number o f families, especially the poor, will be able to provide complete
information to the survey teams. Since women are less likely to have CNIC cards compared to
men, it is pertinent to note that as o f April 2009, the accelerated distribution o f CNIC cards has
benefited women disproportionately: there is a phenomenal increase in women's enrolment with
100,000 women receiving new CNICs per week.

135.    This operation will help protect the poor against both chronic poverty and transient
poverty. Pakistan has experienced a series o f adverse aggregate income shocks, such as a drought
and earthquake and recently, the global economic crisis. The unfolding global financial crisis
will reduce aggregate demand and will inevitably affect - albeit with a lag - employment and
wages. Recent evidence from Pakistan and elsewhere in South Asia suggests that the poor are
often the hardest hit by a crisis. Given limited physical assets and human capital, the poor are
more likely to follow behavioral strategies to cope with income shocks. These include pulling
their children out o f school, or reducing the quality and quantity o f food consumed, or borrowing
from usurious money lenders-all       o f which forces them deeper into poverty. Informal risk
sharing arrangements often cannot reduce poverty, especially when shocks affect communities as

a whole. Global evidence suggests that countries with effective safety net systems can better
protect those adversely impacted by shocks. Incountries without a well-administered safety net,
governments use inefficient policies such as expanded untargeted subsidy programs that are both
distortionary and often do not reach the poor. The BISP program, supported by this operation,
has the potential to mitigate negative economic impacts o f the financial crisis by providing well-
targeted basic income support to the poorest households. A recent Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis (PRES0 Annex) indicated that while the recent food and fuel crisis households could
have increased poverty between 2 and 3 percent, depending on whether growth did not occur or
the economy grew at 6 percent, a safety net system could be much more effective than subsidies
for protectingthe poor, assuming it was well targeted.

                                  B.     ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 136.     The reforms and policies supported by the proposed loan to strengthen Pakistan's social
safety nets are not likely to have any significant negative effects on Pakistan's environment,
forests, or other natural resources.

 137.     The Strategic Country Environmental Analysis (SCEA) prepared by the Bank indicated
that environmental degradation costs Pakistan at least 6 percent o f GDP, or approximately Rs.
365 billion per year. Roughly 80 percent o f these costs stem from increased mortality and
morbidity associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution and waterborne diseases. Infant child
mortality rates, for instance, are the highest in South Asia and the prevalence o f childhood
diarrhea and acute respiratory infections are the second highest. More specifically, Pakistan's
under-five mortality rate o f 97 per 1,000 live births as well as its infant mortality rate o f 78 per
1,000 live births are higher than those o f both India (76 and 57) and Bangladesh (69 and 52),
respectively.

138.     By 2008, excluding the impact o f malnutrition,26 roughly one third o f all child mortality
in Pakistan (or approximately 132,000 children per year) is caused by environmentally related
factors (35 percent o f which originate from acute lower respiratory illnesses and 64 percent due to
diarrhea).27     When malnutrition is taken into account in the calculations, mortality from
environmental factors increased to 187,000 children per year (47 percent o f all child mortality).
Annual costs o f the environmental health burden not accounting for malnutrition are in the order
o f 2.9 percent o f GDP, and when malnutrition effects are included, annual costs increase to 4.1
percent o f GDP. Moreover, when the longer-term effects o f malnutrition (partly attributed to
environment-related infections) on education and income are considered,28estimated annual costs
may be as highas 8.8 percent o f GDP.

139.     Realizing the costs and the potential long-term ramifications o f environmental
degradation, the Government o f Pakistan (GoP) i s giving top priority to the environment. The
GoP, through its Ministry o f Environment (MOE), has requested assistance from the Bank in the
development o f an environmental management program that enables a reduction inenvironmental
degradation and its economic consequences, with the aim o f underpinning the country's


26 Malnutrition and child mortality are strongly interlinked. Malnourished children are particularly vulnerable to
environmentally-related diseases and therefore at higher risk of death. Conversely, children that contract
environmentally-caused infections have a high likelihood of becoming malnourished, regardless of their socio-
economic level, although lower incomechildrenwith limited access to treatment are at higher risk.
27 Comparable fractions of environmentally caused children mortality were found when analyzing the situation in
Ghana.
'*Chronic  malnutrition causes impairment of cognitive development, resulting in poor school performance and
ultimatelya loss of lifetime earnings.

 sustainable economic growth.     In this sense, the Bank is carrying out analytical work and
preparing a technical assistance loan to support Pakistan's National Environmental Policy (NEP)
to enable environmental interventions aimed at ameliorating the social consequences o f
environmentaldegradation.

            C.       IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

 140.    Implementation: The BISP is currently implemented by the Cabinet Division and a
 Special Secretary was appointed along with a National Program Coordinator. Moreover, the
 Special Secretary was declared as the Principal Accounting Officer with all administrative and
financial powers as given in the Rules o f Business o f Pakistan for Federal Secretary, in charge o f
a Division. The Special Secretary was later replaced by a Managing Director with the same
powers as o f a Federal Secretary. The BISP i s governed by a Board (national Steering
Committee) headed by the Chairperson.

 141.   At the federal level, a Managing Director (MD) and a Director General (DG)
Administration have been appointed. Moreover, five Regional Directors for all the provinces
including AJWNA, Director Admin, Director IT, Director Finance & Accounts, Director Internal
Audit and a Deputy Director, Media, along with some support staff have been appointed.
However, some administrative setup at the federal level, namely DG Operations, DG Finance &
Accounts, M&E Officer, Director Media and some support staff are yet to be placed. At the
provincial level, a DG will head each province including AJWNA (a total o f 5 DGs). Provincial
DGs shall be assisted by 28 Divisional Directors, who shall be further assisted by 125
Supervisors. So far, all the five Regional DG positions have been filled, whereas the remaining
staff has to be appointed. The Management Board for BISP was established under the Cabinet
Division via Notification No. F.1/5/2008-Admn-II dated September 27th2008.

 142.    TheManagement Board that will oversee the overall implementation o f BISP comprises
the Ministerhiinister o f State - Chair; MNA - Vice Chair; 3 MNAs, the Deputy Chairman,
Planning Commission,       Member, Advisor        Finance,    Member;    and the MD BISP -
MembedSecretary. BISP will implement the program through partnerships with the Pakistan
Poverty Alleviation Fund; the Rural Support Program Network and Population Census
Organization for data collection; the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) for
database design and management; MIS; verification o f eligible beneficiaries selected through the
Targeting Process, and generation o f payment lists. The BISP has also signed an agreement with
Pakistan Post, for paying beneficiaries through the postal system, which has a very wide
outreach.

143.    Monitoring and Evaluation: The program is designed to include a robust monitoring
and evaluation system (see Annex 4 for a detailed description). The program will be monitored
by an effective management information system that allows BISP to access information on
applicants and beneficiaries, generate payment lists, handle grievance redressal, and reconcile the
payments. Moreover, the M I S will also enable BISP to share information with partner agencies,
perform regular cross-checks, and update the information contained in the database on a regular
basis within a secure environment that guarantees the integrity o f the information underpinning
the system. The evaluation strategy o f BISP aims to assess the impacts o f the cash transfers on
the socioeconomic conditions o f the beneficiary families focusing on food and non-food
household consumption.      Given that the cash transfer i s given to the female head o f the
beneficiary families, the evaluation also aims to assess the impact o f BISP on women's perceived
and actual social status. Inaddition, the proposed evaluation aims to assess the targeting process,
including the poverty scorecard performance and the effectiveness o f targeting centers, and door-

                                                47

to-door approach. Three phases o f evaluation are proposed: First, the process evaluation o f the
test phase will emphasize evaluating the quality and the effectiveness o f the poverty scorecard as
well as the operational processes for all stakeholders (including beneficiaries and non-
beneficiaries). Second, the initialhest-phase impact evaluation will further inform the baseline
(and follow-up) questionnaires for the nationwide impact evaluation o f the program. Finally, for
the roll out o f the BISP program, a full- fledged impact evaluation would be carried out that
would benefit from the gradual roll out at the national level. The impact evaluation study will
assess the targeting performance o f the program and how cash transfers affect food expenditure,
overall household consumption patterns as well as women's social status. The evaluation would
include a baseline survey (between targeting and payment) and at least two follow up surveys to
build a panel dataset on the same households to assess the impact o f the program in the medium
term. The follow-up survey will be conducted once or, if possible, twice a year in order to
capture the seasonality effects on consumption, but the frequency o f the follow-up surveys i s
contingent on the availability o f the financial resources. The results from the monitoring and
evaluation o f the program will help inform policy makers about program performance and assist
in fine- tuningthe safety net system to ensure that it meets its stated objectives o f protectingthe
poorest populations.

144.     Consultation and participation:The policies and programs supported by the proposed
credit are based on the National Social Protection Strategy, which was developed via stakeholder
participation and consultation. Consultations with district governments are a key aspect o f the
initial design of the reforms, and these are ensuring greater ownership and input into the reforms.
Greater participation o f communities ensuring transparent benefit delivery as part o f the social
accounting mechanisms will be an important facet o f program monitoring.

145.     Bank's Monitoring Arrangements:            The reform program sets out qualitative and
quantitative benchmarks and targets. The Bank team will monitor and follow up on progress,
carry out regular consultations with the executing federal ministries, and assess implementation
o f policy measures. The follow up and monitoring will be done in the context o f SSN DPC
missions and progress will be documented inaide-memoires.

                                 D.      FIDUCIARYASPECTS


146.     Public FinancialManagementSystem: The Pakistan Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) o f December 2003 highlighted improvements in expenditure reporting and
monitoring, and stated that budget support operations disbursed and managed through
Government's financial management systems have satisfactory outcomes.            However, it also
underscored the need for building institutional and human resource capacity to support the
transition to full reliance on government systems, controls, and financial reporting. It revealed
weaknesses in data reliability, particularly at the sub-national level. In accounting and financial
reporting, challenges that remain to be addressed are: (i)the creation o f internal audit units in
departments to improve internal controls; and (ii)finalization o f the Controller General o f
Accounts' (CGA) control over organization, staffing, and training arrangements with clearly
defined roles and responsibilities for staff reporting

147.     Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessments (PFMAA) for the
provinces o f Balochistan, Punjab, and NWFP were completed in May 2007, and identified
deficiencies in internal audit and controls, and budget credibility. These assessments were based




                                                 48

on the PEFA,29PFM,30and Performance Measurement Framework, which were used to rate the
existing PFM arrangements against international best practice.          Reform strategies are being
formulated to bridge these gaps. A federal-level PFMAA, usingthe same PEFA framework, is in
progress. A stakeholders' workshop was recently held and the draft report i s being revised to
incorporate comments received.

148.      Inaddition, a PEPFM3'review was also carried out. The review concluded, inter alia, that
expenditure effectiveness would be fostered by a concerted review and revision o f government
business processes to eliminate redundant procedures in expenditure commitment and payments,
particularly for the development budget.

149.      Government has taken action to enhance accountability and effectiveness o f public
expenditures. For better accounting and financial reporting, the Project for Improvement to
Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA) has supported a new accounting model, which has
introduced an IMF GFS-compliant Chart o f Accounts (CoA) for general government. As o f
2007/08 the federal, provincial, and district governments have prepared their budgets based on
the new CoA.         An automated budget compilation, accounting, and financial/fiscal reporting
system is being implemented country-wide. The financial management systems o f the federal
government, NWF, Sindh, and Punjab provinces, including the district accounts and finance
offices, have been fully automated. Implementation in Balochistan i s currently in progress, and
completion o f the automation process is expected during2009/10. The next step also being taken
i s to complete system connectivity to all 140 line departments to support the monitoring o f budget
execution on a realtime basis.

150.      Timeliness o f end-year financial reporting has improved at the federal level and in all
provinces and districts owing to the introduction o f the automated budget management system.
Within 12 to15 days o f the end o f each month, civil accounts are prepared and presented to the
Ministry o f Finance. The reliability o f these reports has also improved with material reductions
in un-reconcilable differences and the elimination o f suspense accounts. Reconciliation levels,
except in Balochistan, which is yet to achieve full computerization, have improved to about 97
and 98 percent for receipts and expenditures, respectively, and 99 percent for suspense and inter-
governmental accounts. Year-end financial statements have been prepared on the IPSAS32basis
by the federal government and all provinces. District governments are also transitioning to this
form o f reporting as part o f Government's international financial reporting regime. Pakistan is
moving ahead well in compliance with international standards and the timeliness and readiness of
annual financial statements for audit have improved to an average o f six months after the end o f
the fiscal year compared to more than 15 months prior to 2007/08.

151.      To enhance the effectiveness o f external audit, a risk-based audit methodology, compliant
with international standards on auditing, has been rolled out.            It was applied to federal
government accounts in 2005/06 and to the financial statements o f provinces and some districts in
2006/07. The 2007/08 financial statements o f federal, the four provinces and 115 districts have
already been certified by the Auditor General. It is for the first time that this certification has
been done within 9 o f the end o f the fiscal year, compared to 18 to 24 months in prior years.
Introduction o f an Audit Management Information System i s also underway to enhance the
efficiency, effectiveness, and control o f audit processes.

152.     Legislative oversight across the federal and provincial governments has been mixed,
largely due to the absence o f functioning Public Accounts Committees (PACs) insome provinces,
weak capacity o f PAC members in financial scrutiny, and the non-functioning o f the Zila
Accounts Committees at the district level. There i s a large backlog o f un-reviewed audit reports
and audited accounts due to recurring interruption o f the legislative oversight function and the
hitherto poor quality o f audit reports. With the new government since after the last elections,
strong PACs have emerged at Federal, Punjab, NWFP and Sindh that are working systematically
to reinforcing accountability o f the executives through regular reviews o f audit reports and
audited accounts. Institutionalization o f the oversight function in district governments, however,
remains a key challenge in the medium term to ensure enhanced accountability at the sub-
provincial level.

153.     Procurement: The 2000 Pakistan Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)
highlighted a weak regulatory framework governing public procurement, and called for
institutional and procedural reforms. The CPAR revealed that Pakistan does not have a coherent
law that establishes standards and an effective legal system that protects against collusion and
corruption in the award o f government contracts. The CPAR recommended the establishment o f
a new and modern procurement rules conforming to international best practice.

154.     A Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was created in 2002 with powers to
formulate public procurement legislation applicable to federal government line departments,
state-owned enterprises, and semi-autonomous organizations. New public procurement rules
were notified in 2004, and they depart from the old system in two important ways: they require
posting o f all bid notices on the PPRA's website, and prohibit post-bid negotiations. Moving
forward, the development o f monitoring and reporting mechanisms, and the creation o f an
autonomous second-tier appeals procedure to handle complaints in a timely and transparent
manner will be critical for effective implementation o f PPRA rules. PPRA rules are widely
recognized as the rules to follow for procurement, and Sindh and Balochistan have adopted the
rules to apply to all procurements o f the provincial and district governments. Punjab i s in the
process o f implementing a procurement reform strategy, and technical assistance i s being
provided to NWFP on amendment o f its existing procurement law and making it consistent with
international best practice.

155.     Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank: An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the
State Bank o f Pakistan was conducted in 2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities, in
particular, relating to SBP financial statements and disclosure policies that fell short o f acceptable
central bank standards.      However, since 2001 the risks associated with foreign exchange
management control have been mitigated. SBP is currently producing financial statements
consistent with international accounting standards and formats. An independent review o f SBP's
internal audit function has been completed and the recommendations implemented. SBP has also
established a process o f reconciling data reported to the IMF, and implemented guidelines to
prohibit operations that pledge or encumber reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair
the availability of, foreign exchange reserves outside the authorized framework. Also, the SBP
Act has been accordingly amended to strengthen its independence and autonomy in the
management o f reserves.

156.     Overall Fiduciary Environment: The proposed operation is related to the social
protection sector and particularly BISP, which is newly established and considered highrisk with
respect to financial management. Having due regard to the Government's commitment to overall
P F M reforms exemplified by actions already taken at the federal, provincial and district level as
well as the risksassociated with the sector, the overall fiduciary risk associated with the proposed

                                                 50

operation is `substantial'. Significant progress has been made in public financial management
reforms. In public procurement, several challenges remain to be addressed, including the
establishment of an independent second-tier appeals process and an effective monitoring and
evaluation system. Enhancing accountability, transparency, and reducing opportunities for
corruptionare core elementsof improvedgovernanceandreducedfiduciary risks.

                            E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDIT

157.    Borrower and Credit Agreement: The proposedCredit would be made to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, represented by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The IDA credit proceeds,
amountingto the equivalent of US$200 million, would be transferred to the Federal Government
in accordancewith the terms ofthe FinancingAgreement (FA).

158.    Funds Flow Arrangement: The Government of Pakistan will identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with SBP, which forms part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves, into which the proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed in two tranches. The first
tranche will be disbursed upon project effectiveness, and the second tranche upon fulfilment of
the triggers as described in Schedule 1, Section IT, C of the FinancingAgreement. The Rupees
equivalent of the funds in the Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the
Consolidated Fund of the Government of Pakistan (Account No. 1-Non-Food) held with SBP,
which is usedto finance budgetary expenditures.

159.    Disbursements: Disbursementsfrom the ConsolidatedFundfor activitiesto be financed
under the program by the Government of Pakistan will not be linkedto any specific purchases,
and no special procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds of the Credit shall,
however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the excluded expenditures as defined in
Appendix 1ofthe FA. Ifany portionofthe Credit is usedto finance ineligibleexpenditures as so
defined in the FA, IDA will require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund
the amount equal to the amount of the said payment to the IDA.Amounts refunded to IDA upon
suchrequestwill becancelledfrom the credit.

160.    Accounting and Assurance Requirements for the Credit: SBP, on behalf of
Government, will continue to maintain an appropriate accounting system in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.       For this Credit, since no special fiduciary
arrangements are required, no additional assurance requirements in the form of a formal audit
will apply, in the light of the fiduciary environment as established with the management of
foreign exchange reserves by SBP. However, within 45 days of disbursement of the Credit by
IDA, the Finance Secretary, Ministry of Finance, will provide a written confirmation to IDA
certifyingthe receiptof the Rupees equivalent of the Credit into the Consolidated FundAccount
of the Government of Pakistan, the date of receipt, and the exchange rate appliedto translate the
Credit currency into Rupees.

                           F.     RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION


161.    The risks to the proposed Pakistan Safety Nets DPC are substantial. The political,
economic andimplementationrisks for the operation are outlinedbelow:

162.    Political risks: Attaining a sharp reductioninthe fiscal and current account deficits will
require political leadership and cohesion. The scale and speed of the requiredeconomic policy
response to the macroeconomic imbalancesto improve economic growth and poverty reduction


                                               51

prospects in the long run could intensify social tensions in part o f the population. The
sustainability o f the program could also be undermined by possible differences among Pakistan's
main political parties on other issues, including constitutional reforms and the security situation.
The development o f a well- governed and targeted safety net could help mitigate the economic
and social impact o f necessary structural reforms on the poorest segments o f the population,
promoting social peace. The BISP has been established as an autonomous agency under
presidential Ordinance IX o f 2009. The Pakistan Constitution provides for a sunset clause for all
Ordinances. Ordinance IX o f 2009 will eventually require the Parliament's adoption to remain in
force.   The chances o f the Ordinance being repealed are deemed slim. Nevertheless, the
association o f the safety net program with the current government could lead to its disbanding
under a new and different government in the future. In addition, the involvement o f
parliamentarians in the initial beneficiary selection could also pose a major risk to its governance,
and pose a reputational risk for the Bank. The development o f effective institutions and strong
monitoring and evaluation systems that can provide information on program performance and
gain the confidence o f the public could mitigate this risk. The consensus across the political
spectrum on the need for a safety net program will also ensure continuity o f the program (though
the name or institutionalhome may change).


163.     Economic risks: On the external side, a renewed rise in international energy and
commodity prices, a reduction in foreign remittances especially from the countries o f the Middle
East, and a further deterioration in the world economy and international financial markets could
weaken the export sector, reduce household transfers, lower capital inflows, limit economic
growth and reduce flexibility for policy reforms. Owing to these reasons, the external imbalances
may continue to widen despite the short-term measures taken. On the internal side, the inability
o f Government to restore fiscal and external balance as agreed could reduce business and
consumer confidence. This could cause a fundamental shift in market expectations and a loss o f
confidence at home and abroad, leading to a sudden reversal o f financial assets held in Pakistan's
stock and bond markets.      This could generate a vicious cycle between weakening financial
markets, stalling economic activity, and a worsening fiscal position. The IMF Stand-By
Arrangement will mitigate these risks by committing the authorities to fiscal and current account
deficit targets.

164.     Implementation risks: A successful implementation o f the reforms will be critical for an
effective safety net system. Among the risk factors that would influence reform implementation
performance are (i)the low administrative capacity o f BISP, which is a newly established
organization; (ii)continued enrollments to BISP under the old system; (iii)over-ambitious and
unrealistic roll out o f the safety net system, which would have negative implications on the
quality o f program implementation; (iv) inadequate financing o f the program that could result in
insufficient coverage o f the poor; (v) delays in funds release to safety net programs arising from
the current fiscal crunch and the need to reprioritize public spending; (vi) fraud and corruption
that could undermine the ability o f the program to deliver benefits to the poor in circumstances o f
weak internal controls; and (vii) transition to a new targeting system, which may lead to
dissatisfaction from beneficiaries o f the old system who no longer qualify for the benefit. The
mitigating factors are (i)Bank supported technical assistance to build capacity for the
implementation o f the reform program; (ii)roll out o f the new targeting system with a strong
M&E component to demonstrate its effectiveness; (iii)the use of a pilot enrollment phase to fine
tune and adjust program parameters prior to a national roll out; (iv) Government's strong
commitment to establishing and implementing a modern safety net system as evidenced by its
adoption o f an objective national targeting system; (v) the establishment o f separate agencies for
data collection, eligibility determination and benefit payments; (vi) the institution of special

Generalof Pakistan as well as regular operational audits by third parties; and (vii) the institution
ofan appeals mechanism andprocessevaluations of the targetingprocessduringthe test phase.

                                             Letter o f Development Policy


    Dear Mr. Zoellick,

    1.       I am writing to request,on behalfo f the Government o f the Islamic Republic o f Pakistan
    (Government) for the Pakistan Social Safety Net Development Policy Credit (SSN DPC), of USD 200
    million to support inclusive economic growth in Pakistan through establishing a national social safety net
    system that is fiscally sustainable and provides the chronic and transient poor with basic income support
    and access to opportunities for graduating from poverty. This letter o f Development Policy sets out the
    Government's key social safety nets policy actions that are consistent with the National Social Protection
    Strategy (NSPS, 2007) and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP I,2003 and PRSP 11, 2009), to
    be supported by the SSN DPC for 2009/10.

    2.       Pakistan faced both external and internal shocks in the past year. External shocks include the
    sharp rise in international oil and food commodity prices and the slowdown in the global economy, while
    internal shocks include the rapid rise in macro-economic imbalances and the increasing political turmoil.
    These shocks have dampened growth prospects and are likely to reverse recent gains in poverty reduction,
    imposing hardship on the poorest and most vulnerable households. Pakistan's ability to help the poor cope
    with these shocks is limited because the country's safety net programs suffer from several weaknesses
    including infer alia, limited outreach, weak administration, low financing, and inadequate benefits. Poor
    governance and accountability mechanisms and the absence of an effective and transparent targeting
    mechanism have also impeded the quality and efficiency o f benefit delivery.

    3.       Recognizing the need to provide immediate support to pow families, and the fragmentation and
    ineffectiveness o f existing safety net programs, the Government launched thc Benazir Income Support
    Program (BISP) in 2008 as Pakistan's main social safety net system. The short term objective o f the
    program is to cushion the adverse impact of the food, fuel, and financial crises on the poor, but its broader
   objective is to meet the re-distributive goals o f the country by providing a minimum income support
    package to the chronic poor and those who are highly vulnerable to future shocks. The program will
   provide cash transfers of Rs.lOOO [%12] per month to the eligible families and is expected to cover 3.4
   million families in 2008/2009.' Further expansion of coverage and funding is planned for FY2009/10 and
   2010/11.

   4.        The Government is committed to develop a modern social safety net system, as the first step in
   developing a viable social protection program for the country. Our strong commitment to the safety net
   reform agenda is evident from the rapid introduction o f the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) to
   address chronic poverty and to protect the poor from the adverse impacts o f the recent global economic
   crisis. Our commitments to the safety net reform agenda is evident from the increase in safety net spending


   ' This level of coverage is approximately equal to about 25 percent of the population-around the 2005106 national poverty
   headcount rate-according to the most recent estimates.

                                                                                                                          1




                                                          54

from 0.3 to 0.6 percent o f GDP. We expect to further iiicrease spending to nearly 0.9 percent o f GDP in
the comingyear. The formal adoption of the poverty scorecard as an objective instrument to identify safety
net beneficiaries shows our Government's commitment to ensure that increased safety net expenditures
transparently and effectively reach the poor.

5.       It is now important to transform the BISP into a modern well administered and targeted social
safety net system. In meeting this objective, we aim to achieve the following overall outcomes by the end
of 2010: (i)increase in the share o f beneficiaries enrolled in the BISP program using the new targeting
mechanism from 0 to at least 30 percent oftotal beneficiaries; (ii)increase in program applicants receiving
a response   011 whether they qualify for the program within 3 months from scorecard form submission,
from 0 to at least 50 percent o f total applicants; (iii)increase in benefit payments audited from 0 percent to
at least 50 percent of total payments, under the new payment system and improvement in reconciliation
time lag from the present indefinite period to 2 months; and (iv) Increase in percentage o f participating
(poverty-scorecard) districts in which beneficiary lists are publicly available, from 0 to at least 30 percent.

6.        Our reform plans to reach these outcomes are reflected in the following three main pillars: (I)
improving the targeting efficiency of the safety net programs; (11) establishing an effective institutional
framework for safety nets program implementation; and (111) enhancing fiscal sustainability and
strengthening the fiduciary environment. These reform areas are outlined in the following paragraphs.

I. ImprovingtheTargetingEfficiencyofSafetyNetPrograms

As noted above, as a first step in developing a viable social protection program for the country we have
adopted the poverty scorecard as our national targeting instrument. To implement the poverty scorecard,
we have established a national iargeting sysiem IO implement the poverry scorecard method, through
coniracting of separate agenciesfor scorecard data colleciion and eligibility determination. To ensure
sound governance, the targeting system will separate the enrollment of beneficiaries from the
determination of their eligibility for the BISP. To this end, we will select a separate agency/ agencies for
national data collection for the poverty score card. This selection will be based on clear selection criteria,
provided in the targeting manual o f BISP. The rationale for selecting partner organizations is to capitalize
on their outreach and ability to galvanize the community to apply for the program. We have also selected a
separate institution for the processingo f the poverty scorecard data for eligibility determination once it has
been collected, including the provision of CNICs to eligible families in a coordinated manner. The
agencies for poverty scorecard data collection will be required to transfer the scorecard information to this
entity who will then undertake the data entry, processing, validation, o f the list for determining their
eligibility to the program. Based on the eligibility thresholds, this entity will determine and transfer the
final list of eligible beneficiaries to a separate payment agency for delivery o f benefit to eligible
households. To prepare for the nationwide rollout o f above processes, ihe BISP shall complete /he
collection ofpoverry scorecard information in ai least eigh! (8) disiricts und transmit such injormaiion to
the dataprocessing agency.

Given that the Government is committed to rolling out the poverty scorecard based targeting system at the
earliest, a policy decision for beneficiaries in the old targeting system will need to be taken. We huve
therefore taken a policy decision on ihe iransition of BISP enrollees under [he parliamentarian based
system to the new system. Specifically, our decision is to discontinue benefits of the existing beneficiaries
of the old system  flthey  do not complete the scorecard form or qualib under the new targeting system.
This decision will be implemenied as the poverry scorecard iargering system is sequentially rolled out in
various districts. To address the social costs of the transition, based on the results of the test phase, we

                                                                                                              2




                                                55

will adopt a policyfor transitioningBISP enroleesfr.omparliamentarian based selection system topoverty
scorecard based system. Thispolicy will provide, interalia, the grievance redressal mechanisms, definition
of cut-off ointfor eligibili&j and communications strategy.

9.       In order to closely monitor the implementation of the test phase of the targeting process, we have
udopred efective mechanisms to ensure the qualiry of data collection for the test phase of poverty
scorecard based targeting process. First, Partner Organizations will be required to establish a cascade
system for the supervision of the data collection as outlined in the targeting guidelines. Second, a process
evaluation for the test phase will provide insights into the adherence of data collection institutions to the
established processes. Third, BISP will receive timely information from third party random spot checks
on the quality of the data collection by the Partner Organizations. The results from these spot checks will
be communicated to BISP management and the Partner Organizations to ensure learning and mid-course
correction if necessary.The spot checks will also suggest a threshold level for errors on the basiso f which
the area can be re-surveyed for improving the quality of data. This policy will be critical for helping to
ensure that exclusion and inclusion errors under the new system are reduced.

 IO.     Over the medium term, we will finalize the institutional policy arrangements for enrolling
beneficiaries for the nationwide rollout based on test phase results, taking into account their performance.
Based on this institutional arrangement, the score card enrollment will be rolled-out nationwide (at least
80% of districts in the country). In the medium term, the spot checks for monitoring the quality of
scorecard roll out and ensure mid-course correction will be taken; and appeals emanating from the
scorecard based selection will be addressed to minimize inclusion and exclusion errors. Policy decisions
regarding the long term enrollment process will also be taken, including whether to make enrollments
open or closed; and whether to collect information via a census approach or atargeting center approach.

11.      Establishing the Institutional framework for Safety Net Implementation

II.      BISP was originally established to be headed by a National Program Coordinator under the
Ministry of Finance. A National Steering Committee headed by the Minister for Finance was also
established at the same time. Later in 2008, the Program was transferred to the Cabinet Division and a
Special Secretary was appointed along with a National Program Coordinator. Moreover, the Special
Secretary was declared as the Principal Accounting Officer with all administrative and financial powers as
given in the Rules of Businessof Pakistan for Federal Secretary, in charge of a Division. Special Secretary
was later replaced by the Managing Director enjoying the same powers as o f a Federal Secretary. Thus,
BISP remains a temporary institutional arrangement compromising its governance and administrative
efficiency, and a more formal institutional arrangement for,the agency is required to minimize political
interference and ensure sound governance and effective program implementation. Such an arrangement
would also allow fragmented safety net prograins to be consolidated and rationalized under one platform
and through one agency, resulting in more consistent safety net policy formulation and improvements in
targeting and administrative efficiency of safety net spending. Recognizing the need for a more formal
institutional arrangement, we have estublished BISP as an autononious stalutory safety net author@ to
implement sajety nets programs by promulgating a legal ordinance with: (i) clear financial and
admintrtrative uutononiy; and lii) distinction in roles ofthe Bourd, the Chairperson und the Secretaryfor
the oversight and niariugenient ofprogram implenientation

12.      The successful administration of the BISP requires transparent and accountable administrative
policy guidelines for the effective, coordinated, and efficient delivery of income support to eligible
beneficiaries. We have adopted administrative policy guidelines for               effective BISP program

                                                                                                           3

implenientaiion.    These guidelines contained in the program Operational Manual includes detailed
operational and implementation provisions for the roles and responsibilities o f all implementation partners
(BISP, MOF, Planning Commission, Pakistan Post, Partner Organisations for enrolment and for eligibility
determination, provincial and local governments, beneficiary households.) as well as modalities for
implementation, As the program rolls out, the Manual will be further elaborated on key processes such as
targeting, enrolment, payments, organisational structure, staffing, and monitoring and evaluation
arrangement, as well as fiduciary rules governing the program. .

13.      Pakistan's National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) was prepared through a consultative
process under the leadership of the Planning Commission and approved by the cabinet in 2007. Even
though the general framework provided in the NSPS is consistent with the social safety net reforms
currently being introduced by the new government, it is important to revise the strategy document to
reflect the latest policy developments and institutional arrangements. We have initiaied ihe updaie of the
Naiional Social Proieciion Strategy (NSPS) to include program raiionalizaiion and esfabhhed the
insiiiutionalfiameworkfor enhancedcoordination and delivery of socialproiectionprogranis.

14.      The government intends to make BlSP the central safety net program of the country. However,
given that the Pakistan Bait-ul Mal (PBM) is also a federal safety net agency that administers a similar
cash transfer program, a policy decision was required to clarify its future role especially regarding the
administration of its unconditional cash transfer program i.e. Food Support Program (FSP) vis-a-vis BISP.
We have adopted apolicy io remove overlapping niandatev of BISP and PBM in delivering uncondiiional
cash iramfer programs. The policy will require PBM to discontinue the FSP in order to remove its
duplication with BISP. However, the PBM will continue to implement the CSP (CCT) pilot until its
successfulcompletion and evaluation.

15.      We believe that a key issue in program design and implementation is to ensure that the safety net
program does not induce benefit dependency; but rather facilitates the graduation o f beneficiaries from
poverty status. As the first step in this process, and in an effort to reduce inter-generational poverty, we
have expanded the Child Suppori Program (a CCT pilot), using ihe poveriy score curd based iargeiing
nwthocl. A rapid assessment of this pilot program in 3 districts indicated, inter alia, the need to increase the
CSP payment amount and to improve better coordinate with Provincial Education Departmentsduring the
implementation of the program. The targeting inethod used in the pilot will also change to the new poverty
card based targeting instrument. The evaluation of this program will inform its feasibility for scaling up to
the national level under the BISP.

16.      In the medium term, we will consolidate select federal safety net programs under the safety net
authority adopted by federal cabinet, in a manner that is consistent with the revised National Social
Protection Strategy. `To be effective in implementing programs the agency will be staffed with qualified
professionals at the federal, provincial and divisional levels in accordance with the Organizational
Struclure outlined in the BlSP Operational Manual. As monitoring and evaluation results become
available, a wide dissemination of these will ensure a broad based debate about the effectiveness of the
BISP in providing basic income support to the poor. Finally, the BlSP will be modified to ensure that
program beneficiaries are able to access selected human development services (e.6.             health/nutrition.
education, training) and selectedkxisting activation programs (e.g. skill development. income generation,
employment, cash for work) to promote exit from poverty. In particular the results from the CCT pilot will
be used to assess how the BISP and PBM can coordinate their programs to ensure better human
development outcomes among the poor.

111.    Enhancing Fiscal Sustainability and Strengthening the Fiduciary Environment

17.     Compared to other countries in the region, the social safety net spending in Pakistan was quite low
and declining in recent years, To ensure that we are able to provide adequate and financially sustainable
benefit to households, the BISP budget allocation for FY08/09 is consistent with medium term
macroeconomicframework and udeyuate top q the agreed benefit amount to at least 3.4 mi1lionjunilie.r.
This will increaseour safety net spending from 0.3 to 0.6 percent o f GDP.

18.       Aside from providing adequate resources for the program, we believe it is vital to ensure that
benefit expenditures reach eligible groups transparently and in a timely manner. As a first step in this
process, we have appointed an independent payment agency (Pakistan Post) and agreedpolicy guidelines
for ensuring timely delivery of payments. The agreement with this agency includes the periodic provision
of eligible list o f beneficiaries by the selected eligibility determination agency to Pakistan Post. According
to the Government policy, the Pakistan post will be required to print money orders and deliver the money
at the door steps to the beneficiaries after verifying their CNICs. Pakistan Post will also maintain a record
o f the delivery of payments and will periodically subinit it to BlSP in a specified format. This data will
then be uploaded in the MIS, with the record of each transaction will serve as the financial management,
reporting and reconciliationmechanism and will allow regular tracking o f payments.

 19.     In order to establish the appropriate procurement procedures in accordance with the federal Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance 2004, the BISP has approved a procurement
procedures manual, which is consistent with international best practice. These procedures will help the
BISP for transparent procurement of goods and services.

20.      Finally. in addition to appointing an independent payment agency, we will take further measures
to ensure that benefit payments reach the poor in a transparent manner and operational funds are
appropriately utilized. To meet this objective, we have adopted independent operational audit
arrangement,r for BISP.         This will include placement o f organizational arrangements for instituting
operational audits, including their functional relationship with the Management Board as well as the
Secretary being the Principal Accounting Officer. The operational audits will include audits o f the
payment system, from the time the post office receives the list to the time when benefit is supposed to be
received by the eligible beneficiary. This exercise will help to identify the constraints to benefit delivery as
well as requisite measures for improving its effectiveness, such as the posting o f beneficiary lists in the
village, coinmunity verification, etc. In order to ensure that the correct beneficiaries of the BlSP safety
nets get the benefits in a timely manner and operational funds are appropriately utilized. the operational
audits will also look into the efficacy o f and transparency in the financial management system. The
findings will enable BlSP not only to meet the program objectives in a transparent manner but also to avert
any financial risks. The above organizational arrangement will also assume the internal audit function to
look into, among others, the entire payment process from generation of the beneficiary list to the receipt of
cash by the eligible beneficiary. This will help to identi@ constraints in benetit delivery and monitoring
mechanisms and recommend solutions. The internal audit will serve as a management tool to enhance
control and accountability mechanisms in BlSP's overall operations.

21.      To provide sustained financiiig Tor the program and expand its coverage, we are planning to
 increase spending on BlSP to nearly 1           percent of GDP in 2009110. In the medium term, fiscal
sustainability will be ensured if budgets to the safety net programs are adequate, with the number o f
families chosen through corresponding cut-off scores (determined in part by making use of the firsUroll-
out phase implementation experience o f the poverty scorecard) to ensure program consistency with the

                                                                                                              5

overall macro-economic framework. To ensure benefit payments are made efficiently, both accurately and
on time, the FM system will be fully functional and FM audit reports regularly available and observations
fully settled. The reconciliation process o f payments will be functional in accordance with the
administrative policy guidelines; the procurement procedures will be fully implemented; and the third
party ex-post review o f sample procurements will have been completed. Over time, however, B[SP
management will evaluate and adopt, if feasible, alternative payment options using modern technology
(e.g. smartcards). Social accountability systems will also be in place and will allow the assessment of
payment processes, which would include, interalia, the publication o f beneficiary lists at the appropriate
sites, systematic oversight by local stakeholders, and a mechanism for complaints and confidential
allegations. Finally, grievance system for payments will be in place to ensure that beneficiaries are able to
obtain their full benefits in a timely fashioii.

22.     In conclusion, Iwould like to reiterate the commitment o f the Government to the country's safety
net reforms as mentioned above, and 1trust that this requestfor World Bank support for implementation of
safety net reforms will receive your favorable consideration.

                     Pakistan-Assessment Letter for the World Bank

                                          March 2,2009

This note provides the IMF s t a f f s assessment of Pakistan's macroeconomic developments
andprospectsas background for the Poverty Reductionand Econonlic Support Operation
policy loan beingconsideredbythe Executive Board o fthe World Bank on March 26. The
assessmenti s basedonthe findings of the February 2009 IMF missionto Islamabadand
Dubai that conductedthe discussions with the Pakistani authorities on the First Review under
the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) andthe 2009 Article I V Consultation.

Recent Developmentsand Performance under the SBA Program

Economic developmentsinPakistansince the SBA was approvedon November 24,2008
have beenfavorable.


        The exchange rate has beenbroadly stable, with the State Bank of Pakistan(SBP)
        intervening on the buying side o fthe interbank foreign exchange market. As a result,
       the international reserves position hasstrengthened signlficantly (gross reserves
        amountedto $6.7 billionon February23).

        There was a strong positive responsefrom the T-bill marketto the 200-basis points
        increaseinthe central bank discount rate inmid-November, allowing the government
       to retire some of its debt to the SBP. T-bill auctionsthrough end-February have been
        consistently oversubscribed, with wide participation of banks, and interest rates on
        T-bills came down from 14percent (weighted average) inmid-Januaryto
        12.98percent at the most recentsession (February 25).

        There has also beena gradual reflow of deposits into the banking system.

        Headline inflation declined markedlyto 20.5 percent in January, due to lower food
        and energy prices, but year-on-yearcore inflation remainshighat 19percent, despite
        a decline inthe month-on-month core inflation rate.

        Inmid-December,the authorities removedthe stockmarket pricefloor which had
        been inplace for 3% months. Subsequently, stock prices dropped sharply, but the
        decline moderatedinearly January. Since then, the markethas fluctuated in line with
        economic prospectsand developments ininternational equity markets.

        All the quantitative performancecriteriathrough end-December2008 were observed.




                                             64

Through December, the budgetregistereda revenueshortfall that was compensated
by expenditure restraint.

Despitethe improved confidence, credit andbroad money growth have beenslower
thanexpected. Specifically, private sectorcredit growth, at 13 percenton an annual
basis, hasbeenlower owing to both lower demandfrom corporates and an increase in
lenders' risk aversion.

Structural conditionality has generally been observed, althoughthere is scopefor
improvement insome areas.

        A contingency plan for handlingproblem private bankshas beenprepared.

        A committee to review the operational autonomy ofthe SBPhas been
        established.

        A tax administration reform planhas beenpreparedwhich compriseskey
       reforms, such as the integrationofthe income tax and sales tax departments
        andthe replacementof the current generalsales tax with a broad-basedVAT.
       The authorities haverequestedtechnical assistance from the Fund to help with
       the design ofthe VAT law, the revisions inthe income tax legislation, and the
       possible introductionof a carbontax.

       Electricity tariffs havebeen reviewed (with the World Bank) and it has been
       agreedthat a 4 percent increase, to be implemented betweenFebruary and
       June, would suffice to reachthe cost recovery level, giventhe recent
       substantialdrop inthe price of furnace oil.

       The SBP has stopped the direct provision of foreign exchange for furnace oil
       on February 1,2009, as agreed under the program.

Progresshas also beenmadetoward the end-March2009 benchmarksunder the
program.

       The fiscal program includes additional spending on the social safety net

       Inlate January, the authorities andthe World Bankagreedonreformingthe
       Benazir Income Support Program and introduce a scorecard for the
       identification o fpoor households.

       The authorities have acceleratedthe preparation of aplan to deal with the
       circular debt issue (inter-corporate debt inthe energy sector).

Outlook

Since the SBA program was agreed in October, the world economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly. This deterioration is likelyto affect Pakistan's economythrough several
channels:


        Domestic activity is likely to be weaker thanoriginally envisaged inthe program.
        Large-scalemanufacturingoutput has dropped, andthere has been a significant
        decline inexports. Preliminary projections for agricultural output in2008/09 show
        that increasesinrice and cotton crops, andthe prospects of a large wheat crop, would
        offset a decline insugar cane production.

        Lower activity is having an adverse impact on fiscal revenue.

        Falling food andenergy prices andthe lower economic activity should continue to
        exert downwardpressure on headline inflation. Under conservative assumptions,
        year-on-yearheadline inflation would declineto 10percentby end-2008/09
        (comparedwith 20 percent inthe program), andto 6% percentby end-2009110.

        The external current account has also improved, but the outlook is fragile owing to
        the recent decline inexports. The projected outcome for the external current account
        through end-2008109 is slightly betterthan envisaged inthe programbecause a
        marked decline inimports is expectedto outweigh the weaker export performance.
        The financial account surplus is now expected to be somewhat lower than originally
        projected, due mainlyto lower thanenvisagedinflows of private capital. The overall
        external balance for 2008109 is now projected to be better than programmed by about
        $500 million. This outlook, however, is subjectto significant downside risks,
        especially ifthe drop in exports continuesandremittances decline.

Key Challenges and Policy Issues

As noted above, the downturn inthe world economyposes significant downside risksto
economic activity andthe externalposition. The authorities recognizethat, given financing
constraints, the scope for countercyclical policies is limitedandthat consolidating economic
andfinancial stability remainsthe principal challengefacedby the authorities. The fiscal
program andthe monetary policy stance remainthe key policytools to consolidate stability.


        The fiscal outlook for the remainder of 2008/09 i s likely to be affected by shortfalls in
        revenue andforeign budgetfinancing. The authorities remaincommittedto the
        program target of a deficit of Rs. 562 billion, equivalent to 4.3 percent ofthe revised
        GDPfor 2008109.The tax revenue shortfall is expectedto bepartly offset by higher
        collections from the Petroleum Development Levy, as well as stepped-up auditing,
        andthe authorities are committed to restraining expenditures, as needed, to achieve




                                              66

                                              4


        the budget deficit target. Externalbudgetfinancing in2008/09 is now projectedto he
        lower than expected, mainly reflecting a shortfall inexternal privatization proceeds.

        Pakistanneeds additional external resourcesinorder to create fiscal space for higher
        development and social spending. A donor conference, tentatively scheduledfor
        March'April2009, will provide an opportunityto seek additional external assistance.

        The cumulative 500-basis points discount rate hike in 2008 has resulted intighter
        monetary conditions. As inflation remainselevated, it is premature at this stage to
        reduce interest rates, but rates may be lowered later inthe year, provided that
        inflationcontinuesto decline andthe government avoids SBP financing of the
        budget.

        The exchange rate should remain flexible, with market interventionlargely aimed at
        meetingthe international reserves targets.

        Pakistan's banks have weatheredthe crisis well so far, but there are increasing risks
        fromthe deteriorating economic outlook. Non-performing loanshave risen to 9.1
        percent in December2008, from 7.7percent inJune. Stress tests by the FSAP update
        mission and by the authorities show that the a deterioration incredit quality is the
        mainrisk.Accordingly, the authorities needto continue to monitor developments in
        the bankingsystem very closely.

Medium-term outlook

A significant increase inrevenues as ashare o f GDP remainsthe cornerstoneofthe
medium-ternframework, but the economic downturn has ledto a revision ofthe
medium-term pathfor fiscal and external adjustment.Growth is projected to recover
gradually to 4.0 percent next year and 7.0 percentby 2013114.Headline inflation is expected
to decline rapidly to 6% percent by 2009/10. The external current account deficit is envisaged
to narrow to 4% percent of GDP in 2009/10 andto decline further to more sustainable levels
by 2013114. A significant increase inthe revenue-to-GDP ratio will create fiscal space for
higherpublic investment andsustainable growth. However, the roomfor increasingthe
public investment-to-GDP ratio may be more limited than previously assessed, as there is a
needto ensure that the outlook allows for an adequate increase inoutlays on poverty
reduction.

Status of IMFRelations

As noted, a SDR 5.169 billion ($7.6 billion) SBA was approved onNovember 24, 2008. The
staff hasjust completed the discussions on the First Review of the SBA and the 2009
Article IV Consultation, which are scheduledto be consideredby the IMFExecutive Board
inlate-March 2009.

I. PovertyScorecardSystemanditsRationale

 1.      A poverty scorecard is a targetingtool that includes a limited number o f simple indicators
that correlate well with poverty along with an intuitive scoring system that helps identify program
eligibility. The poverty scorecard for Pakistan's social safety nets programs i s marked by two
main characteristics: a "Proxy Means Testing" approach to improve targeting performance and
ease o f implernentati~n.~~

2.       Adoption of the "Proxy Means Testing'' approach to ensure targeting performance: The
poverty scorecard for the BISP follows the "Proxy Means Testing" method in ensuring good
targeting performance. A challenge in designing a scorecard is to make the resulting scores
accurately reflect the attributes o f households or families that a program aims to address, e.g.,
poverty. The "Proxy Means Testing" method determines program eligibility based on a predictor
o f household income or welfare that is created from a set o f typical proxies o f household welfare,
like household demographics, housing conditions, and ownership o f durable assets. The
assumption behind this methodology is that collecting direct measures o f household welfare like
income is vulnerable to misreporting whereas measuring consumption is very painstaking and
costly. Instead, the proxy means testing method relies on the proxies o f household welfare that
can be easily collected and verified.


3.       The "Proxy Means Testing" method not only produces a good predictor o f household
welfare but also provides various statistical assessments o f the targeting performance o f the
welfare predictor. Any targeting mechanism, including a proxy means test, necessarily involves
some targeting errors which lead to the exclusion o f some inthe target group and the inclusion of
some who are not in the target group. It is important for program providers to assess ex ante the
extent o f such mis-targeting, and to select the proxies o f household welfare that minimize
targeting errors. The "Proxy Means Testing" method i s a valuable tool because it provides a
detailed ex ante assessment o f program coverage and targeting performance. The poverty
scorecard for Pakistan, developed by utilizing various rounds of existing household surveys, is no
exception. It ensures checks and balances that the data affords to minimize targeting errors ex
ante, especially exclusion o f the poorest 20 percent o fthe population.


4.       Ease of implementation: The poverty scorecard form contains only twelve questions,
most o f which require a simple yesho answer, or the selection o f one answer from a set o f simple
choices, which not only makes it easy to train program implementers to accurately collect the
requisite data, but also make it relatively cheap to do so. In addition, the poverty scorecard only
includes information that i s easily verifiable and this makes it much easier to address complaints
or carry out audits. Households are identified as eligible for a program if their scores are below a
cutoff score set by the program provider. The simplicity and verifiability o f the scorecard
approach minimizes the implementation costs and improves the quality o f data collection.

11. Developing a Scorecard for Pakistan

5.        This section describes how the poverty scorecard for Pakistan was developed based on
the proxy means testing method. It required the following steps: (i)         selection o f a proper dataset,
(ii)selectionofanindicatorforhouseholdwelfare, (iii)           selection o f a group o f poverty correlates,
(iv) selection o f a regression model, and (v) conversion o f regression coefficients to a simple
scoring system.

Data Sets

6.        The data used for this exercise i s the Pakistan Living Standard Measurement Survey
(PSLM), conducted by the Federal Bureau o f Statistics in 2005-06. This i s a multi-topic
household survey, with modules on consumption, income, employment, health, education, and
living conditions. The PSLM 2005-06 covered around 15,000 households drawn from four major
provinces o f Pakistan and was designed to be representative at the national and provincial levels.
For several reasons, the PSLM 2005-06 appears to be well suited to the purpose o f developing a
scorecard following the Proxy Means Testing approach. First, it has rich and detailed information
on household and individual characteristics that are correlates of poverty. Second, the PSLM
2005-06 data are representative at the national level, which enables one to estimate key program
statistics like program coverage, program leakage, and budgetary needs. Third, this dataset i s
used for estimating the official poverty headcount rates o f 2005-06 making it easy to check what
percentage o f the poor defined in the official estimation will be identified by the poverty
scorecard.

Selecting an indicator for household welfare

7.        Household consumption expenditure (monthly) per adult equivalent i s chosen as the
welfare measure. The same measure is used for producing the official poverty estimates in
Pakistan; therefore, it i s easy to identify the poor. Household expenditure includes all
expenditures on non-durables, the imputed value o f non-durables received as gifts or produced in
the household, while it excludes expenditures on durable goods and assets.

8.        Inthe economic development literature, consumptionexpenditure is generally considered
a more accurate measure o f welfare than income for several reasons (see Deaton 1997). First,
because consumption expenditures tend to be less variable than income over seasons, it is more
likely to indicate the household's "true" economic status (as a result o f households with sporadic
incomes smoothing their consumption patterns over time). Second, in practice, consumption i s
generally measured with far greater accuracy than income in a household survey. For example,
households' sources o f income may include home-based production, own farms and businesses.
Calculating the flow o f net incomes from these sources turn out to be a big problem since the
flow o f costs and returns from these activities are often inaccurately reported by households.

Choice of Poverty Predictors

9.        Selection o f variables to predict welfare as measured by per capita consumption should
take into account two separate criteria: correlation between the welfare measure (consumption)
and the predictor, which will determine accuracy o f the prediction, and veriJiabiZity o f the
predictor, which will determine the accuracy o f information used to impute welfare. The types o f
predictors used for this exercise, discussed below, were arrived at after judging all possible
predictors on the basis o f these two criteria.35


35The list of all variables is available inTable A-1 inAnnex.


                                                          70

 10.      Household and individual characteristics, such as the number o f members and
dependents, and the age, education and occupation o f the household head, as well as the
education o f children, not only strongly correlate with consumption levels they are relatively easy
to verify and are less likely to be misreported.

 11.      Ownership o f durable goods and housing characteristics: These variables are verifiable
by inspection. However they can be misrepresented if a household removes the goods from its
home during an expected visit by the social worker, which is easier to do with small or mobile
items than with larger items such as stoves or refrigerators. The general presumption in the
literature is that people are more willing to misreport ownership o f such items as opposed to
household characteristics. Nevertheless, these variables tend to have high predictive power for
welfare, and therefore including them should reduce mis-targetingsubstantially.

 12.      Ownership o f productive assets, especially land holding, livestock and farm equipment i s
critical to proxy the welfare status o f rural households. Verifiability o f these variables i s
reasonably high. For example, even for a variable like land ownership, which may not be
measured perfectly, one can reasonably expect that program officers belonging to the community
would be able to deter misreporting using local knowledge.


Selection of a regression model

13.       While each variable listed above is already a good poverty predictor, a combination o f
them can be an even more powerful predictor o f poverty. However, combining them i s not a
simple task and combining variables in an arbitrary way can produce a worse predictor o f
poverty. For example, some welfare programs simply count the number o f poverty predictors
satisfied by a household and use that as a score to identify whether the household is poor or not.
There is no guarantee that the resulting score is a better predictor o f poverty than a single variable
is.

14.      Inthe Proxy Means Testing approach, the OLS regression method is used to find a good
combination o f variables in predicting poverty. The OLS method regresses the consumption
variable (household expenditure per adult equivalent in the case o f Pakistan) on various sets o f
variables listed above. Predicted values from a regression model are by construction better
proxies of poverty than any single variable included in the regression model. The main task here
i s to find a regression model from many possible combinations of variables based on a set o f
criteria.

Conversion of the regression coefficients to scores

15.      Once the preferred regression model i s determined, the predicted value i s a good proxy
for household expenditure per adult equivalent. However, the predicted value is not necessarily
intuitive and easily processed for implementation. To simplify the calculation o f scores, the
predicted values were normalized so that all scores are integers ranging between 0 and 100. To
minimize the risk of reversing the ranking, this normalization was made by first revising
regression coefficients o f all variables proportionally andthen rounding them.

111.     FinalProxy Means Testing Formula (PMTF)and a Poverty Scorecard

16.      Usingthe latest Pakistan Social Livingand Measurement Standard Survey (PSLM 2005-
06) data, a final model was chosen from the regression analysis, which has the relatively high R-


                                                  71

square but low exclusion and inclusion errors. Annex 4-Table 1 indicates the regression results o f
the final model. Consistent with the standard literature on poverty diagnostics, the predictors
include the number o f dependents, the educational attainment o f household head, children's
enrollment status, and housing conditions and asset ownership etc. The scorecard i s prepared by
converting regression coefficients in the final model to certain points so that predicted values o f
household expenditure take integers between 0 and 100. Annex 4- Table2 shows the final
coverage page and the scorecard questionnaires.

 17.      Figure 1 provides the coverage rate o f the chosen poverty scorecard by expenditure
deciles. At a coverage rate o f 25%, the excluded among the poor are far more likely to belong to
the upper deciles o f expenditure while over 60 percent o f the poorest 10 percent o f population are
selected.

constraint, program coverage and
budgetary       needs    in terms       of
"families"    are estimated for each
score. Annex 4 -Table 3 summarizes
the results. All calculations are based           Source: The World Bank staff estimationusing PSLM 2005-06 data
on estimated population as of 2008-
09. The estimated number o f families per household is derived usingthe PSLM 2005-06 data.36
Additionally, it is assumed that the benefit amount per family i s Rs. 1,000 per month.

20.       Ifthe cutoff score of 14 were chosen, 13.3 percent of all families in Pakistan would be
selected as beneficiaries and the budgetary needs would be Rs. 56.8 billion. This cutoff o f 14 is
roughly consistent with GoP's current intention to cover 5 million families in the coming fiscal
year. On the other hand, if the cutoff were raised to 17, program coverage would include 19.8
percent o f families and the estimated budgetary needs would be Rs. 84.6 billion. The cutoff score
o f 17 comes closest to covering 25 percent o f the population which is the national poverty
headcount rate (according to most recent estimate^)^^.



36According to PSLM 2005-06 data, there are on average around 1.47 families ina household.The number
o f families in a household is approximated by the number of ever married women (including widows or
divorced) in ahousehold. With the population estimate of 2008-09 (164 million) and the averagehousehold
size of 6.8, the total numbers of households and families in 2008-09 are estimated to be 24.1 million and
35.6 million, respectively. This meansthe proposedbudgetallocation can cover 16 percent of families.
37 The current scoring system from 1-100 does not easily allow for meeting exact goals like for example
targeting 5 million families. The closest cut off score is 14 with coverage of 4.73 million families.
However, this scoring system can be easily adjusted to accommodate a more precise coverage of five
millionfamilies, ifthat were the target number of beneficiaries for BISP.

V.       Monitoringand Evaluation

21.      The poverty-scorecard based targeting mechanism will be monitored and evaluated
through (i)an integrated Management Information System; (ii)financial management and
auditing arrangements; (iii) procurement arrangements; (iv) appeals and complaint mechanisms;
(v) social accountability mechanisms; (vi) the role and use o f impact and other forms of
evaluation. Since these monitoring mechanisms are described in detail by the proposed Social
Safety Nets Technical Assistance Project Appraisal Document, this section will only outline the
impact evaluation arrangements.

22.      The impact evaluation will focus on displaying the effects o f the cash transfers on the
socioeconomic conditions o f the beneficiary families such as food and non-food consumption,
and potentially on a number o f human development indicators such as school enrollment and
attendance, health outcomes, and child labor. Given that the cash transfer i s provided to the
female head o f the beneficiary families, the evaluation will also assess the impact o f BISP on
women's perceived and actual social status. Inaddition, the targeting performance o f the poverty-
scorecard will be re-assessed.

23.      The evaluation is structured in two phases: the first phase focuses on evaluation of the
test phase, mainly on the implementation process, scorecard effectiveness and the spot checks.
The second phase focuses on the impact evaluation o f BISP through a combination o f quantitative
and qualitative instruments.

Phase I:Evaluation of the Test Phase

Process Evaluation of the targeting test phase

24.      The process assessment has three main objectives: (i)to evaluate the consistency of
activities o f the poverty scorecard test phase with what has been specified in the targeting
manual; (ii)to evaluate the efficiency and transparency o f the payment process, and (iii)to
evaluate whether the data entry, data quality verification, data formatting and report generation in
accordance with the targeting guidelines. The main methods for this evaluation include direct
observation, individual interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group interviews.

Assessment of the scorecard effectiveness

25.      The poverty scorecard is developed using the most recent household survey data (PSLM
2005-06), which unavoidably bears statistical errors. The main purpose o f this evaluation
component is to assess the effectiveness o f the scorecard by comparing the relative score
distribution versus the actual consumption distribution. That is, for a sample o f households, both
the scorecard data and actual consumption data are to be collected. The relative score distribution
against the national representative scorecard distribution is to be compared with the relative
consumptiondistribution against the national representative consumption distribution.

26.      There are a couple o f data sources that will be used for this assessment. The first is the
up-coming PSLM 2007-2008 data, which contain both scorecard and consumption information in
a national representative sample (the sample size is about 16,000 households); the second i s a
rapid assessment o f the overlap between the existing BISP beneficiaries and the poverty
scorecard-based beneficiaries (the sample size is about 2,500 households); and the third is a
follow-up study plannedto assess the impact o f the food crisis and financial crisis on households
(sample size is about 4,000), which also contains the scorecard and the full consumption
information.


                                                73

Spot Checks

27.      The "spot-checks"    (or "operational"    audits) are at the initial stages o f program
implementation mainly used to evaluate whether the data collected on the poverty scorecard is
accurate. This objective will be achieved by re-visiting a sample o f randomly selected families
and re-collecting the same information that has been collected in the poverty scorecard and
comparing it with respect to results provided by Partner Organizations and NADRA. Ifdifference
exists, causes are to be investigated and the data collection in the problematic villages/Union
Councils (UCs) i s to be repeated.

Qualitative Survey to Identify the PotentialAreas of Focus for the Cash Transfer Impact
Evaluation

28.      This activity is designed to collect qualitative information on how the families are
planning to use the additional income provided by BISP and how the additional income can
potentially alter households' behaviors in order to better understand the outcomes o f the BISP.
These areas include (increased) consumption on some items, (increased) savings, (increased)
investment in productive assets, preferences to send children to school or work, women's social
status, labor participation, and others. The collected qualitative information would be used to
develop the questionnaires for the program impact evaluation.

Phase11: ImuactEvaluationof BISP

29.      For the BISP program, a full-fledged impact evaluation would be carried out, benefiting
from the gradual roll out at the national level. The impact evaluation study will assess how cash
transfers affect food expenditure, education and nutrition outcomes, child labor supply as well as
women's social status. The evaluation would include a baseline survey (between targeting and
payment) and at least two follow up surveys to build a panel dataset on the same households to
assess the impact o f the program in the medium and long term. The follow-up survey should be
carried out ideally twice a year in order to capture the seasonality effects on consumptionbut the
frequency o f the follow-up surveys i s contingent on the availability o f the financial resources and
institutional capacity.

30.      Decisions are yet to be made by the government whether the national rollout could be a
randomizedprocess. Ifthe rollout is to be a randomized process, it should be at the U C level and
this randomization will guide the national rollout - the UCs in the treatment group should be
rolled out first, followed up with UCs in the control group. In both treatment and control groups,
a random sample from beneficiary families and non-beneficiary families that are right above the
cut-off score will be selected. If the rollout i s constrained by various factors and can not be a
randomizationprocess, matching technique has to be used to identify a control group in the later-
enrolled UCddistricts which are as similar as possible to the selected beneficiary families in the
earlier-enrolled UC/districts. Alternatively, the impact evaluation has to rely on the regression
discontinuity design: comparing beneficiaries' right below the cut-off point and non-beneficiaries
rightabove the cut-off point.

31.      Thus the first and preferred option is to use a randomized experiment with treatment
group being enrolled first and control group being enrolled later. The assumption is that families
in the treatment group and control group are similar in both observed characteristics and
unobserved characteristics. Direct comparison o f the outcome indicators between the treatment
and control groups renders the average program treatment effect. The second option is to use a
Regression Discontinuity (RD) technique. Targeting by proxy means test generates exogenous
thresholds that discriminate between eligible and non-eligible households. Identification in the


                                                 74

RD settings stems from the assumption that the un-observables o f those who were barely
excluded from the program are similar to those o f individuals who were barely accepted.
Comparing a sample o f individuals within a very small range around the cutoff score is analogous
to conducting a randomized experiment at the cut-off score (quasi-experimental design). The
regression discontinuity methodology identifies the treatment effect locally, i.e., identification
stems from the discontinuity around the exogenous cut-off point, thus might have limited
implications on the overall program effects. The third option is to use a matching technique to
match beneficiary families enrolled later and beneficiaries enrolled earlier if randomization
becomes unfeasible. Various matching techniques are available, such as non-parametric matching
and propensity score matching. A key assumption for the matching technique is that if families
are similar based on a vector of observed characteristics, families are likely to be similar in
unobserved characteristics.
