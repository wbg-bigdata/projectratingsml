              adequately to the challenges posed by the crisis.

   PROPOSEDPRIVATE AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOANTO
                                  REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document presents the first in the series o f up to three Programmatic
Private and Financial Development Policy Loans (PFDPLs) to the Republic o f Serbia to
support the government's structural reform program. The proposed operation i s inthe amount
of Euro 34.9 million (US$50 million equivalent).

2.      The objective o f the proposed PFDPLs is to support three policy areas: (i)further
improve the business environment to encourage new business and to attract foreign direct
investments (FDI); (ii) strengthen financial discipline by enhancing hard budget constraints in
the enterprise sector through privatization or bankruptcy, o f large SOEs, and the restructuring
o f public utilities; and (iii)build a more efficient and stable financial sector through
continuing the divestment of state ownership inthe banking and insurance sectors, enhancing
prudential supervision of bankingand encouraging development of the capital markets.

3.      The proposed PFDPL stream i s fully in line with the goals o f the World Bank
Group's assistance to the Government of Serbia (Government or GoS), as outlined in the
recently adopted FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), one o f the key areas of which
includes encouraging dynamic private sector led growth to ensure incomes convergence with
European levels.

4.      The PFDPL i s designed to support the government in advancing its financial and
private sector related reforms. This PFDPL series builds on the reforms initiated under the
earlier Bank-supported operations, such as the three prior private and financial sector
adjustment credits (PFSAC-I, PFSAC-I1and PPFDPC-I) and the structural adjustment credits
(SAC and SAC-11). It i s envisioned to be complemented by another DPL operation aimed at
supporting Serbia's Public Expenditure Management. The policy actions set in the PFDPL
program will largely conclude the era of fast-track transition reforms in private and financial
sectors of the Serbian economy. The private and financial sector reforms outside the PFDPL
context will require a shift from immediate, near-term needs to medium- and longer-term
results.

RECENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSINSERBIA
5.       The economy has grown strongly in recent years, following significant economic
changes since 2000. In spite o f a drought, real GDP growth in 2007 reached 7.5 percent, the
second highest since the start of the transition. Non-agricultural growth averaged 7.6 percent
over the past three years, driven by the services sector which has been growing at double digit
rates (inparticular trade, financial services and transport and telecommunication). Output has
risen by nearly 50 percent since 2000, as the corporate sector started to post profits and the
banking sector was restructured. The positive supply response also appears to reflect increases
in productivity and output of recently privatized and de novo firms, as evidenced by the
particularly rapid rates of output growth in precisely those sectors which have recently
undergone extensive privatization (e.g., steel, cement, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar, and
banking) or attracted foreign investors.

6.       Rapid growth during 2005-07 has been led by aggregate demand. Overall investment
levels have remainedroughly constant in recent years, and slightly increased to 24.4 percent
of GDP in 2007, although public investment levels have beenrising from 2.7 percent of GDP
in2005 to 4.7 percent in2007. Real private sector consumption has beengrowingrapidly and
increasedby nearly 10percent in2007 alone. Ittook place on the back of:

            a) a credit boom: Serbia continued to experience rapid credit growth which for
                2007 is estimated to be 16.1 percent (average for the year); and the key driver
                of that growth was credit to householdswhich grew by more than 51percent in
                2007 (average for the year);

            b) expansionaryfiscal policies and significant increases in public spending:
                consolidated general government spending reached 44.9 percent of GDP in
                2007, up from 42 percent in 2005, driven by increases in both capital and
                current spending;

            c) increases in real wage levels: the total year-on-year real gross wage increase
                was 17.9percent in2007, ontop of 12.1percent in2006;

            d) rapid increases in exports:exports increasedon average 29.6 percent annually
                (indollar terms) over the 2005-07 period, albeit from alow base.

7.       Growth in 2008 is estimated to reach 6 percent, driven by continued strong services
sector performance, a much better agriculture season, and a 1.3 percent real growth in
manufacturing, as well as an acceleration of export growth of 24 percent in dollar terms (in
particular of material products). Preliminary figures for 2008 also indicate more modest and
sustainable real wage increases, a relatively small fiscal deficit of about 2 percent of GDP, and
continued decline of public debt as share of GDP.

8.       Inflationary pressures have reemerged in the first half of the year, but went down
afterwards. Since September 2006 the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has been gradually
moving towards inflation targeting, with explicit objectives for core inflation. The National
Bank of Serbia has increased the rep0 rate by 775 basis points during 2008. Nevertheless,
credit has been increasing rapidly and inflation (measured by retail prices index) reached 12.3
percent (y-0-y) in October 2008, but has fallen to 6.8 percent by the end of 2008. There were
important supply side effects inthe first part of the year, includinghigher global prices of food
and agricultural products (contributing to nearly 50 percent of total inflation over the past
year), and oil products and electricity (contributing about 30 percent of total inflation). These
pressures declined with the global decline in commodity prices. However, core inflation i s
currently running at about 10 percent, well above the NBS target rate for 2008 of 3-6 percent.
Since the NBS has started its move towards inflation targeting, there has been increased
exchange rate variability, and a significant overall appreciation of the dinar, which reached a
4-year high against the euro inAugust 2008. However, since then dinar startedto depreciate
significantly and especially since early October. The first direct impact of the international
financial crisis manifested itself in pressure on dinar which lost 10.9 percent against the euro
inOctoberalone. Throughout 2008 dinar depreciatedby 11.8percent.

9.      A major concern for policy makers is the widening of the already high current
account deficit (CAD). In 2007 the CAD reached 15.9 percent of GDP, a record high level

                                                3

since the beginning of transition. For 2008 a further deterioration of the CAD to 18 percent of
GDP is projected. In the first three quarters of 2008 the CAD was USD 7 billion or 14.2
percent of projected annual GDP.'

 10.       Net FDI covered about 87.2 percent of the current account deficit during 2005-07.
Foreign direct investments (net) are estimated to be 6.3 percent of GDP in 2007, while
portfolio investments reached 2.3 percent of GDP. Net foreign loans increased from 9.6 to 13
percent o f GDP. As a result of the large surplus in the capital account, gross international
reserves increased from USD 11.9 billion (EUR 9 billion) at the end of 2006 to USD 14.2
billion (EUR 9.6 billion) as of December 2007 when they representeda record high coverage
of prospective imports (7.5 months). In 2008 the reserves in dollar terms reached a peak in
March(USD 15 billion) while in Euro terms they peaked in September(EUR 9.7 billion). In
October the National Bank of Serbia began to intervene in the foreign exchange market,
selling EUR 266 million, and reserves declined to EUR 9.3 billion by the end of October.
Significant intervention at the inter-bank foreign exchange market continued in the later
months and consequently reserves declinedto USDl1.5 billion (EUR 8.1 billion). Inthe first
three quarters of 2008 net inflows of FDI were USD 2.4 billion (4.9 percent of the annual
GDP).

11.        Private external debt continues to increase rapidly while the public debt stock is
declining. External debt outstanding as a percentage of GDP i s estimated to have decreased
slightly from 63 percent in 2006 to 61.1 percent in 2007 despite the increase inprivate sector
borrowing due to solid growth of the economy and exchange rate valuation effects. In dollar
terms, foreign debt increased from U S 19.6 billion at end-2006 to US 26.2 billion at end-
2007. The share of the private sector in external debt has increased significantly over the last
several years and at the end of 2007 i s estimated to be around two-thirds of the total. Public
debt (including both domestic and foreign) as a share of GDP declined from 42.5 at the end of
2006 to an estimated 34.2 percent at the end of 2007. Most of the public debt is denominated
in foreign exchange (95.4 percent). At the end of November 2008, the total stock of external
debt (public and private) reached USD 27.9 billion. Short term debt accounts for 9.8 percent
oftotal external debt.

12.        Given signals of growing macroeconomic imbalances with external and financial
vulnerabilities, insufficient fiscal restraint would be a serious risk to macroeconomic stability
inSerbia, especially inthe light ofthe ongoing international financial crisis. The fiscal deficit
of the consolidated government sector for 2007 was around 1.9 percent of GDP, following a
deficit of 1.6 percent in 2006. Although revenues have continued to grow (from 35.8 percent
of GDP in 2001 to 43 percent of GDP in 2007), both capital and recurrent spending have
grown even faster. As in previous years, a key generator of the deficit remains the social
insurance funds (health, pension and unemployment insurance funds) which on average over
the last couple of years ran deficits of over 5 percent of GDP. The deficits of social insurance
funds are coveredby transfers from the central governmentbudget.


 There are some measurement issues with the CAD. Usingthe revised methodology o f the National Bank o f
Serbia, where a portion o fremittances has been transferred from the financial to the current account, the C A D
(after grants) increased fiom 9.7 percent o f GDP in2006 to an estimated 12.4 percent in2007 and is forecast to
deteriorate further last year. There are also issues with the treatment o f reinvested dividends o f foreign owned
corporations which iftaken into account would at least partially offset the effect o f the alternative treatment o f
remittances on the size ofthe CAD.
                                                           4

13.        Given Serbia's already high public revenue-to-GDP ratio, limiting growth of overall
public spending will be one of the major challenges of the Government, especially given the
plans to increase spending for much-needed infrastructure investments. Expenditure
reprioritization and a reduction of current expenditures will be critical. Delivery on election
campaign promises would increase the expansiveness of fiscal policy and undermine
macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit in 2008 will crucially depend on budget execution
in the last quarter (including of the investment projects) since in the first three quarters the
fiscal deficit was 1 percent of annual GDP. The deficit originally projected for the whole year
was 1.9 percent of GDP, but due to some one-off but very costly measures the deficit for the
year might rise to 2.1 percent of GDP.

14.        Potential impact offinancial crisis and mitigation measuresput inplace. As a result
of the global financial turmoil, the risk of instability in the domestic financial sector has also
increased. However, past tight prudential policies are now paying off in providing a strong
                                                                                                                           I


first line of defense against financial crisis spillover. Increased financial sector stability risk
stems mainly from recent rapid credit growth inthe banking sector, primarily in Euro or Euro
indexed loans and guarantees extended for cross-border borrowing of companies. However,
this risk is temperedby the large current liquidity (liquidity rate of 31% as of October 2008)
and capital buffers (CAR of 26% as ofthe same date) o fthe banking system.

15.        With regards to enhancingmarket confidence, GoS andNBS respondedpromptly to a
withdrawal of some 15 percent of foreign currency deposits during the month of October
2008. They put in place a series of confidence building measures, including stepping up
ongoing monitoring of liquidity in the banking system and early warning indicators (see Box
1). Withdrawals since the end of October have slowed very sharply and are now negligible.
Moreover, much of the net reduction in deposits in October was balanced by injections of
liquidity from home country banks, hence the liquidity remains high.

                 Box 1. NBS and GoS Stabilization Measures in Response to Financial Crisis

GoS andNBS have taken anumber of measuresto sustain market confidence and increaseliquidity in the system and step

         In addition, to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the economy and to minimize potentialcorporate default, NBS
         has agreed with the bankingsector on the following temporary measures for 2009: i)extension of the repayment
        periodof the existingloansup to 1year for credit worthy clients; ii)no penalty fees for early loanrepayment.



                                                                5

16.       Recognizing the risks inherent in the current international financial situation and the
large CAD, Serbia requested a Precautionary Stand-By Agreement (SBA) with the IMF. On
November 13, the Fund mission and the Serbian government reached agreement on an
economic program supported by a potential loan o f USD 516 million (75 percent o f the
quota). The agreement limits the overall 2009 budget deficit to 1.75 percent of GDP and
incorporates a freeze on increase inpensions in 2009, a freeze on public sector wages (inreal
terms) and a significant cut in subsidies. Inaddition to fiscal tighteningthe Fundagreed with
the government to accelerate structural reforms in order to create an environment for faster
private sector development (including privatization of remaining state banks and large state
enterprises and legal reforms that will improve business environment). Additional provisions
of the SBA define the roles and responsibilities o f the Deposit Insurance Agency and other
authorities based on a Fund Financial Crisis Preparedness Review which judged the legal
basis for crisis preparedness to be sound but noted that smooth implementation o f its
provisions, should the need arise, may prove challenging. Since Serbia has a comfortable
international reserve position and continued access to external financing, the SBA has been
formulated under regular, not exceptional, procedures and access limits. The Serbian
government indicated that it does not intend to draw on resources made available under the
SBA, unless the need arises. The IMF's Boardadopted this arrangement on January 16,2009.


MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
17.       The Serbian economy will be affected by the international financial crisis, like other
countries from the region, but growth i s projectedto stay at around 4 percent per year over the
medium term. This represents a downward revision of some 2-3 percentage points from earlier
estimates but still represent relatively solid growth relative that projected for other European
economies. Serbia's success duringthe first years o f transition (2001-2004) was primarily due
to the implementation o f key structural reforms typical for transition economies (such as
liberalization o f foreign trade, privatization o f socially owned enterprises etc.) which set the
stage for fast growth in the future. However, these growth projections are associated with
some uncertainty, and could be revised upwards or downwards depending on the depth and
length o f the financial crisis. The Serbian economy to large extent depends on availability of
credit and investment from abroad, and receives annually about 9 percent o f GDP inthe form
o f remittances. Under the presented scenario, investments are projected first to decline slightly
(in 2009) but then to recover to levels similar to those of the last two years (reaching 24.5
percent o f GDP by 2011). These levels are still below those characteristic o f the fastest
growing economies o f the region. Inflation is projected to decline again to single digit levels
by the endo fthis year and to continue declining to levels o f 6-8 percent thereafter.

18.       As part o f the agreement with the IMF, the Serbian government committed to cutting
public expenditures more significantly relative to GDP. The deficits o f 1.8-2 percent o f GDP
that characterized last couple o f years will decline to about 1 percent o f GDP. Consolidated
general government expenditures are projected to decline significantly next year: from 44.9
percent of GDP this year to 43.7 percent. A similar trend i s projected through 2011, when
public expenditures are projected to reach 42 percent o f GDP. Public revenues are projected
to decline as well, but at a somewhat slower pace, thus these will come down from 42.8
percent of GDP (as it i s estimated for 2008) to about 41 percent o f GDP by 2011. These
projections incorporate the changes in fiscal policy envisaged by the new arrangement with
the IMF which limit the consolidated general government deficit to 1percent of GDP.

19.         The medium term macroeconomic projections for Serbia shown above have been
revised twice since preparation of the CPS, most recently in December 2008. They reflect
ongoing developments inthe financial crisis as well as new fiscal polices adopted inline with
the Fundprogram. The debt positionis now projectedto deteriorate (as indicated by increased
the share of external debt to GDP) but will then improve in the later years of the projection
period. External debt as share of GDP is projected to decline significantly in2008 and then to
increase gradually through 2010. It will only to start to decline again in 2011. In 2007 total
debt outstanding was 61.1 percent of GDP, and in2011 it is projectedto reach 75.1 percent of
GDP. It is important to stress that the composition of external debt will shift towards the
private sector which will account for about 80 percent of total external debt by 2011. This
partly reflects the expected continued borrowing of foreign owned commercial banks
operating in Serbia from their headquartersabroad. Public debt (both domestic and external)
i s projected to continue to decline from 30.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24.9 percent in 2011,
as fiscal deficits are going down and are expected to be easily funded by non-debt creating
inflows (i.e., privatization revenues).

20.         Some risks to Serbia's external debt sustainability remain, particularly given
continuing external imbalances. The current account deficit (after grants) remains very high2
and is projected to increasefrom 15.9 percent of GDP in2007 to 18 percent of GDP this year.
Thereafter it will begin to decline, reaching 12 percent of GDP in 2011 primarily as a
consequence of a decline inthe trade deficit from 23 percent of GDP in 2007 to 16.6 percent
by 2011,largely because of declining imports rather than increasedexports. Private transfers,
Le., remittances, at the level of 8-9 percent of GDP will remain a key factor keeping the CAD
at a more sustainable level until export growth picks up. Following a massive buildup in the
period to 2007, external reserves are projected to decline slightly in2009 (by about 8 percent
ineuro terms) andthenwill rise after 2010.

21.       Over the projected period 2009-2011, Serbia will have financing requirements o f
about 32.4 percent of GDP to cover its C A D o f about 14-15 percent o f GDP, and to regularly
service its debts (amortization accounts for most o f the remaining amount). Reserves are
projected to change only marginally innominal terms. A significant portion o f these financing
requirementswill be covered from non-debt creating inflows such as foreign direct investment
and other capital inflows (including portfolio investments). These two categories are projected
to be about 8-9 percent o f GDP, or approximately one third o f financing requirements.
However, a major part will be provided through borrowing from abroad - either by private or
government sector. Private sector borrowing will rise with its share in total external debt
outstanding reaching 80 percent by the end o fprojectionperiod.

22.       Despite the GoS' mitigation measures aimed at easing the impact o f the financial
crisis, Serbia will not remain immune to the effects o f the global turmoil, which are expected
to significantly slowdown economic activity in 2009. Ensuringmacroeconomic stability will
require government's continued commitment to structural reforms and adequate response to
any adverse development^.^

11.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

23.        The PFDPL operation i s designed to support concrete Government led reforms
structured in three pillars. Pillar 1 o f the proposed PFDPL operation aims to strengthen the
business environment; Pillar 2 is designed to further strengthen the fiscal discipline through
reducing the flow o f direct and indirect subsidies to the enterprise sector and, at the same
time, accelerating the resolution o f remaining SOEs; and Pillar 3 will encourage further
financial sector reforms through divestments and institutional strengthening.

24.       As to Pillar 1, the improvement o f business environment is a key factor for ensuring
sustainable private sector growth and job creation. While implementation o f the government
programs focused on privatization of state- and socially-owned enterprises and strengthening
fiscal discipline led to increase o f productivity and freed up scarce government resources, the
future economic growth and job creation will depend on the emergence and successful
development of a dynamic private sector. To that end, in the last few years the GoS has
embarked on a series of successful reforms aimed at improving the business environment.
Moreover, the government has closely coordinated its plans and actions with the
representatives o f the private sector, such as the Foreign Investors Council, and it has
conducted intensive stakeholder consultations in order to address the ongoing business
concerns and stimulate further investments.

25.        Some recent notable successes include implementation o f a comprehensive reform o f
business entry that led to the transfer o f business registration from judicial to purely
administrative process managed by the Serbian Business Registers Agency (SBRA); adoption
o f such key elements o f commercial legislation as the Company Law and a new Bankruptcy
Law; enhancement o f access to finance by adopting Secured Transactions Law, Leasing Law
and Mortgage law andestablishing Pledge and Leasingregistries; coordination of Government
reform efforts through the Regulatory Reform Council and introduction o f a Regulatory


  Macroeconomic outlook i s subject to revision given the uncertainties associated with the global economic
crisis and an updatedversion will be presentedduring the Board discussion.

Impact Assessment (RIA) in Serbian legislative process. These reform efforts have been
acknowledged inthe World Bank 2006 Doing Business Report that identified Serbia as one of
the top 10 reformers in the world. However, political developments between 2006 - mid
2008, including the dissolution o f the State Union o f Serbia and Montenegro in June 2006,
national referendum on a new Serbian Constitution, KOSOVO'S               unilateral declaration of
independence inearly 2008, andtwo Parliamentary elections a year from each other (2007 and
2008), followed by the difficult prolonged negotiations between the political parties on
formation o f the new Government, delayed the implementation o f the planned business
environment reforms. Though there was no significant absolute worsening in the business
environment observed, businesses in Serbia continue to encounter a number o f administrative
barriers and substantial regulatory compliance costs.

26.       The Government i s committed to reinvigorate the reform efforts and pursue
unfinished reform agenda inimproving the business climate. The World Bank stands ready to
assist it. Priority areas that have been agreed upon include: (i)   further streamlining o f business
registration procedures with an aim of creating a one-stop shop for business registration and
eventually introducing a single identification number; (ii)improving legal framework for
strengthening corporate governance and facilitating business entry and operations by
introducing amendments to the Company Law; (iii)simplifying regulations o f business
activities and reducing business compliance costs through the implementation o f a
comprehensive regulatory review, the so-called guillotine), and (iv) improving legal and
institutional framework for competition.

27.       With regards to Pillar 2, the GoS is committed to strengthening the fiscal discipline
which is necessary to attain permanent fiscal adjustment, but also required to facilitate the
restructuring o f the real sector. Whilst GoS has made good progress intightening fiscal policy
in 2004 and 2005 - there was a significant reduction inthe deficit o fthe consolidated general
government in 2004 (3 percentage points o f GDP) and surplus in 2005 - the size o f the
government remained among the largest in the region. Also, most o f the deficit reduction to
date reflected buoyant revenues owing to strong economic growth, inflation and better tax
collection rather than efforts to contain spending. Further, 2006 and 2007 witnessed
deterioration in fiscal policy, and as a result a fiscal deficit of 1.6% and 1.9% of GDP in2006
and 2007 respectively. Buildingon the achievements o f PPFDPC-I, under this operation the
GoS will pursue a two-pronged strategy o f (i)      containing the direct and indirect subsidies to
the enterprise sector and (ii) accelerating resolution o f the remaining SOEs.

28.       In pursing permanent energy sector reforms, Serbia has committed to integrate its
energy sector into the regional and pan-European oil, power and natural gas markets and is
seeking to enhance energy security through obtaining foreign investments in transit pipelines
for natural gas across Serbia. The Government recognizes the need for continued
rehabilitation and modernization o f its energy infrastructure, and sees further restructuring and
private sector participation as tools to achieve cost-efficient improvements in the sector. In
parallel, GoS i s focusing on energy efficiency in the supply chain as well as in energy
consumption, and movement towards cost-reflective tariffs i s one o f the elements in the
strategy. Furthermore, the Government wants to support renewable energy sources and
environmentally acceptable technologies for energy utilization.

29.       As to Pillar 3 on financial sector reforms, substantial progress has been made interms
o f privatization and sale o f assets and strengtheningo f the legal regulatory framework for both

                                                  9

the banking and insurance sector. As a result of these reforms, the financial sector i s now
mainly private, foreign players dominate both markets and both markets have expanded
significantly. Recently, the Government has also started a review o f the key capital market
legislation to promote its development. Notwithstandingthe considerable progress to date, it
is important that GoS completes the privatization process o f the bank and insurance sectors,
continues to transition to risk based supervision, approves the motor third party liability law
and continues to promote the development o fcapital market.

30.      Thanks to a substantial privatization effort, including the recent privatization of three
banks (Vojvodjanska, Panonska and Komercialna) only 17.2% o f banking sector assets i s still
state owned. This stood at 43.7% in2002 when the privatizationprocess started and following
the closure of four largest banksovernight in2001. Currently, the majority o fthe sector (over
70% o f total assets) is foreign owned, mainly by European groups. In2007, lending to SOEs
was at only 2.1% o f total lending and was primarily extended by private banks to profitable
SOEs. As a result o f the reform, the sector has not only become more stable, but has also
expanded substantially, with banking sector as a percentage o f GDP reaching 67% in 2007,
and insurance premium increasingby 120% over the 2002-2007 period.

31.      A major effort to strengthenbankingsector supervisionhas been undertaken with the
approval o f a new Law on Banks in 2005 and the new law introduced consolidated risk based
supervision, thus addressing a key issue raised inthe 2005 FSAP. The new Law on Banks has
also been supported through the adoption o f a number o f regulations. To date these include an
updated supervision operating policy, an amended procedural guide on remedial actions, new
bank licensing procedures, a new IFRS-compliant banking chart of account, and new capital
adequacy requirements for market and foreign exchange exposures. New regulations on risk
management, liquidity, loan classification, consolidated financial group reporting and related
capital adequacy and reporting requirements have been drafted. NBS has also put considerable
effort in the implementation o f the new framework by standardizing supervisory procedures
and training inspectors on risk-based supervision.

32.      Insurance supervision has also been improved thanks to a complete revamping o f the
legal framework, including the introduction o f a licensing requirement for insurance agents,
and the enhancement o f the quality o f supervision and o f enforcement. As a result, there has
been substantial consolidation in the sector; over the 2001-2008 period, the number o f
companies has shrunk from 40 to 21. State ownership in the sector has been substantially
reduced. Finally, the work on motor third party liability (MTPL) i s underway.

33.      The Government has started a comprehensive review o f the key relevant legislation
for capital markets development, the Law on Securities, the Law on Takeovers and the
Company Law. Amendments to the Securities Law will take care o f immediate problems until
the full review is completedwhich will ultimately ensure that conflicts betweenthe three laws
are eliminated and they are in line with international standards. Further, the Government i s
committed to the establishment o f a long term government bond market and it has set up a
working group to study the legal and institutional framework for a bond market including
corporate, municipal, and government bonds.        In order to proceed with the restructuring
program o f the state owned utilities, the GoS i s preparing legislation to corporatize public
utilities (Le. to transform them into companies with a structure that i s in compliance with
Serbian company and securities laws). Additionally, there is a need to repeal o f a 1996 Law
on Assets o f the Republic o f Serbia, which created an anomaly whereby state owned

                                               10

companies do not own the assets that they use. The Government also intends to privatize or
ensure private sector participation in certain public enterprises through IPOs or sales in the
market. This recognizes the increasing strength o f the Belgrade Stock Exchange as a
mechanism not only for secondary market trading, where citizens and workers entitled under
the Law on Gratis Shares can buy and sell, but also as a place where primary fund raising can
be carried out as well. Finally, the Government will improve the institutional arrangements
for capital markets by providing the Securities and Exchange Commission with more
responsibilities and ensuring its impartiality and independence.


             111.   BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

LINKTO CAS

34.        The FY08-FY11 CPS for Serbia, approved by the Board in December 2007,
envisages this PFDPL as a base case operation for FY08-FY09. In broader terms, the CPS
outlines a possibility for a set o f consecutive development policy operations over a three-year
period, depending on the needs and financing requests o f the GoS. This PFDPL would be the
first o f such operations, as envisaged inthe CPS.

35.        The objectives of the PFDPL are consistent with key objectives and expected
outcomes under the first priority area o f the Serbia CPS: "Dynamic Private Sector Led
Growth to Ensure Incomes Converge with Europe." The proposed PFDPL would address a set
o f objectives outlined under this priority area, such as (i)further improving the business
environment, particularly cumbersome licensing and permit arrangements; (ii)strengthening
the financial sector intermediation; (iii) completing divestiture o f socially-owned enterprises;
(iv) strengthening enforcement o f bankruptcy and other mechanisms to ensure the assets of
insolvent socially-owned enterprises unable to be sold can be freed up for productive use; (v)
continuing the process o f privatizing and restructuring o f large state-owned enterprises; and
(vi) strengtheningthe competitiveness of the enterprise sector. A number of potential PFDPL
triggers and program outcomes are featured inthe Policy Matrix.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

36.        The success o f reforms in Serbia over the first seven years o f transition was
substantially stimulated by the effective collaboration and coordination betweenthe Bank and
other key donors. The Bank maintains close working relations with the IMF and other donors
assisting the GoS for the purposes o f harmonizing policy recommendations, seeking synergies
among the respective operations, and avoiding overlaps. The IMF has beenprimarily focused
on the short-term impacts o f the reforms on macroeconomic stability while the Bank has
focused on the medium-term impacts o f structural reforms. The Bank also maintains very
good relations and keeps ongoing policy dialogue with various bodies of the EU, either in its
headquarters inBrussels or inBelgrade.

37.       The IMF and Serbia have successfully completed one Stand-by and a three-year
Extended Arrangement since 2001. The final review under the Extended Arrangement was
completed on February 07, 2006 after two extensions. Followingthe successful completion o f
the Extended Arrangement, the IMF has maintained regular Article IV consultations with
Serbian authorities, the last one completed in February 2008. In2006 the Serbian authorities

                                                 11

decided to use part o f their privatization revenues to prepay major creditors, including the
IMF. Duringthe 2006 Serbia prepaid about USD 600 millionto the Fundwhile the remaining
balance due to the Fund was amortized in the first quarter o f 2007, thus completely clearing
the outstanding debt. Giventhe abrupt change inglobal financial environment and inorder to
safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, Serbian authorities have requested a
precautionary Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. Duringthe course o f the Fund's mission
in Serbia inNovember 2008 the mainparameters o fthe economic programwere agreedupon,
and the IMFBoard approved the SBA on January 16,2009.

38.     Overall, the Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community in
Serbia in order to avoid duplication o f efforts and leverage support for the GoS' reforms. The
Bank is an active participant in macro-level donor coordination mechanisms led by the GoS,
and the Bank also coordinates efforts on specific thematic fields directly with other donors.
This includes the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) and USAID on enterprise
sector reform and improving bankruptcy regulatory regime and its enforcement, the U.S.
Treasury, SIDA and the DFID on support to the Deposit Insurance Agency's mandate and
USAID on its long-standing support to the NBS Supervisory reform initiative. The
collaboration between the Bank and SIDA also includes supporting the Serbian Business
Registry, development o f regulatory reform strategy, and regulatory impact assessment.

39.     The Bank has been closely coordinating with other donors engaged in supporting
financial sector development in Serbia, especially related to banking sector restructuring. In
particular, the Bank has consulted with EBRD which has equity stakes in two banks with
significant state ownership, ensuringclose donor coordination in supporting the government's
efforts to further strengthen the banking sector. Most recently, the Bank has been closely
coordinating with Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs which is finalizing its assistance
program to the Government o f Serbia related to restructuring and privatization o f state owned
banks. The Bank's coordination and cooperation with the European Union, Serbia's most
important current and future development partner, i s increasing and deepening since
practically all World Bank assistance is aimed at helping Serbia inthe process o f convergence
with the European Union. Finally, the GoS has received a PHRD grant from the Government
o f Japan for the preparation o fthis operation.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

40.      The proposed PFDPL program follows closely the Programmatic Private and
Financial Development Policy Credit (PPFDPC- 1) and a successful series o f two consecutive
Private and Financial Sector Adjustment Credits. The PFSAC-I, with a total commitment o f
USD 85 million, closed inJune 2003 with a highly satisfactory outcome. This credit focused
on initial reform measures in five areas: (i)   banking sector reform; (ii) reform o f socially-
owned enterprises; (iii)bank asset and enterprise workouts; (iv) financial sector regulatory
andsupervisory framework; and (v) business environment reform.

41.      The PFSAC-11, with a total commitment of USD 80 million, put inplace the medium-
term reforms agreed upon in PFSAC-I. Its overall objective was to support the GoS' program
of regulatory, institutional, and structural reforms seeking to significantly accelerate private
sector growth through: (i)improving the business enabling environment by means o f
comprehensive reform o f enterprise entry, operation and exit; (ii) strengthening the financial
system by improving the environment under which banks and other financial intermediaries
                                                12

operate; (iii)privatizing and/or liquidating outdating majority state-owned banks; and (iv)
privatizing and restructuring socially-owned enterprises that crowd out private sector growth
and incur significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs.

42.      Under the PPFDPC-1 closed in March 2006, with a total commitment of USD 55
million, the GoS has successfully completed core policy actions in: (i)  strengtheningthe fiscal
discipline in enterprise, energy and transport sectors, and attracting foreign investment; and
(ii)building a more efficient and stable financial sector and improving access to finance. To
strengthen the fiscal discipline, the GoS reduced subsidies and continued with divestiture o f
SOEs through privatization and bankruptcy; and pursued reforms in the energy and railway
sector.,The GoS activities aimed at buildingmore efficient and stable financial sector focused
on continued privatization and divestment o f state-owned banks and financial assets;
strengthening insurance sector regulation and resolution regime; and improving access to
finance through the adoption o f a mortgage law.

43.      Implementation o f the reform agenda under the PFSAC and PPFDPC-1. programs
benefited considerably from and was facilitated through two grants, the Private Sector
Development Technical Assistance (PSD TA) and Financial Sector Development Technical
Assistance (FSD TA), followed by the recently completed Privatization and Restructuring of
Banks and Enterprises Technical Assistance Credit. These operations provided technical
assistance and institutional capacity building for (i)
                                                     privatization and bankruptcy o f SOEs; (ii)
implementation o f a comprehensive banking and insurance sector restructuring strategy
targeted at creating a more viable financial sector; and (iii)improvement o f the business
environment for business entry and sustainable operations.

44.      Inaddition to the private and financial sector reformdimensions outlined inthe above
mentioned operations, the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) program has also laid a
foundation for the implementation o f the envisaged PFDPL program. Inparticular, the SAC-I1
focused on: (i) improving the business climate; (ii)  institutional development and improving
performance withinthe energy sector; (iii)   strengthening social protection; and (iv) improving
public administration. The planned DPL operation to support the Public Expenditure
Management will provide assistance to the GoS inwider public financial management issues.

45.      The approved Bor Regional Development Project, which included supporting the
government inthe assets resolution o f copper miningand smeltingcomplex RTB Bor, pursues
objectives that are cross-reinforcing with those o f PFDPL, as RTB Bor was the single largest
recipient o f GoS subsidies to the SOE sector.

LESSONSLEARNED

46.      The PFDPL program builds upon the experience accumulated during the preparation
and implementation of the previous private and financial sector operations. This experience
has demonstrated that an integrated approach i s needed to reform the financial and enterprise
sectors inparallel. Underthe earlier programs, financial sector reform aimedto boost financial
intermediation, encourage domestic savings and generate much needed liquidity to support
real sector expansion. Concurrently, the continued privatization o f SOEs and the adoption o f
early measures to strengthen the business climate drew inincreased foreign investments.



                                                13

47.       A key lesson from other transition experiences and from the first seven years of
transition in Serbia was the need for sequencing: the initial steps should be the immediate
goals o f price liberalization and fiscal stability, followed by structural reforms in industrial
enterprises and banks and, only then, in the third stage, pursue reforms in utilities, non-
banking institutions and capital markets. Moreover, due to the political economy o f post-
conflict Serbia, it was important to start enterprise privatization with sellable companies - or
"early wins" - and only later move onto restructuring o f the politically sensitive large loss-
makers. The focus o f the three stage sequencing must include lessons on the timing and design
o f social policies aimed at directly addressing poverty reduction and mitigating some o f the
adverse social impacts potentially caused by the three transition stages. In parallel, from the
start o f the reforms, long-term efforts should be undertaken which are aimed at creating a
robust, transparent regulatory and institutional framework for utilities, financial markets and
the business environment. In the case o f utilities, privatization should be preceded by
unbundling and commercialization on the basis of an appropriate market structure. Moreover,
the negative experience o f some transition countries forewarns that the proper preparation i s
requiredto attract interest from international reputable strategic investors.

48.       In recent years, Serbia has proven to posses sufficient technical capacities be very
effective in implementing economic reforms. However, given an unstable political situation
the pace of reform has been noted to be stop-go. Therefore, in designing this programmatic
approach the Bank has adopted a modular strategy, striving to ensure that the achievements in
the first DPL are incremental and largely irreversible, serving as a strong foundation for
further structural reforms later on inthe program.

49.       Reform implementation i s heavily dependent upon an effective.champion who takes
the early `ownership' o f the reforms sought. Equally, it is important that the domestic reform
champions are well advised as to the positions assumed and actions taken. For example, the
willingness o f key counterparts at NBS and M O F to take key decisions, inter alia, to
significantly reign in regulatory forbearance, take additional robust measures to further
strengthenthe bank andinsurance regulatory regimes, withdraw licenses o fbanksand insurers
and offer a number of state-owned banks and assets for sale has enabled the financial sector
reform agenda to be substantially advanced. Similarly, the effective management o f the
enterprise privatization process by M O E and P A facilitated progress in the reforms o f the
socially-owned sector.

50.       The ability to provide extensive technical assistance on a timely basis has been crucial
to enabling the PFSAC-I and I1 operations to achieve their objectives. As well, the early
provision o f substantial grant funding and the effective coordination by the Bank o f support
from bi-lateral donors (notably EU, DFID, PHRD and USAID) proved critical for developing
institutional capacity at the DIA, PA and NBS to implement early highimpact measures.

51.       Finally, it i s important to note that Serbia differs from most other transition
economies in two ways. First, its system o f socialism, based on worker management and the
concept o f "social capital," did not entail classic central planning; and secondly, due to the
break-up o f the former Yugoslavia and the resulting conflict and sanctions, Serbia was
relatively late in embarking on the journey to a full-fledged market economy. These factors
meant that the fundamental transitional task o f reforming banks and enterprises had to be
adjusted to these different initial conditions and to take lessons o f experience into
consideration: auctions replaced voucher privatization, so typical for many other transition

                                                 14

economies, the four largest state-owned banks were closed and lastly, the approach to
restructuring of utilities and of the largest loss-makers has beenmore gradual than that of the
early reformers.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

52.      The PFDPL program heavily relies on findings of the extensive economic sector work
undertaken by the Bank. The policy recommendations integrated into the relevant components
of the program are stemming from a number of key documents presented to the GoS in2004-
2007. They includethe Serbia Economic Memorandum; the Financial Sector Note (FSN); the
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA); the Private Sector Note (PSN); the Fiduciary
Assessment Update, the Public Expenditure Review, the Accounting and Auditing Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) report and most recently, the Integrated Public Finance Management Assessment
(IPFMA), the Labor Market Study and the Public Expenditure Review update. The new CPS
for FYOS-FY11 was adopted in December 2007 following extensive discussions with the
incominggovernment basedon a set of policy notes.

53.      According to an empirical analysis in the ICA and the PSN, private firms are more
productive than the socially-owned ones, proving that ownership does matter. Further,
according to an EU sponsored study from 2005, companies privatized under the 2001 Law
have generally improved their financial performance and have invested in modernizing their
production process in comparison to companies privatized to employees under the pre-reform
1997 Law, although originally the latter were, on average, of better quality companies thanthe
firms privatized after 2001. Moreover, the ICA demonstrates that new private firms in Serbia
are unambiguously more productive, more profitable, and growing more rapidly than the
socially-owned ones. The problem is simply that there are not enough of them. Although the
new private firms are better performers, their scope for growth and the possibility of entry by
new entrepreneurs are severely limited by the improving, but still deficient business
environment.

54.      The PRSP rightly emphasizedthat improvements inthe businessenvironment are key
preconditions for sustainable private sector-led growth. The strategy for Serbia acknowledges
the needfor streamlining the registration process, reducing administrative barriersto business
operation, improving corporate governance, and establishing a modem bankruptcy regime.
Similarly, comprehensivereformof the financial sector represents an important cornerstone of
governments' growth strategy. The SerbianPRSP and FSAP alike each identifies a set of the
short- to medium-term actions needed to strengthen financial sector supervision, privatize
remaining state-owned banks, and improve access to finance. With proper implementation,
these reform steps should help significantly in allowing the Serbian financial system to better
fulfillits role inchanneling resourcesintoproductive investments.

55.      Inaddition, the results of Business Environment and EnterprisePerformanceSurveys
(BEEPS), as well as the Doing Business indicators were analyzed to help identify main areas
of concern for private sector development. These datasets not only provide valuable insight in
the regulatory environment and administrative practices in Serbia, but also allow for
benchmarking against other countries in the region and the world, a further measure to
identify where Serbia might be underperforming incomparison with other countries.


                                                 15

56.       Several regulatory reform areas that are targeted within the scope o f this operation
have been identified in the I C A and other studies as priorities for private sector development
and increased investment: (i)reduction o f the regulatory compliance burden, including
continuous streamlining o f business registration and operations, (ii)simplification o f the
burdensome procedures for obtaining construction permits, which in turn are linked to the
problems of urban planning and land management; and (iii)improvements in competition
legislation and implementation capacity o f the government.

57.       The FSN demonstrates that Serbia's financial sector remains insufficiently developed
by regional benchmarks, andthe existing level o f financial intermediation cannot fully address
the needs of economic growth. Narrowing the efficiency gaps between the weaker Serbian
banks, and the leading CEE and EUbanks began only in2005 as a result o f local acquisitions
by foreign banks. In this context, further development of non-bank financial institutions
(NBFI), such as insurance companies and capital markets, is particularly important as they
may offer the potential o f a broad array o f intermediary services and instruments currently
unavailable from most banks.

58.       The recent IPFMA report significantly improved our understandings o f the sequence
and needed measures to strengthen the fiduciary environment. The IPFMA suggests that
despite the recent public disclosure o f basic fiscal and budget execution data, the lack o f
transparency and operating checks and balances in public finance still appear to be an
overarching problem in Serbia and the fiduciary risk associated with the PFM system i s high.
Although significant steps have been taken towards strengthening PFM, such as
modernization o f the interim treasury system, the establishment o f an internal audit and the
adoption o f the law on the state audit institution inNovember 2005, a lot remains to be done.
This includes strengthening transparency and accountability in PFM, strengthening SAI, and
continuing strong Government leadership o f the ongoing reforms requiredto bring Serbia on
par with other EU-aspiring countries inthe region.


       IV.     THE PROPOSEDPROGRAMMATIC PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL
                                  DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

OPERATION DESCRIPTION


59.       The PFDPL is the first o f three development policy lendingoperations in the private
and financial sector stream o f DPLs envisaged under the FY08-11 CPS. The operation is
designed to enhance business environment, continue strengthening fiscal discipline in the
enterprise and energy sectors and build a more efficient and stable financial sector by putting
inplace a well targeted set of key, irreversible structural reform measures through the above
three pillars.

60.       The business environment (or first) pillar aims to: (i)further simplify regulatory
requirements and compliance costs for the business entry and operations, including business
registration and procedures for obtaining construction permits, (ii)enhance the legal
framework for strengthening corporate governance, and (iii)     strengthen institutional capacity
and regulations for ensuring competition. The fiscal discipline (or second) pillar will support:
(i)further reductionof subsidies and staffing levelsat SOEs andpublic utilities, thereby
facilitating their restructuring and ultimate resolution through privatization or, in some case,
                                                16

bankruptcy, as well as putting government finances on a more sustainable basis, (ii)
continuation of reforms inthe energy sector. The financial sector (or third) pillar i s to support:
(i) substantialdivestmentofthegovernment's remainingholdingsinthebankingand
   the
insurance industries; (ii)strengthening of the banking and insurance sector regulation and
supervision regime; and (iii)   progress inthe development o f the capital markets.

POLICY AREAS

PILLAR I-EnhancingBusinessEnvironment

62.      The improvement o f the business environment is anchored in several of the
Government programs and is central to ensuring sustainable economic growth and poverty
alleviation. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Serbia identifies job creation as one o f

                                                  17

the main avenues for poverty reduction. A better investment climate will encourage
investment flows, thus contributing to export expansion and job creation. The privatization
program and measures to strengthen fiscal discipline implemented in the last few years and
supported by a number o f World Bank operations have increased productivity and freed up
scarce government resources. However, future economic growth will depend on the
emergence o f a more dynamic private sector and its sustainable development.

63.      New sources o f growth will have to come from increased private sector investments,
domestic and foreign, in both new and existing enterprises, and a more conducive business
environment is vital. Serbia has already made substantial progress inthis respect, but the pace
o f the reform slowed down in the period o f political instability and change o f government.
However, the new government fully embraced the remaining priorities o f business
environment reform agenda, as reflected in the new draft National Program for Integration
with EU, and a number o freform initiatives got new impetus.

64.      The proposed PFDPL operation will build on the earlier achievements and progress in
the implementation o f the business environment reform agenda, focusing in particular on (i)
further simplification o f business entry through implementation o f a single agency approach to
business registration; (ii) developing legal framework for strengthening corporate governance
and improving conditions for business operations; (iii)   conducting comprehensive regulatory
review to streamline regulations o f business operations and reduce business compliance costs;
and (iv) improving legal and institutional framework for competition.

Policy Area 1.1:Further simplification of the business entry through the implementation of
single agency approachfor business registration

65.      The recent progress with the implementation o f the comprehensive business
registration reforms and institutional strengthening o f the Serbian Business Registers Agency
(SBRA) was remarkable. In 2004, the authority for registering companies was transferred to
the SBRA from trade courts and local administrative bodies. Previously, registering a
company took 51 days, a minimum o f $5,000 o f founding capital, and the registration cost o f
US$202. After the reform, total administrative procedures for registeringa company take 23
days (of which just 3 days for registration inthe SBRA); the minimumcapital requirement has
been reduced to Euro 500 and registration costs to US$60.

66.      Equally, the .institutional capacity o f the SBRA and its efficiency increased
dramatically. In addition to the business registration, the Agency also maintains registries o f
leasing deals, pledges, bankruptcies and liquidations. As a result, in the course o f 2007,
12,100 new companies were registered (compared to 6,329 in 2004). About 40 firms are
registered every day with the number o f newly opened businesses rising at an annual pace o f
10%. At the same time the agency registers 150 new entrepreneurs every day, with 48,700
new registrations in 2007. A complete electronic database on business entities and
entrepreneurs i s now fully functional. This created the basis for the electronic exchange of
relevant data between all state institutions.

67.       Despite these strong early results no major improvements were achieved during 2006
and 2007. The reform started to gain momentum again at the end o f 2007 and is fully
supported by the new government. While Serbia has surpassed regional averages in certain
business registration indicators, its performance i s still below best international standards.

                                                18

Currently, after registering in the SBRA, businesses still have to visit the Public Revenue
Office to obtain a tax number as well as both the pension and health insurance bureaus to
register for social security. The GoS decided that the reform measures in this area should
focus on transforming the SBRA into a one-stop-shop (OSS) for all procedures related to
starting a business, including issuance o fthe tax number.

68.      It is envisionedto implement the OSS concept for business registration intwo phases.
During Phase I the focus will be on securing authorization that the SBRA performs all
activities necessary to support starting a business. To this end, the Ministry o f Economy has
prepared a proposal on a streamlined model, which would eliminate redundant forms,
regulations, steps and processes and would merge the various informational requirements
necessary to start a business. The Government has adopted the proposed model and once the
necessary amendments to the relevant legislation are introduced, the SBRA will assignthe tax
identification number. This reform measure will lead to a substantial reduction o f a number o f
days required to start a business from 23 to 12 and reduce the number o f steps from 11to 8.
In the medium term (Phase 2), the reform efforts will be focused on the introduction of a
unique business identification number that will be used for all purposes. The SBRA advanced
the reform implementation by (i)    establishing cooperation with all relevant institutions; (ii)
commissioning feasibility       study and technical needs assessment for             establishing
interconnection o f all relevant public databases; and (iii)commencing unification o f
registration procedures for entrepreneurs on a pilot basis.

69.      Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:the Bank agreed with MoERD and MoF that
the following measures will betaken under the timeframe o fthe PFDPL:

        The GoS has adopted the principles for consolidating business registration
        procedures related to issuance of tax, pension, and social security identification
        numbers inthe SBRA.;

70.      Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

    0   Amendments to the relevant laws and regulations are drafted and approved by the
        GoS, and incase o f laws submittedto the Parliament for adoption;

    0   Introductiono f single identification number i s completed.

Policy Area 1.2: Improving the legal framework for strengthening corporate governance
andfacilitating business entry and operations

71.      The GoS is committed to advance the reform measures aimed at making the existing
legal framework more conducive for improvement o f corporate governance and facilitation o f
business entry and operations. The agreed reform program includes amendments to several
key areas o f the Company Law o f 2004, (the Law on Business Entities),which was adopted to
make the legislation more clear and consistent with international business practices and to
introduce modern concepts and provisions on corporate governance and protection o f
investors. In the course of its practical implementation certain problems with its application
and the areas that required additional regulation were identified. This relates in particular to
the following areas: (i) corporate governance provisions, (ii) detailed regulation o f new forms


                                                19

o f operation (such as branch offices o f foreign legal entities); (iii)clear and consistent
regulation o f status changes (mergers, divisions).

72.      Several key areas will require substantial improvements. First o f all, the
Entrepreneurs Law still remains in force. It has not been harmonized with the Law on
Business Entities and imposes burdensome registration requirements and other excessive
regulations o f entrepreneurial activities. Unification o f all provisions regulating the
establishment and the operation of entrepreneurs and companies, including explicit
elimination o f all unnecessary requirements and thereby annulling and replacing the Law on
Entrepreneurs entirely are required. Secondly, the Law on Business Entities allows for the
establishment o f branch oflces offoreign legal entities, but several important issues related to
their foundation, operation and ceasing the activities are not regulated. Thirdly, the legal form
o f business association has been omitted in the existing Law, and therefore new business
associations cannot be established, while the legal status o f already registered ones i s unclear.
Fourthly, regulation o f complex forms o f business organization and operation (concern,
holding, group o f companies) is not adequate. Inaddition, status changes (mergers, divisions)
regulations lack consistency and clarity.

73.      The Ministry o f Economy and Regional Development established expert working
group that drafted amendments to the Company Law covering inter alia the following areas:
(i)enhanced corporate governance provisions, (ii)detailed regulation of new forms of
operation; (iii) clear and consistent regulation o f status changes; (iv) explicit elimination o f all
unnecessary requirements for the establishment and operation o f entrepreneurs and
companies, sunset provisions for the Entrepreneurs Law. Once finalized, the amendments will
be subject to broad public consultations. At the same time, the Ministry o f Finance has
preparedamendments to the Law on Securities to address some immediate concerns raised by
the industry representatives; it i s also planning to undertake a comprehensive review o f
Securities and Takeover Laws inthe next few months. Therefore, it i s important to ensure full
coordination indrafting amendments to these laws.

74.     Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:the Bank agreed with the MOERD that the
following measures will be taken under the timeframe o fthe PFDPL:


    0   Amendments .to the Company Law, including those substituting for the Law on
        Entrepreneurs are drafted inclose coordination with review of Securities legislation.

75.      Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

    0   Amendments to the Company Law, includingthose substituting for the Law on
        Entrepreneurs, are approved by the GoS and submitted to Parliament for
        adoption;

        Amendments to the Company Law are enacted.

Policy Area 1.3: Streamlining Regulations of Business Operations and Reducing Business
ComplianceCosts

76.      By introducing a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirement into the legislative
process, the GoS took measures to ensure that the introductiono f future regulatory regimes i s

                                               20

based on a clear, rationale, and proper analysis of costs and benefits, and includes appropriate
consultation with affected stakeholders. The proper implementation of RIA will ensure the
quality of new regulations - the legislative flow, which has a particular importance in the
context of legislation harmonization with the EU requirements. To support capacity building
in this area the Council for Regulatory Reform with the support of the Bank and Swedish
International Development Agency is implementing RIA project.

77.      However, it i s impossible to create a secure and transparent legal environment
without dealing with existing stock of legislation. In order to tackle this issue, the MoERD
proposed to conduct a comprehensive regulatory review of existing regulations known as a
"regulatory guillotine", a technique that can speed up the process of reviewing, eliminating,
and streamlining unnecessary outdated regulations. To initiate the reform a set of Principles
which will determine a timeline and institutional framework for the implementation of a
comprehensive regulatory review has been developed and approved by the GoS. This
document has defined the approach to the "guillotine" implementation, its scope, required
resources, and will help to build consensus regarding the reform within the government and
gain support of other key stakeholders.

78.      Procedures related to obtaining planning and construction permits and the associated
costs remain the most burdensome constraint for business development, in this area Serbia
ranks worse than most other countries of the world. The GoS demonstrates commitment to
streamline the proceduresrelated to obtaining planning and construction permits and to reduce
related compliance costs. Building on the work supported by Austrian, German and Swiss
donor agencies and local experts, the Ministry of Infrastructure and other local counterparts
continue working on a set of draft Laws on Urban Planning and Construction. This area of
business regulations will definitely benefit from comprehensive regulatory review as a part of
the proposed"guillotine process."

79.      Based on the consensus built around the Principles for the implementation of the
regulatory "guillotine," it is expected that a comprehensive regulatory review of existing
regulations will be carried out in 2008-2009 and the required amendments to laws and
regulations will be introduced, includingthe regulatory framework for obtaining planning and
construction permits. These reform measures would lead to dramatic simplification of the
regulation of business activities and decrease inthe regulatory compliance costs.

80.     Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:the Bank has agreed with the MoERD and
MOF that the following reformmeasures will betaken under the timeframe of the PFDPL:


    0   The GoS has adopted a strategy for the implementation of a comprehensive
        review of regulations governingbusiness activities("regulatory guillotine")..

81.     Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

    0   Comprehensive review of regulations of business activities ("regulatory guillotine") i s
       underway;

       Comprehensive review of regulations of business activities ("regulatory guillotine")

                                               21

Policy Area 1.4: Improving legal and Institutional Frameworkfor Competition

82.      The GoS has taken some important steps to protect consumers and strengthen the
competitive environment by adopting a new Competition Law in 2005. However, the
implementation o f this Law has proven problematic. Three years after implementation all
local counterparts agree that this Law has several important deficiencies which need to be
tackled, including: (i) time required for a merger, which contradicts the privatization law
                        the
takeover procedures; (ii)unclear delineation o f responsibilities amongst the Competition
Commission, the Privatization Agency and the NBS; (iii)the very low thresholds for
concentration o f capital notifications - requiring almost every mergerhale/ tender to have to
undergo scrutiny by the Commission; (iv) strengthening institutional arrangements; and (v)
the basis for notification fees and applicable fines should be clearly defined so as not to lead
to prohibitively highcompliance costs.

83.      The Ministry o fTrade and Services has ledthe work on preparingthe amendments to
Competition Law which addressed the described priorities, and the proposed amendments
were approved by the previous government. However, due to the new parliamentary elections
the procedure requiredanother GoS approval o f the proposed amendments. Instead, the GoS
has, with the assistance o f European Agency for ReconstructiordEuropean Commission, opted
for a more ambitious approach o f drafting a brand new law which would include all o f the
previously drafted amendments and eliminate additional deficiencies in order to ensure
effective implementation o f the legislative provisions. The new Law i s expected to address all
major business concerns and to be fully in line with EU standards. In addition to the new
Law, two other secondary regulations are being drafted - on block exemption on horizontal
and vertical agreements - which should be adopted following the passage o f the new Law.
Finally, further capacity building o f the Commission for Protection o f Competition remains a
part o f a medium term reform objective as well. The Bank team expressed its readiness to
comment on the draft Law and secondary regulations prior to their approval by the
Government, and subsequent adoption inthe Parliament.

84.      Actions to be taken under thePFDPL:

        New Competition Law i s drafted and submittedfor approval to GoS.

85.      Proposedactionsfor future PFDPL operations(triggers are bolded):

        and approved by the GoS.

PILLAR I1 Strengtheningfinancialdiscipline
             -

86.      Under PPFDPC-1, the GoS took important steps towards strengthening of financial
discipline in enterprise sector. The proposed operation will build upon and expand the
PPFDPC-1 agenda in this crucial area, focusing on: (i)the further reduction of direct and
indirect subsidies; (ii)accelerating restructuring, privatization and, where applicable,
bankruptcy and/or forced liquidation o f socially-owned enterprises; and (iii)
                                                                             continuation o f the
unbundlingand restructuringo fpublic utilities.

                                                22

Policy Area 2.1: Reduction in direct and indirect subsidies

87.     Diagnostic. The GoS continues to provide substantial financial support to the
enterprise sector. Despite their operating losses, many socially-owned enterprises on the
restructuring list continue to survive largely because they benefit from both direct and indirect
subsidies, extended by the state and state-controlled entities.

The direct subsidy i s drawn from the annual allocation in the state budget, which is
administered by the Ministry o f Economy. Generally, it is used by SOEs for supporting
current operations and clearing arrears rather than investment. The indirect subsidy can take
many forms: non-payment or partial payment o f taxes; arrears to state-owned utilities such as
EPS and NIS; arrears to public funds on pension, social security, and unemployment
contributions; and "soft" loans extended by the state-controlled banks. While it i s difficult to
measure indirect subsidies with any precision, a crude analysis o f the financial statements for
sixty SOEs undergoing restructuring process suggests that in 2004 they amounted to nearly
Euro 200 million, thus dwarfing the direct (MOE) subsidy extended to these SOEs over the
same period (Euro 53.9 mln).

88.      It is important to note that both the direct and indirect subsidies are concentrated in
just a handful of SOEs on the Government's restructuring list4. In 2004, the top twenty
subsidy recipients accounted for more than 80 percent o f the combined direct and indirect
subsidies extended to the SOEs in restructuring. Two o f the largest remaining SOEs, car
maker Zastava Group and miningcomplex RTB Bor, absorbed more than a quarter o f the total
subsidy envelope over the past several years, with roughly half o f this figure coming in the
form o f direct support fromthe MOE.

89.      Government Actions. The GoS i s aware o f the subsidies' pernicious effect, and i s
committed to strengtheningthe financial discipline inthe SOE sector. Under the framework o f
PPFDPC-1,the 2006 state budget allocation for MOE direct subsidy to SOEs was reduced to
RSD 3.85 billion in the 2006 budget and further reduced to RSD 3.1 billion in the 2008
budget, down from RSD 5.0 billion in 2005. In addition to working on privatization o f
socially-owned enterprises, the GoS has also formally initiated privatization o f two state
o w e d companies, namely underground coal mining enterprise PEU Resavica, and national
airline company JAT Airways. While PEU Resavica i s still in the preparation stage, the
tender for JAT Airways has been announced but no bids were received. The government has
also announced that it will initiate minority/majority privatization o f other state-owned
companies, thus contributing to their efficiency. It is important to note that this initiation o f
privatization o f state-owned companies i s a positive reform signal, since a lot o f state-owned
companies are not performing well and are heavily dependent on GoS assistance. However,
this process may be delayed due to the current financial crisis.

90.      In parallel, the GoS contributes to the improvement o f financial discipline in the
enterprise sector through implementing an ambitious program of public sector reforms. The
adoption o f a value added tax (VAT) in 2005, accompanied by measures to strengthen the
public revenue service, have resulted in better tax collection. The resolute privatization o f
state-owned holdings inthe banking sector has all but eliminated the practice o f concessionary
loans used to prop up failing SOEs, which had a long history in Serbia. Finally, as part o f its

restructuringprocess, EPS has increased its overall collection rates from 86.7 percent at end-
2003 to more than 90 percent as o f end-2007. At the same time, EPS' collection rates for the
group o f SOEs inrestructuring reached only 60 percent in 2005, equivalent to almost RSD 2
million inaccumulated arrears.

91.      Bank's Assessment4lecommendation. The existence o f subsidies not only
contributes substantially to the fiscal deficit, it also represents a significant obstacle to
restructuring and resolution through the sale or bankruptcy of the loss-making SOEs. The
direct and indirect support provided by the state allows the management and employees o f
poorly performing enterprises to postpone the painful restructuring, thereby releasing non-core
assets to higher productivity users. At the same time, the entry and market access o f private
firms are crowded-out by un-restructured SOEs that continue to function in a soft budget
environment.

92.      Inaddition to MOE's visible direct subsidies, some SOEs are able to bypass the hard
budget constraints through an increase in liabilities (taxes, wages, pension contributions,
utilities bills, etc.). These types o f indirect subsidies represent a much greater (and more
difficult to measure) source o f fiscal burden, which is ultimately more damaging in the long
run. Accumulation of arrears from SOEs undermines the solvency ofpublic institutions, such
as the pension fund andthe national health-service. Inthe case o fpublic utilities such as EPS,
the unpaid liabilities result in higher cost o f services and deprive the companies o f financial
resources for much-needed modernization.

93.      It is thus crucial for the resolution of the remaining SOEs that the GoS systemically
addresses the financial discipline problem by closing off the actual and potential sources o f
direct and indirect subsidies at the same time. In this respect, the team anticipates that the
continuation of public sector reform, particularly state-owned utility companies, will help
reduce the supply o f subsidies. However, both regional and global experiences provide ample
evidence that the soft budget problem will persist for as long as there exists the demand for
state support in the form o f loss-making, inefficient SOEs. Given the high concentration o f
subsidies among a group of a few large enterprises on the restructuring list, it is thus
imperative that the GoS accelerates the resolution o f these worst offenders o f financial
discipline through privatization or bankruptcy.

94.      Inthis regard it is important to underscore that over the past three years the GoS has
shown consistent commitment to resolution o f top subsidy recipients. Since October 2005,
the GoS has offered for sale through the PA of 17 SOEs from the list of top 20 recipients o f
combined direct and indirect subsidies, and sold nine o f them. In addition, one large SOE
from this list has been placed into bankruptcy after all attempts at sale failed. Most
significantly, the GoS has made substantial progress in identifying strategic private investors
for the core assets o f Zastava Group and RTB Bor, the two largest subsidy recipients in the
SOE sector. Infact, the GoS has signed a strategic partnership agreement on Zastava with the
Italian car maker Fiat, andlaunched a tender for a strategic partnership for RTB Bor.

95.      Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:Based on the above analysis and the
discussions with the MOF, MOERD, andP A counterparts, the Bank has agreed with GoS on
the following measures:

Policy Area 2.2: Privatization, Restructuring, and Bankruptcy of Socially-Owned
Enterprises

97.      Diagnostic. At the core o f Serbia's enterprise sector reform strategy over the past
seven years has been the ambitious program o f privatizing socially-owned enterprises (SOEs).
The principles o f the approach are laid out in the Privatization Law o f June 2001, which
incorporated international best practice and lessons learned from other transition economies.
The principle lesson drawn from experience o f other transition countries was that
privatizations that put core, dominant investors in charge o f the firms worked better, from a
variety o f viewpoints, then those that passed ownership to diffused, inexperienced groups o f
workers or citizens. The law thus stipulated three methods o f privatization: (i)  tenders o f large
enterprises, offering to a strategic investor at least 70 percent o f the shares; (ii)  auctions o f
medium-sized enterprises; and (iii)restructuring and subsequent tenders and/or auctions o f
large loss-making enterprises and/or partsthereof.

98.      The selected privatization model was aimed to overcome the problems which arose
from the voucher-privatization model implemented in many other transition countries in
Eastern Europe; it was more conducive to improving corporate governance and real sector
efficiency, attracting foreign capital and technology, and ultimately fueling Serbia's economic
growth. Finally, a significant amount o f time was devoted to development o f the necessary
regulatory framework, institutional capacity building, and preparation o f companies for
privatizationprior to actually offering them inthe market.

99.      Despite the impressive progress to date, the process o f ownership transformation i s
not yet complete. As noted above, the financially (and politically) damaging role o f the SOE
sector inthe Serbian economy i s highlighted by the continued prevalence o f direct and indirect
subsidies and soft budget constraints. The core o f the problem was in some 80 loss-making,
heavily indebted industrial conglomerates, which have been selected by the authorities, to
undergo organizational and/or financial restructuring under privatization through restructuring
method specified inthe Privatization Law, as they could not be sold intheir current condition.
Over the past three years significant progress was achieved with successful resolution o f 30 o f
these enterprises.

100.      Government Actions. Between 2001 and 2005, the Privatization Agency (PA),
supported by the Bank at both policy and technical level, achieved significant progress in
implementing the Government's privatization program. By the end of 2005, more than 1,200
SMEs hadbeen sold inauctions andcirca 60 large enterprises were sold through tenders, most
of them to international strategic investors. Notwithstanding the difficult political
environment, the overall scope, pace and transaction quality of these privatizations compared
favorably to similar stages of reform in other transition economies. Further, the progressive
trend has continued after the 2005, as reflected in the following table exhibiting results from
the period immediately following the previous operation (PPFDPC-1) as well as the results
achievedunder the current project (PFDPL):

101.      Overall, as of end-November 2008, Serbia has privatized over 2,400 companies,
ensuring improved corporate governance and significantly eliminating the demand for of
subsidies, and realized nearly EUR 2.9 billion inprivatization revenues since 2002. Further,
new owners have pledged nearly EUR 1.4 billion in investment plans, and over EUR 276
million in social programs, thus contributing both to future economic growth and social
cohesion.     It is important to note that the rate of privatization has not slowed down
significantly, despite the fact that the current PA portfolio is of much'lower quality than in
early years of privatization. As an illustration, the PA has beenselling enterprises via tenders
and auctions at an average rate of 18, 55, 21, 28, 26, and 34 enterprises per month in 2002,
2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. During the first two quarters of 2008, the
average monthly sales rate has stood at 24 enterprises a month.

102.      As stipulated in the recently amended Privatization Law, the GoS is committed to
offering for sale all SOEs currently in the PA tender and auction portfolio, and all saleable
assets from the restructuring portfolio, by end-2008. Inparallel, the SOEs that have failed the
market test through tender or auction three times will be subject to bankruptcy under the
improved insolvency regime. All unsold SOEs remaining inthe PA portfolio after the end of
2008 will be subject to compulsory liquidation.

103,     Auctions. The GoS is committed to complete the very successful auction privatization
program started in 2002. Some 750 SOEs remained on the'books of the PA's Auction Center
as of September 2008, includingalmost 300 enterprises that have beenclassified as candidates
for bankruptcy and/or liquidation. The current management of the PA has strengthened the
processing capacity of the Auction Center which resultedinmore companies being offered per
sale every month, and a higher success rate.

104.      Tenders. Bringing reputable strategic investors through the tender process for the
relatively attractive SOEs remains a priority for the GoS. At the moment there are 89 SOEs
are left in the PA's tender pipeline, including the non-core assets spun off from state utilities.

                                               26

With the help of TA funding, provided by the Bank and EAR, the PA has engaged
experienced financial advisors to prepare and execute tenders for these enterprises.

105.      Privatization through Restructuring. Completing the restructuring o f large loss-
making SOEs, andtheir subsequent divestiture through, as applicable, tender, auction, or asset
sale procedures, constitutes one o f the Government's key challenges. Assisted by the financial
advisors hired through the Bank and the EAR TA funding, the P A has been puttingto market
test most o f the SOEs on the restructuring list. The restructuring process has been given a
major impetus by the passage (in Spring 2005) of the debt restructuring amendments to the
Privatization Law, supported under PPFDPC-1. The amended law made possible the use o f
debt write-off by the state and state-controlled creditors against the future sale proceeds, to
enable the privatization o f heavily indebted large SOEs. To avoid generating moral hazard, the
debt restructuringwill become effective only at the moment o f sale. As a result, core assets of
at least 30 SOEs from the restructuring list were sold over the past three years.

106.      At the same time, in order to facilitate privatization and to mitigate the social cost of
the lay-offs resulting from the decreasing subsidies, the authorities continue to use the
Transition Fund (TF) resources to address the problem o f surplus labor at large SOEs. The
TF5represents a budgetary item which received a RSD 7.3 billion budget allocation in 2008,
as opposed to RSD 6.5 billion and RSD 9.95 billion in the 2006 and 2007 budgets,
respectively (a more detailed description o f the social assistance options supported by the TF
can be found in section VI, Poverty and Social Impacts). Experience has shown that the
necessary labor shedding needs to occur before privatization because the levels o f surplus
labor in large SOEs risk deterring investors altogether, or reducing the cash price offer to a
politically unacceptable level. It i s important to note the difference between the Government's
subsidy program and the severance payment financed by the TF: the former represents a
recurrent burden on the budget, the latter i s a one-time payment which allows companies to
decrease their labor force and wage bill, thus leading to a reduced subsidy need and ultimate
resolution of the enterprise. Finally, it i s important to note that Transition Fund, as it name
suggests, was set up as a temporary vehicle to assist the redundant workers during the
privatization process to finance their salaries, contributions/taxes, retraining and/or severance
payments, thus facilitating the enterprise sector reforms. After the privatization process i s
over, which will last for the next few years, this Fundwill be no longer needed.

107.      Bankruptcy of SOEs. Having an effective bankruptcy instrument is a prerequisite for
successful enterprise restructuring, and for the establishment of hard budget constraints with
regards to the SOE sector. The implementation o f the new bankruptcy law started on February
1, 2005 and the progress to date is encouraging. As o f end 2007, 392 bankruptcy
administrators have been trained to apply the new law and have received licenses. The
Bankruptcy Unit (BU) has been established within the P A to act as the bankruptcy
administrator o f insolvent socially- and state-owned enterprises. By end-September 2007, the
BU had more than 360 SOEs in its portfolio, two-thirds of which represented cases opened
under the newlaw.

108.     The Governmentfaces two major problems inits efforts to implement the Bankruptcy
Law. First, although the PABU can prepare a plan for restructuring and privatization through
bankruptcy, it does not have the authority to initiate the formal bankruptcy process. As in any


 Inreality, the "Transition Fund" is not a fundas it does not have either capital or personnel.
                                                       27

market oriented bankruptcy regime, the creditors are authorized to petition the courts and to
initiate bankruptcy proceedings against insolvent SOEs. However, few state creditors have
exercised this right over the first two years o f the new law's life. Another major problem i s
the insufficient (although improving) capacity o f the commercial courts to decide on the
resolution o f bankruptcy procedure.      To resolve first obstacle, the Government plans to
appoint dedicated bankruptcy units within state creditor bodies that would be capable o f
initiating and monitoring the bankruptcy process for multiple SOEs. In sum, the MoF i s
committed to take clear actions to speed up the initiation o f bankruptcy procedures against
unsaleable enterprises remaining inthe PA's portfolio. Inaddition, the recent amendments to
the Privatization Law provide for the option of a "forced liquidation" by the PA of companies
that do not start the privatization process by the endof 2008 incases where: (i)  announcement
o f public tendedauction has not been published; (ii)  the company (capital/assets) was not sold
even after the third attempt (tendedauction); and (iii) the entity subject to privatization
                                                           if
failed to submit its financial report to the business registration agency for two years in a row.
This new provision o f the law may require adopting by-laws regulating forced liquidation
procedure.

109.     Distribution of Shares to the Public. According to the 2001 Privatization Law, 70%
o f a company offered on tender was to be sold to a strategic investor to ensure sound corporate
governance, 15% was given to the workers (which in the Yugoslav model were de facto
owners), and 15% was designated for citizens who did not receive gratis shares as employees
of companies. Under the recently enacted Law on Citizens' Rights to Gratis Shares and Cash
Benefits inthe Privatization Process (hereinafter Law on Gratis Shares), those shares allocated
for the public (15%) in the industrial companies sold in tenders to date and held by the
Privatization Register are being sold in the market, and the proceeds will be distributed in
cash to the citizens entitled under that law. The Law on Gratis Shares (Article 12) provides
that the sale o f those shares will be conducted in an open and transparent manner by
competitive biddingto obtain the best prices for the citizens.

110.     The Law on Gratis Shares further provides that 15% o f the capital allocated for
citizens in the six large public utilities (NIS, Telekom Serbia, EPS, JAT, Airport, Galenika)
will be distributedto the eligible citizens. However, in view of the high value of the large
public utilities, the Government succeeded in convincing the trade unions to agree to the
provision in the Law on Gratis Shares which reduced the gratis allocation to present and
former employees o f those enterprises: they agreed to receive free shares inthe value o f EUR
200 per year o f service (for a maximum o f 35 years o f service) which i s expected not to
exceed 2.5% o f shares inpublic enterprises, incontrast to 15% inthe other enterprises.

111.     Privatization   of   state-owned enterprises. The corporatization and eventual
privatization o f public utilities i s a major challenge facing the Government in next several
years. The Government i s now selling 51% o f shares inNIS to a strategic investor, while its
attempt to sell majority stake in JAT has recently failed as no bids were received. Further,the
government i s planning to sell majority stake in Galenika as well, and to offer shares o f
Telekom Serbia, EPS, Airport, and perhaps other companies, through an initial public
offering. These planned actions require these public enterprises first to be converted into
companies through an incorporation process. Finally, the ongoing global financial crisis may
delay the implementation o f these plans. With Bank's assistance the government is, currently
starting a project to incorporate the state-owned companies and to amend the Law on Assets

of the Republic of Serbia adopted during the 1990s which created a legal anomaly stripping
the state-ownedenterprises of their assets.

112.    Bank AssessmenZlRecommendation.Notwithstanding impressive overall progress to
date, the following issues remain to be addressed by the GoS: (i)    completing the tender and
auction privatization program for SOEs currently in the PA's portfolio, with the objective to
offer for sale all saleable enterprises by end-2008; and (ii)using the improved bankruptcy
regime andthe powers of state-controlled creditors to resolve SOEs that fail the market test.

113.    Actions to be taken under the PFDPL: To this end, the Bank has agreed on the
following privatization and bankruptcytargets with the GoS and the PA, to be achieved inthe
timeframeof PFDPL:

        The GoS has enactedthe amendments to its PrivatizationLaw (dated December
        26, 2007) setting December 31, 2008 as the deadline for launching the
        privatizationprocessof SOEs;;

        least 40 socially owned enterprises and sold at least 15 of them; (b) offered for
        sale, through auctions at least 350 SOEs, and sold at least 40% of them; (c)
        offeredfor sale at least7 SOEs from the list of companies underrestructuringor
        companies of which a significant part thereof is under restructuring,using as
        applicable, tender, auction and asset sale procedures, and sold at least 4 SOEs
        from the said list;;

        Starting on September 1, 2007 Republic of Serbia-owned or controlled creditors will
        request the courts to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for: (i)at least 20 SOEs that
        have unsuccessfully been offered for sale through auction; and (ii)at least 2 SOEs
        that have unsuccessfully been offered for sale twice through tender;

        MOERD approves a transparent and competitive procedure, acceptable to the Bank,
        for the sale of shares from the Privatization Register proposed by Share Fund.

 114.    Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

Policy Area 2.3: Energy Sector Reform

115.    Serbia has a comprehensive energy industry controlled by state-owned companies:
EPS is in charge o f virtually all the power generation and distribution; EMS is the power
transmission company; N I S controls domestic production o f oil and gas, two refineries, and
petroleum products distribution systems including gasoline stations (largest operator);
Transnafia undertakes oil transportation; and Serbiagas i s one of two transmission companies
for natural gas. Serbian oil and gas reserves and production are small; coal reserves and
production are substantial. Domestic power production largely meets domestic demand for the
time being, and gas is imported from Russia. An import banfor petroleum products, expiring
at the end of 2010, gives market protection to the two refineries.

116.    Over the past few years, the Serbian energy sector has undertaken a considerable
amount o f investments; partially donor funded, and has, in the case o f electricity, made
progress in improving the supply system to a level that allowed reconnectionto the European
interconnected power network (UCTE) in 2004. In 2005, Serbia joined the EU-supported
Energy Community of Southeast Europe. The power and gas sectors have recently been
structured in compliance with EU's internal market regulations, i.e. transmission functions
have been separated from production, distribution, and sales activities. A regulatory agency
for energy was established in2005.

117.    The Serbian government gives considerable weight to energy security. Therefore, in
January 2008 an intergovernmental energy agreement was entered into with Russia. The
agreement, which establishes a framework for subsequent negotiation o f detailed agreements,
provides for the building o f a large transit pipeline for Russian natural gas across Serbia. The
agreement further involves the sale of a majority o f shares in N I S to Gazprom, a majority
state-owned Russian oil and gas company. Furthermore, Russian financial support in
developing gas storage in Serbia i s part o f the framework agreement.

118.    One o f the major and costly challenges facing the Serbian energy sector i s the
replacement o f retiring power generation units and the addition o f new generation capacity to
meet increasing national and, potentially, regional demand for power. In agreement with the

                                                 30

Bank under this PFDPL operation, the government will decide through its approval of EPS'
Business Plan 2008-2012, on a strategy and time-bound action plan inwhich the private sector
would take majority control of and manage major power generation assets to be built during
the coming 5-7 years. The Bank considers this an important step in the direction of creating a
more competitive market environment inthe power sector of Serbia and the region.

119.     NIS refineries in Pancevo and Novi Sad are uncompetitive until major investments
can be undertaken. The government keeps the refineries in operation through market
protection inthe form o f a temporary import ban on petroleum products. The government has
agreed under this PFDPL that the lifting of the import ban and the introduction of full, open
competition inpetroleum products shall take place no later than December 31, 2010.

120.      End-user tariffs for electricity and gas have been raised significantly over the last
several years but are not yet covering costs, and payment collections of only about 80 percent
from household electricity consumers add to the financial strain in the sector.                The
government recognizes the substantial financial requirements to maintain gas and power
systems, to undertake environmental investments, and to expand supply capacities. It has
therefore agreed, in the context of this PFDPL, to implement gradual tariff adjustments to
reachcost-recovering tariffs for electricity and natural gas no later than in20106.

121.      The government and the management of EPS recognizes that the power utility will
have to enhance its operational efficiency and undertake some further restructuring inorder to
utilize its resources in the best possible way and to prepare for the competitive pressures in
generation and marketing that are emerging in the Energy Community of South East Europe.
A major efficiencyhestructuring study has been undertaken for EPS by international
consultants. Guided by such expertise, the government plans to adopt a strategy and time-

facilitation of private sector participation in the power sector in mind. Finally, EPS
management board has endorsed 2008-2012 business plan in July 2008 and sent it to the
MinistryofMiningandEnergy for GoS approval.

122.      Pollution from the consumption of low quality petroleum products i s considered a
serious problem in Serbia. In 2008, the government plans to develop a timed action plan for
introducing EU-basedpetroleum product quality standards and to agree with the Bank on such
a planunder the 2009 follow-up operation of the PFDPL.

IndependentAudit Institution

Policy Area 2.4: State Audit Institution

125.     Budget System Law prescribes that final accounts will be subject to external audit.
However, final accounts for the years 2002-2007 have not been audited. In order to register
improvementsinthis area, the Law on state Audit Institution was adopted inNovember 2005
with a view to establishing an independent and competent body responsible for the audit o f
public sector accounts. With some delay, a five member Council, as the highest body o f State
Audit Institution (SAI), was appointed inlate September 2007 under provisions o fthe Law on
SAI. According to the Law, the Council is obliged to submit to the Parliament operations
manual, work program and annual plan within three months from the establishment o f the
Council, hence the due date being late December 2007. Draft documents were submitted to
the Parliamentbythe due date. The documents were reviewedbythe Bankand are found to be
acceptable to our standards. A reasonable SA1budget was included as a separate line item in
the 2008 budget of the Republic of Serbia and adopted by the Parliament. Further,the same
policy has continued as reflected inthe 2009 draft budget o fthe Republic o f Serbia.

126.     In the medium-term, reasonable progress should be made towards making the SA1
fully functional. This would include securing adequate premises and equipment, employing
the sufficient qualified staff, adopting the Audit Manual specifying work methodology,
training the core staff, and commencing audits in accordance with the program o f work
submittedto the Parliament. In addition, audit of 2007 government accounts, performed by
the SA1or its agent, should be submitted to the Parliament. Finally, full implementation o f
the Law on State Audit Institution should be achieved, providing sufficient resources and
capacity buildingfor the SA1to perform all o f its responsibilities and procedures inrelationto
auditees covered by the Law. Corresponding to that, the audit o f 2008 accounts should be
submittedto the Parliament.

PILLARI11 Buildinga moreefficientand stable financialsector
              -

129.    Thanks to an aggressive reform program, supported by three World Bank lending
operations, the banking and insurance sectors have grown sharply and undergone a
fundamental shift in ownership. State ownership in banks and insurance companies has been
significantly reduced to approximately 17.2% and 34% of total banking and insurance assets
respectively. To complete the privatization of the sectors, the Management Board of the
Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA - which i s also in charge of privatization of the financial
sector) will approve a strategy for each bank and insurance company with state and socially
owned capital. NBS has also taken steps to enhance market confidence by capitalizing the
deposit insurance fund, strengthen the legal framework, and enhance supervision. Finally, in
an effort to strengthen the capital markets regulatory and supervisory regime, the GoS has
drafted amendmentsto the Securities Law.

Policy Area 3.1: Resolution of state-owned banks (SOB) and the divestmentoffinancial
assets (non-performing loans and equities) and deposit insurance capitalization

130.    Privatization and the divestment of state-owned banks and financial assets have
progressed substantially since PPFDPC-1 and, as a result, state's ownership of the banking
sector has been reducedto 15 % oftotal banking systemassets as of end 2007. Going forward,
the major challenge will be to sustain the privatization process, especially ina context where
the banks left for sale are not as attractive as those that have beenprivatized inthe first rounds
andthe crisis has driven investors from the financial sector.

131.    A number of actions have beenundertaken by GoS inthe past couple of years. First,
in2006, the DIA successfully completed the privatization ofthree banks.It sold 99.4% ofthe
share capital of Vojvodjanska Bank to the National Bank of Greece, 87.39% of the share
capital of Panonska Bank to San Paolo IMI from Italy, and 89.29% of Niska Bank to OTP
Bank from Hungary. In the same year DIA sold 25% of Cacanska Bank and Komercijalna
bank to EBRD. In accordance with the shareholders agreement, both shareholders will be
selling their shares by 2009 and 2010 respectively. The shareholders also committed to
implementing an institutional development plan inbothbanks untilthen. As a result RoS still
has ownership in nine banks (see table 4 below), which account for 17.2% of assets, 20% of
deposits and 15.9% of equity inthe banking sector. Secondly, in2007, DIA launchedthe sale
of 6 packages of non-performing loans (NPLs) of bankrupt banks inthe total amount of RSD
433,424,670.38 and USD 35,342,978.93. Only one NPL package inthe total amount of USD
11,121,516.4 was sold for USD 1,107,000 in January 2008 while there were no offers for
other NPL packages. Despite this, DIA will continue working on resolution of the remaining
NPLs in its portfolio. Thirdly, in 2008, the DIA developed a privatization strategy for all the
banks and insurance companies that still have state or socially owned capital. The strategy
                                                  33

proposed a three pronged approach for the sale of banks and insurance companies in which
RoS has the majority shares, for banks inwhich RoS has the minority shares, and for banks in
which RoS is a majority shareholder together with EBRD. Given the recent financial crisis
and abrupt deterioration of global financial sentimenttowards the region, the Strategy is being
updated to reflect recent market developments and available privatization and restructuring
options.

   RoS and
    EBRD

132.    Finally, to increase market confidence, the government transferred RSD 700 million
to the DIA and thus increased the capital of Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.18 percent of
insurable deposits, against a set target of 5 percent.

133.    Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:

    0  Strategy for banks and insurance companies with ROS ownership i s developed;

    0  Pre-qualification for bidders for second tender of non-performing loans of bankrupt

        accordingto the agreed schedule;


    0   Resolution o f all 223 non-performing loans o f bankrupt banks completed.

Policy Area 3.2: Strengthening the insurancesector regulation and resolution regime

135.     The government and NBS have been effective to date inmoving the insurance sector
reform agenda forward. Significant and substantive transformation marked the Serbian
insurance sector in 2007. During this time, the market has experienced consolidation,
increased share of foreign ownership, and significant growth. While the volume o f the gross
insurance premium written (GPW) in2007 has increased from 38.3 to the estimated 45 billion
dinars, the number of insurance companies active in the market declined from 40 to 21 (18
insurance licenses were revoked by the NBS, 5 companies undertook voluntary liquidation,
there was 1 merger, 1 company transformed to a pension fund and 6 new greenfield licenses
were issued). Currently, 13 out o f 21 insurers are foreign owned. With the completion o f the
recent sale o f DDOR to Fondiaria (Italy), Dunav will remain the only government-owned
company in the market, accounting for slightly over 30 percent o f the insurance premium
written. At the same time, the quality o f the insurers' balance-sheets has seen considerable
improvement. Further, the quality o f insurance supervision has improved as evidenced by the
introduction of licensing requirements for insurance agents (128 institutional licenses were
revoked and 154 new issued), the launch o f a comprehensive regulatory framework (20 by-
laws were issued), improved market transparency and commencement o f pro-active on-site
and off-site market supervision.

136.     The matters still outstanding tendto involve multiple constituencies and will require a
degree o f negotiation to finalize. Government's key achievements have been the privatization
of DDOR, closure and liquidation o f more than a dozen insolvent insurance companies,
significant achievements o f the turn around work in Dunav, including the completion o f an
independent actuarial review o f its liabilities, introduction of centralized IT systems for cash
and claim management and reorganization o f its business operations along functional lines,
improved quality of insurance regulations and insurance supervision.

137.     All regulations required under the new Insurance Law have now been produced and
amendments passed to enable the privatization o f the socially owned insurers. In addition, a
law dealing with bank and insurer bankruptcy and liquidation has come into force (No. 61/
2005). The major outstanding piece o f insurance related legislation is the Motor Third Party
Liability Law (MTPL). Key areas to be addressed before the MTPL Law can be finalized are
the mode of funding o fthe MTPL Guarantee Fund.The MOF has provided a draft law to The
World Bank which appears to be largely inline with current practice inthe region.

138.     The other major challenge is the extent o f work required to maintain the
competitiveness of Dunav prior to its privatization or at minimum, a sale of sizeable stake to a
strategic investor. Actions taken to date by management have been successful so far in
maintaining the company's market share and improving its profitability and solvency. To a

                                                 35

large extent, these noticeable improvements inthe financial performance of the company have
been the result of a newly installed IT system that enable it to centralize cash and claims
management and restructure its operations along functional lines. Yet, due to the growing
competition from several private players with global brand names, the ability of the company
to successfully compete is impaired by the lack of operational experience and appropriate IT
systems that are neededto run a highly cost efficient distribution network enjoyed by several
other players inthe market.

139.     Aside from the adoption of a new MTPL Law and privatization (or a partial sale to a
strategic investor) of the last remaining socially owned insurer, key outstanding matter relates
to the liberalization of the reinsurance segment of the market, which can be facilitated by
selling an equity stake inDunav Reto a strategic investor.

140.     Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:

    0   Run-offMTPL liabilities of bankrupt insurers have been computed and an action plan
        to fund the liabilities is developed;


    0   MTPL Law has beendrafted and subjectedto public debate;


    0   DDORprivatizationhasbeen completed;

    0   Dunav's liabilities have beenfully quantifiedthrough an independent actuarial review;


    0   Dunav's strategic restructuring plan is being implemented in accordance with the
        agreedperformance indicators.

141.     Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

    0   Run-off MTPL liabilities of bankrupt insurers have beenfunded;


    0   MTPL Law has been approvedby GoS and submittedto the Parliament;

    0   Privatization of Dunav Re through a sale of an equity stake to a reputable foreign
        reinsurerhas beeninitiated;


    0   Preparation for sale of an equity stake in Dunav to a strategic investor has been
        initiated.


Policy Area 3.3: Enhancingprudential supervision of the banking sector

142.     To enhance prudential supervision a number of steps have been taken by the
government and NBS. First a new Law on Banks became effective on October 1, 2006. The
Law includes the introduction of a risk based supervisory approach and consolidated
supervision; thus capturing many of the regulatory issues cited by the 2005 FSAP. The Law
has been further supported by the adoptiodamendment of regulations. These included, inter
alia, requirementson bank disclosure and pricing, `know your client' directives, updating of
capital adequacyhegulatory solvency requirements, new guidelines on external auditing
requirements, and updated guidance on conducting bank supervision. Recent additions
                                               36

included procedures related to an updated supervision operating policy and the updating of
corrective/remedial action procedures. New bank licensing procedures were also recently
issued, as well as an IFRS-compliant chart of banking accounts for regulatory reporting and
regulations on capital requirements for foreign exchange and other marketrisks.

143.     NBShas also focused on improving and formalizing the processof supervision. First
the concept and implementation of the bank supervisory cycle has been refined and the
internal working procedures of bank supervision have been upgraded. Second, supervisory
strategies and associated regulations are more frequently updated, and, together with recently
adopted risk matrices, form an increasingly enhanced picture of each banks' risk profile.
Third, the role and reliance on the internal Senior Supervisory Oversight Committee is
increasing in stature and visibility, which in turn, assists in objective and informed
supervisory decisions. Finally, the staffing levels have been augmented and staff has received
more extensive training.

144.     Additionally,  new regulations on loan/asset classifications,             bank liquidity
requirements, and consolidated financial group reporting including the requisite capital
adequacy requirementshave beenapproved.

         Actions to be taken under the PFDPL:

        The Key SDP and Regulatory objectives have been met. In particular NBS has: (i)
        disseminated an updated Supervision Operating Policy; (ii)revised the Manual on
        corrective/remedial actions; (iii) a new bank licensing manual; and a new IFRS
                                          issued
        compliant chart of accounts; (iv) issued capital adequacyrequirementsto cover market
        and forex risks; loadasset classification; and liquidity requirements; and (iv)
        introduced consolidated financial group reporting (andsupporting CAR regulations).

         Proposed actionsfor future PFDPL operations (triggers are bolded):

        TheNBShas finalized aBasel I1implementationroadmap;

       NBShas establisheda framework for-and         first trial version of its Financial Stability

PolicyArea 3.4: Developing CapitalMarkets


147.      Serbian capital market remains relatively underdeveloped and lags behind the
banking and insurance sector in pursuing reforms that require a comprehensive national
strategy to address a range o f development agendas, from revision o f legislation to
improvement in supervision. However, to fulfill the market functions efficiently in terms o f
reliability of execution and settlement o f transactions, as well as the integrity of ownership
records at the Central Depositary - a completely new continuous trading system was
introduced in January 2008 with a capacity to handle greater volumes. Out o f 1,778
companies traded (the trading facility i s not a listing) at the Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE),
only about 100 companies are traded actively. Only 4 meet full listing requirements; no major
capital raising IPO has beenmade due to the expense, complexity, andthe delay inobtaining a
full listing. Despite this, the trading volumes are quite large, and inthe Balkans interms of
market capitalization, the BSE i s second only to Zagreb, a much longer established market
where market capitalization is dominated by major telecoms companies. Ifplans to proceed
with the IPOs of public enterprises identified inthe Law on Gratis Shares are implemented,
market capitalization will double and the range of choice, liquidity, and volumes of trading
will increase considerably.

148.      In terms o f government securities, the major Dinar denominated marketable
instruments are short term bills issued by the MoF and NBS with a maturity o f less than six
months. Treasury bonds with longer maturities are totally held by NBS. Though frozen
foreign currency bonds (FFCBs) are traded, providing regular market turnover, more than a
third o f value has already been redeemed and the remainder will be redeemed inthe coming
years, with the final issue being redeemed in 2016. The market o f government bonds
denominated in dinars i s expected to shrink due to the government's continued prudent fiscal
policy, although a major expansion o fbondmarkets is beingplanned.

149.      The almost nonexistent primary market for equities and corporate bonds deprives the
Serbian firms o f access to either equity or long-term dinar debt financing because most bank
lending i s short-term foreign currency denominated or indexed. The size o f the domestic
marketable government securities is too small for a viable market, accounting for less than 4%
o f GDP, although the total public debt over GDP reached 50 percent. The current Treasury
and NBS bills form segmented markets with a different discount rate o f 15 percent and 25
percent respectively, due to a strict sterilization monetary policy, thus hindering the
establishment o f a reference rate in the debt market. The absence o f long term government
bonds in local currency is a major impediment for the private sector's issuance o f debt
securities.

150.      As in many other transitional economies, the privatization reform to date has
produced little impact on development o f the equity market beyond secondary trading o f
minorities in companies sold by tender and the long tail o f shares owned by over 1 million
citizens as a result o f several previous privatization attempts. Establishment o f a robust
institutional and legal environment will require adequate government policies. As to the
secondary market, the number o f tradable shares i s being constantly reduced as a result o f
"takeover" activities, since new supply o f (quality) shares does not occur through initial and
secondary public offerings. Due to the non-existence o f government bond trading, there i s no
reliable yield curve of risk free securities. As a result, the nascent industry of insurance and

                                               38

private pensions suffers from the dearth o f investable assets and reference tool to evaluate
their investments. Moreover, in the absence o f an effective regulation and enforcement
system, corporate abuses amongst public companies continue to undermine the investors'
confidence in the stock exchange. Acute problems in the Serbian capital market are the legal
and regulatory framework for the protection of shareholders rights. Currently, the Securities
Commission (SC) has four enforcement officers and five legal staff out o f 45 staff in total,
which falls far short o f covering 150 brokers and traders licenses in about 80 brokerage firms
and the 12 asset management companies licensedunder the new Investment FundsAct.

151.     Strengthen the Legal Framework: The GoS i s making significant progress in
enhancing the legal framework. The Takeover Act and Investment FundsAct were adopted by
Parliament in 2006 and detailed implementation regulations have been issued. The revisions
of the Takeover Act shouldbe designedto make the takeover process more efficient and more
transparent allowing investors greater decision making power in deciding whether or not to
accept a takeover bid. The GoS will take further reform measures in amending the Securities
Act, which i s being subjected to both short term emergency amendments and longer term full
review. The emergency revisions to the Securities Act (SA), prepared in close collaboration
with market participants, have been approved by GoS and submitted to the Parliament. The
main improvements to be put in place through the new SA will be made in the areas of: (i)
improving prospectus for fuller disclosure; (ii)shifting the issuance regulation to disclosure
system; (ii)clarifying and extending legal authority o f the SC; (iii)   re-defining connected
person o f inside trading; (iv) allowing for the brokerage houses to open client accounts. A
comprehensive revision will take place later in 2008. When the full new SA i s enacted with
above-mentioned two critical securities related laws, the Serbian capital market would align
more closely to IOSCO core principles and EUdirectives.

152.     Improve the Government Bond Market: The GoS has made progress in debt
management and domestic debt market development. In 2005, the Treasury Sector was
merged with the Public Payment Agency to form a separate agency under the MOF. A new
Public Debt Law was enacted in July 2005, allowing the M o F to: (i)issue domestic
government securities indinars to refinance FFS; (ii) issue securities longer than one year; and
(iii)possiblyrestructure thepensiondeficit withmarketable government securities. TheIT
based public debt management will be further strengthened with support o f the European
Agency for Reconstruction. The GoS will have to resolve the market fragmentation o f
Treasury bills and NBS bills through gradually migrating from issuingNBS bills to auctioning
add-on T-bills. Measures to encourage the development o f both government and corporate
bond markets are underway and a working group, set up by the Ministry o f Finance, will
report with recommendations in March 2008. It aims to strengthen the regulatory capacity,
build capacity for major public offerings, and harmonize tax regimes between public and
private sector securities. It will provide inter alia recommendations for comprehensive
improvements inthe procedures for issuance o f longer term government bonds, corporate and
infrastructure bonds.

153.     Enhance the Regulatory Capacity: The SC has an ambitious plan for improving its
institutional capacity through IT investment and staff training supported by the USAID TA
program. When the budget is approved by the Parliament, the SC would launch a new
business plan aiming at (i)strengthening the institutional effectiveness, (ii)enhancing the
accountability, and (iii)improvingawareness and professional capacity o fmarket participants.
The adequate financing is critical for enhanced capacity building and better compensation -
                                              39

making it financially self-supporting i s a fine idea in principle, but in practice, may result in
excessive fees, inadequate staffing and low salaries because the securities market i s not yet big
enough to support it financially.

154.     Promote Public offerings: The Government is considering the launch o f a public
offering to promote new issuance o f securities. The Share Fund (SF) hiredboth financial and
legal advisors to evaluate the marketability o f its shareholdings and effects o f a potential
capital increase of several leading public enterprises with full cooperation o f the incumbent
management. The SF has identified five preliminary candidate companies in its portfolio for
potential sale. The shares o f state-owned banks and insurance companies, and public utility
companies are being proposed in the Law on Gratis Shares as candidates for public offering
and listing on the BSE in a capital raising exercise. Public offerings of government shares
could serve as a benchmark for future equity financing o f the local firms as well as create a
demonstration effect for the local individual investors and bring in both local and foreign
institutional investors attracted by better quality companies with greater liquidity.

155.     Introduce a Neutral Tax System or Private Sector Securities: Within the broad
context of pending 2006 tax reforms, the GoS is prepared to revamp the taxation system
concerning the capital market so as to remove distortionary effects on private sector securities,
as currently government shares and debt instruments and NBS bills are exempt from all
taxation. First, three key tax laws will have been amended to introduce a neutral tax system;
the property tax, corporate income tax, and personal income tax. Under the proposed tax
reforms, private securities will be treated equally with the government securities in terms of
interest and dividend incomes, capital gains, and transactions. Second, tax treatments o f the
securities incomes and transactions o f non-residents will be streamlined. Third, new tax rules

international standards.

                            V.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS


158.      As of end-June 2008, Serbia posted over EUR 2.8 billion in privatization revenues
since 2002. More than 2,300 companies were sold in tenders and actions and on the capital
market, with buyers pledging over EUR 1.2 billion in investment plans, and over EUR 276
millioninsocial programs.

159.      Since the latest stage of reform began in 2001, job losses have been large, as Serbia
has embarked on a program of restructuring and privatization. At the same time, job creation
inthe private sector has been slow, despite fairly strongeconomic growth inrecentyears. Like
many other transition countries, Serbia has been facing a "job loss growth" in recent years.
According to the data of the semi-annual employment survey conducted by the Statistical
Office, the total number of employedhas declined from 2.521 million employed in September
2006 to 2.502 million in September 2007. The decline was due to reduction inthe number of
employees in enterprises, institutions and organizations from 1.447 million to 1.428 million
while the number of individual entrepreneurs, self-employed, and agricultural workers has
been relatively stable. At the same time, the unemployment rate has, according to the labor
force survey data, decreased from 21.8 percent in 2005 to 18.8 percent in 2007 (aged 15-64)
but the rate is still more than double the EU-27average.The reforms supportedby PFDPL are
expected in the medium term to lead to job creation and a more efficient allocation of labor.
However, the same reforms are also likely to result in a transitory increase in unemployment
as some 850 socially owned enterprises have yet to go private. However, it is important to
note that while privatization i s initially always a net destroyer of jobs, in the long run it
contributes to job sustainability and growth. Moreover, the empirical studies conducted in
Serbia have shown the increase in productivity of privatized firms, while the employment in
some socially owned enterprises prior to privatization was only formal, as a lot of them did
not pay regular salaries and/or contributions.

160.      Therefore, it is important that the social impacts of the privatization and the
restructuring of SOEs be mitigated and, consequently, political support for ongoing and
planned reforms can be maintained. It is also important, at the same time, that social
protection measures are designed in a fiscally sustainable manner and provide strong
incentives against relying on welfare transfers and for finding gainful employment.

161.      To mitigate the welfare and employment impact of the ongoing and expected SOE
reforms, the GoS introduced the Social Program' in 2002. In July 2005, the Social Program
was revised, changing the benefit formula for extended severance payments, and offering
three (lump-sum) options for redundant workers: (i)         remuneration amounting to 10 average
gross wages in the Republic in the industry sector for employees with more than 10 years of
insurance record; (ii)remuneration amounting to Euro 100 per year of service in Dinar
equivalent; and (iii)   severance pay according to the Labor Law.

Preparation for Privatization
                                                  41

162.        Since its inception, the Social Program has provided support to around 172,600
redundant workers (2002-2007) through this mechanism. However, only a portion o f all the
redundantworkers are supportedby the Social Programwhile others receive regular severance
according to the Labor code. In2002-2004, mostly big SOEs dominated among the recipients
o f its funds. Starting 2005, the list o f enterprises approved for funds includes also a number o f
state-owned utilities. During 2007, 214 enterprises and 22,700 redundant workers benefited
from the Social Program.* The average redundancy payment in Serbia equals to about US$
2,100 which i s far more generous compensation package than the registered unemployed with
insurance record can claim. The benefits offered though the Social Program in Serbia are in
line with many other countries in the region: the Czech Republic spends about US$2000,
Hungary US$2500 and Poland US$37OO9per redundant worker for severance payments and
additional training benefits.

163.        In 2004-2006, tracer surveys of workers made redundant from 2002-2003 were
conducted inPancevo, Kraljevo, Nis and Lazarevac, and they provided important insights into
the Government Social Program. The workers with longer tenure, and respectively older
workers dominated among the displaced workers. For example, in Pancevo, over 25 percent
o f displaced workers had job tenure o f over 30 years, and only 6 percent, less than 10 years.
By their job profile, most displaced workers were blue collar workers with narrowly
specialized skills. This made their redeployment a more challenging tasks. The largest share
o f redundant workers included craftsmen, plant and machine operators and assemblers,
elementary occupations workers, and office clerks. Most redundant workers had very low
salaries prior to dismissal, and 81 percent o f them earned less than Euro 100 per months (in
2003, average net salaries inthe country were around Euro170, and in2002, around Euro150).
This indicates that many o f them may not have been fully employed prior to dismissal or were
on administrative leave.

164.        As for the current labor market status, the largest number o f displaced workers who
were surveyed in 2006 and who were beneficiaries o f the Social Program, remained
unemployed (64 percent); 5 percent have remained out o f the labor market, whereas 31
percent found new employment; 18 percent out o f those who found new employment are now
working in the private sector, five percent in the public sector, whereas another five percent
developed their own business and three percent o f the redundant workers are involved in
casual jobs.

165.        As shown in paragraph 104 above, the GoS is committed to using the SP as an
instrumentto reduce the level o f excess employment in large SOEs in preparation for their
privatization. Therefore, it is important that the TF continues to receive adequate resources,
while recurrent subsidies to SOE sector are reduced. In reflection o f these needs, the
Government almost doubled allocations to the Program between 2004 and 2006 to over 6
billon dinars, and increased these expenditures to 9.971 billion dinars (about EUR 125
million) in2007. Inaddition, the Government intendsto clear up the arrears incash payments
for severance from the Transition Fundaccumulated over the past years.




* It is estimatedthat around one fifth of workers inenterprises includedinto the Government Social Program are
made redundant and benefit from the program.
9 It is limited to afew coal mining sector enterprises only.
                                                        42

166.    Inaddition to the Social Programdescribed above the GoS provides social assistance,
including cash benefits and services, to poor households. The main social assistance benefits
are: (i)MOP - Material Support to Families whose income i s lower than the guaranteed
"social security level", and (ii)child allowances - cash transfers to poor households with
children, includingthe families o f redundantworkers.

167.     The workers, who are not included into the Government Social Program, are entitled
to an unemployment benefit. The duration o f benefit payment varies from three months, ifthe
insurer has been insured for the period o f 1 to 5 years, to 24 months ifthe insurer i s older than
55 years and has been insured for the period longer than 25 years. The benefit size i s 50-60
percent (depending on the duration) o f the average earnings inthe month before employment
contract was terminated. All redundant workers and employees are entitledto ALMPs, such as
training and retraining programs, self-employment assistance, counseling and training for
business start-ups, reassignment to other jobs, etc. In 2006, ALMPs covered about 398,700
unemployed persons, or about two fifth of the average number o f registered unemployed.
However, funds available for these additional activities especially by NES are limited.

168.     The Bank i s providing two types o f assistance to the Government to mitigate the
social impact o f redundancies resulting from corporate restructuring, privatization and
bankruptcies: (i)  general budget support through the programmatic loan series in order to
reduce the short-term fiscal pressures generated by severance payments, and (ii)technical
advice and funding offered through various ongoing and planned investment operations. In
particular, the Employment Promotion Project (EPP; 2003-2006) supported the GoS in
designing and the implementing enterprise-based labor redeployment programs, provided
through Worker Transition Centers which act as a resource center providing information on
workers' redeployment options and options related to the Government's Social Program, and
assist in implementation o f enterprise social plans. As part o f the EPP project, 13 such pilot
Transition Centers were launched in enterprises undergoing privatization which provided
counseling services and training to over 18,000 workers. The planned Bor Regional
Development Project would support social mitigation measures aimed at redundant workers,
and creation o f new sources o f diversified growth and employment in one o f Serbia's poorest
regions.

169.     Building on our fruitful policy dialogue in this area (through SACS 1 and 2 and
SOSAC), in 2006 the Bank conducted a labor market study and a study on social protection
system in Serbia that informed the design o f public sector development policy loan and a
potential social sector operations. Policy and procedural advice provided to the GoS will be
based partially on these studies, as well as, on projections concerning the expected fiscal
implications o f future layoffs.

170.     Given that the Serbia country program includes operations explicitly dealing with
mitigation of social consequences o f reforms, PFDPL will not include conditionality directly
influencing labor legislation and social policy. In the longer term, however, PFDPLs will
assist the Government to reduce poverty through creating the necessary conditions for
accelerated economic growth. First, strengthened fiscal discipline and divestiture o f state and
socially-owned assets will improve resource allocation and the country's growth prospects,
and will also reduce the risk o f macroeconomic shocks, which disproportionately affect the
poor. Second, reform measures directed at improving the business climate will create the basis
for investments neededfor medium-term growth and employment creation, and thus for more

                                                43

sustainedpoverty reduction. Third, policy efforts aimed at building a more efficient and stable
financial sector will underpin economic growth and increase the resilience of the Serbian
economy to potential adverse shocks-both          of which are prerequisites for increasing
employment andreducing poverty.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION
171.      The MOF will be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed
operation and for reporting process and coordinating actions among other concerned
ministries and agencies. The Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the
implementation of the proposed operation, as well as the subsequent actions of the GoS
program by using the short term and the overall program outcomes outlined in the Policy
Matrix.

172.      At the same time, the overall status of the GoS program will be monitored during
supervision to determine whether the specific conditions of the proposed operation have
changed. In addition, supervision missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the
policy dialogue with the institutions involved in the implementation of the reform program,
but will also ensure synergieswith other donors to avoid conflicting advice to the Government
inthe policyandtechnical areas involvedinthe reforms.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

173.      This fiduciary information section and the set of agreed fiduciary measures included
below for the operation draw on the findings and recommendations of the 2007 Integrated
Public Financial Management Assessment (IPFMA) and assessment of more recent
developmentsinthe public financial managementsystemfor Serbia.

174.      Public financial management (PFM) system: A Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and a Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) were completed in 2002 and 2003. The initial
diagnostic was updated inJune 2005 with a PEIR Update and a Fiduciary Assessment Update
(FAU) for public financial management and procurement. Integrated Public Financial
ManagementAssessment (IPFMA) was publishedinFebruary 2007.

175.      The overall conclusion of the IPFMA suggests that despite the recent public
disclosure of basic fiscal and budget execution data, the lack of transparency and operating
checks andbalances inpublic finance still appear to be an overarching problem in Serbia. This
i s reflected in the relative poor performance on several PFM performance indicators relating
to internal and external audit, internal control and predictability of funds availability.
Significant steps have been taken towards strengthening PFM, such as modernization of the
central treasury'system incorporating a single treasury account and new integrated financial
managementinformation system, the establishmentof a central unit inthe Ministry of Finance
responsible for internal audit, and the establishment of the State Audit Institution Council in
September 2007. Further improvements in financial controls have been proposed and are
awaiting finalization of the new Budget System Law, currently under development. While
these efforts are encouraging, this assessment suggests that much remains to be done to
strengthen transparency and accountability in PFM in Serbia and strong Government
leadership of the ongoing reforms will be required to bring Serbia at par with other EU-
aspiring countries inthe region.
                                               44

176.     The IPFMA suggests that the fiduciary risks associated with the PFM system inSerbia
are high. Whereas some o f the greatest fiduciary risks are associated with poor performance in
the areas o f external financial reporting, external auditing and the extent o f unreported
government operations, significant risks are also associated with the public procurement
system, the stock o f expenditure arrears and internal control and internal audit systems. The
IPFMA also suggests that attention need to be paid to specific anti-corruption measures.

177.      Mitigating fiduciary risks will require strong and sustained commitment towards
transparency and accountability in budget management. The government has taken steps to
strengthen budget execution and reporting arrangements and i s developing improved
arrangements for public internal financial control and audit as part o f its pre-accession
program. Establishment o f the SA1 Council and provision o f separate budget allocation in
2008 was a positive step, but not sufficient to provide an effective external audit function to
date.

178.      The operation will support the further actions required to attain acceptable fiduciary
arrangements. Thus, the following actions have occurred: (i)the Institution has presented
acceptable Operations Manual (rules and regulations) and has submitted it to the Parliament;
and (ii) acceptable first annual plan and work program have been submitted by the SA1to the
Parliament's Finance Committee; (iii) Institution's 2008 budget as separate line item inthe
                                        the
Budget of the Republic o f Serbia has been adopted by the Parliament. Draft documents were
submitted to the Parliament within agreed timeframe. The documents were reviewed and
found acceptable to the Bank. Reasonable SA1budget as a separate line item i s included in
2008 budget o fthe Republic of Serbia adopted by the Parliament.

179.      Dependingupon the progress achieved inimplementingthe agreed fiduciary reforms,
additional public financial management fiduciary pre-conditions may be formulated to
address, inter alia: (a) the extent o f unreported Government funded operations and
transparency o f government financial reporting; (b) public procurement arrangements; (c)
internal control and audit; (d) implementation o f the Modernized Treasury System and (e)
anti-corruption measures.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING


180.      Borrower and Loan Amount: The Borrower i s the Republic o f Serbia. This operation
i s a single-tranche loan. The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic o f Serbia.

181.      Disbursement: Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank o f the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and Serbia, the Borrower will submit
a withdrawal application to the IBRD. At the request o f the MOF, the IBRD will deposit the
proceeds o f the loan into the designated account at the National Bank o f Serbia (NBS) which
forms part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves. This account will be managed
by and subject to control o f the MOF. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the
Loan into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in local currency to the Single
Treasury Account (ifthey use one) also kept inNBS and that is available to finance budgeted
expenditures.
                                              45

182.      If, after depositing funds in the dedicated foreign currency deposit account at the
NBS, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan
Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (i)               return that amount to the account
for use for eligible purposes; or (ii)      refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which case the
Bank will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount o f the loan.

183.      Auditing: Due to nature o f the DPL, being a single tranche transaction intended to
supplement general Republic of Serbia budget funds, and considering the unqualified audit
findings on NBS financial statements, no specific auditing arrangements are provided in the
loan agreement. The Bank does, however, require a confirmation from the Government on
movements into and out o f the designated account, including dates and details within 30 days
following any and all transactions. The corrective actions taken by the National Bank of
Serbia to safeguard funds inthe foreign exchange account are deemed adequate.lo


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

184.      The major pillars o f the PFDPL have been assessed for likely significant effects on
the environment, forests and natural resources under the requirements o f the World Bank's OP
8.60. The principal concerns inthe sectors supported under PFDPL arise from the handlingo f
environmental liabilities (e.g. water, air and waste emissions) from past and current operations
caused by socially- owned enterprises (SOEs), including especially inthe energy sector, being
privatized or allowed to go bankrupt.The screening also noted that one possible impact from
electricity tariff increases could be an increase in uncontrolled wood cutting. Discussion o f
these issues immediately follows a review o f the institutional and legal framework for
environmental management below.

185.      The environmental legal framework for environmental management in Serbia has
undergone significant reform along the lines o f the EU acquis, however, enforcement and
implementation still need substantial strengthening.                  Four key environmental laws were
adopted in recent years: Law on Environmental Protection, Law on Environmental Impact
Assessment, Law on Strategic Environmental Assessment, and Law on Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control. Further,new law on waste management has also been drafted. Serbia
has also signed the South Eastern European Energy Community Treaty which subjects it to
key pieces o f the acquis, notably the Large Combustion Plants Directive. This directive places
restrictions on local pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate
matter). Serbia has also recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Government o f Serbia has



lo IMFconductedasafeguardsassessmentoftheNationalBankofYugoslavia (now NBS) inNovember
   The
2001 and concluded that substantial risks may exist in the financial reporting framework, internal audit
mechanism, and system o f internal controls. The mission proposed a series of measures to address the identified
weaknesses. The report on the Sixth review under the Extended Arrangement (IMF Country Report No. 06/58)
noted that the measures were being implemented by the NBS. In November 2008 the IMF announced the
establishment o f a precautionary stand-by arrangements under regular procedures and access limit noting that the
policies envisaged under the program are adequate to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. The N B S
received an unqualified opinion from its auditor in respect o f its latest available financial statements December
31,2007.



                                                      46

also introduced the use o f pollution charges for S02, NOx and particulate matter which also
apply to thermal power plants. Environmental oversight in Serbia i s shared among the
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MoESP), the Autonomous Provinces of
Vojvodina and municipalities. The mandate o f the nascent Serbian Environmental Protection
Agency is limited to data collection and reporting. Recent years have also witnessed
delegation o f environmental oversight functions, such as some o f EIA and permitting, to local
government agencies. However, variation o f capacity in local government agencies and lack
o f secondary legislation related to the new laws lead to delays and variations in the
interpretation and application o f laws. Such delays and inconsistencies are detrimental to the
business climate and warrant inclusion inthe regulatory review.

186.     Environmental liabilities of SOEs/public enterprises. Thermal power plants (TPPs)
remain key polluters which continue to be significant emitters o f S02, while recent
investment at one o f the TPPs has reduced particulate matter emissions to admissible levels.
Air pollution leads to substantial damages to public health, agricultural products and
ecosystems. Uninsulated ash dumps also contribute to air and water pollution. As a
monitorable condition o f the PFDPL an environmental audit (EA) will be carried out and
action plans to control and remediate damages will be developed for those SOEs/public
enterprises deemed to have significant environmental impact. The combination of EAs and
action plans will not only ensure remediation o f environmental damage, but also help attract
serious international investors and possibly lead to higher bids as the new owner's risk o f
facing unexpected environmental liabilities i s reduced.

187.     Ongoing air pollution from TPPs i s as much a matter o f financial capability o f the
national electric power utility EPS as it i s o f enforcement. The increase o f electricity tariffs
which is supported under this loan will allow EPS to obtain larger revenues part o f which it
can use to install abatement technology. The newly instituted pollution charges will provide
an added incentive.

188.     Since the privatization process began in the early 2000s, Serbia has made significant
progress in integrating environmental concerns in the privatization process. Recognizing that
strategic investors will be reluctant to invest or will heavily discount their offer prices if there
are significant unassigned environmental liabilities in 2003, the Government amended the
Law on Privatization to state that liability for environmental damage caused by a socially or
state-owned enterprise up to the date o f privatization rests with the state. In the process of
privatizing the Copper Mining and Smelting Complex o f Bor, one o f Serbia's foremost
environmental hot spots, this legal clarification has played an important role in determining
financial responsibilities for cleaning up "historical pollution" and mitigating "current
pollution" associated with the enterprise's ongoing operations. The Government will use
World Bank support for cleaning up historical pollution at this site under the Bor Regional
Development Project. The operation was made possible by cooperation between the MoESP
and the Privatization Agency. The only outstanding issue relates to the adoption o f a bylaw
definingthe scope o f state's environmental liabilities

189.     Similar past environmental damage and liability issues arise with SOEs that are too
unviable to be privatized and will be allowed to go bankrupt.According to the "Polluter Pays"
principle which is firmly established in the Environment Law enacted in 2004, liability for


                                                47

such damage lies with the state. It is recommended that GoS prepare a clear action plan on
how to deal with such liabilities.

190.     Increases in electricity tariffs are inevitable for economic efficiency. However, this
may increase the use o f fire wood and excessive/illegal cutting especially on private lands.
The recent UNECE Environmental Performance Review for the Republic of Serbia (2007)
indicates that "Seven per cent o f households heat with wood. As wood is often used directly
by rural communities without entering the commercial market, the total amount o f firewood
used is unknown. But risingpoverty has caused more use of firewood, and illegal logging has
increased." The non-commercial nature o f firewood use makes it difficult to quantify the
relationship between electricity tariff increases and firewood consumption. As a result, the
changes in fuel wood use would best be monitored in regular household surveys that gauge
poverty levels inrural and semi-urban areas. The GoS i s urged to use this monitoring tool and
feed this information into plans for targeted electricity tariff design and forest inspection
efforts.

RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

191.     Political risks related to the unresolved Kosovo status issue, previously fragmented
political situation and finalizing the cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have been largely mitigated with the election o f the new
Government o f Serbia. The advent o f the new democratic government and its commitment to
EU integration indicated renewal o f stability and pursuit o f economic reforms. The fact that
the Stabilization and Association Agreement, an important step towards accession, with the
EUhas been signed and ratified inthe Serbian Parliamentwill provide a significant anchor for
further reforms which would have beenvirtually impossible without it, as the process o f EU
integration i s unique in the world, demanding from all new prospective members to
implement dynamic economic, political, and institutional reforms. Both sides o fthe coalition
government are firmly focused on implementing further economic and political reforms and
vigorously pursuing EU agenda. The election o f democratic government was yet another
confirmation o f Serbia's commitment to European integration, following the presidential
elections in February 2008 in which incumbent president was entrusted with another 5-year
mandate running on pro-reform and EU agenda. While final status o f Kosovo remains an
issue, economic reforms and associated EU agenda are no longer subordinated to the status o f
Kosovo. Nevertheless, while the government i s committed to advancing the development
agenda, there is still some uncertainty how obstructive the opposition parties inthe Parliament
are going to be. Current developments indicated that the government is well aware that
moving ahead with European integration is arguably the most important factor for Serbia's
long term development prospects and stability, and that it will find a way to implement this
agenda.

192.     The impact o f the international financial crisis on Serbia and readiness o f the Serbian
authorities to respond promptly and adequately are additional risk factors to be considered.
The impact of the international financial crisis so far was not as dramatic as in many other
countries in the region. Nevertheless Serbia will experience lower inflows of FDI and cross-
borderborrowing, which inturnwill lead certainly to slower growth o f economy. The revised
growth rate for 2009 for Serbia is 3.5 (instead o f the 7 percent projected for the unified
survey). Serbia has significant external stability risk due to high financing requirements,

                                                48

increasing external debt, high euroization o f the banking sector and low level o f export. The
government quickly responded and created a joint committee with the National Bank of
Serbia to monitor developments at the financial market and to prepare the policy response.
The Committee had several meetings with representatives o f banks, insurance companies and
investment funds. As a result the government decided to increase the amount that is insured
with the National Deposit's Insurance Corporation, from EUR 3,000 to EUR 50,000 which
effectively means that 99 percent o f deposits in Serbia will be insured. Inaddition, there will
be some fiscal incentives to increase private sector savings. The NBS also decidedto abolish
the 40 percent reserve requirement on subordinated loans to foreign-owned local banks
thereby increasingthe liquidity o f the banking sector. It is important that the government has
ready responses to all challenges inthe real and financial sector and the cooperation with the
Fundvia the recently agreed Stand-by Arrangement is a major step forward.

193.     The precautionary SBA ensures much needed fiscal discipline. The SBA will last
through March 2010 when global financial turbulence i s likely to be most intense. However, it
will be important that the government not relax its efforts thereafter. The Serbian government
needs over the medium term to remain committed to countercyclical fiscal policies not only
due to constraints on finance inthe shorter term but also inorder to reassure investors and the
Serbianpublic that it remains committed to implementation o f structural reforms and a private
sector-lead economy over the longer term.

194.     Finally, relatively weak institutional capacity including for fiduciary management
raises concerns including on internal controls. Improving the public expenditure management
system i s an important component o f the operation, but institutional change comes slowly.
The Programmatic Private and Financial Sector Development Policy Loans will include
benchmarks on the external audit o f the Government accounts and strengthening the Supreme
Audit Institution. The government is also proceeding with adoption o f SAA requirements,
includingpublic internal financial control. Renewal o f the Budget System Law is inprogress
and other reform initiatives are under consideration in preparation for a separate DPL to
supportpublic expenditure reform initiatives.

195.     Other potential risks relate to specific actions of the reform program include delays in
the implementation process o f the overall program. The current capacity o f some public sector
institutions to implement an ambitious reform agenda, while much improved over the past few
years, remains relatively weak. The execution risks will be mitigated through utilization o f
continued technical assistance facilities and active coordination of bi-lateral donor funded
technical assistance. Furthermore, support from ongoing and proposed Bank projects in social
protection, public sector administration will further serve to mitigate risks. Another potential
risk may include delays in the Parliamentary approval of a package o f laws, due to
filibustering o f some opposition parties, which serves as a precursor to successful
implementation o f the reform program.

                           LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLlCY


    Mr.Robert 3. Zoellick
    President
    The World Bank
    1818 H Stteet,N.W.
    Washington, D.C., 20433


    Dear Mr.Zoellick,


    1.       We are Writingto request, on behalfof the Government o f the Republic of Serbia
    (GoS),the first Programmatic Private and Financial Development Policy Loan (PFDPL)
    of US$50 million equivalent to support our economic reform program. This Letter of
    Development Policy sets out the key actions that the GoS is committed to undertake over
    the near termto enhanceeconomic growth inSerbia.

    2.         The macroeconomic framework of our refom program centers on            8 high
    quality fiscal adjustment that will enhancemacroeconomic stability and boost confidence
    in the policy fiarnework, thereby stimulatingprivate investment. Further, an acceleration
    o f policy efforts aimed at improving eficiency, including privatization and enterprise
    restructuring and strengthening of bankruptcy mechanisms, dong with measures directed
    at improvingcompetition and the investment ciimate will elevate the economic reform
    agenda vis-&vis the policy framework. Finally, we aim to strengthen the financial sector
    in Serbia with continued restructuring and divestment of stab-owned holdings, and
    overhauling o f capital msrkets Eramework.

    3.         In2007, Serbia hadrobustreal GDP growthof 7.1 percent, retlectinganupturn
    in industry as privatization and enterprise resmcuring continued and cumulative FDI
    inflows since the beginning of transition in 2001 reached $10.4 billion. However,
    inhtion picked up and reached IO. 1 percent in2007 and is projected at some 9.5% at the
    end of ZOOS.    This was primarily due to exogenous shocks, such as oil price increase.
    Nevertheless, the infiation is targeted ro gradually dedine to law single digits over the




                                                56

medium term, specifically to 4% in 2012. The GoS intends to ensure continued annual
growth despite the current financial crisis, to gradually reduce a current account deficit
from 15.9% in 2007 to 8% in2012, increase the share of investments from 24% ofGDP
to 2628% in 2012, and to create at least 200,000 new jobs over the next four years,
reducing unemployment from 18.1% to 11.9%. We plan to achieve these ambitious
targets with a set of diverse reforms, some of which will be supported with this DPL
operation.

4.         The overarchingobjective of the programmatic DPL is to promote economic
growthanddevelopment inthe country. It will suprt our reformprogramthat fits under
the first priority area of the recently adopted Country Partnership Strategy for the
Republic of Serbia: dynamic private sector led growth to ensure incomes convergence
withEurope.The proposedPFDPLoperation, the first of threeprogrammaticoperations,
will focus on three specific areas: (i)enhancingbusinessenvironment to stimulate more
private sector-led investments, (ii)strengthening financial discipline in enterprise sector
to improve our fiscal position, and (iii) building a more eficient and stable financial
sector to maximize its potential growth dividend, We aim to achieve the following
outcomesthroughimpfementationofthe PFDPLsupportedreformprogram.

5.         En order to improve business environment we are applying a two-pronged
approach: improving the quality of new regulations through introduction of the
Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in the legislative process of Serbia (2004) and
facilitation of a public consuitationsprocess, and streamhing and simplifying regulation
of business activity through conducting comprehensive review of the existing stock of
business regulations. To this end, in October 2008 the GoS has adopted a Strategy for
implementation of comprehensive regulatory review (also known as a regulatory
guillotine). The proposed reform of business registration based on the single agency
approach is expected to decrease the number of procedures and rime for business
registration from I f proceduresand 23 days in2008 to 8-9 proceduresand 7 days by the
end of the reform program We expect that by the end of the reform program, all
businesses will be assigned a single registrationnumber, regulatory compliance costs of
business will decrease substantially, particularly as regards to obtaining construction
licensingandpermits. Additionally, regulatory frameworks for competition development
will be strengthened.

6.         We me committedto further strengtheningthe financia{disciplinein enterprise
sector inorder to ensure lastingfiscal adjustment. We also recognizethat enforcementof
hard budget constraintsis essentialfor completion ofthe restructuringof the socially and
state-owned enterprise sector, started in 2001. To this effect, we will build upon and
expand the earlier efforts in this crucial area, focusing on: (i)khe furher reduction of
direct and indirect subsidies provided to enterprise sector; and (ii)accelerating
restructuring, privatization and, where applicable, bankruptcy of socially-owned
enterprises.

7.         The GoS intends to introducesignificant improvementsin the energy sector as
well. Recognizingthe potential value ofprivatesectorparticipationinenergy generation,
we will fwus ondevelopinga strategyand time-boundactionplanfor privateinvestorsto



                                             57

 invest in, take majoritycontrol of, andmanage assets inpowergeneration. We will also
 commit to filly removingobstacles to competition inrefinedpetroleumproducts by the
 end of 2010. Finally, within the sameperiodwe intendto undertake gradualannual tariff
 adjustments inorder to eachcost-recoveringtariffs for power andgas.

 8.         Building on the successful financial sector privatization program, which
.includedthe recentprivatizationofthrw banks (Vojvodjanska,Niska, and Panonska) and
 of the second largest insurance company (DDOR), and the launch of the tender for the
 sale of 6 packages of non-performingloans of bankrupt state owned banks, the GoS will
 finalize the Strategy for the remaining banks and insurance companies with ROS
 ownership. We will also continueto strengthenthe insurancesector with the new MTPL
 Law and restructuring of Dunav insurance company. Further, NBS will work on
 approving key policy and procedures laid out in the second SDP, and will update/issue
 banking sector regulations. Finally, we have drafied and approved the urgent
 amendments to Securities Law which is now in the Parliament awaiting adoption, thus
 contribuzingto ongoingdevelopmentof capital markets. We also planto prepare a brand
 new Securities Law in the near future. We expect that these measures will result in
 decreased state sector share in the bankingsector from 17.29% af total assets as of mid-
 2008 to 510% in2010, while the reductionof state ownership will continueininsurance
 sector as well From 62% in insurancepremiumwritten in 2006 to 34.2% inmid-2008,
                -
 and continuing slide to below 30% in the following years. The proposed reform
 measures will also contribute to improvedaccess to finance, broader range of financial
 services availablefar the companiesand individuals.

 9.         Our reformplans to reachtheseoutcomes arebriefly outlinedas follows.

                        I. EnhsnefngBusinessEnvironment

 10.        We intend to undertake measures which should lead to removal of multiple
 adrninistr&ive barriers for business development and continuous reductionof regulatory
 compliance costs. Additionally, these measures will also support strengthening of
 corporategovernance, competitiondevelopment andbetter functioningmarkets.

 Further Sirnplifreatjon of Business Entry through Implementation of a Single
 Agency Approach for Business Registration

 1 I.       Building on the Serbian achievements in implementation of the business
 registration reform and institutional strengthening of the Business Registers Agency
 (SBRA), we would like to focus on transforming the SBRA into a real one-stop-shop
 (OSS), ensuringthat the SBRA performs all proceduresrequired for starting a business,
 including issuance of the tax number. To this end we have adopted the Principles of
 consolidatinginthe SBRA of business registrationprocedures relatedto issuance of tax,
 pension, and social security identification numbers, as a necessary prerequisite for the
 implementationof the Single Agency Approach. Over the medium term, the Parliament
 i s expected to adopt relevant regulationsto create legal framework for introduction of a
 singleidentificationnumber f ~all Serbianbusinesses.

Improving Legal Framework for Strengthening Corporate Covernernce and
FacilitatingBusinessEntry andOperations

12.        While we have made substantial efforts to advance the reform activities aimed
at making the existing legal fr?unmork more conducive for improvement of corporate
governance and facilitation of business entry and operations, further refomis are
necessary. This will primarilyinclude amendmentsto several key meas of the Company
Law of 2004, where the gaps and shortcomings have been identified in the course of its
practical implementation, namely:       (i)corporate governance provisions, (ii)detailed
regulation of new forms of operation (such as branch offices of foreign legat entities);
(iii) andconsistentregulationofstatuschanges(mergers,divisions); (iv)unification
     clear
of all provisions regulating wtablishent and operation ofentrepreneurs and companies,
including explicit elimination of at1unnecessary requirements and thereby annullingand
replacing the Law on Entrepreneurs entirely. Finally, we plan to conduct a round of
broad public consultations for the proposedamendmentsto the Company Law, including
those substituting the Law on Entrepreneurship, and submit them for Parliamentary
approval.

Sfreamlining Regulatiorrs of Business Operations and Reducing Business
ComplianceCosts

13.      By introducing a Regulatory Impact Analysis (REA) requirement into the
legislative process, we took measuresto ensure that the introduction of future regulatory
regimes is basedon a clear rationale, a proper analysis of costs and benefits, and includes
appropriate consultation with af%ected stakeholders. However, in order to createa secure
and tramparent legal environment we need to start dealing with stock of legislation. In
order to tackle this issuewe have proposalto conduct 8 comprehensiveregulatory review
of existing regulations knownas a "regulatory guillotine*a,a technique t b t can speedup
the processof reviewing, eliminating, and streamlining unnecessaryoutdated regulations.
To this end the GoS has approved a Strategy which determined a timeline and
institutional framework for a comprehensive regulatory review, defined the approach to
the "guillotine" implementation andits scope, .

14.      Since Serbia still has rather complicated and costly proceduresrelated to issuing
planning and construction permits, the GoS remains committed to dealing with this
problem. We feel that this area of businessregulations couldbenefit from comprehensive
regulatory review as a part ofthe proposed "guillotine process". Inthis regard we intend
to pursuethis issue further and introduceanew set oflandreform laws inthe near future.

15,      The regulatory "guillotine" of existing regulations will be conducted in 2009-
20IO along with the introduction of necessary amendmentsto laws and regulations. We
are certain that the intended reforms will &matically simplify the regulation of business
activities and decrease the regutatory compliance costs.




                                             59

ImprovingLegal end InstitutionetFramework for Competition

16.       The GoS has &ken a number of important steps to protect consumers and
strengthen the competitive environment by adopting a new Competition Law in 2005.
However, two years into implementationof the Law several important deficiencies have
been identified which needto beresolved. Initiallythe COSapprovedamendments to the
Law aimed at addressing the majority of existing business concerns (Le., the time
required for a merger, tow threshoids for concentrationof capital notifications, definition
of the basis for notification f e s and applicable fines that leads to prohibitively high
compliance costs, etc.) and submitted the amendments for the Parliament approval.
However, following the fomtion of the new government, we have decided to draft a
brand new Competition Law which wodd include all of the previously prepared
amendments, eliminate additional deficiencies, and be fully inline with EU regulations.
Further, two secondary regulations - on block exemption on horizontal and vertical
agreements - are being drafted and will be approved following the passage of the new
Law. We expect that the new Law and accompanying regulations and bylaws will
become effective in the near term.. The introduced changes would both improve
competition and reduce regulatory compliance costs to businesses. Thus, the proposed
increase of the thresholds for concentrationnotification, which proved to be too low in
practice, will significantly duce compIiancecosts to businesses. Finally, strengthening
both independenceand capacity of the Commission for Protection of Competition will
remaina part ofa mediumtern reformagenda.


                          11,StrengtheningFinancieIDiscipline

17.        Over the past seven years, we have made a significant progress in multi-track
privatizationprogramaimedat divestitureofsocially-ownedassets. Over this pcriod, we
have also undertaken steps aimed at reducing, gradually, the direct subsidiesto socially-
and stateawned enterprises in the Serbian economy. The proposednew operation will
assist us withcontinuingreformsinthis crucial area, focusing on: (i) reductionof
                                                                      further
direct and indirect subsidies to enterprise sector; (ii)acceierated restructuring,
privatization and, where applicable, bankruptcy andor forced fiquidation o f socially-
owned enterprises; and (iii)continuation of unbundling and restructuring of public
utilities.

Reductionin Directand IndirectSubsidies

18.        We have fbrther reduced the budget allocations for direct (MOE) subsidies
provided to SOEs in 2008 budget to CSD 3.1 billion from CSD 4,1 billion in 2006.
Additionally, we aim to continue improving EPS collection rates for SOEs. In paralIe1,
we are working to reduce the demand for subsidies by pursuing divestiture, through
privatization or bankruptcy, of no less than 15 SOEs among the top twenty largest
recipients of combined direct and indirect subsidies, including the core assets of Zastava
Group and RTB Bor. No less than 10 of these enterprises have been either privatizedor
put into bankruptcyprocedureby endof August 2008. Finally, when It comes to Zastava
we have established a strategic partnership with Italian car manufacturer Fiat, and we




                                           60

have also launched a tender far prospectivestrategic- partners for RTB Bor, We expect
that the laterdeal will be finalized inearly 2009.

Privatization, RestructuringandBankruptcyof SOEs

19.        We realize that continuedexistence ofa large SOE sector imposes considerable
risks of disrupting fiscal discipline. As you may know, the GoS has achieved significant
progress in its privatization program, and despite many changes in the political
environment, the privatization of SOEs through open tender and auction process has
steadily continued over the past seven y m .         The Privatization Agency (PA) has
accelerated the privatization process with the objective to offer for sale all remaining
saleable socially-owed enterprises inthe PA portfolio by the end of 2008. We have also
developed a transparent and competitive procedure for the sale of shares from the
Privatization Register in order to comply with the provision of the Law on Citizens'
Rightsto Gratis Shares and Cash Benefits inthe PrivatizationProcess,

20.      Over the medium term we intend to make the necessary arrangements for
privatization of municipal enterprises, and inthis regardthe MoERDis planning to haw
the strategy ready for government approval by June 2009. When it comes to further
strengthening bankruptcy mechanism one important measure will include setting up
specialist bankruptcy units within Tax OEce, Public Prosecutor's Ofice and other State
creditors, with the right and power to represent the State's claims. Additionally, we
intendto strengthen the regulatorycapacityof BankruptcySupervisionAgency (BSA) by
developing an appropriate regulationto support the BSA in implementing a system of
oversight and discipline, including de-licensing and lesser sanctions, of bankruptcy
administrators.     Finally, we intend to continue the process of restructuring and
corporatization of state owned companies, leading to their eventual majority or partial
privatization, including Initial Public Offerings (IPO) andjoint ventures. In this regard,
we have conducted a tender for JAT Airways, offering majority ownership to reputable
foreign investor with considerable experience in this industry, but due to the current
masker conditions no bids were received. We intendto finalize       the sale of a majority
stake in NIS (natiod oil company) and restructure the airline company JAT following
the failed tender, .

EnergySector

21,      Over the last few years, we have recorded significant progress in restructuring
our power and gas sectors, primarily by separating power transmission from generation
and distribution, andby separatingSrbijagas (gas transmissionanddistributioncompany)
from MS. Serbia has therefore met EU standards for unbundlingof formerly vertically
integrated utilities. Furthermore, in 2005 we established a regulatory agency, thereby
makingsignificantprogressinlicensingandtarifl'systemdevelopmentin2006,2007 and
2008. We have undertaken significant increases in utility tariffs overthe last few years to
get closer to cost-recoveringlevels.

22.      The Government is committed to obtaining full cost-recovery tariffs for
electricity and gas no later than by 2010. While undertakinggradual tariff increases, we




                                              61

will give proper attention to adequate mitigation measures to deal with social impactsof
higherutility tariffs.

23.     Our view is that Serbia would benefit from privatesector participationinpower
generation, and we will take steps to put this idea into practice. The Government will
approve EPS' Business Plan for 2008-2012which includes the stmtegy and time-bound
action plan for private sector participationwith majority control in the development of
new major power generationunits. Furthermore, we havemade the decisionto open the
market for petroleum products to free, international competition from no later than
December 31,29IO.

24.      Over the medium. term we intend to adopt a strategy to restructtm and improve
operationalefficiency of EPS, thereby also facilitating private sector participationin the
power sector. Also, in the medium tern we will develop a time-bound plan for
introducingEU-basedpetroleumproductquality stanch& inSerbia.

EstablishmentandDevelopment:of the State Audit Institutfon

25.      Inorder toestablishan independentandcompetentbodyresponsiblefor auditing
public sector accounts, the Law on State Audit Institution was adopted in November
2005. The Council, as the highest body of State Audit Institution{SAI), was appointedin
late September 2007. Within three monthsfrom establishment, the Council has prepared
the operations manual, work program, and annual plan and submitted them to the
Parliament, thus meeting ail legal requirements. Finally, the Institution was atlocated a
budget suflticient for conducting its activities. The budget was shown as a separate line
item in the Budgetofthe RepublicofSerbia.

26.      Inthe mediumterm, we will ensure that SA1becomesfully functional. This will
include securing adequate premises and equipment, employing the core staff, defming
work methodology, training the core staff, and commencingactual audits. It is expected
that SA1will, possibly with the assistance of another country's supreme audit institution
or commercial audit firm, complete the audit of government accounts for 2007 and
submit them to the Parliament. Finally, the adequate capacity building measures for
responsible bodiedinstitutions will ensure regular audits of all government accounts
without any exceptions

               1x4. Buildinga More Efficient and Stable Financial Sector

Response to the Potential SpiIIovers of GlobelFinancialCrisis

27.      Though Serbian banking sector indicators remained sound inlight of the globat
financial crisis, the Government and the National Bank have introduced additional
precautionary measures to ensure its stability and mitigate the spillover risks. Building
on the past prudential and supervisory measures, robust internationalreserves (covering
four months of imports), high aggregate liquidity-asset ratio, and one of the highest
capital adequacy ratios in the region, the NationaJ Bank has introduced further
stabilization incasures, enhancing its supervisory capacity and focusing on closely




                                              62

monitoring liquidity,NPLlevels, deposits, and foreignexchange bufferson a daily basis.
Specific liquidity indicators and early warning mechanisms were put inplace to preempt
any potentialproblems. Further, the NBS h s requestedsystemically important banks to
submit their businessplansfor 2009, alongwith informationonearly repayment ofcross-
border loans. Additionally, the NBS remains in close contacts with home country
supewisors to ensure coordinated monitoring, which is an important mmure given that
75% of Serbian banking sector is foreign owned. The plan for targeted diagnostic
measureshas also beenprepared, as well as the guidelines on liquidity risk management,
inline with the Baselprinciples. Inadditionto closely monitoringliquidity the NBShas
also introduced measures for boosting it by abolishing mandatory reserve requirements
on n mcross-brder borrowingfor financial leasingcompanies, and cross-borderlines of
credit, includingsubordinatedones.

28.      The NBS has also agreed certain temporary measures with the banks to provide
short-termrelief to banking sector clients, such as extension of repaymentperiod of the
existing loans for up tu one year for credit-worthy clients, applying no costs on early
repayments, and Eurther stimulating RSDEUR denominated toms. These measures are
complementary to GoS decision to increase the deposit insurance from EUR 3,000 to
EUR 50,000 per deposit, and reduce taxes on foreign currency savings, thus fixther
boostingconsumer confidence. GoS andNBShave formed high level monitoring teams,
working in concert and in close contacts with financial industry, strengthening crisis
response capacity.

29.      Given the abrupt shiA inglobal financial environment and in order to safeguard
macroeconomic and frnancial stability, we requested precautionary Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, although we do not intend to draw on Fund's
resources unless the need arises. Further economic measures will focus on fiscal
restraintsover the next two years, containing inflation, strengtheningcrisis preparedness,
and facilitating reformsto boosteconomy's supply side.

Privatizationand Divestmentof State-OwnedBanksand FinancialAssets

30.      The GoS is committedto continue the reformsinthe bankingsector. As you may
know. in 2006 the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) successfully completed the
privatization of three banks. It sold 99.4% of the share capital of Vojvdjanska Bank to
the NationalBankof Greece, 87.39% ofthe share capitalof PanonskaBank to San Paolo
IMIfrom Italy, and 89.4% of Niska Bank to UTPBank from Hungary. inthe same year
DIA sold 25% of Cacanska Bank and Komercijalnabank to EBRD. Inaccordance with
the shareholders agreement, both shareholders are planning to sell their shares in 2009
and 2010 respectively.The shareholdersalso committed to implementing an institutional
development plan in bothbanks until then, Additionally, in20137, DIA launched the sale
of 6 packages of non-performingfoam (NPLs) of bankrupt stateawnedkmks inthe total
amount and soldone NPLpackageinJanuary2008.

3 I. To date RoS has still ownership jn nine banks (majority stake in 4, and minority
in 5) which accounts for 17.2% of assets, 20% of deposits and 15.9% of equity of the
banking sector. The MoF and DIA have developed a privatization strategy for the




                                           63

banking and insurancesectorouttininga three-pronged approach orbanks andinsurance
companies in which RoS has majority shares, for banks in which RoS has minority
shares, and for banks in which RoS is a majority shareholder together with EBRD.
However, due to the global fkmcial crisis we are revisiting the Strategy in order to adjust
it to reflect the current market developments.         Further, we have provided initial
capitalization for Deposit InsuranceScheme strengthening DIA's capacity in light of the
crisis. We are also committed to continue supporting financially the DIA whose
experience is cruciat in ensuring that the Strategy is successfully implemented. In the
medium em, the Government intends to divest all of its holdingsin the banks where it
has majority ownership, as well as to implement an institutional development plan in
Postanska Stdianica. Further, we intend to complete the resolution of all remaining
NPLsofbankrupt state ownedbanks.

StrengtheningInsuranceSector Regulationand Resolutionregime

32.      In 2007, the Serbian insurance sector has been in the process of a major
transformation. During this time, the market has experienced consolidation, increased
share of foreign ownersbip, and significant growth. While the volume of insurance
activities increased substantially in 2007, the number of insurance companies active in
the market declined from 40 to 21 (I8 insurance licenses were revoked by the NBS, 9
companies undertook voluntary liquidation, there was 1 merger, 1 company transformed
to a pension hnd and 6 new Greenfield iicenses were issued). Currently, 13 out 21
insurersare foreign owned. With the complehnof the recent sale of DDOR to Fondiaria
(Italy), Dunav remains the only govemment-owned company in the market*As a result,
the state ownership share in insurance sector decreased in two times and now accounts
for slightly over than 30 percent of insurance premium written. At the Same time, the
quality of the insurers' balance-sheets has seen considerable improvement. Further, the
quality of insurance supervision has improved as evidenced by the introduction of
licensing requirements for insurance agents (128 institutionallicenses were revokedand
154 new issued), the launchof a comprehensiveregulatory framework (20 by-laws were
issued), improved market transparency and commencement of pro-active on-site and off-
site market supervision.

33,      Dunav insurance company has successfully completed the first stage of its
restructuring plan by centralizing the cash and claims management functions and
reorganizing its operations along business lines. Additionatly the company also fully
quantified its long-tail liabilities by carrying out an independent actuarial review. We
intend to continue with remcturing of DWY in order to ensure its campetitive position
in the Serbian insurance market. Going forward we are considering partial and/or fufl
privatization, as well as a strategic partnership with a reputable international insurer that
could help the company to adopt the cutting edge insurance technologies and hence
maintain itscompetitivenessinthe long-run.

34.      We have prepared the &aft MTPL law and we intend to include the funding
strategy for the unfunded liabilitiesof the JnsuranceGuaranteeFund inthe Action Planof
the Government Strategy for banks and insurancesector, which is now beingfinalized.

EnhancingPrudentSal Supervisionsfthe BankingSector

35.      The NBS has, in call&oration with the World Bank, developed a Supervisory
DevelopmentPlan(SDP) in2005, which hasbeenadequatelyupdatedover the past three
years. A number of regulatory reforms, aimed at updating the framework for bank risk
management and cometlswate supervisory focus, hme been implemented or me in the
processofbeingapproved. Regulatoryreformsor directives and guidanceto the banking
industry have included addressing issues such as requirements on bank disclosure of
interest rates and pricing, updating of capital adequacy requirements, new guidelines on
external auditing, bank licensing and supervision. In this regard, the NBS has recently
completed priority actions supporting SDP objectives including the dissemination of a
supervisionopmtingpolicy, revision and updateof the proceduresfor correctiveactions,
issuance of new bank iicensingproceduresand new bank chart of accounts in line with
IFRSaccountingstandards.

36.      Further, we plan to issueandpublisha number of regulatory updates, including
new capital adquacy requirements covering market risks and foreign exchange risk
exposures, loanand asset classifications, new minimum bank liquidity requirements, and
requirementfor consolidatedreportingon a financial group basis. These new regulations
will ensure accurate financial disclosures and reporting. In 2009 reform priorities will
include Basel IIimplementationmadmap,reportingpracticeson financial stability issues,
implementing stress testing to detect individual bank potential weaknesses, and
mainstreaming consolidated bank group supewision. Going further into 2010, NBS
priorities will fwus on developing a horne/host supervision strategy indicating banking
risks and home vs. host supervisory responsibilities and respective corrective measures,
implementation of financial reporting standatds rSqUid under Basel fl standards, and
rolling out standards and procedures for implementation of Basel 11's pillars 2 and 3
relatedto supervisoryreviewprocessand marketdiscipline/disclosure.

StrengtheningCapital MarketsRegulatoryand Supervisory Regime

37.      The Government has undertaken initial steps aimed at reforming regulatory
regime to support further strengtheningof capital markets. The Ministry of Finance has
prepared short-term, emergency amendments to the Securities Law, which have been
submitted to the Parliament following a roundof publicdiscussionwith key stakeholders.
Beyond this, the government is committed to enswing that progress is being made on
comprehensive and coordinated revision of key laws relevant to capital markets during
the course of 2009, including the developmentof brand new Securities Law, in order to
establisha firm anddurable foundation for their f h r e development.

38.      Also, the Government made strategic decisions on majority privatization and/or
tPOs of key sate owned companies, as well as subsequent distribution        G ffree shares to
citizens and employees. Before any decisions can be taken on the options available for
the future of these enterprises, their existing structure, in which the state owns the assets
of the company will be thoroughly revised with the objective of converting them into
openjoint stock companies inconformity with Serbia's existing legislation. The Ministry
of Finance has engaged a focal consultant inearly 2008, whose task is to define the steps

necessary for full corporatisation of the state owned companies+The Government also
plans to engage financial advisers to preparethem for privatization and IPO. Finally, any
funher steps will take intoconsideration the ongoing market developmentsresulting from
the fimcial crisis.

39.      Both the National Bank of Serbia and the Ministry of Finance are conscious of
the need to develop debt markets in Serbia. At present the only form of government
financing is through short term (3 month) treasury bills. fn order to provide greater
stability in government financing bills and bonds with a longer tenor are needed. The
resultant development of a benchmark yield curve will make possible the issuance of
municipal, corporate, and infr.astructure bonds. The Ministry o f Finance has set up a
working group to recommend necessary steps towards this goal, whose report is due
shortly.

40.      Further, we will proceedwith implementation of a planto devefop debt markets,
and eventually aim at issuing local currency instruments with tenor 6 months to 2 years,
as well as assisting municipalities inissuing debt securities.

41.      The GoS is undertaking major actions to address pending structural problems
and improvethe business climate. We remain resoluteto deepenthe reforms inthe fitture,
and to complement &em with measures aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline and
buildinga more effkienl and stable financial sector together with policy actions directed
at enhancingthe competitiveness of the Serbianeconomy.

42.      The Government undertakes to continue working on these policy issues, for
which the support by the World Bank andthe rest of the international cornunity will be
of vital importance in attaining our objectives of placing the country on a path of
sustainable and equitable growth, as well as, integration into European structures. In
conclusion, we would like to reiterate the commitment o f the GoS to all these reforms,
and we trust that this request for World Bank support for their implementation will
receive your favorable consideration.

  ANNEX 3: IMFPRESSRELEASE

IMF Approves 402.5 million Stand-By Arrangement for Serbia
Press Release No. 09/12
January 16, 2009
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 15-month
SDR 350.8 million Stand-By Arrangement (about 402.5 million or US9530.3) to support
the authorities' program aimed at maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability. The
approval makes SDR 233.9 million (about 268.4 million or US$353.3) immediately
available. However, the Serbian authorities intend to treat the arrangement as
precautionary, and not to draw on Fund resources unless the need arises.
The authorities' program aims at safeguarding macroeconomic and financial stability, in
view of the global financial turmoil. It focuses on measures aimed at maintaining market
confidence, complementing the large buffers in the financial system. Policies include
upfront fiscal restraint, with the 2009 deficit limited to 13/4percent of GDP; containing
inflation, while maintaining a managed float to facilitate external adjustment; strengthening
crisis preparedness; and reforms to boost the economy's supply side.

Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:

"Serbia's recent stretch of robust growth and moderate underlying inflation-underpinned
by large capital inflows-has been accompanied by the build-up of sizable external
imbalances and vulnerabilities. With the global financial turmoil spilling over to Serbia, a
rebalancing of the economy through a sharp slowing of credit and domestic demand seems
necessary.

"The authorities' program-supported by the SBA-is an appropriate response to the
current challenges, and seeks to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability through a
comprehensive policy package. Determined implementation of this program should poise
the Serbian economy to resume more balanced and sustained real income growth.

"Strong fiscal measures are being taken to achieve the tighter 2009 deficit target. Because
of the procyclical fiscal policy stance since 2006, limited budgetary financing options, and
the need to ensure the credibility of the program, there is no scope now for countercyclical
fiscal loosening. The slowdown in public wage and pension growth, as well as other savings
measures, preserve fiscal space for much-needed infrastructure investment.

"Monetary policy will continue to focus on inflation within a strengthened framework,
supported by a managed float with foreign exchange interventions limited to ensuring
orderly market conditions. Given the uncertain economic environment, the monetary
stance will need to be adjusted flexibly.

"Past prudential policies are now paying off in providing a strong first line of defense
against spillovers from the financial turmoil. These policies have succeeded in building large
liquidity and capital buffers in the banking system, although they may also have
encouraged risky cross-border borrowing. The authorities need to strengthen the financial
stability framework, mainly by improving the monitoring of risks and setting up
comprehensive contingency plans.

"Structural policies need to address the economy's weak supply side, with a view to
delivering balanced and sustainable catch-up growth toward EU income levels. The program
calls for privatizing, restructuring, or liquidating a wide range of state- and socially owned-
enterprises, as well as lowering the cost of doing business, to help expand the undersized
private sector.

"The authorities have started to implement their program steadfastly. This gives confidence
that the Serbian economy, with the support of the international community, will succeed in
overcoming the present difficulties," Mr. Portugal said.

Recent Economic Developments
The global financial turmoil began to spill over to Serbia in the fourth quarter of 2008, as
for the region as a whole. The stock market plummeted; sovereign spreads soared;
households withdrew some of their deposits; and, amid high volatility and frequent NBS
interventions to maintain foreign exchange market liquidity, the dinar depreciated. Growth,
which so far was strong, seemed to be losing momentum. At the same time, the reversal of
the region-wide food and energy price shocks eased headline inflation pressures. These
outcomes were accompanied by the build-up of an increasingly unbalanced external
position. The current account deficit could reach 18 percent of GDP in 2008, although it has
so far been easily financed by capital inflows, resulting in rising international reserves.
Consequently, external stability risks have increased substantially in the current
international environment. These reflect Serbia's unsustainably large external deficit; the
private sector's high external indebtedness; high euroization; and indications of weak
export competitiveness. Financial stability risks have also increased, but the banking
sector's liquidity and capital buffers are comforting.
Program Summary
The authorities' program, supported by the SBA, responds to the abrupt deterioration in
the short-term outlook: trading partner growth and prices of key Serbian exports,
particularly metals, are projected to slow sharply in 2009; and formerly plentiful capital
inflows can no longer be taken for granted, further constraining domestic and cross-border
credit growth.

The program's objective is to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability through
strengthened policies, designed to underpin an orderly rebalancing of the economy. The
policy package focuses on four main features:

   0       Tightening of the fiscal stance in 2009-10, with the 2009 general government
       deficit limited to 1%percent of GDP, followed by further fiscal consolidation in 2010.
       This involves strict incomes policies for containing public sector wage and pension
       growth and a streamlining of non-priority recurrent spending, which helps create
       fiscal space to expand infrastructure investment.
          Strengthening the inflation targeting framework while maintaining a managed
       floating exchange rate regime.
          Making good use of the accumulated financial sector buffers, while
       enhancing financial crisis preparedness.
          Implementing structural policies to address the roots of the economy's low
       capacity to produce, save, and export. The main elements of the fiscal package
        include

The program's macroeconomic framework assumes a decline of foreign inflows and
domestic credit, which should lead to a slowdown in domestic demand, output growth, and
inflation, and a narrowing of external imbalances. Real GDP growth is projected to
decelerate to 3% percent in 2009 but should rebound in 2010. With the inflation-reducing
effects of commodity price declines and slowing activity being counteracted by pressures on
the exchange rate, inflation is projected to slow only gradually to 8 percent by end-2009.

Serbia joined the IMF on December 14, 1992; its quota is SDR 467.7 million (about 541
million or US$707 million) and it has no outstanding use of IMF credit. Its latest
arrangement with the IMF was an Extended Fund Facility, completed on February 28, 2006,
