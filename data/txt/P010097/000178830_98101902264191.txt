REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR
A TILE DRAINAGE AND IRRIGATED FARMING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of
US$14.0 mi.llion on standard IDA terms to help to finance a drainage, irriga-
tion and farm development project. Approximately US$0.6 million of the
credit would be passed on to the Province of Si.nd as a grant and approximately
US$1.4 million would be onlent to commercial banks for nine years at 6% p.a.
for relending to farmers and contractors.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 1.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an average
annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In the Second
Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial growth of 13%
per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural output grew at 6.2%
annually with the aid of new high-yi.elding wheat and rice varieties, compared
with less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but the industrial growth
rate fell to 8.6%. During the 1970's, however, the growth rate has been con-
siderably lower. During FY71 and FY72, there was virtually no change i.n total
output as political uncertainties and the conflicts culminating in the separa-
ti.on and independence of East Pakistan resulted in a decli.ne in industrial
activity, while drought virtually halted agricultural growth. Si.nce December
1971, growth has been modest. After two years without growth, the GNP grew
by 7% in FY73, but the increase declined to 5% in FY74 and in FY75 it was
less than 3%.
4.        In FY75, Pakistan suffered a series of setbacks.  These included
record low river flows reducing irrigation and hydroelectric power, a dete-
rioration of about 20% in the terms of trade, and falling export demand
caused by the general world recession. In addition, because of damage to
the stilli.ng basins, repairs to the Tarbela Dam have taken longer than ex-
pected and the use of its irri.gation potential has been restricted. However,
there have also been important positive developments, including an accelera-
tion of public investment, some upturn in private investment, closer economic
ties with, and capital flows from, the Middle East oilproducing countries,
the reopening of relations with Bangladesh, and prospects for a slowdown in
world and domestic inflation.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.         IN FY75 the output of the major agricultural crops declined by
about 5% owing primarily to lack of water earlier in the year and pest
attacks on cotton. Good rains in the summer of 1975 came in time to bene-
fit the wheat crop and brighten prospects for FY76. The sugarcane harvest
this year has been a very good one. In late 1974 the government lowered
agricultural export duties and in early 1975 it announced higher procurement
prices and higher prices to consumers, which will help eliminate some food
subsidies.  Procurement prices will probably need to be raised further, how-
ever, in order to give sufficient incentive to production. Other government
programs which should assist agricultural growth are those to increase the
supply of high quality seed, to improve cultural practices through agriculture
extension, to increase availability of fertilizer, and to reduce water-logging
and salinity.  With the increasing desire of small and medium-scale farmers to
participate in the "green revolution," agricultural growth in the next five
years could accelerate if appropriate pricing policies are followed and if
adequaLc priority is given to supporting services and programs.  Substantial
increases in production in FY77 can be expected when water from the Tarbela
reservoir becomes available.
6.        Domestic savings rates declined steadily from  FY70, dropping
from 13% to 5.6% of GDP in FY75. Private savings declined from 12.1% to 6.5%
of GDP over the same period. Savings will have to be substantially increased
if a satisfactory rate of growth in the future is to be maintained and ex-
cessive reliance on external borrowing avoided. In recent months, the Gov-
ernment has taken some significant steps to reduce subsidies, restrain other
non-development expenditures, and increase revenues from Government enter-
prises. These have included substantially higher prices for wheat, vegetable
ghee and sugar, a doubling of the price of natural gas, and higher electric
power and petroleum product prices.
7.        After more than a decade during vwhich prices rarely rose more than
2 to 3% annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of 20% to
30% annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the money supply
has been limited to about 14% annually by monetary and fiscal restraint. At
the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to curb domestic in-
flation, however, international prices began to increase sharply. The dollar
prices of imports rose by 37% in FY74 and by a further 20% in FY75. Dollar
export prices rose 52% in FY74, but declined by 2% in FY75. With the present-
ly lower rates of international inflation, however, the rate of price increase
in Pakistan has declined. For the first half of FY76 wholesale prices rose at
an annual rate of 5%, compared with 26% during FY75.
8.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting from
increased imports, particularly of goods related to investment, and of wheat,
and the adverse changes in the terms of trade, are reflected in an increase in
the current account deficit plus debt repayment from US$239 million in FY73 to
US$665 million in FY74 and US$1,368 million in FY75. The deficit in FY75 has
been financed principally by aid from the Pakistan Consortium and from OPEC
countries, which enabled Pakistan to finance its balance of payments deficit
in FY75 with only about US$116 million of short-term borrowing and some
draw-down of net reserves. In the medium term, rising agricultual fertilizer



-3-
and other domestic production should improve the current account position,
but the balance of payments as a whole will be adversely affected by rising
debt amortization payments, particularly after the end of the debt-relief
period in June 1978. At the recent meeting in Paris of the Pakistan Aid
Consortium, indications of new aid for FY77 were at about the US$700 million
level pledged for the current year.
9.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June 1975 amounted
to about US$5.3 billion equivalent, of which US$1.2 billion was undisbursed.
At present Pakistan's debt service problem has been eased by the arrangement
concluded in June 1974 whereby countries participating in the Pakistan con-
sortium agreed to provide US$650 million equivalent in debt relief over four
years. In FY75 the debt service ratio to export earnings and non-factor ser-
vice and factor income receipts was almost 18%. However, with the end of
the debt relief arrangement in FY78, Pakistan's debt service ratio must be
expected to increase somewhat. It is therefore important that Pakistan should
make every effort to increase its domestic savings and exports and that bor-
rowing on conventional terms should be held to the minimum. For this reason
the major part of Bank Group operations in Pakistan consists of IDA credits.
Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now repre-
sents about 16% of its external public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio is
likely to fall to about 13%. The share of the Bank Group in total debt
service (after taking account of the debt relief which Pakistan will receive
from other creditors) is now about 23%, but is expected to decrease to about
9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
10.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.4 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. To date, 43% of total commitments have been for
public services, 24% for agriculture, 20% for industry, 12% for industrial
imports and 1% for education. Lending for public services has amounted to
over US$600 million and has included loans and credits for railways, elec-
tric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and
water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture was for Indus
Basin projects. The lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for
which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead
satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates
charged by some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and,
hence, some utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
11.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.  One
of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the economy, to



4-
increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains, edible oils,
fertilizer and engineering and-capital goods and to sustain export growth in
cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, the
Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (TDBP) and the National Development
Finance Corporation (NDFC) which provides finance primarily for industries in
the public sector. The most important part of future lending for agriculture
is expected to be for the Government's new program to increase productivity
in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and improving the utilization of
surface irrigation and groundwater. The Bank is the Executing Agency for a
UNDP technical assistance grant for improving agriculture and water planning
in the Indus Basin.
12.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion of, and
to improve the institutions which are responsible for, the principal public
services which have benefited from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Water and Power Development Authority,
Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company and the Lahore Water and
Sanitation Agency. In most of these, institutional improvements are being
made with technical assistance financed by the Bank Group.
13.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This proposed shift,
which implies increased lending for agriculture and rural development, will
involve significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela
works. This may involve both large drainage projects and smaller-scale
projects. This shift has already occurred in terms of staff time devoted to
the preparation of projects in rural development, livestock and forestry.
14.       Further in support of the third objective, and at the Government's
request, Bank missions have been working with municipal authorities on plans
for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds 4 million.
A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of consultants
financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within the framework
of this plan. In view of the preparatory work which has already been done on
urbanization problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile
participation by the Bank Group in this area, beginning with a project in the
Lyari section of the city. The Government has also asked the Bank to study
urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in
Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is
for technical assistance. A mission to examine problems of urbanization and
regional development of smaller cities on a country-wide basis visited
Pakistan in March 1975.
15.       Among the projects now being prepared for your consideration are
a livestock project, a third education project, an urban project in Karachi
(Lyari improvement), a tenth railway project and an industrial investment
(DFC) project. All of these projects have been appraised. Preparatory work
is also proceeding on a loan for a fertilizer project, in which IFC may par-
ticipate, and on further irrigation and drainage projects, as well as the
rural development project.



- 5 -
16.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million by
equity vr.rticipations (these are showm in Annex II). About US$11 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN PAKISTAN
17.       Agriculture is the mainstay of the Pakistan economy, accounting in
FY75 for about one-third of the gross domestic product and, directly and
indirectly, for 70% of export earnings. It provides direct employment for
nearly two-thirds of the country's labor force, with an important indirect
contribution through the employment of an additional 20% in secondary and
tertiary activities. Irrigated agriculture dominates the sector, accounting
for some 90% of total farm output.
18.       Beginning in the 1870's, barrages were constructed on the Indus
tributaries in the Punjab, and more recently on the Indus itself, enabling
diversion of water throughout the year. The Basin now is irrigated by a
canal system with a cultural commanded area (CCA) of about 30 million acres--
one of the largest in the world.
19.       The construction of the barrages and canals was not accompanied by
the installation of adequate drainage systems, and during the past century
waterlogging and salinity have become a major problem in large areas.  Under
the GOP's Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPS), the Water and
Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has installed 7,500 tubewells in over 3
million acres and individual farmers have installed over 100,000 tubewells
which contribute in varying degrees to controlling the water table. In saline
groundwater areas, however, where the wells must discharge into disposal
drains, the benefits of this method of groundwater control are limited unless
additional canal water is provided for reclamation of the saline soils.
Moreover, this method is restricted to areas where the subsoil formation
permits the installation and operation of the wells.
20.       Over large areas in Pakistan, including the Khairpur project area
in Sind, the groundwater aquifers have poor discharge or other adverse char-
acteristics which make them unsuitable for tubewell operation. In the Khairpur
area, the aquifer is underlain by bedrock at such a shallow depth that no
tubewells can be installed. In such situations, buried tile drains are the
most appropriate method of drainage. The alternative of deep open drains
would take up large acreages of farm land and would cut across established
road and canal systems.
21.       In 1968, the Khairpur-II project adjacent to the Khairpur-SCARP
was selected by WAPDA as a prototype to assess the construction techniques,
installation and operating costs and effectiveness of tile drainage. Subse-
quently, the Bank's Indus Basin review mission assigned high priority to the



- 6 -
project which was also strongly endorsed in the GOP Planning Commission's
1973 "Proposals for an Accelerated Program of Waterlogging and Salinity Con-
trol." The project lies within one of Pakistan's important areas of cotton
and grain production. In the project area, the saline water groundwater table
has risen steadily since completion of the Sukkur Barrage in 1932 and in
parts of the area soil salinity is visible in many fields. While saliniza-
tion has become severe, complete reclamation should be possible by an ini-
tial water application sufficient to leach down the salts, given levelled
land, adequate water supply and means to remove the saline effluent. There-
after, significant increases in crop yields should be achieved with adequate,
timely irrigation and periodic leaching of incoming salts.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project, to be implemented during FY77-81, was
appraised in November 1974. A follow-up appraisal to review selected
project components was conducted in August 1975. The Appraisal Report
(No. 1062a-PAK) on the project is being distributed separately. A credit
and project summary is attached as Annex III. At negotiations which took
place in Washington during May, 1976, the Pakistan delegation was led by
Mr. A.W.F. Shaikh, Additional Chief Secretary of the Sind Irrigation and
Power Department.
Project Description
23.       The proposed project would install tile drainage as a means of
water table and soil salinity control throughout 36,000 acres and enlarge
and remodel existing canals and outlet structures serving 44,000 acres to
provide additional water for irrigation and for reclamation of saline soils
by leaching. In addition, the project would include:
-    construction and improvement of watercourses, roads and
bridges throughout the project area;
-    provision of technical and financial support to farmers
for on-farm development work (mainly land levelling) and
financial assistance to small local contractors for the
purchase of land levelling equipment;
-    purchase of imported spare parts for existing tubewells
in the area;
-    development of a more effective agricultural extension
service;
-    technical assistance and training for WAPDA and the Sind
Irrigation Department and Agriculture Department; and
-    provision of aerial photographs and preparation of maps
based on satellite data of the Indus Basin.



-7-
24.       Tile Drainage System.  Subsurface drainage for 36,000 acres would
comprise about 1,600 miles of buried tile and collector  drains discharging
into 130 small pump stations, each serving a drainage unit of about 270 acres.
Effluent would be pumped into about 45 miles of open disposal channels dis-
charging into the existing Rohri irrigation canal for dilution and re-use.
About 60 miles of power transmission li.nes would supply the pumping stations.
Various methods of construction would be used to determine thei.r effectiveness,
cost and speed under local conditions.  Specifically, where conditions permit,
labor-intensive methods and machine operations would be applied side by side
in similar works.
25.       Canal Remodelling.  Canal systems would be remodelled and control
structures rebuilt as necessary to meet peak kharif water requirements
within the project area. The layout and capacity of watercourses would be
modified to provide the additional water supplies at a rate farmers can con-
trol efficiently. About 50 miles of minor canals would be enlarged, and the
size and location of many of the irrigation outlets would be re-surveyed
and modified to improve the distribution of supplies. Minor adjustments of
some field boundaries would be desirable to enable construction or realignment
of the watercourses.
26.       On-Farm Development.  To maximize early benefits from this project,
farmers would be encouraged to level their holdings during the implementation
period. Levelling, by enabling more even distribution of water, increases
yields under normal soil conditions and improves the conditions for leaching
of salts and for preventing salinization due to uneven irrigation.  In addition
to land levelling, farmers would be encouraged to reclaim waste land and to
adjust field boundaries. The project would provide funds for onlending through
commercial banks to farmers to cover the cost of land levelling work and to
local contractors for the purchase of land levelling equipment.
27.       Other.  Under the project, the WAPDA Southern Zone (SZ) would im-
prove some roads and strengthen bridges and culverts in the project area; and
would build offices, stores and staff housing. The credit would provide for
the import of spare parts for tubewells (US$0.2 m) to remedy a shortage of
spare parts which has led to the failure of about 25 wells in the SCARP area,
some of which are in the project area. The project would also provide air
photo coverage of 65,000 square miles of the Indus Basin and Baluchistan.  In
addition, analysis and interpretation of Earth Resources Technology Satellite
(ERTS) images of a 10,000 square-mile area of saline-affected soils would
be provided. The aerial survey and satellite imagery are required in con-
nection with, inter alia, the master planning for water resource development
in Pakistan, and the preparation of future irrigation/drainage projects.
Project Implementation
28.       Drainage construction and canal remodelling would take four years,
and during this period watercourse improvement and land levelling would be
substantially completed.  Increased irrigation deliveries in each drainage



unit would follow upon installation of lateral drains and completion of water-
course development, at which point the agricultural extension service would
begin intensive activity. Full project implementation would be completed in
five years.
Costs and Financing
29.       Total project costs (including aerial photography and ERTS surveys)
are about US$28.3 million (excluding taxes and duties), of which nearly one-
half would be foreign exchange. The major project elements and their res-
pective costs (based on December 1975 prices) are: civil works, US$6 million;
on-farm works, US$2.5 million; construction and agricultural equipment and
vehicles including space parts.for tubewells, US$7.4 million; engineering,
administration, consultants and training, US$2.5 million; and aerial photo-
graphy and ERTS surveys, US$1.0 million. Provisions of US$2.0 million to
cover physical contingencies and of US$6.7 million for price contingencies
are included. The price contingencies are calculated so as to cover estimated
price increases of about 8% per year for equipment and consultant's costs and
about 12% per year for civil works and local costs.
30.       The proposed IDA credit of US$14.0 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project, equivalent to about 50% of the total
project costs net of customs duties and taxes. The balance of US$14 million
equivalent would be provided by GOP and GOSind through annual budgetary
appropriations.
Procurement and Disbursements
31.       Vehicles, equipment and materials with an estimated total cost of
US$9.0 million (including contingencies) would be procured by WAPDA (SZ) and
the Sind Department of Agriculture after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or prevailing
customs duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in evaluation
of bids. Small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each, which
are not practical for international tendering, would be purchased through
normal Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory to IDA. Such
purchases would be limited to a total of US$300,000. Civil works with an
estimated total cost of US$10.0 million equivalent (including contingencies)
and land leveling (US$3.5 million equivalent including contingencies) would
not be suitable for international competitive bidding and would be carried
out by WAPDA (SZ) force account and by local contractors, respectively.
Because there may be unavoidable delays in acquiring access for some of the
drainage works and since there may be design changes to accommodate field
conditions and since these works would have to be phased with seasonal
farming activities, flexible utilization of WAPDA forces should prove more
economical than engagement of a contracting firm.  Land levelling activities
will be too small and dispersed to attract participants from outsi.de the
area.



- 9 -
32.       Disbursements from the proposed credit would cover 100% of the
foreign exchange costs of all imported items and of the ex-factory costs of
items manufactured locally and procured after competitive bidding; 100% of
the foreign costs or 70% of local costs of consultant services, 100% of the
foreign costs of overseas training, aerial surveys and ERTS surveys; 70% of
the cost of imported goods procured locally; an agreed percentage (estimated
at 25%) of the costs of civil works and of amounts provided through parti-
cipating banks for on-farm development (50% of credit extended to project
farmers; 70% of credit extended to local contractors). The inclusion of
credit to farmers in the project is desirable in order to encourage the
local banks to extend their lending operations to small farmers in the
area and to assist them to provide the credit on medium terms.  Up to US$1
million of the credit would be used to finance retroactively the cost of
aerial surveys which were carried out this spring when conditions were best
for aerial photography.
Project Organization and Management
33.       In this project as in other SCARPs, WAPDA would be responsible for
project implementation. The General Manager of WAPDA's Southern Zone would
have executive responsibility for construction of all project civil works;
the Project Director (Planning) of WAPDA (SZ) would be responsible for de-
tailed investigations, planning, design and specifications for the main
civil works; and the Project Director (Construction) would be responsible
for force account construction by WAPDA field divisions. Extension ser-
vices in the project area would be brought under administration of the SCARP
Khairpur agricultural wing which is a unit of the Sind Irrigation and Power
Department. Project management would be strengthened by the formation of
a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) comprising representatives of all
agencies involved in project implementation, provision of supporting services
and subsequent operation of project works. Establishment of the PCC would be
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
34.       For two years following completion of the project drainage system,
WAPDA (SZ) would be responsible for its operation and maintenance. The works
would then be taken over by the Sind Irrigation and Power Department (SI&PD).
Maintenance of watercourses would continue to be the responsibility of indi-
vidual farmers under the direction of SI&PD. Assurances have been obtained
that the GOSind would provide adequate budgetary allocations for the opera-
tion and maintenance of the project facilities (Project Agreement, Section
Section 2.02).
35.       The agricultural extension service in the project area would work
through selected contact farmers on whose lands improved techniques and prac-
tices would be demonstrated. Land levelling on project area farms would be
carried out by individual farmers assisted technically and, in part, finan-
cially by the Government's Precision Land Levelling Project (PLLP) operated
by the Sind Department of Agriculture. Subsidies are provided under the PLLP
to cover one-half the standard cost of levelling up to ten acres of an indi-
vidual's holding. Commercial bank loans, covered in part by funds provided



- 10 -
it the proposed credit, would also be available to cover the cost of levelling
larger areas. Also, farmers and private contractors woulLd be eligible for
bank loans to finance the purchase of farm tractors for land levelling work.
Credit futnds would be onlent through the State Bank of Pakistan to participat-
ing commercial banks for nine years at an interest rate of 6% p.a.  The com-
mercial banks would, in turn, provide loans of up to eight-year maturity to
farmers and land-levelling contractors at 11% p.a. Tractors would be sold on
credit with the express understanding that the recipient farmer or contractor
woul.d give priority to land levelling on farms in the project area.
36.       WAPDA, in consultation with SDA, would appoint consulting firm to
assist in training project staff in engineering and agriculture extension.
Appointment of such a firm would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit. WAPDA would require technical assistance in the planning,
design and construction of the drainage system, and in the procurement of
tile drain laying equipment. Consultants would also assist in planning the
supply of drainage materials and in field management of construction works.
The credit would provide for about 170 man-months of consultants' services
(US$1 million) and funds for overseas training of project staff (US$300,000).
Water Charges
37.       Water charges levied on irrigated land in Sind are, in effect,
taxes geared to the potential productivity of the land. They do not vary
with the amount of water the farmer takes nor with the scarcity or plentitude
of water available in the canals at any particular time. Nor do they reflect
any attempt to recover from the farmers in a particular area the cost of in-
vestment or 0 & M related to that area. In fact, with the erosion in rates
due to inflation, current charges are not adequate even to cover the cost
of satisfactory 0 & M.
38.        In the Sind, landowners pay water charges together with land
revenue taxes as a "Flat Rate"' per acre. The water and land revenue com-
ponents are calculated as the product of farm area and a Produce Index Unit
(PIU) and local rates per acre, one for water and one for land revenue. One
PIU applies throughout each administrative unit (taluka) and reflects the
general productive capability of the land and the type of irrigation (flow,
lift or combined). The water and land revenue rates vary from village to
village. Following discussions with the Bank, the Government of Sind has
agreed to revise the classification, for the purpose of setting water charges,
of the project area to reflect, in accordance with the present system, the
effect of the project on the availability of water and the quality of land.
This is to be done within one year of project completion. The Government has
also agreed to increase water charges in stages throughout the Province over
the development period so that they would cover by 1988 the full annual
0 & M costs of all irrigation and drainage works in Sind. These increases
would affect the whole Province and hence would avoid inequities in the
treatment of farmers inside and outside the project area. Annual water
revenues in Sind should rise from the current level of about Rs 60 million
to at least Rs 95 million (in 1976 prices) by 1988. In addition, the GOSind
has agreed to adjust the rate structure so that in the Project Area a



- 11 -
reasonable portion of the investment cost of the Project would be recovered
from Project beneficiaries.
Project Benefits
39.       With the drainage and improved water distribution facilities to be
provided under the project, farmers would be able to reclaim and restore the
productivity of lands that have become saline or waterlogged, thus opening the
way for substantial yield increases and the cultivation of land not now in
production. Under the project, the overall cropping intensity is expected to
rise from the present 86% to almost 150%.
40.       The value of additional output from the project area, less the cost
of production inputs, is estimated at US$11 million equivalent annually, of
which about US$5.8 million would accrue in the form of net foreign exchange
savings/earnings. Farm and tenant incomes would increase two and one-half to
three times as a result of production increases due to the project and, in
addition, employment opportunities, largely for landless families in the area,
would double. Production increase would also stimulate additional wage-earn-
ing opportunities in the local cotton gins, processing industries, mills and
market centers. It is estimated that the project would directly improve the
earning capacities of more than 85% of all households in the project area.
Moreover, the experience and information gained from this project will be
useful in planning the development of other areas covering several million
acres in the Indus Basin where similar constraints exist.
41.       With a shadow exchange rate of Rs 11 to the US dollar, world prices
for crops and imported items, all farm labor valued at an average rate of
Rs 7 per day (half the peak market wage) and domestic market prices for all
other items, the project's economic rate of return is estimated to be about
17%. Other important benefits, such as increases in trade and induced
secondary employment, are not included in this computation. The rate of
return is not seriously affected when various less favorable assumptions
are tested.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the International Development Association, draft
Project Agreement between the Province of Sind and the Association, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
43.        The special features described in paragraphs 33 and 36 of this
report are reflected in Sections 3.09 and 3.03, respectively, of the draft
Development Credit Agreement; the special features described in paragraph 38
are reflected in Section 3.01 of the draft Project Agreement. The establish-
ment of the Project Coordinating Committee and the appointment of a consulting



- 12 -
firm to assist WAPDA and the SI&PD in implementing the project are specified
in Section 6.01(b) and (c) of the draft Development Credit Agreement as
additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
44.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION  1,
Credit No. 50        Education:  US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Effective Date: August 14, 1964; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
Project implementation, originally scheduled for four years has
been delayed by eight years, due to cumbersome administrative procedures,
wars, floods, labor unrest and price escalation. Despite delays and cost
inflation, the total project cost in US dollars will be within the appraisal
estimate because of the devaluation of the Pakistan rupee in 1972. Civil
works are 95% completed; equipment procurement is also virtually completed
except for the Polytechnical Institutes at Sind. The technical assistance
program has been completed.  Disbursements to date amount to 92% of the Credit
and are likely to amount to 98% by June 30, 1976, the final Closing Date.
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule tXo enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reserloir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to with:in 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the st-illing basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. Investigations of the causes of the dam-
age and a program of remedia:L measures are being prepared. Plans for begin-
ning generation of power in December 1976 and filling the reservoir to maxi-
mum operating level during the summer of 1976 have not been affected by this
latest damage.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC:  US$40.0 Million
Loan of Mlarch 21, 1969; Effective Date: May 21, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then to
September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to be made
for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date:  August 28, 1969; Closing Date:  June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 157       Agricultural Development Bank:  US$30.0 Million Credit
of June 26, 1969; Effective Date: September 23, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Although the Closing Date of this credit has passed, minor dis-
bursements are expected to continue into April, 1976, as the last tractors
ordered under the project are shipped. The Government has requested a fur-
ther credit for ADBP and discussions are taking place concerning the measures
necessary to remedy ADBP's financial and managerial problems.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:  US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31,
1977. The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.2 million re-
mained undisbursed as of April 30, 1976. Progress has been achieved on the



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
Bangladesh liabilities issue. The major problem remaining is the large
arrears in IDBP's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The
liquidity problem has been eased with Government assistance but the long-
term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on developments in the textile
sector which accounts for a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:  US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date:  July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule.  The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete by the Closing Date
(December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are
linked to the Technical Assistance program.  This program will require at
least two years extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment
of experts. Progress in staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because
of low staff salaries, but these have recently been improved. Suggestions
for improvement have been made to the Borrower during the supervision visit.
Project costs on civil works are expected to exceed the appraisal estimates
by 85% in rupee terms, but total project costs are unlikely to exceed the
appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee.
Disbursement remains slow but is expected to improve in FY76 with the comple-
tion of the physical facilities.
Credit No. 213       Power Transmission and Distribution:  US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the
past year, has suffered a further setback and the Closing Date has been
postponed for the second time, to June 30, 1977. The new delay is caused
by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which negotiations
have now been completed. All equipment orders have been placed and the
credit has been fully committed.
Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
The contracts for the construction of four shipping berths and
two transit sheds at Juna Bunder, and for the reconstruction of Napier
Mole Bridge were awarded, in June and October 1975 respectively, to the
same joint venture, National Construction Company (NCC) of Pakistan and
Chriastiani & Nielsen (CN) of Denmark. Site work is due to commence pre-
sently. Materials for permanent way and pipes and fittings have been
ordered, and work on operational buildings is proceeding. However, there
have been delays in appointing consultants for supervision and in com-
mencing other parts of the project, such as the proposed study of KPT's
dredging fleet. Over 90% of lhe Credit allocation has been committed.

Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credi' of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The four bids received for construction of the oil berth have
been reviewed and are presently under more detailed assessment by the
consultants & KPT. In view of the bids received, significant cost over-
runs appear likely. Consultants have not yet been formally appointed by
KPT for preparing contract documents for dredging works and dredger pro-
curement. The credit implementation is now some 18 months behind the program
prepared at the time of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been
made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
Progress has been made in solving that problem although some pending matters
are still under discussion with the Government. The other major problem is
the large arrears in PICIC's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity.
The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from the
Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on dev-
elopments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion of PICIC's
outstandings. The loan has been fully commited and disbursements amounted
to $11.1 million on April 30, 1976. A new loan is under consideration.
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Effective Date: May 15, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 was post-
poned one year to permit completion of procurement of specialized spare
parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.
Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plant construc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most likely potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as heat exchangers and boilers, which could delay
s.artup by several months,

Credit No. 510        Third Telecommunications:  US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This credit is proceeding satisfactorily though still at an early
stage. Procurement action for all the main equipment items is well-advanced
Reorganization of T&T to a form more suited to its commercial-type operation,
which was an agreement of the first Telecommunications Credit and reiterated
in the Credit Agreement of 510-PAK, has not progressed. A Government ap-
pointed Committee was to have formulated by December 31, 1975, the steps
required to achieve this reorganization.
Credit No. 546        National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):  US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Cls3ing Date: September 30, 1979
This credit was made effective on July 17, 1975. Commitments
amounted to $6.7 million and disbursements to $0.9 million on May 22, 1976.
Loan No. 1107         Fourth Su:i Northern Gas:  US$60.0 Million Loan of
May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Engineering and procurement are on schedule, as is construction,
despite unusually heavy rains and floods during late sluamer. Progress on
the purification facilities is falling behind original plans. Two problems
facing the Borrower are delivery delays due to congestion at the port of
Karachi and the loss of skilled craftsmen to the Middle East. The project
is expected to be completed Cil time and well within the estimated cost.
No action has been reported on the government's obligation to make a
reservoir study of the Meyal field by December 31, 1975 and the Bank has
taken the matter up with the Government.
Loan No. 1208         Power Transmission:  US$50.0 Million Loan of
February 18, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976.
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
This loan was made effective on April 30, 1976.
Credit No. 620        Seed Project:  US$23.0 Million Credit of March 29, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This credit is not yet effective.
Credit No. 629        Program Credit; US$50.0 Million Credit of June 2, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
This credit is not yet effective.

US$26.6 Million Credit of June 8, 1976; Closing Date:
