                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Bank support for the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP) is nearing the end of its second year and the achievement of disbursement linked indicator (DLI)
                         targets has helped make substantial improvements to the quality of implementation. Ongoing evaluations commissioned by the Bank and other agencies, such as the International
                         Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), indicate that the EGPP has been successful at targeting the poorest populations (e.g. all beneficiaries own less than 3 decimals of land,
                         where the minimum threshold is 50 decimals), and maintaining a quota of over one-third female participants. Results also indicate that Program processes are becoming more
                         formalized and supervision capacity has improved, particularly with the introduction of Field Supervisors under Bank financing, and the introduction of dedicated “shordars? (worksite
                         supervisors from among beneficiaries). Utilization rates of non-wage costs have also increased in from FY 2011 to FY 2012.

                         Such evaluations have also provided key feedback for the Operations Manual (for FY 13), which was formally launched in September 2012, and serve to continuously highlight issues
                         for consideration in policy and implementation level revisions. As part of its ongoing improvements to the EGPP, the Ministry of Disaster Management & Relief (MoDMR) has
                         allocated a portion of this fiscal year’s budget towards setting up signboards at each worksite in order to enhance transparency at the community level.

                         In terms of improvements to one key area of the program – work attendance and wage payment – the MoDMR is currently finalizing a memorandum of understanding with the
                         Bangladesh Post Office for a pilot to be conducted in a selected Upazilla using the postal cash card. Lessons learned from this pilot will serve to inform the Ministry of the suitability
                         and scalability of such an ICT based model for attendance monitoring and payment delivery.
