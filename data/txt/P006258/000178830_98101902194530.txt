INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO LIGHT - SERVICOS DE ELETRICIDADE, S.A.
FOR A POWER DISTRIBUTION AND SUB-TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on approposed
loan to Light - Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A. (LIGHT), with the guarantee
of the Federative Republic of Brazil, for the equivalent of US$20 million
to finance part of the equipment for the 1972-74 distribution and sub-
transmission expansion program in LIGHT's area of concession. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "The Economic and Social Develop-
ment of Brazil" (38-BR), dated March 12, 1973, is being distributed to
the Executive Directors. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
The report is based on the three Bank economic missions which were sent
to Brazil in 1972 to review, respectively, the Government's programs
for developing the Northeast and Amazon regions, prospects for develop-
ment of agricultural and industrial activity elsewhere in Brazil, and
Brazil's macro-economic performance.
Macro-Economic Performance
3.        After having grown by about 9 percent annually during 1968-70
Brazil's national product increased by an estimated 11 percent in 1971.
Indications are that growth was at least equally rapid in 1972. Indus-
trial production during the first six months of 1972 was almost 15 percent
greater in real terms than during the equivalent period in 1971. Output
of Brazil's principal crops excluding coffee appears to have increased by
about 10 percent in 1972. Simultaneously, the Government succeeded in
its effort to reduce the annual rate of inflation from 20 to i5 percent.
Reflecting good weather and sharp increases in crop yields, food supplies
were abundant and food prices rose by only about half as much in 1972 as
in 1971.
4.        Export growth and diversification continue to be strong.  After
slowing down from 19 percent in 1970 to 5 percent in 1971, largely as a
result of a drop in coffee prices, export growth accelerated during 1972.



-2-
However, the extremely high rate of economic growth continues to cause
large increases in imports, which were up by about 27 percent in the
first semester of 1972 after increasing 20 percent in 1971. The current
account deficit in the balance of payments is likely to have exceeded
$1.5 billion in 1972 compared with $1.3 billion in 1971. The increase
in imports and-in the size of the current account deficit associated
with the high rate of growth in recent years is a matter of concern to
the Brazilian authorities, since they recognize that it would be difficult
to finance such large trade deficits on a sustained basis.   For that reason,
they aim to hold the rate of growth of imports below that of exports,
both by accelerating the pace of growth of exports and by reducing import
requirements. There is a good prospect that objective can be achieved
if the rate of growth of GDP is held to a level near the 8.5 percent per
annum projected in the economic report. However, for the present, the
Government, rather than taking action immediately to moderate the present
11 percent rate of growth, is giving additional attention to export pro-
motion and import substitution, through the system of incentives for
exports of manufactures, an "export corridors"' program designed to expand
non-traditional agricultural exports such as corn, soya and beef, and
encouragement of domestic production of capital goods, raw materials and
intermediate goods (chemicals, petroleum and non-ferrous metals). The
authorities realize that if these programs fail to contain the trade gap,
they may have to take action to reduce the rate of growth, but they feel
that the balance of payments position is now strong enough to make such
action unnecessary in the near term.
5.        The substantial increase during 1971-72 in Brazil's foreign
exchange reserves, to a level approaching US$4 billion, was largely a
result of a large inflow of foreign capital. In 1972, more than US$4.7
billion in gross loan capital, of which US$3.5 billion was in the form
of financial credits, flowed into Brazil. Financial credits represent,
to some extent, a substitute for foreign direct investment which takes
this form because of more favorable tax and administrative treatment
accorded to interest payments than to profit remittances. They are also
a result of foreign borrowlng by Brazilian private and public enterprises
necessitated by imperfections in the domestic financial market which make
loan and equity funds both expensive and scarce. Their growth in recent
years reflects the attractiveness of Brazilian prosperity and stability
to the international financial community. However, the accumulation of
financial credits is greater than the Government expected, and to prevent
this debt from causing foreign liquidity problems, the authorities have
imposed comprehensive controls on debt maturities. The average term on
new financial credits in 1972 was four years as compared with two years
in 1971 and a minimum maturity of six years is now required. To protect
the external liquidity position, the Government is deliberately following
a monetary policy which results in substantial foreign exchange reserve
accumulation. These reserves give the authorities an adequate margin of
time to adjust their overall economic policy in the event that the
financial flows should be reversed. The need to offset much of the
increase in financial credits with foreign exchange reserves reduces



- 3 -
greatly the contribution which such financial credits can make toward
financing the trade deficit. In this context, the existence of large
reserves does not indicate that Brazil has no need to increase the
flow of long-term capital from abroad.
6.        Financial credits are only a partial and imperfect substitute
for long-term capital. The inflow of such credits, net of reserve build-
up, cannot be depended upon to cover as large a proportion of Brazil's
current account deficit as in the recent past if the debt service burden
is to remain manageable. A country at Brazil's stage of development can
be expected to run substantial current account deficits if rapid growth
is to be sustained. The mobilization of large flows of official term
capital will, therefore, play a crucial role over the long-term.
7.        By the end of 1972, Brazil's total external debt is likely to
have exceeded US$9 billion, of which over US$5 billion is financial
credits. The overall debt service ratio was about 54 percent in 1972,
but the substantial reserves which Brazil has accumulated assure liquidity
and should be taken into consideration when appraising creditworthiness.
Furthermore, this debt service ratio includes service on all public and
private debt, including that on financial credits, since Brazilts debt
data do not differentiate between public and private debt. The debt
service ratio for public and publicly guaranteed debt would be very much
lower. Service on total debt excluding financial credits (the bulk of
which is owed by private borrowers) was around 15 percent in 1972.
Nevertheless, it is clear that, however measured, Brazil's debt service
obligations are high. The country's creditworthiness depends on continued
high caliber economic management.
8.        While the official loan capital needed to support Brazil's
economic growth targets is substantial, the direct import needs of most
public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting -- inter alia --
the ability of Brazil's highly developed capital goods industry to compete
successfully under international competitive bidding. Hence, an appreci-
able part of official external financing must continue to be available to
cover domestic expenditures.
Income Distribution and Economic Policy
9.        Although the overall growth and management of the Brazilian economy
in recent years has been outstanding Brazil continues to experience highly
unequal distribution of income accompanied by massive incidence of absolute
poverty. According to the best available statistics, in 1970 the most affluen
20 percent of Brazil's income earners received 62.2 percent of total money in-
come while the poorest 20 percent received 3.2 percent of total money income;
i.e., the richest one-fifth of the population received 19 times as much
income as did the poorest one fifth. There occured reconcentration of
income during the 1960's; in 1960 the income received by the most affluent
fifth was 16 times as great as the income received by the poorest fifth.
Absolute increases in money income levels were achieved in every decile
of the size distribution of Brazilian money income during the 1960's.
In the 9th and 10th deciles -- the highest income brackets -- the



-h -
increases were greatest, averaging 3.1 and 5.2 percent annually in
real terms, respectively. In the lowest four deciles increases in per
capita real money incomes averaged 1.7 percent per annum. In part, the
increases reflect increased monetization of the economy. In 1970 the
incidence of absolute poverty in Brazil continued to be high: as much
as one-third of total income recipients were receiving less than Brazil's
lowest legal minirmum wage, about US$25 per month.  It should be added
that the comparisons of changes in real terms suffer from more than the
usual statistical limitations in view of the degree of the Brazilian
inflation. Further analysis of income distribution problems will be
found in paragraphs 35 to 53 of the economic report.
10.       In the early 1960's poor economic management led to an accele-
ration of inflation -- which peaked at an annual rate of 144 percent
during the first quarter of 1964 -- to balance of payments crises --
which required debt reschedulings in 1961 and 1964 -- and to economic
stagnation; in 1963 per capita domestic product declined by 1.6 percent.
Galloping inflation tended to strike hardest at the wage earner, while
economic stagnation left the economy unable to absorb the large annual
increments in its labor force. Between 1964 and 1967 the Government
implemented a price stabilization and balance of payments retrenchment
program. Not only did economic stagnation continue during this period
but stabilization efforts depended heavily on income restraint policies.
Both the economic crises of the early 1960's and the corrective measures
taken subsequently by the Government are likely to have contributed
significantly to the deterioration of income distribution which took
place during the decade.
11.       Having (a) reduced inflation to an annual rate of about 20 per-
cent; (b) instituted automatic adjustment mechanisms such as the flexible
exchange rate and monetary correction of financial instruments designed
to prevent price distortions from reemerginig in a still inflationary
environment; and (c) improved Brazil's capacity to import by promoting
the expansion and diversification of exports, the Government, by 1968,
was able to undertake policies conducive to a resumption of the rapid
economic growth which the country had enjoyed in the 1950's. As noted,
these policies have been very successful.
12.       The Government counts primarily on the employment created at
rapid rates of growth to alleviate the dualism of the Brazilian economy
and the poverty which results from it. The Government also believes that
maintenance of steady growth -- i.e., avoidance of any acceleration of
inflation and/or external liouidity problems such as those which led to
the stop-and-go development of the early and mid-1960's -- is essential
if further concentration of incomes is to be forestalled. Finally,
through profits controls and wage guidelines the Government is seeking
to insure that wage earners receive a fair share of the benefits of rapid
growth. The growth of employment and -- in some sectors -- wage rates
which has taken place since 1968 probably accounts for most of the improve-
ment in lower level incomes shown for the entire decade by the 1960 and
1970 censuses.



13.       It thus appears that in order to correctly evaluate the impact
on income distribution of policies pursued by the present Government it
would be necessary to use 1968 as the basis for comparison with 1972
data. Unfortunately, there are as yet no sufficient statistics available
to permit sucha comparison. In any event, and notwithstanding job creation
and real wage increases which have been achieved since 1968, the Govern-
ment is determined to make additional efforts to overcome the regional
and sectoral concentrations of poverty which characterize the Brazilian
economy. Here the Government regards as crucially important the fact that
its own propensity to save increases with the pace of economic growth.
This is because the tax structure -- its incidence concentrated in the
industrial sector, Brazil's growth leader -- is highly elastic to changes
in GDP while current expenditures are not. Much of the public sector
savings generated at high rates of growth are being used to finance
programs of great social significance. One of these is the program to
reform and expand the educational structure. Another is the housing
program which, in addition to resettling urban slum dwellers, has created
an enormous amount of employment. Still other programs are designed to
expand potable water and sewerage facilities, to improve nutrition, and
to better the medical facilities available to both urban and rural workers
through the social security system.
14.       The most difficult of the Government's social programs is its
Northeast regional development effort funded by tax sharing and invest-
ment tax credit mechanisms which directly transfer about 5 percent of
Brazil's total domestic savings to the Northeast from the relatively
affluent center-south. Through this program, Brazil has been a world
leader in the innovation of transfer mechanisms designed to redress
regional imbalances in the distribution of income. These mechanisms
have been in existence for some time but their impact became really
significant only with the tremendous improvement in taxing power effected
in the mid-1960's. Moreover, until 1970, resources transferred were con-
centrated on the industrialization of the Northeast. While this enabled
the overall growth of the Northeast economy to keep pace with that of
the rest of the country -- it had very sparse direct employment effects.
In 1970 and 1971 the Government restructured its Northeast development
effort, channelling about half of the resource transfers to that region
into rural development programs designed to:
(a) redistribute land in the Northeast;
(b) equip Northeast farmers with the information and technical
inputs needed to improve their low productivity;
(c) reorganize and reequip the inefficient but very important
Northeast sugar industry; and
(d)  resettle Northeast farmers -- as well as farmers from other
poor regions of the country -- on hitherto unexploited land
on the western margin of the Northeast and in the Amazon.



-6-
15.       These new rural development prograns are only just now getting
underway on a significant scale. Given the need to coordinate Brazil's
various regional development agencies and to study carefully the impli-
cations of regional development goals -- particularly for the ecology of
the Amazon -- it will take time before results become highly visible.
Nevertheless, the effort which the Government is making remains a very
clear indication of its earnest desire to bring the benefits of develop-
ment to all the inhabitants of Brazil.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Lending Strategy
16.       The Bank's lending strategy in Brazil is designed to support
in many ways the Government's development efforts. One important objec-
tive of the Bank's support (and which is especially important in lending
for power) is to help provide the necessary long-term external capital.
In this regard, the Bank seeks to play a complementary role to that of
other lenders, supplementing their resources in individual operations
and financing activities that they are unwilling to finance. Brazil has
needed and will continue to need a very large volume of medium- and long-
term loan capital inflows to sustain rapid growth and achieve its employ-
ment creation and regional development objectives. As emphasized earlier,
the fact that it has accumulated large amounts of foreign reserves in recent
years by no means contradicts this. These reserves have been accumulated
because of the large volume of external financial credits directed to
Brazil and are necessary to maintain an adequate degree of external
liquidity. Without this reserve cushion Brazil's very high overall debt
service ratio would make it highly susceptible to external liquidity
problems and to the kind of "stop-and-go" development experienced in the
1960os.
17.       Another important objective of the Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil is to support adequate sector planning, institutional development
and policy reform, designed inter alia to ensure that public savings
resources are used economically and that an adequate volume of savings
is left available for application in the social sectors. This aspect of
our lending strategy is especially important in our lending in the
transportation sector.
180       The Bank has also been helping to ease the foreign exchange
constraint on Brazilian development by supporting projects designed to
increase Brazil's export capacity and to substitute -- on an economic
basis -- imports. The recently approved livestock project will help
provide the technological base for expansion of Brazil's livestock
exports, an area in which it has considerable comparative advantage.
Support of Brazil's steel industry is helping to maintain Brazilian
self-sufficiency in a commodity which can be produced efficiently in



Brazil owing to that country's bountiful supply of high grade iron ore
and the scale of its internal market.
19.       The Bank is also making efforts to lend increasingly for
projects which will help alleviate human misery, improve the equality
of economic opportunity and increase incomes in the lowest brackets.
It has supported Brazil's education, water and sewerage and land
settlement programs; further support for these programs is under active
preparation. In addition we are seeking to identify new opportunities
to support small scale farming, low cost urban housing, mass urban trans-
port, and improved nutrition. However, such projects not only are hard
to identify but in many cases are small in magnitude. Moreover, when
identified, such projects equally attract the interest of other develop-
ment lenders. It is, therefore, likely that, despite our efforts, only
a limited number of projects in these areas will be available and suitable
for Bank finance in the near future, and that for some time projects of
this kind will constitute only a fraction of total Bank lending to Brazil.
20.       The Bank is also trying to help Brazil in analyzing the social
impact of its development strategy. Bank missions have exchanged views
with the Government on such subjects as the effects of Government policies
on income distribution and regional growth, the impact of payroll taxation
on labor absorption, the capacity of local governments to absorb additional
federal revenue transfers, the cost of domestically produced fertilizer,
and the distribution of agricultural credit. These discussions have helped
to clarify the links between rapid economic growth and human welfare.
Bank Cperations
21.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven
loans totalling US$437 million were approved. So far, in FY73, four loans
amounting to US$113.7 million have been approved covering an Agricultural
Settlement project in Northeast Brazil, the Fourth Highway Construction
project, a Grain Storage project and the Interim Second Livestock Develop-
ment project. Now in process of appraisal is the Itumbiara Hydroelectric
project of Furnas, S,A., in which the Bank loan under consideration will
supplement parallel financing from bilateral sources. We are also holding
discussions with the Brazilians on a program of investment in processing
facilities for agricultural exports, an investment program in the port of
Recife and a water supply program, and hope to present these projects to
the Executive Directors in the next twelve months.
22.       By February 28, 1973, Brazil had received 45 loans from the
Bank amounting to US$1,546.3 million.   Annex II gives a summary statement
of loans and credits as of February 28, 1973. Of the loans declared
effective, 30 have not been fully disbursed. During FY65 through FY69,
disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing to
US$66 million in FY70, US$75 million in FY71, US$137 million in
FY72, and US$92 million in the first half of FY73. Disbursements



-8-
should continue to increase during the next few years. Comments on the
implementation of individual projects are contained in Annex II.
IFC Operations
23.       IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country. Since 1957, IFC has made 21 commitments in Brazil, totalling
UStLO1.5 million, of which US$6.8 million has been repaid and US$36.5 million
sold. Of the balance of IJS$58.2 million, US$411l million represents loans
and US$17.1 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments up to February 28,
1973, is also given in Annex II.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
2h.       The proposed loan to LIGHT for power distribution and sub-
transmission would be the Bank's twenty-fifth for the development of the
power sector in Brazil. Since 1967, the Bank has financed five power
projects: the Porto Colombia hydroelectric project (Loan 565), the Volta
Grande hydroelectric project (Loan 566), the Marimbondo hydroelectric
project (Loan 677), the Salto Osorio hydroelectric project (Loan 728) and
the Sao Simao hydroelectric project (Loan 829).
Electric Power Development
25.       The electric power sector is regulated by the Ministry of Mines
and Energy through the National Department of Wpter and Electric Energy
(DNAEE), responsible for tariff setting, approval of the expansion plans
of the concessionaries, and gathering of statistical information; and
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS) responsible for sector financing
and sector coordination. ELETROBRAS controls thirteen power companies and.
has a minority interest in 23 others. Power companies can be grouped as
follows:
(a) the large publicly-owned genera.ting companies (FURNAS, CESP,
CEMIG, CHESF, ELETROSUL) responsible for 60 percent of the
total power generation in 1971;
(b) privately-owned LIGHT, responsible for 18 percent of total
generation and 47 percent of sales to consumers in 1971; and
(c) other smaller publicly-owned companies responsible for 22
percent of generation and 53 percent of sales to consumers
in 1971.
New generation projects and related transmission are being exclusively
undertaken by the companies in the first group; while new investment by
LIGHT and companies in the third group will be limited to sub-transmission
and distribution.



-9-
26.       From the point of view of national planning of future power
development, the most important step taken by the sector was the studies
covering the power market and energy resources of the Southeast and South
regions carried out by a consortium of Canadian and American consultants
called CANAMiRA, financed by the UNDP and for which, the Bank acted as
Executing Agency. The studies, completed in 1966 for the Southeast regic--,i
and in 1969 for the South region, identified and made feasibility studies of
potential hydroelectric sites, assessed costs of development in relation
thermal and nuclear alternatives, and laid down the order of priority for
implementation on least cost considerations. Since the CANAMBRA study wss
made there have been changes in the load growth projected then, and in thke
relative costs of generating and transmission schemes. Reflecting this f£c'-
on the occasion of the loan for the Sao Simao project, the Government agree"
to have ELETROIAS revise the Development Plan for generation facilities in
the Southeast region. The final report is expected to be ready by the end
of 1973.
27.       The expansion of the sector has also been greatly assisted by
legislation calling for annual tariff adjustments to ensure that tariffs
provide an adequate return (now 10-12 percent) on net revalued fixed
assets and working capital. Taxes and special surcharges added to the
above return, all earmarked for expansion of the sector, bring the averag-
return to 16-17 percent for the sector. ELTROHRAS administers a substan-
tial and rising percentage of the financial resources of the sector:
30.5 percent in 1971 and estimated at 43.7 percent in 1975.
28.       The average rate of growth of electric power consumption from
1967 to 1971 was 11 percent; in 1971 it was 12.7 percent. Regional dis-
parities, however, were large.  The Northeast, with a 110 KWh per capita
consumption in 1971 grew at 15.5 percent, whereas the Southeast, with
795 KWh per capita, grew at 10.3 percent.
29.       In order to meet the demand for power, Brazil will have to inst 1!
an average of 2,100 MW per year in 1973-76 and spend about US$1.2 billion
equivalent per year. Because of the need to channel their contributions LI
sectors less able to raise funds for expansion, the Federal and State Govern-
ments will be reducing their contributions to the power sector from 11.2 per-
cent of the 1971 investment program to 5e5 percent of the 1975 investment
program. Since the capacity of local capital markets is still limited, the
power sector will have to continue to rely heavily on internal cash genera-
tion. It is expected that this source will contribute roughly 60 percent
of the 1971-75 program (70 percent if compulsory loans from consumers are
included). Most of the balance is to come from external financing. During
the late sixties, the financing gap between sector requirements and internal
cash generation plus govermment contributions was primarily filled by the
Bank, the IDB and USAID; but assistance from these sources will not suffice
in the seventies and additional sources of financing are being sought. To
mobilize new sources and maximize foreign participation, Brazil has been
engaging in joint or parallel financing schemes under which bilateral
credits have financed a substantial part of imported equipment and the BanK
has predominantly financed the items for which bilateral credits are not



- 10 -
normally available on favorable terms. In the recent Marimbondo and
Sao Simao power projects, estimated to cost US$682 million, the Bank
contribution will be US$140 million, while bilateral sources will
provide US$91 million. Similar patterns of financing will be followed
for other power projects under consideration.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The project consists of the 1972-74 portion of LIGHT's ongoing
expansion program, and is to increase LIGHT's transmission and distribu-
tion facilities to meet the load growth and improve reliability of service
in its area of concession, comprising the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo and nearby areas. The project was appraised by the Bank in June 1972;
negotiations were held on February 1973, with Dr. Moacyr Lisboa Lopes repre-
senting the Government and the LIGHT delegation headed by Mr. R. E. Spence.
31.       In the Sao Paulo area the transmission capacity will be increased
by converting the east portion of the 230 kV ring to 345 kV, and by building
3h5 kV transmission lines to a transformer station east of Sao Paulo. The
supply to the sub-transmission system will be increased by building a 240 MVA
transformer station south of the city and a 500 MVA transformer station in
the downtown area and by increasing the capacity at the existing substations.
The 88 kV sub-transmission system will be extended and reinforced by con-
structing 312 km of overhead lines, rebuilding 576 km of existing lines and,
installing 29 km of underground cables. In the Rio de Janeiro area, the
132 kV transmission capacity will be increased by constructing 97 km of
overhead lines, rebuilding 174 km of existing lines and installing 68 km
of underground cables. The planned transmission will provide facilities
for future power delivery from bulk supply points and for load growth,
including 132 kV customers in a new industrial zone west of Rio de Janeiro,
a 320 MVA transformer station (fed by 132 kV underground cable) in the
downtown area, and the new airport under construction at Galeao.
32.       To supply new loads and provide emergency transfer capacity,
distribution substation capacity will be increased almost 50 percent by
building 33 new substations and by increasing capacities at 101 existing
substations. The distribution systems will be expanded to supply an
estimated 717,000 new customers, requiring the installation of 63,500 km
of overhead conductor and 843 km of underground cable and an increase of
35 percent in the installed distribution transformer capacity. One under-
ground network will be added in the Sao Paulo area. Supervisory control
equipment will be provided to control some distribution substations from
area centers. About 925 MVAR of static capacitors will be installed for
power factor correction.



Th2 Borrower
33.       LIGHT, the prospective borrower, is a subsidiary of a
Canadian company, Brascan Limited, formerly Brazilian Traction, Light
and Power Company Limited, in 1912 to acquire the stock of several
Canadian power companies then-operating in Brazil. Under Federal Govern-
ment concessions, LIGHT is authorized to generate, purchase, transmit and
distribute power, in specified areas of the States of Sao Paulo, Guanabara,
Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.
34.       LIGHT is currently the largest private company in Brazil in terms
of revenues and share capital. LIGHT's 1971 revenues from the sales of
electricity exceeded Cr$2,230 million while at the end of 1971 its share
capital amounted to Cr$2,321 million. Its shares were held 83.3 percent
by Brascan Limited, 9.5 percent by Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico, 0.2 percent by ELETROERAS and 7.0 percent by other minority
shareholders.
35.       LIGHT has a large, well-qualified, planning, engineering and
construction staff developed over many years and, therefore, engineering
consultants will not be required for the project. The project planning
and preliminary engineering is prepared. LIGHT's staff will complete the
detailed engineering and will supervise the construction and installation
work. Construction of most of the new transmission and distribution lines
and civil works for substations and underground systems will be contracted
to local firms with LIGHT supplying the materials. LIGHT personnel will
perform installation work on substations and underground systems and will
handle all transmission and distribution work in areas on or near existing
circuits to ensure personnel safety and system security.
Project Cost and Financing
36.       The total investment cost of the project is estimated at
US$382.6 million equivalent, including imported materials estimated at
US$34.7 million equivalent. Total financing required in 1972-74, including
increases in working capital, is US$385.7 million equivalent, which LIGHT
plans to obtain as follows:

37.       The financing plan reflects the impact on LIGHT of a new law
introduced by the Brazilian Government on January 1972. The law pertains
to the allowable return of electric utilities and the use of funds from a
special surcharge on tariffs (reversion funds). Formerly these funds had
been automatically loaned to the utility that had raised them. Because
of LIGHT's size and financial strength, ELETROBRAS has decided that LIGHT
is now no longer eligible to borrow "reversion" funds. Although LIGHT's
allowable return under the new law may go up from 10 to 12 percent, the
consequent additional revenues will fall far short of making up the loss
of "reversion" funds. In fact, in the period 1972-74, it is estimated
that as a result of the new law LIGHT must find almost US$100 million,
i.e., the equivalent of about 25 percent of its construction program,
from new financing sources. Thus, LIGHT must now rely heavily on the
financial markets, and increasingly the international bond market, to
satisfy the balance of its cash needs.
38.       To assist LIGHT to raise funds in the financial markets, Brascan
and the Government agreed on two Eurobond issues of US$20 million each.
The first one was successfully placed in October 1972, and the second
issue is scheduled to be made in 1974.   The securities are actually being
issued by Brascan International, a subsidiary of Brascan Limited, which
relends the proceeds to LIGHT. Between 19h9 and 1959, the Bank made four
loans totalling about US$120 million equivalent to the Brazilian Traction,
Light and Power Company Limited, now Brascan Limited, to finance mainly
power development by its Brazilian subsidiaries, and the Government and
LIGHT felt that for the Bank to renew this association would increase the
confidence of the private international financial community in the compaxy.
The Government and LIGHT, therefore, requested the Bank to participate in
the financing of the 1972-74 portion of LIGHT's ongoing expansion program.
As a preliminary step, the Bank agreed in early 1972 to modify certain
security provisions of the existing loans made to Brascan's predecessor
in order to facilitate the issuing of new bonds for the benefit of the
LIGHT expansion program. In these circumstances, Bank lending for the
LIGHT expansion program should be viewed as a catalytic measure facili-
tating the tapping of additional sources of finance for the expansion of
the electric energy sector in Brazil.
39.       During 1972-74, LIGHT plans to increase its share capital by
some US$40 million equivalent. Of this total, a US$20 million equivalent
issue was offered in 1970 to existing shareholders for subscription in
cash at par value. The company had not received permission to make a
public offering in Brazil because of depressed capital market conditions
prevailing during most of 1972; under these circumstances the Brazilian
monetary authorities encouraged foreign controlled firms to seek funds
outside Brazil. However, LIGHT expects to be able to make public offer-
ings in the future as market conditions improve. This would be in line
with the Brazilian Government policy of promoting wider ownershiip of
predominantly foreign owned companies provided that these companies in
addition to tapping local savings also bring into the country long-term
external resources.

40.       in connection with the aforementioned issue of new shares,
Brascan Limited waived a portion of its preemptive rights and the
minority shareholders which held about 17 percent of the shares subscribed
about one-third of the issue. The balance was subscribed by Brascan Limited
through one of its non-utility investment subsidiaries in Brazil. During
negotiations, Brascan has agreed to support LIGHT's planned share capital
increase in 197t4 of US$20 million equivalent and to subscribe all shares to
which it would be entitled, or should Brascan Limited decide to forego its
preemptive rights, any shares not taken up by the public or by other share-
holders.
41.       The proposed Bank loan would be secured by LIGHT's unsubordinated
debentures issued under an existing trust indenture set up between LIGHT
and the National Trust Company of Canada. This is required to place the
Bank in a pari-passu position with other lenders. According to the terms
of this indenture, LIGHT may issue debentures for amounts not exceeding
60 percent of the book value of its net electric plant. The debentures
are secured by a first floating charge under Brazilian law on the under-
takings, property and assets of LIGHT.
42.       Borrowings other than from the Bank include principally:
a) About US$40 million of Eurobonds floated in two install-
ments by Brascan International, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Brascan Limited (see paragraph 38). The first install-
ment amounting to US$20 million, was successfully placed
at par during 1972. An amount equivalent to the principal
of these bonds is being loaned to LIGHT on the same terms:
15 years, including a 3-year grace period, at 8-1/4 percent
per annum. The second placement is planned for 1974.
b) A US$30 million 6-1/2 year loan, which includes a 3-year
grace period and bears interest at 1-3/4 percent over the
London one-year interbank rate, was arranged for immediate
drawdown with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York
during 1972.
c) Export credits of up to Can$31 million have been arranged
by Brascan Limited for the benefit of LIGHT with the Canadian
Export Development Corporation and the Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce with the guarantee of the Brazilian Government.
This credit would be used in the period 1973-76 and would be
repayable over eleven years, commencing in 1977, with interest
at about 7-1/2 percent. Of this total amount some US$13 mil-
lion equivalent would be used in 1973-74.
d) About US$40 million would be loaned to LIGHT by Brascan
Limited, out of that portion of its dividends from LIGHT
which cannot be remitted outside of Brazil.

LIGHT's Financial Position
43.       In the period 1969-71 LIGHT earned 10 percent on its investment
and after distributing a 10 percent annual cash dividend was able to
finance normal expansion almost entirely out of net internal cash genera-
tion (h9 percent), "reversion" funds (34 percent) and borrowings (17 percent).
The long-term outlook is excellent and will allow LIGHT to increase its
annual dividend rate to 12 percent in line with the policy of promoting
wider local share ownership.  Future financial prospects will necessarily
depend heavily on the continuation by the Brazilian Government of a reasonable
electricity tariff policy.  In this context, it would be an event of default
if a change in the legislation of the Guarantor were to occur, which, in the
judgment of the Bank, prevented LIGHT from operating its business in accordance
with sound financial and public utility practices. In the period 1972-76,
LIGHT's debt service is expected to be covered 3.2 times by its gross internal
cash generation and its combined debt service and dividends 1.6 times, a level
virtually unchanged from that experienced in the period 1969-71.
Market
4h.       In the five-year period 1966-71, the number of consumers served
by LIGHT increased from 2.h million to 3.3 million, i.e., an average annunal
increase of 6.7 percent. In the same period, electricity sales grew from
12,797 GWh to 20,310 GWh, i.e., an average annual increase of 9.7 percent.
The growth rates for the major load classifications were: residential
10.2 percent; commercial 8.8 percent; and industrial 10.2 percent.
45.       LIGHT forecasts that its sales will continue to grow at 9.7 percemt
annually in the period 1971-76 and that by 1976 its system energy requirement
will be almost 36,000 GWh with a peak load of over 6,000 MW. The growth in
the residential component is forecast at 9.3 percent annually due to the
4.4 percent annual population increase in LIGIIT's service area (compared to
the country's 2.9 percent), the potential market in non-electrified households
(almost 1/3 of the total), the Barra da Tijuca urbanization projeet west of
Rio de Janeiro, and increased use of electrical appliances. The growth rate
for the commercial component is forecast at 7.5 percent annually, somea-hat
lower than in prior years, reflecting a slightly lower growth pattern in
commercial loads in Rio de Janeiro following the Federal Government's move
to Brasilia. LIGHT forecasts that industry in the Southeast region will
continue to concentrate near Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, resulting in a
10.6 percent annual growth in the industrial component of LIGHT's load.
Procurement
46.       Procurement of the equipment and material financed by the loan
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The Bank loan would be used by
LIGHT to finance equipment items that are expected to be procured outside
Brazil. However, Brazilian bidders would be allowed the normal 15 percent
margin of preference and the Bank loan would finance the total cost of any



- 15 -
contracts awarded to Brazilian manufacturers. Goods financed by the
Canadian Export Development Corporation will be procured after competi-
tive bidding in Canada. LIGHT will procure the remainder of the equipment
needed for its capital investment program through national competitive
bidding. Based on past experience, the cost of procurement of equipment
reserved for Brazilian suppliers is estimated to have been around 20 per-
cent higher than if it had been purchased abroad (excluding import duties
and indirect taxes).
Rate of Return
47.       The 1972-74 slice of LIGHT's expansion will affect many points
throughout the LIGHT system. The benefits associated with this investment
cannot be isolated. However, a return of at least 15 percent would be
obtained by relating the revenues resulting from the 1972-74 expansion to
the estimated incremental costs.
Environmental Aspects
48.       The project includes facilities to transport large blocks of
power to the downtown areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro by under-
ground cables and to distribute this power by extending the underground
systems, limiting surface installations in these areas. To minimize the
land area taken by power facilities in the suburban and rural areas,
LIGHT will utilize existing rights-of-way wherever possible by raising
the power transmission and distribution voltage levels through the use
of larger conductor sizes and more circuits. Thus, the project will
cause little detrimental effect to the environment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade,
S.A., and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative
Republic of Brazil and the Bank, the draft Shareholders Agreement between
Brascan Limited and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The major features of these agreements
have already been described in this report.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
There are now 26 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/7h    Estreito HYdroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million
loans of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing
Date: June 30, 1974. The project is proceeding on sc muie.
Equipment costs were substantially below estimates, so that
disbursements have been less than forecast. The original
closing date was April 1, 1971.
bob       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965 Closing Date:   December 31, 1973.   The
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about
eighteen months) except for the installation of equipment
for an associated transmission line. Ordering of this equip-
ment was delayed, and the loan is now expected to be fully
disbursed by December 31, 1973, four years after the initial
closing date. The original closing date was December 31, 1969,
postponed to December 31, 1971, and further postponed to
February 29, 1972.
4.2       Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:   US$49 million loan of
March 15, 196   Closing Date:   December 31, 197T.  All the
four generators were commissioned during 1971 and the project
has been completed. Disbursements will extend up to the end
of 1974 primarily because equipment, originally defective
has made necessary a postponement of the last payments to
suppliers. The original closing date was April 30, 1971,
postponed to April 30, 1973.
b75/176/
477/478   Power Distribution Projects:   US$6.2, US$8.1 and US$41 million
loans of December 19, 1966; Closing date for Loans 475 and 476:
June 30, 1973; Closing date for Loan 477: December 31, 1973.
These power distribution projects had a slow start but after
administrative reorganization in 1970 they gained momentum.
Procurement for the projects has been completed and all equip-
ment will be delivered by middle-1973. Most of the overhead
distribution system has been completed; construction work on
transmission lines, substations and underground distribution
systems will extend into 1973. The original closing dates
were December 31, 1970, postponed to December 31, 1972.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding tiat
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weakness in project execution.

Loan No.
516       Livestock Project:  US$40 million loan of September 23, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31. 1973.   After initial delays due
to marketing and organizational difficulties, the livestock
credit program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
Some problems arose in early 1972 with respect to the calcu-
lation of interest on indexed principal amounts during the
grace period but these have now been settled. The loan is
fully committed and disbursements are expected to be completed
by the closing date, December 31, 1973.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan
of October 23, 196d; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes
in the project layout and design have increased substantially
the local cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS. Construc-
tion work is well advanced and the project is likely to be
completed on schedule.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:   US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, l968; Closing Date: January 31, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
Powerhouse construction cost estimates have increased by 72 per-
cent due to additional work resulting from foundation difficulties
and price escalation greater than estimated but, as the original
cost was very low, the resulting cost per kWh is still attractive.
No financial difficulty is expected for the company as a result of
the overruns. The project is now two-thirds completed and the first
generating unit is expected to be in operation in February 1974.
567       First Highway Construction Project:   US$26 million loan of
October 23, 196t; Closing Date: March 31, 1973.    The First
Highway Construction project is virtually completed at a cost
slightly below estimates.
656       Industry:  US$25 million of February 16, 1970 to Banco do
Nordeste do Brasil (3BNB; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
Commitments of the loan by ENB has continued to be slow. ENB
recently submitted to the Bank several loan applications for sub-
projects which, however, require reformulation by the sponsors and
BNB. A Bank mission will arrive in Brazil on March 19 to review
the progress of the project.
676       Second Highway Construction Pro ect:   US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date:   July 31, 197h.  The Second Highiway
Construction project is almost di percent completed.   Although
disbursements are now slightly behind schedule, the project is
expected to be completed without delay and within cost estimates.

Loan No.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Closing Date:  May 31, 1977.   Construction
work is proceeding on schedule. The cost of increased
excavation and concrete work resulting from poor rock foun-
dation is expected to be mostly offset by a reduction in
earth fill work. A US$26 million overrun, caused by equip-
ment prices higher than estimated and additional transmission
facilities, was covered by a loan from a commercial bank.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977.    The construction
of the Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satis-
factorily and no cost overrun is foreseen at this time. The
construction of the transmission system is being held up pending
clarification of ELETROSUL's market which has become uncertain
as a result of the failure of demand to grow as rapidly as ex-
pected, the addition of heretofore unscheduled generating
capacity, and the possibility that other entities will install
still further capacity.  In seeking new outlets for its future
power production, ELETROSUL is hoping to sell some of its out-
put to the Southeast region. It has requested Bank approval
for changing the transmission scheme included in the Salto
Osorio project. Bank agreement, however, must await resolution
of ELETROSUL's position in the South region and clarification
of its prospects for selling power in the Southeast.
755       Education Project:   US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction
and equipment of the project schools is proceeding in accordance
with the revised schedule agreed upon in September 1972.
756       Santos Port Project:   US$45 million loan of June 21  1971-
Closing Date: September 30, 1976. The overall port investment
program at Santos was recently expanded to accomodate increased
exports under the Government's "export corridors" program. Cost
estimates for the Bank-financed project increased from US$78.5
million to US$108.1 million, reflecting worse-than-foreseen soil
and construction conditions, higher than initially estimated costs
for completing new railway connections, and Bank-approved increases
in the size of project dredging equipment and the corn silo. The
Borrower and the Bank are now reviewing the combined impact of the
above developments on the project's rate of return. Preparation
of tender documents is nearing completion but, pending results of
the above review, tenders for civil works and equipment for the
corn and container terminals and rail access thereto, have not been
asked. Satisfactory progress, assisted by management consultants,
has been made in improving port operations at Santos and in pre--
paring recommendations for the reorganization of the National
Department of Ports and Navigable Waterways. Selection of consul-
tants is underway for the National Port Development Plan study.

757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:  US$22 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project
suffered initial delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo
not furnishing the required counterpart funds The required
funds are now included in the state budget and the project
is proceeding satisfactorily.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$37 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date: june 30 1975.    The original
project design included the pumping of untreated sewage into
an area reservoir reDresenting a major source of water and
serving as an important recreational facility for the Sao
Paulo area. Earlier studies had shown that the reservoir
could absorb the organic pollution without damage for some
time. Area residents, however, have objected to this solu-
tion and subsequent technical review has questioned the
initial judgment that no ecological harm would be caused.
As a result, the project has been delayed to modify the
original design so that it would exclude the discharge of
raw sewage and include a treatment facility. The Bank is
now considering the Borrower's new design proposals. Bidding
procedures are in progress for other portions of the project.
786       Railway Project - MBR.   US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date:  Seember 30,9T5.      A delay of about six months
occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing the new
railway link for the MER iron ore mine due to engineering prob-
lems encountered and inadequate project management by the
Federal Railways. Work on site is now proceeding at a rapid
pace, and much of the lost time is being regained such that
the project should be sufficiently completed to allow new ore
traffic to commence by, or soon after, the planned completion
date of July 1, 1973.
787       MBR Iron Ore Project:  US$50 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31 1976. The estimated cost of the
project has increased due to major design changes for the port
terminal and several investment additions to the project. A
new financing plan has been agreed with the Borrower and target
completion dates at the mine and terminal should be met.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:   US$ 64.5 million loan of
February L, 1972; Closing Date    July I, 1976.  The loan became
effective on August 31, 1972, and the project is proceeding
according to schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project:   US$63 million loan of

project is just getting underway. Bids for the civil works
were opened January 15, 1973, and it appears international
bidding has had a beneficial effect on the project.
