SUMX&hY AND CONCLUbIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project for LIGHT-Servicos
de Eletricidade S.A. (LIGHT), the private electric utility serving an area
centered in the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao I'aulo in the
Southeast Reg-n of Brazil.  The project is the 1972-7h slice of LI3iiT's
continuing exfansion program which aims to increase its transmi.;- rn and
distribution .ikcilities to meet a projected annual load growth of 9.7% and
to improve the reliability of its service. The total cost of the project
is eb ';iat^7 at US$382.6 millifcl enivtivrr ' including some US$34.7 million
equival nt for t.ie 'o.t of 'he t-quiprietit and material which is expeote, to
be purc1u Žd outside of Prazll.  LIC!,'lis pr' jectel investment in the period
1972-76 represents slightly over 11% of the Lotal projected investment in
the power sector.
ii.       As a result of a change in the Brazilian legielaticii gzverning
the electric utilities, effective January 1972 a major portion of LlTHT's
local financing - Jzovernment "reversioni" funds - is no longer available
and LIGHT rust lurn therefore to the financial markets in order to complete
its financial requirements. Because LIGHT has never borrowed in the foreign
markets, it has requested the Bank, with the support of the Brazilian
Government, to participate in the financing of the 1972-7T  porticn of its
continuing expansion on the grounds that fiank presence will enhance its
ability to obtain the required funds. A Bank loan of US$20 million is
therefore proposed to finance the foreign exchange cost of some of the
distribution and subtransmission equipment and material roquired for the
last two years of the three-year program. The Bank loan would be guaranteed
by the Brazilian Government.
iii.      This would be the first loan made direct to LIGHT, although the
Bank has made four previous loans totalling US$120 million equivalent
between 1949 and 1959 to Brascan Imited, LIGHT's parent, company.  At the
end of 1972 some US$20 million was ouitstanding on these loans. The Bank
has made 24 loans totalling US$752 million to the electric power sector in
Brazil. The bulk of these loans has financed hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission systems in the Southeast Region which consumes
about 77% of Brazil's electricity production.
iv.       LIGHT was created in 1967 to amalgamate the idrazilian power
subsidiaries of Brascan Limited. It is responsible for tce transmission ;.nd
distribution of power in the States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro and
parts of the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. It is the largest
private company in .3razil in terms of share capital and rev'rnues and its
staff numbers over 25,000. During 1971 LIGHI's generating capacity was lb8
of the national total and its s. les covered about 47% of the total
consumption. It has a strong financial position which can be attributed to



- ii -
it efficient management and the favorable Brazilian tariff legislation.
v.        LIGHT will do its own planning and engineering for the expansion
program and will supervise the construction and inst llation of the new
facilities. Most of the equipment and material for the program will be
purcha&ed locally in Brazil. Items to be financed by the Bank will largely
be imported subject to international competitive bidding with Brazilian
suppliers free to compete with the normal 15$% preference.
vi.       LIGHT has been actively looking for lenders and with the
assistance of Brascan Limited, and potential Bank participation, has
virtually assured itself of adequate financing for the period 1972-7h.
Total requirements of US$382.6 million equivalent would be provided W4%
from net internal cash generation, 4% from the proposed Bank loan, 23% from
other foreign sources, 11X from a napital share issue and the remaining 18%
from various local sources.
vii.      In developing its expansion program, LIGHT conducted computer
load flow studies to determine the minimum additional facilities that would
provide the required se.vice.  LIGHT's expansion program is a well-balanced
system development plan.  The return for the 1972-74 slice of LIGHT's
expansion program is at least 15%.
viii.     The project  s suitable for a Bank loan of US$20 million equival-
ent for a term of 20 years including a three-year grace period.

BRAZIL
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01       LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade 3.A. (LIGHT), a private company
owned principally by Brascan Limited of Canada, has asked the Bank to
participate in the financing of the 1972-7. portion of its ccntinuing
syster. expansion program. This three-year slice of the program at an
estimated cost of US$382.6 million equivalent will increase LIGHT's
trransinssion and distribution facilities to meet the expected load gro-dth
in its service area, comprising the cities of Sac Paulo, Rio de Janeiro
and nearby areas.
1.02      Ban), participation in LIGHT's program was requested oa) the
basis that Bans association would enhance LIGHT's ability to obt.in funds
in foreign capital markets where LIGHT has had no previous exper:.ence.
1.03       A Bank loan of USO20 million equivalent or aLout 5% of the total
program cost is proposed to finance the purchase of some of the required
distribution and subtransmission equipment and material, includirg
transformers, oil-filled cables, and network protectors.
1.01     Betwieen 1',49 and 1959 the Bank made i loan- totalling about
USOL120 million equivalent to Brascan Limrted's predecessor, Brazilian
Traction, Light and Power Company, Ltd., which relent the proceeds to its
utility subsidiaries in Brazil to finance the cost of power and
communications facilities. Approximately US$20 million equivalent is
still outstanding on these loans.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. Moore, Prenoveau and
Cordukes. It is based on the findings of Bank milssions to Brazil in June,
1972 composed of Messrs. Moore, Prenoveau and Cordukes an(d to Toronto in
July, 1972 composed of Messrs. Prenoveau and Cordukez 



II. THE POWER SECTOR
Organization of the Pow'zr Sector
2.01      The Ministry of Mines and Energy controls the power sector through
its Department of Water and Electric Energy, iuhich performs regulatory
functions, including granting licenses for hydroelectric sites, allotting
concession areas, setting tariffs, and approving expansion plans. Financial
and technical coordination within the sector are the responsibility of Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS), a government agency under the
Ministry of Mines and Energy which has direct control of 13 Federal utilities
and minority interest in 23 State utilities. ELETRBRA!S collects and allocates
public funds used for electrification and expansioh, programs, monitors company
5-year budgets, reviews company con.,truction programs, and plays a coordinating
role in the planning and operation of the country's power system-. ELETROBRAS
is not completely effective in the coordination of the power sector mostly
because of its lack of legal autnority to demand infor..Ltion from the conces-
sionainrs and to impose its decisions on them but with its increasing financial
resources (para. 2.0?) it is expected this situation will improve.
2.02      The early development of the power sector in Brazil was done almost
completely by private companies. Q)f these, LIGHT was a major force in
establishing the electricity supply in the country through its development
of the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo systems and its introduction over the
years of technological improvements.  LIGHT is the only major private utility
mparlany ..till operating in Brazil; most of the other private companies producing
electricity are industrial "self-oroducers" which account for only 9% of the
national electricity production.
2.03      The Ministry of Mines and Energy has gradually assumed responsibility
fer oulk suDoly of electricity by ini,iating the development of major hydro-
electric sites and tAie associated t:an.;mission systems in conjunction with the
State utllities; in the future LIHT's role will be principally that of a
distributi n company. Under existing arrangements LIUG14 must purchase its
additional p-wer requiremenr.ts from Furnas-Centrai3 Eletricas S.A. (FIJRNAS), the
Rederal utility responsible for supply in the States of Guanabara and Rio de
Janeiro, and Centra;s Eletricas de .;ao Paulo S.A. (CESP), the State-owned
utility respoonsible f)r supply in the State of Sa) Paulo.
power in the S^utheast Region
?.OuL     Almost Q,0j0 MW of the country's 13,000 MW of generating capacity
is in the Southeast Region, which includes LIGHT's service area. The
Southeast Region compri,es the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara,
Mina.  Gerai; and Espirito Santo.  It is the major contributor to the economy
of lirazil; with only 13{ of the country's area, it contains 43% of its pop-
@ ati-n and accounts f)r 70% of its industrial production, hO% of its agricultural
iutput ana 7,% ^f its electricity production.  The city of Sao P,aulo with 6½
millio-n r'.pulation is the largest industrial center in South America.
2.0t     IPlans have been approved for the construction of more than 7,000 MW
ol additional generating capacity in t.he Southeast Region.  This will ensure an
adequate ower .upply for the Revion, including the LIGHT system, until the
late spventies.



-3-
2.06      System operation in the Southeast Region is well coordinated
through the activities of a Committee for the Coordination of Operations.
Its activities include water storage regulation, studi.s on reserve capacity,
coordination of maintenance programs, standardization of technical terminiol-
ogy, system load and frequency control, preparation of emergency procedures,
and, the analysis of system disturbances. The Committee was particularly
effective in optimizing the use of the available power resouirces and mini-
mizing power shortages during a severe drought in 197 .
Sector Tariffs
2.07      The current Brazilian tariff policy aims at providing electric
utilities with sufficient funds to cover their operating expenses and obtaini
a reasonable return on investwent. The tariff policy is embodied in legislation
which has evolved gradually since publication of the wator c,de of 1934.
Currently the Brazilian legislation calls for recovery of costs, equal treatment
for like groups of consumers and varying charges f-"- different load factors.
Introductions and revisions of all tariffs must be approved by the Fational
Department for Water and Electricity. Consumers are divided into two groups -
those connected at or above 2,300 volts (Group A) and those connected at a
lower voltage (Group B).  All tariffs must be calculated on a two-pa't basis
for capacity and energy, the concessionRires having the right to establish
blocks. The Group A consumers must be charged separately for capacity and
energy whereas the Group B, in practice, is charged on equivalent energy
tariffs. LTGHT's tariffs generally follow this procedure except that the
block type of tariff is not used for the Group B consumers.
2.08      In the recent past and up until the end of 1971, legi3lation allowed
a return of un to 10% on remunerable investment (revalued assets in ope:stion
plus various current assets). Effective 1972, however, a rate of return of
not less than 10% and not more than 12% is permitted.
2.09      "Reversion" funds are a special tax collected from the electric
utilities hy the Federal Government. This tax is the equivalent of un to 3%
of the value of fixed assets in operation and is recovered as an operating
expense in the tariffs of the electric utilities. "Reversion" fund., are used
to develop powpr sector facilities.  Tn the past, these funds cnuld be borrowed
automatically by the company from which they originated.  Effective January
1972, h,owever, "reversion't funds are administered by ELETROIsRA!2 who riecides, which
of the sector rompanies may borrow them. This recent change will ;trengthen
ELETROBRA!7' financial influence in the Brazilian power sector, will give the
Government morp flexibility in allocating this important portion -f the sector's
financial resources and by denying its use selectively to srMe of the sector
companies, will eventually increase total sector resources by f)rcing these
companies to resort to the financial markets to satisfy their additional financial
requirements.
1/ This Committee is composed of representatives of nine companies of the South-
east Region and adjacent areas, namely FURNAS, CESP, CEMIG, CELF, CELG, CBEE,
CPFL, LIGHT and COPEL.

2.10      In addition to the cost of service, tte electricity bills include
various taxes and compulsory loans, the proceeds of which are also administered
by ELETROBRAS to develop power sector facilities.  For details of tariffs

Enpineerin7 and Construction
4.07       LI>T,HT has a large, well-qualified planning, engineering, and construction
staff develined over many years and therefore engineering consultants will not
be required fzr the prsject.  The project planning and preliminarv engineering is
prenared.  LIGHT's staff will c:,mplete the ens7ineering and will supervise the
construction and inst-illation  rrk. 0-if,' {-'  n -arried out by LTCHT and cGntrac-
forces. Con,itruction of most of the new transrmission and distribution lines and
civil works for substations ai-d underground systems will be contracted to local
firms with LIGHT supplying the materials. LIGHT personnel will perform installation
work on substations and underground systemw and will handle all transmission and
distribution work in areas on or near existing circuits to ensure personnel safety
and system security.
1/ LIGHIT has not separated the contingency items in its cost estimate but con-
siders that the estimated amounts include adequate allDwances for possible
cost increases; in any event, as it is a continuing distribution and trans-
mission program, adjustments could ensiLy be made to the program to keep
within the LIGHT estimate, should the need ari se.
g/ If Brazilian manufacturers bid successfully, the costs of such contracts
would be included in the Bank's disbursements.

Procurement
1.o8       Procurement of' the equipmnent and material to be financed by the
orovosed loan would be cn the basis of international competitive bidding under
the Bank's procurement guidelines.  LIGHT's staff includes a group of pro-
curement sDecialists who wculd handle the procurerent.  In the past, LI(Hfr
h-as ir:c,rted the eauipment and material selected for nrospective B.ank financing
and exDects to continue importing them in the future because of limited local
manufacturing capability for such gcods.  In the event that Brazilian manu-
factuLrers bid they would be alicosed the normal 15' msargin of preference for
bid comnarison; the loan would fin-ance the total cost of such contracts
a-warded to Brazilian manufacturers. Brazil is a meirber of LAFrA, but it has
not asked fcr a "regional" oreprerfrnce margin fer bids submitteo by members
of LXAi".  In .adljicA. to the bar.: finarnced procurement, equipment and material

VI. FINtdXLIL iaSid:KTb
6.01      After a period of stagnation in the early 2960's, LIGHT's financial
position improved rapidly after 1961. as a result of nev tariff legislation.
Indeed in the period 1969-71, LIGqIT was able to finance nrrrnal expansion
almost eriirely out of net internal cash generation, "reversion" funds.
(para. 2.(09) End modest borrowings from its parent, Brascan Limited.  uiS a
result of t..he latest law effective 1972, LIGH;T has lcst "reversion" funus
but as a subs --.tute is successfully resorting to the financial markets in and
out of Brazil, aided at this time by prospective Bank participation.  LIGHT's
long-term out-look is excellent; it depenos mostly on r.aintenance of
efficient nanezgement at LIGHT and continuation b.r the Brazilian Government
of a reasonable tariff policy.
Past and Present Finazces
6.02      !(-eislation introduced in the rucld-1560's rorrected the situation
referred to :in para. 3.06 by introducing mandatory periodic as3ct. revaluation
and by setting up a new rate-making procedure, tne highlight of which
consisted in ensuring that tariffs would be adjusted regularly as required
to enable the electric utilities to earn up to 10A on their investnent.l/
t;s a res.il t, during the late 1560's, LIGHT's finances i-mprovea and, as they
did, prorer .ainte.ance and expansion plans were resiumed.
6.03      in the peror. 1969-71, L:.--HT earned iO; on its investment and, after
distributi-ng a 10,0 annual casn dividend, was aDle to carry out nonnal expansion
wi th funds provided L9  frorr. its ne' internal cash generation, 3J.U' from
"reversion" funds, 11, from- loans of i`rascan Limited, and 6, fror. r.iscellaneous
sources.  .in that perio', LIG:HT's debt service was covered 314 times by its
gress internal cash generation and its ccmbined debt service aund divic'end
payr.cnts were covered 1.6 tines by its gross internal cash generation. At
December 31, 1971, its a.sets totalled about UM.$135 million. n,l its debt'
equity ratio stood at 37/63.
1972-7L Financing Plan
6.oh       Effective January 1972, the Brazilian Government introduced a new
law which mainly affects the ailowable' retur-. of electric utilities (Annex 2)
and the use of "reversion" funds (para. 2 .(').  This law is having important
effects on the financing arrangements of some of the power companies, notably
those of LIGHT.
6.o5       Because of LIGHT's size ard financial strength, the Government has
indicated that LIGHiT is no longer eligible to borrow "reversion" funds.
Although LIGHT's allowable return un-er the new law may go v'j from. 10  to 12k,
the acditional revenues will come far shIrt of m. ng uF the loss ofI
1/  Investmxent subject to renuneration ionder l.razilian legislation is detailec
on page 3 of Annex 2.



"reversicr." fulids.  in fact, in the pcriod 1972-7L, it is estinated that as
a result of the new law; LIGIIT must find almost U6$1(Y riUjoion from new
financirg sources i.e. the equivalent of acout 255  cf its construction
progran.  Thus LIGHT must now rely heavily on the financial r.arkets to
satis7y the balance of -ts cash neeos.
6.06      LIGi'T has not previousl- borrowed out-side of Brazil, other than
from institutions such as the Bank (thro-rgh its parent) and AID.  kwith the
support of the Brazilian Goverrirent, LICrGHT has requAesed the Bank to
participaLe in. the financnrig c r the 1972-74 portion of its expansion
progran. in the belief' that the prnscxic- of the Bank wculd ernhance its
ability to raise the furds in the mar:ct.i        -
6.07      Since t1e publication of the new law, LIGH,T has 1,*cr. actively
looking for lenders and, with the assist.nce of brascar. Lir:ited and the
pro.pect of Bank partic, pation, has been able t.o arrange financing .or the

APPRAISAL OF A POWER DISTRIBUTION AIM SUBTRANSMISSION PROJECT
LIGHT - SERVICOS DE ELETRICIDADE S.A.
ELrzCTRICI1Y TARIFFo IN BRAZIL
1.        Regulations governing tariffs are contained in the Wlater Code of
193h, subsequent am.endments and decrees dated February 26, 1957, and
November b, 196h, and Laws 5,073 enacted on August 18, 1966, and 5,655 of
May 20, 1971 (effective January 1, 1972).
2.        Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of the historic
value of investment, consequently not reflecting the substantial inflation
which occurred in Brazil. The 196lt decree allowed utilities to revalue
their investment in order to reflect changes in price levels; the 1966
legislation made annual revaluation of assets mandatory.
3.        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Department of .vater and Power of the Ministry of Mines ani Energy
every three years or at shorter intervals at the initiative of the utility.
Without advance approval of that Department, between tariff revisiors, the
utilities maRy add surcharges to current tariffs to cover compulsory
increases in iages, social benefits, costs of fuel and purchased power, and
increases in foreign debt sErvice due to changes in foreign exchange
rates.
4.        Tariff adjustments on accowut of revaluation of balance sheet
accounts are actually obtained by LIGiHT as often as the Governnent calculates
and publishes economic correction factors (coefficients) which reflect
variations in the price level.  The coefficients are issued annually about
one month after tne end of each year for the use of industry in general
as well as the electric utilities. The coefficients are applied by the
utilities to update the values of plant in service and work in progress,
depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, if any, and certain
local currency loans of ELETROBRAS and the National Levelopment Bank.
5.        Law 5,655 of May 20, 1971, introduced various changes in the
Brazilian tariff legislation which have an impact on the utilities'
finances, though not altering the legislation's basic philosophy.  To
show which changes have been made, the following explanation on the matter
of electricity tariffs is given by comparing the situation before and
after January 1, 1972, the date the new law came into force:

Tariffs should be set at levels
so as to provide for the following
items:
(i) Cost of operation, main-
tenance and administration   Applicable                Applicable
(ii) Depreciation                   Straight-line up to    Unchanged

assets in operation
for amortization or
up to 3% on the same
base for reversion.
1/  Income Tax - During the period 1972-1975, income is taxed at a rate
of 6%. Utilities are not permitted to include incame tax as an
expense in the tariff applications.
2/  Amortization or Ileversion - Up to January 1, 1972, e2ctzin utilities
had the choice of charging either "amortization" (this has no
connection with debt amortization) of up to 5% cf total fixed
assets in operation, or "reversion" of up to 3% on the same base.
The advantage of charging amortization was that the utilities
could keep the funds derived from such charges, whereas proceeds
from reversion had to be paid to the Government and could be
borrowed back by the electric utilities.
Starting January 1, 197?, "amortization" was abolished and hence-
forth reversior. must be  charged.   To strengthen ELETROBRAS'
financial influence in the Brazilian power sector, the company
has been charged with the responsibility of independently
administering the reversion fund on the Government's behalf. It
pays the Government interest at a rate of 3% for the fund, and
lends money out of the fund to power utilities at a rate of 10%.
At ILJfROBRAS' discretion, it can use up to 5% of thiq fund to
indemnify owners of land flooded by reservoirs.

The above-mentioned items normally are included in the power utilities'
tariff applications and, with the exception of reversion, after January 1,
1972, provide the funds for their operation and internal finances.  Also,
the consumers pay for three additional charges, which the utilities collect
and turn over to the Government. These charges are as follows:

(compulsory loan)             comrerical consLrers at a rate of 35% of the
electricity bill. This conpulsory loan will
be collected urtil 1963 with rates gradually
down from 35% in 1973 tc 10% in 1963.
1/ Remanerable i;ssets - The remunerable assets, on which the rate of
return under Brazilian legislation is calculated, consist of the
following:
Total fixed assets in operation at the end of the year
Add: Allowances for working capital
(i)  Cash at the end of the year up to a maximum  of the
depreciation reserve.
(ii)  Inv6ntories as approved by the tax authorities
(presently up to a maximum of 3% of gross fixed
assets in operation).
(iii) Receivables up to a maximum of two months' billing.
Deduct:
(i) Depreciation reserve at the end of the year.
(ii) Consumers' or other contributions.
(iii) Various small items specified by law.
2/  Enprestimo Compulsorio (Compulsory Loan) - Revenues from the compulsory
loan, for which customers receive 20-year obligations at 6% interest,
are administered by kLETROBRAb, which invests them in power utilities
etther in the form of shares or loans at 13% interest. Proceeds from this
loan will be allotted by hLTIiUlUb, '5O6 for the construction of hydro-
electric power plants in the Parana river basin; 15% for the construction
of nydroelectric power plants in the Sao Yrancisco river has_r; 1O,   t, ue

NOTES AND ASSUFPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS (1972-76)
1.        Operating revenues for 1972-76 have been obtained in accordance
with Brazilian tariff legislation (Annex 2).
2.        Operating expenses for 1972-76 including cobts of maintenance,
customer accounting, administrative and general expenses have been estimated
to increase at the rate of 8% per annum. Fuel cil is purchased from PETROBRAS.
A constant price of Cr$138 per ton has been used in these projections.
3.        All estimates are based on a constant rate of exchange of 6 cruzeiros
per US dollar. The foreign exchange loss which appears zn the income statement
in the years 1972 through 1976 stems from amortizing in those years the debt
acquired prior to 1972 an] which at the end of 1971 was revalued at the then
existing rate of 5.645 cruzeiros per US dollar.
4.        All assets. "reversion" funds and depreciation reserves, were
revalued during 1972 by applying the 1971 co-efficients published by the
Government for "monetary correction" purposes.
5.        Taxes paid by LIGHT and charged to income comprise principally
"reversion" which is calcula:er' substantially as a percentage of fixed assets
(Annex 2), a 6% corporate income tax, a 5% dividend distribution tax anu a ',
tax as applicable on certain increments of Directors' remuneration.
6.        Straight-line depreciation up to 5% for thermal installations and
up to 3% for hydro instaLlatiGns has been used. The composite aepreciation
rate cannot exceed 3% for rate-making purposes.  A composite rate of 3% has
been used in these projections.
7.        Based on past experience, interest has been charged to work-in-
progress at the rate of '.7% at the end of each year.  Also based on past
experience, the transfer of assets from work-in-progress to assets in
operation has been assumed at the rate of 57% of total annual capital
expend-tures, and retirements have been assumed at 2hX of the same base.
Accounts receivable have been projected at the equivalent of about
1.1 months sales; accounts payable have been obtained by increasing their
balaw.e each year in proportion to thr ircreasc in the yearis purchases; and
materials and supplies inventories have been estimate(! at _2  of plant in
servicc.
