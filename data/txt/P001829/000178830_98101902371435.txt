FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Amount:         SDR 3.4 million (US$4.0 million equivalent)
Terms:          Standard IDA
Colenders:      Kuwait Fund and Arab Fund for Economic and Social Develop-
ment
Project
Description:   The proposed project would complete and protect betterment
works carried out under the Third Highway Project, help
Government formulate a rational road maintenance policy,
and prepare a follow up project. It would consist of:
(a) a maintenance study, including a review of sector policy
and maintenance organization, road investment financing,
and construction materials;
(b) engineering studies for reinforcement and rehabilitation
of the Rosso-Akjoujt road (450 km) and for partial
improvement of the Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road (1,150 km);
(c) consultant services and contractors to carry out engineer-
ing, completion of earth works and construction of drainage
structures for the Boghe-Kaedi and Atar-Oued Seguelil
roads; and
(d) equipment, materials, supplies, and personnel training for
urgent maintenance works on the Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road.
The completion of the Third Highway Project's betterment works
would assure that the full benefits of this important invest-
ment are realized. The maintenance study would (i) develop a
road maintenance policy in accordance with the country's
present financial and institutional limitations; and (ii) lay
the groundwork for establishing a more effective maintenance
organization taking into account Government's recent decision
to employ contractors for periodic maintenance. The engineer-
ing studies would prepare for the badly needed rehabilitation
of the country's two major paved road axes. There is a risk
that, as in the past, this project would experience implementa-
tion delays and cost overruns. However, the program of better-
ment works (Boghe-Kaedi and Atar-Oued Seguelil) included under
the project is manageable as the risk of poor execution would
be reduced by the use of contractors.

Estimated Cost:   The total cost is estimated at US$14.3 million equivalent,
(net of tax)       of which about US$11.9 million (about 83 percent) would
be foreign exchange. The project would be exempt from
identifiable taxes and duties. A summary cost table is

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the equivalent
of SDR 3.4 million (US$4.0 million) to help finance the Fourth Highway
Project. The Credit would be on standard IDA terms. Additional financing
will be provided by the Kuwait Fund through a loan of US$5.1 million equiva-
lent with a term of 25 years including 5 years of grace and a service charge
of 0.5 percent. The Arab Fund and the Government would contribute US$5.2
million equivalent. The Arab Fund loan would be for a term of 20 years
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 0.4 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Islamic Republic of Mauritania:  Recent Economic
Developments and External Capital Requirements" (2479a-MAU) dated June 4,
1979, has been distributed to the Executive Directors. Since then, a number
of economic missions have visited Mauritania to monitor the current economic
and financial situation and prospects of the economy. Country Data appear in
Annex I.
The Land and its People
3.        Although not classified among the "Least Developed countries", given
its per capita GNP (US$320 in 1980), Mauritania indeed bears many of the
characteristics of those countries in terms of physical and human resources.
Most of the country is desert; agriculture, while supporting some 85 percent
of the population, is generally limited to the sub-Saharan zone in the south,
where rainfall is nonetheless sparse and irregular. Pockets of modern eco-
nomic activity, are found in the mining complex of Zouerate, the fishing
center of Nouadhibou and the administrative capital of Nouakchott.  These
pockets largely account for the income level referred to above (mining and
public administrative services alone account for 40 percent of total output).
-'       Yet only abut 10 percent of the country-s labor force is engaged in the modern
sector, and indeed the shortage of trained manpower poses a major constraint
on economic development. Moreover, these pockets of modern activiity are well
separated geographically from the agricultural zone, and there is little
economic interaction between the modern and traditional sectors.
4.        The extremely low standard of living of Mauritania's population
(est. 1.6 million in 1980) is reflected in key social indicators: life
expectancy at birth is estimated at 43 years, infant mortality is 169 per
1,000, less than 30 percent of the school age children attend primary school
and only 17 percent of the population is literate in either Arabic or French.



- 2 -
Economic Developments and Medium-Term Outlook
5.        In contrast to its record of relative stability and strong growth
of 8 percent a year in the 1960's, the Mauritanian economy experienced a
sharp deceleration in growth in the mid-1970s and a period of marked finan-
cial instability in the latter part of the decade. Over the past four years,
(1978-81), economic growth is estimated to have averaged only 1.2 percent a
year, one and a half percentage points below the rate of growth in population.
6.        The country's weak economic situation persists despite an extra-
ordinary inflow of foreign grants and loans averaging more than US$100 per
capita a year since 1973, largely from OPEC countries. Factors primarily
responsible are reduced world demand for iron ore, on which Mauritania has
traditionally been dependent for 70-80 percent of its export earnings, and
severe and repeated drought in the agricultural sector. The effects of these
factors were compounded in the 1970's by the prolonged military conflict in
the Western Sahara and by a poorly conceived investment policy centered on
transport infrastructure and a few large industrial ventures. The con-
sequences for the country were reflected in budgetary deficits averaging some
US$90 million a year 1976-79, and, on overall external account, a serious
drain on the country's net foreign reserves (US$36 million in 1975 and US$43
million in 1977).
7.        In mid-1978, the economic and financial situation led the Govern-
ment, with the assistance of the Bank, to prepare a Rehabilitation Plan which
proposed as immediate priority the renegotiation of external debt totalling
US$215 million, more than 40 percent of the disbursed debt outstanding at
the time. The Plan also called for strict conditions on the Government's
future borrowing, tight control of public expenditure and major revisions in
public investment priorities.
8.        Since mid-1978, the financial situation of the country has improved
through Government adherence to measures recommended under the Plan and a
subsequent IMF Stand-By Arrangement, this coupled with both debt relief and
fresh concessional foreign assistance on a substantial scale. As a result,
the earlier drain on the country's foreign reserves has been curtailed and, as
of 1981, the budgetary deficit (after debt service) had been reduced from its
1977-78 level by some 35 percent. The Government's financial situation,
nonetheless, remains strained although budgetary aid from abroad is presently
less than half that of 1978, the situation calls for continued reliance on
concessional assistance from abroad, including full local cost financing, as
well as demanding the Government's perseverance in exercising prudent economic
and financial management.
9.        The economy should be significantly strengthened towards the mid-
1980's as a result of expanded iron ore production. Although virtually
no improvement in international prices in real terms is expected before
1985, the volume of Mauritania's exports is projected to have climbed by that



time to a level 55 percent above that of the past three years, assuming full
utilization of mine capacity. Beyond 1985, production capacity would level
out as the presently mined Kedia deposits approach depletion and their
production is replaced by the Guelbs operation (Phases I and II).
10.       Iron mining would remain the principal source of growth--indeed
an important stimulus to the economy--through the first half of the 1980's.
During this period overall growth could average as much as 4 percent a year,
assuming the expansion of iron ore production cited above (para. 9 ). The
agricultural sector can be expected to expand at somewhat below that rate,
however, due in general to the long gestation period of projects in that
sector and in particular to the limited pace at which irrigation can
realistically be achieved in Mauritania.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITANIA
11.       The Bank Group has had 17 operations in Mauritania for a total
of US$216.2 million. Of these, two are Bank loans for mining operations:
US$66 million for MIFERMA in 1960, and US$60 million to SNIM in 1979 (Guelbs
Project). Thirteen others are IDA credits totalling US$70.2 million. Of
the IDA operations, four are in the transport sector, five are in the rural
sector, and the others are for education, technical assistance to the Ministry
of Economy and Finance, the urban and rural development fund and energy. In
1968, IFC made a loan to and an equity investment in SOMIMA, the copper mining
company, which totalled US$20 million; this IFC participation and the accom-
panying loan were paid back when the Government nationalized SOMIMA in 1974.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
January 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Implementation of Bank Group projects has often been retarded by
administrative inefficiency within the Government. Moreover, large distances,
lack of basic infrastructure, the small number of contractors operating in the
country, and the need to recruit a high proportion of expatriates to implement
works and to staff projects have contributed to high project costs. These
factors, aggravated by the exceptional situation prevailing in Mauritania
during the 1970s (para. 6), high inflation, and unfavorable exchange rates,
have led to cost overruns on many projects. In addition, the country's
difficult financial situation has forced the Government drastically to curtail
expenditures, including local funds for its ongoing development program. This
has called for a reduction in the scope of some of these projects. For
example, during execution of the Third Highway Project (Credit No. 519 MAU),
IDA and the Kuwait Fund, the co-financier, agreed to scale down the project
to enable 100 percent coverage of the remaining foreign and local costs.
However, disbursements of IDA funds in general remained extremely slow.
Therefore, the Association increased the number of supervision missions
to assist in improving project implementation in general and in processing
withdrawal applications, in particular. The direct payment method was also
used whenever possible and expatriate experts were provided to assist in
managing project accounts. Recently, some progress has been noted.



13.       The Mauritanian authorities are acutely aware of the difficulties
encountered in project execution, some of which, related to geography or to
the early stage of the country's development, will persist for years to come.
IDA's two technical assistance projects to the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(formerly Planning) and to SONADER are important elements of the Government's
efforts to tackle the problem. By strengthening Government's project prepara-
tion capacity and by providing for more systematic monitoring of execution,
these projects are helping Government invest in operations better adapted to
the country's conditions. The proposed Fourth Highway Project as well as the
recently approved Second Education project would also identify ways in which
the sector's administration can be improved and bottlenecks in project execu-
tion eliminated.
14.       In 1970-72, the Bank Group was the third largest donor (providing
about 18 percent of Mauritania's external capital assistance) behind France
(21 percent) and the EEC (19 percent). With the rapid growth in external
financial assistance extended to Mauritania, the Bank Group's share decreased
to about 6 percent in 1977. Bank Group strategy now emphasizes: (a) dialogue
with the Government on financial and economic matters in cooperation with the
IMF and other financial institutions; (b) technical assistance to improve
economic management and to increase absorptive capacity; and (c) intervention
in a few high-priority development projects particularly for the mobilization
and coordination of large amounts of external aid from traditional donors and
Arab OPEC countries. Thus the Bank Group has appraised a follow-up technical
assistance project to the Ministry of Economy and Finance and a separate
technical assistance project to the rural sector. Further Bank Group involve-
ment is also envisaged in the livestock, irrigation, and energy sectors.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
15.       The transport system in Mauritania consists principally of three
regional networks which are not yet well integrated. They are built around
the mining and fishing centers in the North, the capital city of Nouakchott on
the west coast, and the agricultural region of the South. The northern system
comprises a deep water port at Nouadhibou, a 675-km railroad for the evacua-
tion of iron ore, and regional airports. The capital city has a wharf, an
international airport, plus three paved roads leading towards the North, South
and East. The southern network includes earth roads, river transport and
local airports serving the Senegal River Valley, the most agriculturally
productive area of the country. A fourth network is gradually emerging around
Nema, the capital of the livestock production region, with the construction of
Nouakchott-Nema road and an international airport.
Roads
16.       The road sector is characterized by very high construction and
maintenance costs due to vast distances, lack of good materials, difficult
topography and climate, and a shortage of skilled manpower. Moreover, the
road network is subject to flash floods during the rainy season and sandstorms



- 5 -
during the dry season, which accelerate deterioration and increase maintenance
costs. The road network consists of about 7,800 km of which 1,500 km are
paved, 600 km are improved earth roads, and 5,700 km are unimproved tracks.
The network includes four principal axes: (i) a north-south axis stretching
1,850 km from Rosso on the Senegal River to Atar and the Algerian border in
the north, 459 km of which are paved; (ii) two east-west axes, one totally
unpaved in the south from Rosso to Nema, and one in the center, from Nouakchott
to Nema, 1,041 km of which (Nouakchott-Kiffa-Timbedera) is paved; and (iii) a
central unpaved axis linking Boghe (on the Senegal River), with Aleg and
Tidjikja (see map). Traffic volumes on the main north south road are esti-
mated to be 300 vpd to the north of Nouakchott and 100 vpd to the south.
Other roads carry moderate traffic which cannot be reliably estimated.
Traffic statistics would be updated through studies financed under the project.
17.       At present, freight is moved by a few small trucking companies
and by owner-drivers organized into a cooperative. Passenger transport is
provided by private inter-city taxis and mixed passenger/freight vehicles.
The Ministry of Equipment and Transport (MET) sets maximum tariffs, but there
do not appear to be other effective restrictions on private competition.
Public passenger transport is expected to be provided by a public enterprise
that went bankrupt in 1978, but is now being rehabilitated.
Development Policy
18.       Government's transport policy since independence has centered on
two main objectives: (i) to serve centers of economic activity; and (ii) to
unify and develop Mauritania as a cohesive nation. In line with this policy,
the Bank Group financed the construction and extension of a railroad for the
evacuation of iron ore; developed the commercial port of Nouadhibou; and
financed the construction of the Nouakchott-Rosso road, the main link between
the capital city and the country's important agricultural region. It promoted
rehabilitation of gravel roads in the various parts of the country (Atar-Choum
and Boghe-Kaedi). It also indirectly contributed to the construction of the
Akjoujt-Nouakchott road for the evacuation of copper, through IFC involvement
in SOMIMA, the copper mining society. The Bank Group felt that the relatively
poor state of infrastructure at independence justified these investments in
the sector. However, in the mid-70's, a disagreement arose between the Bank
and the government on the construction of the east-west Highway. To link the
extreme east with the west, the Bank advocated gradual improvement of a road
over the southern route, a longer distance to Nema, the capital of the eastern
region, than the central alignment, but closer to the agriculturally produc-
tive and densely populated Senegal Valley. The government preferred the more
direct central alignment, which in its mind would better serve the needs of
pockets of population scattered throughout the central region, more drama-
tically improve the connection between the capital city and the isolated
extreme east and therefore, strengthen political unity within the country.
A number of external donors, including the Kuwait Fund (KF), the Saudi Fund
(SF), and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AF), supported
the Government's point of view and offered to finance construction of the
Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road and to contribute toward the cost of its future
maintenance. On that basis but without the Associations financing, the
government decided to go ahead with the construction. With the recent



- 6 -
deterioration in the public finance situation, however, the government
has to recognize that it needs to plan more carefully the future investments
in this sector, taking into account its technical and financial capacity for
maintenance and its economic potential. The government agreed, therefore, to
provide the Association with the draft Five Year Development Plan for com-
ments, and would exchange views with the Association on the investment alloca-
tions for the road sector (Section 3.06 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). In addition, during the proposed project's implementation period,
for any road construction investment exceeding an aggregate amount of two
million dollars equivalent, the government gave assurances that it would (a)
carry out a study to evaluate the economic priority of such project, and (b)
give the Association a reasonable opportunity to comment on such study (Sec-
tion 4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Road Maintenance
19.       Bank Group involvement in highway maintenance started with a
maintenance study financed under the First Highway Project (Cr. 69-MAU).
Under the Second Highway Project (Cr. 159-MAU, FY69), the Equipment Division
of the Directorate of Public Works was reorganized, and new procedures were
introduced. Four brigades for road maintenance and improvement were also
established. The brigades carried out maintenance and improvement of
unpaved roads as well routine maintenance of paved roads. Office buildings,
including a training center and a central workshop complex, were constructed
and outfitted. New maintenance equipment was purchased. By project comple-
tion 80 percent (400 km) of the road improvement as well as 60 percent
(1,800 km) of the annual routine maintenance targets had been achieved.
Training for senior level personnel was successful, but only about 40 per-
cent of junior personnel were trained. In addition to insufficient training,
the Project Performance Audit Report of February 2, 1978 1/ identified two
other factors as hampering project objectives: (i) establishment of too many
brigades at once to carry out operations when there were shortages of quali-
fied personnel and local funds; and (ii) diversion of project equipment to
unscheduled activities.
20.       Under the Third Highway Project (Cr. 519-MAU, FY75), which inter
alia included 365 km of betterment works, the Government and the Associa-
tion sought to address some of these issues. The project concentrated on
strengthening two maintenance brigades, which required fewer managers and
trained personnel; a bilingual training expert was recruited and materials
for teaching provided; and additional maintenance equipment was financed.
Unfortunately, a number of unforseeable political and economic difficulties
hindered achievement of project objectives. War, successive droughts,
accelerated Mauritanization of the civil service without regard to qualifica-
tion, paralysis of economic activity and a rapid deterioration of public
finance, all adversely affected project implementation. As the military
situation deteriorated, equipment, fuel as well as personnel were diverted to
1/   Based on PCR, July 5, 1977.



- 7 -
the war effort, and training was impeded due to lack of trainees. Ultimately,
fear of Polisario attacks decreased the capacity of the maintenance brigade in
the north. Force account work of the magnitude envisioned at appraisal proved
beyond the capacity of the Government to implement under these circumstances,
and delays in project execution led to a substantial cost overrun.
21.       In 1979 the Credit Agreement was amended to reduce the scope of the
project from 365 to 215 km of road improvements. To alleviate the pressure on
the already constrained Government budget, IDA and KF (the cofinancer, and one
of the major contributors to Mauritania's road sector) agreed to finance 100
percent of project costs. At the same time, the Government made efforts to
improve management, namely by: (i) appointing a Mauritanian project manager to
work exclusively on the project; (ii) providing the new management unit with
an accountant; and (iii) establishing, by presidential decree, a simplified
procurement system wherein contracts were reviewed by a small committee
consisting of the president of the Tender Board and representatives of the
Ministries of Equipment, and Economy and Finance, and were approved and signed
on behalf of the Government by the Minister of Economy and Finance. In spite
of these efforts, due to the persistence of problems outlined in para. 20,
project accomplishments were limited. Although earth works were implemented
on 215 km, no drainage structures were provided due to delays and lack of
funds. Work on these road sections, which are now being damaged by flash
flooding in the rainy season and face certain destruction if they remain
unprotected, would be completed under the proposed project.
22.       Implementation and maintenance problems encountered during and after
construction of the first sections of the Nouakchott-Nema road, convinced the
Mauritanian government and the external donors financing the project of the
need to reconsider their approach to the road sector. The first Nouakchott-
Boutilimit section began to crack soon after completion due to poorly chosen
construction materials and poor execution. The Boutilimit-Aleg section needs
resealing since the double bituminous surface treatment began to deteriorate
soon after construction. Cracks also appeared on the Aleg-Kiffa section and
shoulders started to disintegrate. Sections of the Kiffa-Timbedera road, where
work began in late 1979, were washed out by heavy rains in 1980. This series
of failures provided further evidence to the Mauritanian Government, and
persuaded external donors, that absolute priority was to be given to improving
the country's institutional and financial capacity for implementing works and
maintaining the country's priority roads. The Government has since begun to
take steps to remedy the situation (para. 24). Moreover, the proposed Fourth
Highway Project would study the priority road network to be maintained, would
determine the level of investment compatible with resource availability, and
identify appropriate construction materials and techniques adapted to the
local environment.
Organization
23.       The Directorate of Infrastructure (DI) of the Ministry of Equipment,
Transport, and Telecommunications (MET) was in principle in charge of planning,
construction and maintenance of the road network, airports, ports, and water-
ways. DI included a Service of Public Works (SPW), in charge of roads and
airports, and a Service of Ports and Railways. SPW included a Division of



- 8 -
Ronds and Airports (DRA), a Division of Equipment, and thirteen Regional
subdivisions corresponding to the twelve administrative regions plus
Nouakchott. Aside from poorly trained personnel, this organizational
structure did not encourage proper road maintenance or development. The
institutions lacked adequate focus and attempted to perform too many tasks
for their limited resources. For example DRA duplicated the work of a
regional aviation agency on airports, and did not devote adequate attention to
road and equipment maintenance, or to the control of road works carried out by
contractors.
24.       In preparation for the proposed Fourth Highway project, the Govern-
ment has made an important decision to utilize private contractors rather than
force account to execute all periodic maintenance and improvement works. It
also carried out a review of road maintenance administration in February 1980.
After discussion with the Association, it was concluded that preceding the
establishment of a more permanent improved road maintenance structure, to be
determined by further studies included under the proposed project (para. 28),
two units should be created to help improve maintenance efficiency: (i) a
central unit with clear authority to plan road investments and effectively
control the execution of works carried out by contractors, and (ii) a road
maintenance and equipment unit to administer routine road maintenance opera-
tions carried out by regional subdivisions and small force account brigades.
These units were established by decree dated February 5, 1982 which reor-
ganized the Ministry (now named the Ministry of Equipment, Transport and
Telecommunications (METT)). Under this reorganization DI has become the
Public Works Department (PWD). The Government has agreed to maintain these
units (Section 4.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement) as well as
simple procurement procedures used under the Third Highway Project.
Finance
25.       The present size of the Mauritanian road network already exceeds
the capacity of the maintenance system. The Government has regularly in-
creased its road maintenance budget from US$0.5 million equivalent in 1969
to about US$2.2 million equivalent in 1979. However, it was estimated by
consultants in 1976 that the Government would need to spend about US$20
million p.a., or about 10 percent of its budget, to maintain its entire road
network to an optimum standard following completion of the Nouakchott-Nema
road. While this estimate remains to be verified and updated, it is clear
that provision of an adequate maintenance budget would be a major drain on
available domestic resources. The maintenance study to be carried out under
the project would enable the Government and foreign donors to jointly deter-
mine an economically viable maintenance program to be implemented on the basis
of a realistic assessment of available domestic and foreign resources. The
Government provided assurances during negotiations that, pending review of the
maintenance study, the Government would provide the resources required for an
efficient operation of the new road planning and road maintenance units (para.
24) and for maintenance of the roads to be improved under the project (Section
4.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The proposed project was identified in Autumn 1979 through a
series of discussions with the Mauritanian Government and the Kuwait Fund,
in their respective countries and in Washington. The project was prepared
and appraised during a mission to Mauritania in January 1980. Coordination
meetings were held in Kuwait in February 1981 and in Washington, D.C.
December 1982, with the participation of representatives from the Mauritanian
Government, KF, AF, and IDA. Negotiations were held in Washington on
December 15, 1981 following final agreement on the project scope and condi-
tions. The Mauritanian delegation was led by Mr. M'Rabih Rabou Ould Cheikh
Bouneina, Director of Projects of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Project Objectives and Description
27.       The objectives of the proposed Fourth Highway Project are:
(i) to assist the Government in formulating a maintenance policy which takes
into account its financial and institutional limitations; (ii) to prepare a
follow-up project, which would contribute to maintenance of paved and
engineered earth roads; and (iii) to complete and protect betterment works
carried out under the Third Highway Project. The project would include the
following elements:
(a) road maintenance studies including: definition of the network to be
maintained, maintenance operations, methods, and organization,
research of suitable maintenance materials, staff training, financ-
ing, and proposals for broader maintenance and investment priorities
in the medium term;
(b) studies for rehabilitation and reinforcement of the Nouakchott-
Rosso (203 km) and Nouakchott-Akjoujt (256 km) paved roads;
(c) completion of works started under the Third Highway Project
including: (i) detailed engineering and preparation of bidding
documents for the completion of earthworks and construction of
drainage structures and studies of bridges on the Boghe-Kaedi
(100 km) and Atar-Oued Seguelil (45 km) roads improved under that
project; and (ii) completion of earth works and construction of the
drainage structures themselves and their approaches, excluding
bridges; and
(d) studies for reinforcement of the recently paved Nouakchott-Kiffa-
Nema road (1,150 km), and the execution of urgent maintenance works
on this road.
28.       Road Maintenance Studies.  The main purpose of these studies would
be to assist the Government's efforts to improve its sectoral administrative
services. In addition to determining a critical road network to be main-
tained, the studies would propose a streamlined and more appropriate regional
road maintenance organization than that which exists. They would also help
Mauritania determine the needs of this organization in terms of personnel,



- 10 -
training and institutions, in light of the country's high illiteracy rate and
its dual ethnic and linguistic system. Because Mauritania's sandy, saline,
and clay soils provide poor road building materials, the maintenance studies
would also investigate material resources. Appropriate techniques for increas-
ing efficiency of maintenance operations would also be explored. Terms of
reference for the studies have been discussed and agreed upon by KF, IDA and
the government.
29.       Studies for Rehabilitation and Reinforcement of Nouakchott-Rosso
and Nouakchott-Akjoujt Paved Roads. These two lane paved roads, constructed
respectively in 1970 and 1971, constitute the most important links of the
major south-north road (from Rosso on the banks of the Senegal River in the
south, via Nouakchott, Akjoujt, Atar, to the Algerian border in the north) and
are the most heavily trafficked in the country. As a consequence of poor
maintenance, some sections of the Nouakchott-Akjoujt road require rehabilita-
tion and/or reinforcement, while most of the Nouakchott-Rosso road requires
reinforcement. The project would include a feasibility study to determine an
economically justifiable level of improvement on these roads, followed by
final engineering and bidding documents for the improvement works. Terms of
reference for the studies were discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.
30.       Completion of Earthworks and Drainage Structures.  Most of the
betterment works carried out on the 215 km of the Third Highway Project are
facing destruction by flash flooding during the rainy season because funds
ran out under the project before the appropriate drainage structures could be
built, and because earthwork and wearing courses on the Atar-Oued Sequelil
road were not properly executed. The Boghe-Kaedi road in the Senegal River
valley, where most drainage structures are needed and two bridges may be
required, is pdrticulariy vulnerable.  To a lesser extent, the Atar-Oued
Seguelil road in the North is also vulnerable to flooding. Consultants
prepared a standard design for drainage structures under the Third Highway
Project. Engineering and bidding documents for the drainage structures and
necessary earthworks would be prepared under the proposed project. The
proposed project would provide for the construction of these works on the
Boghe-Kaedi and Atar-Oued Seguelil roads. The project would also provide for
an engineering study for the construction of two bridges on the Boghe-Kaedi
road where, presently, bypasses permitting through-traffic exist. The terms
of reference for the studies of the Atar-Oued Seguelil road were discussed and
agreed upon at negotiations.
31.       Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema Road.  The first two sections of this road
(Nouakchott-Kiffa (600 km) and Kiffa-Timbedera (441 km)), completed in 1978
and 1981 respectively) are already breaking up. The proposed project would
provide for feasibility studies to determine an economic level of further
improvement on this road, followed by engineering and bidding documents for
the improvement works which the KF has agreed in principle to finance. The
project would also provide for equipment, operating costs and personnel
training to carry out urgent maintenance operations on the road for two
years. Terms of reference for the studies were drafted in consultation with
KF and IDA.

Project Cost and Financing
32.       Total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at
US$14.3 million equivalent, with local costs of US$2.4 million (17 percent)
and foreign costs of US$11.9 million equivalent (83 percent). The Govern-
ment has agreed to exempt the project from taxes and duties which are esti-
mated at US$2.8 million equivalent (detailed cost estimates are in Annex
IV). IDA would provide a credit of SDR 3.4 million (US$4.0 million equi-
valent), which would finance the preinvestment studies of the Nouakchott-Rosso
(203 km) and Nouakchott-Akjoujt (256 km) roads, as well as engineering
and supervision, and civil works on the Atar-Oued-Seguelil road. KF would
provide a credit of US$5.1 million which would finance the preinvestment
studies of the Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema road (1,150 km) and its maintenance
including equipment and, operating costs for two years together with spare
parts and training. AF and the Government would provide US$5.2 million
which would finance engineering studies, supervision and civil works on the
Boghe-Kaedi road. The balance of the AF loan, after financing the Boghe-Kaedi
road component would be used to finance recurrent maintenance costs of the
Nouakchott-Nema road.
Implementation
33.       The Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Telecommunication, through
its Public Works Department, will be responsible for the implementation of the
project. PWD would be assisted by consultants in planning and executing the
engineering studies, and in supervising the construction works executed by
contractors. The project would take about four years to complete. The
preparation of engineering and bidding documents for drainage structures
would be completed within six months, starting from the date of credit effec-
tiveness. Road rehabilitation and reinforcement studies would take about a
year and a half to complete. Construction works should be executed within
about 18 months of the award of contract. Within the framework of the road
maintenance studies, IDA would assist the Government in determining the level
of budgetary resources it should allocate to road maintenance. Preinvestment
studies, under items (b) and (d) of the project description (para. 27),
would be carried out in two phases. Feasibility studies would first determine
the technical and economic level of improvements to be undertaken and the
financing needed for the execution of these improvement works. This phase
would be followed by final engineering and bidding documents for those fea-
sible improvements assured of financing. To ensure a coherent policy in the
sector, a letter of understanding would be signed by KF, AF, and IDA providing
for close consultation between these institutions. During negotiations, the
Government has given assurance that it would seek IDA's comments on all other
studies included in the project.
Procurement
34.       Consultants for the studies of the Nouakchott-Rosso and Nouakchott-
Akjoujt roads, and for improvement on the Atar-Oued Seguelil road would be
selected on the basis of experience and capability, and according to terms



- 12 -
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Procurement of equipment and selection
of consultants for the preinvestment studies of the Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema
road would follow KF procedures. Consultants and contractors for engineering
studies and civil works of the Boghe-Kaedi road would be selected according to
AF procedures. The Government has agreed that it would retain the consultants
selected for the studies of structures, to assist PWD in supervising the
execution of the construction of drainage structures and their approaches on
the Atar-Oued Seguelil road. This arrangement would allow rapid execution
of the urgent works. The works on the Atar-Oued Seguelil road would be let
on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to IDA
(Schedule 3A of draft Development Credit Agreement). Qualified local con-
tractors (foreign and domestic) are available. A contract to be executed
in two consecutive phases (feasibility and final engineering) would be pre-
pared between the Government and consultants for preinvestment studies of the
Nouakchott-Rosso, Nouakchott-Akjoujt and Nouakchott-Kiffa-Nema roads. The
second phase will be notified to consultants only after an agreement has been
reached between the Government, KF and IDA on the level of improvements to be
carried out. A contract to be executed in two phases will also be established
between the Government and consultants for the improvement of the Atar-Oued
Seguelil road: the engineering and preparation of bidding documents phase and
the supervision of works phase. The latter would be notified to consultants
only after an agreement has been reached between the Government and IDA on
these works.
Disbursements
35.       The proposed IDA Credit of US$4.0 million would be disbursed (Dis-
bursement table, AnnexIV) on the following basis: (a) 100 percent of the cost
of consultant services for engineering studies for the Nouakchott-Kosso and
Nouakchott-Akjoujt roads; and for engineering and supervision of construction
of betterment works on the Atar-Oued Seguelil roads; and (b) 100 percent of
total construction expenditures, net of taxes and duties, for execution of
works on the Atar-Oued Seguelil roads. All disbursements would be fully
documented.
Economic Justification
36.       Studies.  The project includes a substantial studies component
to help improve the overall planning and organization of highway maintenance
in Mauritania, as well as to determine the most economical method for the
reinforcement of the country's main north-south paved road (Nouakchott-Rosso
and Nouakchott-Akjoujt). Their eventual rehabilitation and reinforcement is
expected to be justified because these roads were constructed 8-10 years ago
and not properly maintained thereafter, and because of the relatively high
level of traffic which they carry (300 and 100 vpd respectively in 1978).
37.       Nouakchott-Nema road.  Emergency maintenance works on paved sections
of the road are essential to prevent its rapid deterioration. The justifica-
tion of further reinforcement will depend on the extent of works required and
expected traffic levels. The proposed project finances only the feasibility
study and final engineering of these reinforcement works.



- 13 -
38.       Completion of earthworks and drainage structures.  The completion of
earthworks and drainage structures on the Boghe-Kaedi and Atar-Oued Seguelil
roads would complete the improvement works begun under the Third Highway
Project and assure that these roads are usable and that the benefits envisaged
at appraisal are fully realized. The investment will insure that the roads
last their full economic life. In addition construction would be carried out
only after engineering work has determined the least cost solution to the
works. These two roads play an important economic role:
(a) The Atar-Oued Seguelil road forms part of the only land link
(via road/rail) between the capital city of Nouakchott on the one hand, and
Nouadhibou (Mauritania's second largest city) and Zouerate whose iron ore
mines account for 20 percent of GDP on the other. The road carried 40 vpd in
1972 and traffic does not appear to have grown since then based on available
information. The cost of finishing the earthworks and wearing courses and
providing drainage structures needed to complete the road is less than of the
cost of complete reconstruction, and is expected to extend the life of the
wearing course of the road from two to about ten years, and that of the road
substructures until upgrading is required.
(b) The Boghe-Kaedi road serves part of the Senegal River Valley,
the most agriculturally productive area in Mauritania. Several agricultural
development projects are planned or underway in the immediate vicinity of
this road. The road carried 48 vpd in 1981, of which 52% were heavy vehi-
clcs. The benefits of completing the road consist of extending the life of
the wearing course from two to about eight years and that of the substructure
until upgrading is required. Completion of the road, however, does not
include construction of two major bridges, the cost of which is not known.
The project provides only for engineering studies of these bridges. The
completed road will nevertheless permit through-traffic between Boghe and
Kaedi since dry-land detours are possible away from the bridge sites during
the rainy season (3 months).
Risks
39.       In view of the Mauritanian Government's poor performance in imple-
menting earlier highway maintenance projects, there is a risk that this
project will also experience undue delays in execution and subsequent cost
overruns. However, safeguards have been incorporated into the project
to limit this risk. The betterment program has been kept manageable,
and contractors will be utilized to carry it out instead of public works
brigades. In addition, civil works contracts will be awarded under stream-
lined procurement procedures.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Mauritania and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special features of the draft Development Credit Agreement are referred to
in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III. Additional conditions of
effectiveness would be cross effectiveness of the IDA Credit with the KF and
AF loans (Section 6.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C. Status of Projects in Execution
As of January 31, 1982 1/
Credit No. 459 MAU        Education Project:  US$3.8 million; Credit Agreement:
February 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Project implementation was delayed in 1975/76 because of weak project
management and the need to review the cost and content of the project in face
of higher than anticipated price escalation. Since alternative financing was
not available, the scope of the project was reduced with approval of the Execu-
tive Directors. The project now provides for: (a) a vocational training center
in Nouakchott; (b) a mining training program in Nouadhibou; (c) training pro-
grams for farmers on irrigated perimeters; (d) an experimental study of intro-
ducing reading, writing and arithmetic in the Koranic school system; and
(e) technical assistance for the Directorate of Planning. Project management
has improved and project implementation is progressing satisfactorily.
Construction of the vocational training center has been completed, and the
courses started in March i'81. The farmer training component has been revised
to integrate it with Government irrigation projects. The Koranic school
experiment is nearly completed, but the results are inconclusive and the
Government intends to review some key issues that have been raised by the
experiment. The mining training and planning department components were
completed with alternative financing. The project is expected to be completed
by the middle of 1983.
Credit No. 665 MAU        Technical Assistance Project:  US$2.7 million;
Credit Agreement: December 9, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
The aim of the project is to strengthen the Ministry of Planning
to enable it to exercise its responsibility as a central agency to inte-
grate overall plan and policy formulation with the preparation and financing
of sectoral programs and their related projects. The project provides a
four-year program to finance: (a) five professionals for the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (formerly Planning) to elaborate long-term general and
sectoral strategies, set priorities, identify projects, undertake econo-
mic and financial analysis, and train Mauritanian counterparts to take over
their tasks; and (b) temporary consultants to deal with special subjects
when needed. The project substantially completed, a new team leader was
recruited and is in the field since October 1981. The contracts of agricul-
tural and industrial advisers have been extended until the end of the project.
The construction of the offices for the experts has been completed. The team
is assisting Government to complete the drafting of the Five-Year Plan.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 888 MAU        Urban and Rural Development Project:  US$8.0
million; Credit Agreement: April 11, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project includes three separate components to provide financial
and technical assistance to: (i) the industrial sector for development of
small- and medium-scale enterprises promising substantially lower investment
costs per job than currently; (ii) the artisan sector for rehabilitating and
expanding the production of knotted carpets by decentralizing production and
improving training of weavers; and (iii) the agricultural sector for develop-
ment of 30 new irrigated schemes under village cooperatives, including an
adequate credit scheme. The project also provides consulting services to
study the feasibility of establishing a gypsum plaster brick industry to
replace expensive imported cement with locally-made bricks, and of creating a
new industrial zone in the capital city of Nouakchott. The study of the
plaster brick industry, and that of the industrial zone are completed. The
strengthening of the Industrial Development Bank for which technical assistance
is provided is progressing satisfactorily, and five projects eligible for
financing under the IDA line of credit have been approved. The artisan
component, which until recently, had been encountering considerable difficul-
ties, is now making good progress. Production, though still at a low level,
is picking up, and several decentralized units are being set up. The agency's
financial position however continues to remain weak, but a plan for consolida-
tion is under utbideration.  The agricultural component is progressing
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1747 MAU         Guelbs Iron Ore Mining Project:  US$60 million
Loan Agreement: December 14, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
This project consists of opening new mines and constructing bene-
ficiation facilities in order to replace the declining production of the
iron ore deposits currently being exploited in Mauritania in the Zouerate
area which will be depleted by 1991. The project will be implemented in
two phases. The first phase will produce 6 million tpy starting in 1984,
followed 6 years later by the second phase which will bring into production
another 6 million tpy. The Bank Loan of US$60 million is to help finance the
first phase, the total cost of which is about US$500 million. The main
project components are the supplying of mining equipment and railroad rolling
stock, the construction of the beneficiation plant and its ancillary facili-
ties, the extension of the port facilities, and the required engineer-
ing, project management and training. The Bank Loan became effective on
December 31, 1980. Project implementation is delayed because of weak manage-
ment. A co-lenders meeting was organized at the end of 1981 which discussed
ways of strengthening the management and improving project implementation.

Credit No. 1068 MAU       Gorgol Irrigation Project: SDR 11.4 million (US$15
million); Credit Agreement: November 21, 1980;
Closing Date: March 31, 1987
The project consists of: (1) construction of a regulating dam,
conveyance works, irrigation and drainage networks covering a gross area
of about 4,200 ha; (2) construction of roads, of buildings, and of social
infrastructure for 15 new villages; (3) purchase of agricultural transport
equipment and vehicles; (4) provision for initial operation and mainte-
nance of the above facilities and for the settlement of about 4,640 farm
families in the development area; and (5) provision, on credit, of services
and farm inputs to such families. The project is 100% financed by IDA and
eight other colenders. The IDA credit was declared effective on November 22,
1981 and disbursements started soon after. Execution of works is progressing
satisfactorily. Some difficulties, however, have arisen regarding the
local cost financing by the Islamic Development Bank. However, this issue
is expected to be solved by a slight rearrangement of the financing plan.
