SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1584-BT)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the second IBRD-
financed Urban Development Project in Botswana, for which Loan 1584-BT was
approved on May 30, 1978 in the amount of  JS$8.0 million.   The original
Closing Date of the loan, December 31, 1982, was postponed twice to the final
closing date of June 30, 1985. Effective January 20, 1986, the date of the
last disbursement, the loan account was closed, and the undisbursed balance
of US$563,798 was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared on the basis of documents contained in the
regional files, information provided by staff members involved with the
project during its execution, and a field visit to Botswana in MaylJune 1988.
The valuable assistance provided by staff of the Ministry of Local Government
and Lands, the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the Francistown Town Council
and Selebi Phikwe Town Council during the preparation of this report is
gratefully acknowledged.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Attachment).

BOTSWANA
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1584-BT)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
i.       The primary objective of the Second Urban Development Project in
Botswana was to strengthen the institutional arrangements for delivering low-
cost housing. The project was designed to build on the initiatives introdluced
under the first urban project in Francistown (Credit 471-BT, PCR dated
February 25, 1983).  The proje t has sucessfully accoaplished its primary
objective.    It gave  renewed stimulus not only to developing tenurial
instruments for home ownership and to the idea of mortgage financing,
relatively new concepts in Botswana, but also to providing adequate technical
support for the necessary institution building.
ii.      The project also sought to consolidate important financial policy
initiatives introduced under Credit 471-BT, namely, cost recovery of all
allocable investment through direct charges to beneficiaries.  The project
has made great strides in institutionalizing the concept and securAing off.cial
support for, and commitment to, its implementation. The project has led to
the revision of major legislation which was found to be inhibiting the
p r;i:,ures required to achieve cost recovery.  However, achievement of full
co,i recovery for urban infrastructure, the benefits of which are often
perceived to be indirect, can only be considered as a long-term objective
given the historical and traditional context of non-payment for government
services by the low-income groups in Botswana, and given the uneven political
support this objective has received throughout the life of the project.
iii.     All major physical works were implemented as scheduled, but delays
were experienced with the software-intensive components of the project,
particularly plot demarcation and al'.ocation in the upgrading areas.
Approximately 10,000 new and improved housing units, including sanitary
facilities, were added to Botswana's urban housing stock at costs affordable
to the majority of low- and middle-income households (although the unit costs
could have been further reduced if traditional materials and building
techniques had been rigorously promoted as had been expected at the time of
appraisal); necessary community services were provided to serve the new
developments as well as the upgraded areas. Plot boundary demarcation in the
upgrading areas progressed more slowly than had been anticipated, partly
because of staffing constraints and partly due to the limited experience with
procedures involved.  This delayed a sequence of institutional procedures,
including the issuing of Certificate of Rights (CORs, para 3.05) and the
takeup rate of building materials' loans in the upgrading areas. However,
this too was satisfactorily implemented within the revised completion period.
lv.      The materials loans program provided beneficiaries with the savings
inherent in bulk purchases. As a whole, the program which provided for the
purchase of materials from project stores met with partial success. Slow



-vi-
disbursements of materials led the Town Councils to sell materials on a cash
basis on the open market, making it possible for a higher proportion of
families to take advantage of the scheme.  An accurate assessment of the
accomplishments of this program, however, has been made difficult by
inefficient record-keeping of the accounts of the program (paras 4.05,4.06).
v.       While the institutional arrangements for the project turned out to
be satisfactory, project experience suggests that basic revisions are required
in the allocation of functions among agencies concerned with the
irplementation of housing programs (para 5.03).
vi.      After initial testing and experimentation with pilot toilets in early
1980 and follow-on construction of demonstration units, the REC II (paras
4.08, 4.09) was selected as the most technically feasib'e, and socially
acceptable alternative. The unit cost of a fully constructed REC II turned
out to exceed the affordability of the beneficiaries and partially explains
the low level of completion of the latrine superstructures in the upgrading
areas.  Affordability and willingness-to-pay issues relating to sanitation
remain unresolved. Future urban development projects might determine, through
an in-depth socio-econz-.."z study, beneficiaries' willingness to pay for a
range of sanitation alternatives, including waterborne sanitation. This could
be reinforced by stepped-up activity on the part of the GOB to educate
communities about the importance of safe sanitary practices.
vii.          The  financial  position  of  the  town  councils  steadily
deteriorated throughout the seven years of project execution.   While the
difficulties experienced with collecting payments due from beneficiaries for
project services was partly at fault, the councils' weak financial position
can also be attributed to their failure to adhere to the fiscal goals agreed
on at appraisal.   They continue to depend on central government grant
transfers to finance increasing gaps in their recurrent and development
budgets. This trend is inconsistent with GOB's stated policy and commitment
in principle to financial self-sufficiency of local governments.   Future
projects should pursue municipal finance advice to the GOB and suggest ways
to increase accountability from local government for enhanced revenue
collection and financial viability (paras 6.10 to 6.15).
viii.    Although the specific income generating components of the project did
not have significant quantitative impacts, the housing construction process
itself generated a significant demand for labor. The project has increased
rental income and income from business related activities (markets,
horticultural activities), although in neither case has it been possible to
quantify the extent precisely (paras 7.05 to 7.08).

SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1584-BT)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Sectoral Context
1.01     Botswana's urban population has been growing very rapidly.  In the
mid-1960s, some 21,000, or 42 of Botswana's population ltved in urban areas;
by 1975, the time of project preparation, the vrban population had grown to
94,000, or 14Z of the national population. The urban population in 1985 has
been estimated at 220,920, or 212 of the total.  This represents, over the
decade (1975-1985), an urban population growth rate in excess of 8.5 percent.
The Government of Botswana (GOB) predicts in its Sixth National Development
Plan that almost one-third of its population will live in urban areas by the
year 1991.
1.02     The GOB recognized very early that urbanization was an inevitable
part of the country's development and took steps to encourage a balanced
spatial development pattern and to eliminate any explicit policy biases, To
this end, the GOB, in its Fourth National Development Plan published in 1976,
stated thatt
(a) unLike rural development, urban housing and infrastructure would not
be subsidized;
(b) standards for housing, infrastructure and community facilities would
be the same for urban and rural areas; and
(c)  there would be a fair distribution of new industrial and commercial
development among towns.
1.03     Adequately planned urban shelter unable to keep pace with the
increasing growth led to a flourishing of squatter settlements in the
country's evolving towns.  In the mid-1970s, they accommodated 60? of the
population in Francistown and 402 in Selebi Phikwe. The GOB, through its
Fourth National Development Plan in 1976, was determined to have residents of
self-help areas (initiated under Credit 471-BT) pay the full cost of
developing and operating housing schemes, and therefore further lowered
standards and gave emphasis to provision of serviced settlement plots that met
the affordability criteria of the majority of urban residents.
1.04     Based on Government-sponsored growth studies, towns experiencing
rapid growth rates were selected for upgrading and development within a ten-
year period with financial support frou several donc:s: the British Overseas
Development Agency (ODA) financed Lobatse; the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) financed Gaborone.  Loan 1584-BT financed the remaining two
cities: Francistown and Selebi Phikwe.

The Proiect Context
1.05     The project was designed essentially to iicorporate important legal.
financial and design lessons learned during implementation of the first urban
project in Francistown and to replicate the experience in Selebi Phikwe.
Specific lessons from Urban I which were incorporated include: (i) greater
degree of community participation in project planning and implementation; (ii)
elimination of housing subsidies to beneficiaries to ensure replicability of
future projects; and (iii) increased accountability from the town councils for
enhanced revenue collection. It was hoped that Urban II would provide the
continuity essential to consolidate the evolution of the above policies
previously introduced in the sector.
1.06     Previous  IBRD initiatives  in Selebi Phikwe  include the Shashe
Infrastructure Project (Loan 776-BT, PPAR 5294 dated October 17, 1984) which
provided urban services to support a copper-nickel mining complex in that
town. Housing and services provided under this project went only to groups
in formal employment.   No provision was made for the burgeoning migrants
attracted by the employment potential nf Selebi Phikwe.   This led to the
emergence of an unplanned settlement of 10,000 (40Z of the town's population
at the time), near the mine `aft, in an area called Botshabelo, about 4 km
from the town proper.  In 19)z, Botshabelo was legally incorporated into the
town.  Loan 1584-BT was expected to provide secure tenure and basic urban
services for the residents of Botshabelo in Selebi Phikwe and squatter
settlements in Francistown (Tati West, Blue Town, Somerset East and West);
serviced plots and building materials loans were also to be provided in both
towns.    Newly  serviced  industrial,  commercial  and horticultural  plots
targetted for the low-income population, particularly women, was intended to
enhance their employment opportunities.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL
A. The Process
2.01     The GOB requested that part of the savings (approximately US$200,000)
realized from Credit 471-BT be used to prepare a second urban development
project. Terms of reference were agreed upon and consultants (John Burrows
and Partners, Dalgleish Lindsay Group (UK)) were hired in October 1976 to
carry out preparatory work with support from the Department of Town and
Regional Planning.
2.02     Project preparation proceeded relatively smoothly.  Preappraisal was
carried out in June/July 1977. Additional work prior to appraisal focussed
on municipal finance issues.  Negotiations proceeded on time as most of the
precedent conditions were met, namely (i) appointment of project coordinator;
and (ii) Government to submit to the Bank proposals for improving the fiscal
position of the town councils, which were facing serious financial problems
requiring significant financial transfers to remain solvent.   The third
condition regarding cost recovery, however, was discovered (ex post) not to
have been met contrary to information transmitted to the Bank at the time.



3
2.03     While the Bank was informed by the Government prior to negotiations
that the target of collecting outstanding monthly charges from at least 402
of the beneficiaries of the previous project in Francistown was met, upon
detailed examination of data presented at negotiations, it became apparent
that the Government defaulted on this condition. Less than 35Z of the total
amount of outstanding payments were collected as at March 31, 1978, and in
terms of households, the percentage was even lower. Nevertheless, the Bank
considered that progress made was not unreasonable in view of the short period
of time (about two months) that collections had been underway. The Bank then
recommended as a revised condition for loan effectiveness that the collection
target be increased to 502 of households in arrears. The Bank also determined
that as a step towards ensuring the Government's continued commitment to this
matter, to include a covenant in the loan agreement requiring collections to
reach 70Z by March 31, 1979 and 852 by March 31, 1980.
2.04     Other changes at negotiations included the extension of the repayment
period from 20 to 25 years for a number of project items to be repaid by the
Town Councils, utility corporations and project beneficiaries, which brought
the Bank's terms in conformity with those applied in other major centers in
Botswana and with the terms stipulated in the Government's new housing policy.
2.05      Additionally, the Botswana delegation requested the inclusion of a
pilot program that would make households with incomes between US$3,000 (the
ceiling under the project) and US$4,200, eligible to be considered for
allocation of low-cost sewered plots. While stipulating that the financing
of such plots was outside the normal mandate of the Bank, agreement was
reached to include them, partly because the 25Z premium charged to higher
income residents was expected to help improve the financial positiz.. of Selebi
Phikwe in terms of cross-subsidies.
2.06     Responding to concerns of the Bank about financial viability of the
town councils, the delegation indicated that a number of measures would be
taken to improve their financial position, such as tax support grants,
specific grants for health, community and educational services and a
restructuring of local government tax.   The primary source of additional
revenue, however, was expected to be derived from the allocation to the town
council of a local (Batswana) government tax on Batswana mine workers in the
Republic of South Africa (RSA). The delegation stated that an agreement for
this purpose with the South African Mine Workers Union had been reached and
that employers were expected to start deducting this tax from the workers'
wages within two to three months. As the Bank was concerned that this source
might not materialize nor be lasting, a covenant was added to the loan
agreement requiring the Government to review any projected deficits of thoe
Francistown and Selebi Phikwe Town Councils and take or cause to be taken
whatever steps necessary to secure their financial viability.
2.07     Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. in April 1978 with the
Government of Botswana represented by delegates from the Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Local Government and Lands, the Attorney General's Chambers, the
Town Councils of Francistown and Selebi Phikwe, and the Urban Development
Coordinator.

B. Oblectives and Project Description
2.08     The principal  objective of the project was  to  strengthen the
institutional arrangements for delivering low-cost housing.   In order to
accomplish this goal, several important policy and design lessons were
incorporated in this project, namely (a) cost recovery of all allocable
investments; (b) rationalizing land ownership and urban development in
existing squatter areas; (c) provision of affordable settlement plots; (d)
extension of home improvement loans to upgrading and settlement areas; (e)
stimulation of the use and development of indigenous home construction
techniques and materials; (f) special attention to the role of women in
development; and (g) fuller town council and community participation in
project planning and implementation.
2.09     The project components as agreed at appraisal consisted of the
following:
(a) Site preparation and servicing
(i)       settlement plots (994). including security of tenure, in
the Somerset East Extension and the Donga areas of
Francistown; the Western Areas and South East Extension of
Selebi Phikwe (1,505);
(ii)      squatter upgrading,  including  security  of  tenure  and
physical upgrading for all existing periurban areas of the
two towns; provision of plots for the voluntary
resettlement of households living on plots unsuitable for
upgrading in the Surveyed Tati Town, Tati West, Blue Town,
Somerset East and West (Francistown, 1,948), and Botshabelo
in Selebi Phikwe (2,000);
(iii)     low-cost sewered plots (287) in the Southeastern Extension
of Selebi Phikwe;
(b) Home Improvement Loans
A total of 4,680 loans ranging from US$120 to US$804 (P100 - P670)
to purchase building materials for hom^ improvement/construction and
sanitation units;
Provision of a variety of standard plans for house construction and
demonstration houses, financed by the Government;
(c) Community Facilities
Construction, equipping, and staffing of primary schools, clinics,
health posts and multipurpose community centers;
(d)  Primary Infrastructure



5
In Francistown, construction of boreholes with associated mains and
storage tanks, extension of electrical reticulation and roads to
project areas. Only minor extensions were required in Selebi Phikwe;
(e) Low-Cost and Conventional Industrial and Commercial Sites
One new market, vending shelters, infrastructure for local and
district commercial centers and low-cost industrial areas for small-
scale enterprises (SSEs); servicing parts of the extensions to the
Central Business District (CBD) and Central Industrial Area in
Francistown; improvements in the horticultural areas in the two towns
to improve nutritional food supplies;
(f) Studies
A study, overseen by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, to assist
the GOB in adopting a coherent strategy and policies for the develop-
ment of SSEs; a simple base line and follow-up survey and analysis
of healthinutrition status among periurban residents to be carried
out by the Ministry of Health, which would provide the basis for
evaluating the project's health impact, both of which were to be
financed wholly by the GOB.
Two other studies were to be done outside the project by the Ministry
of Finance and Planning: (a) a review of housing policy throughout
Botswana, including design standards, implementation procedures,
financing for community facilities and services; and (b) a review of
the potential role of financial institutions in providing housing                    r
loans to all income groups.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Effectiveness
3.01     The effectiveness of the loan was contingent upon the fulfillment of
the following requirements:   (i) execution of subsidiary loan agreements
between the GOB and the Town Councils of Francistown and Selebi Phikwe, the
Botswana Power Corporation (BPC), and the Water Utility Corporation (WUC);
and (ii) achievement of targets set forth in Section 5.01 (b) of the loan
agreement requiring reduction of arrears in the prior project to 502 by
December 11, 1978. Once the issue was resolved between the GOB and the two
utility corporations on what assets and liabilities they would take over, and
a compromise reached regarding the definition of arrears (i.e. extension from
30 days overdue to 90 days) and the level of reduction that could be
realistically achieved within the agreed timeframe, the subsidiary loan
agreements were ratified on July 1, 1979, three months after the originally
planned date for ratification.   With the impending ratification of the
subsidiary loan agreement, the loan became effective in June 1979, some six
months after the originally targetted date.

3.03      The project was mostly executed in its original scope except for
minor expansions, begun ±i late 1982, of the community facilities (e.g.,
upgrading of health posts to clinics and adding a day care center) further
upgrading of some infrastructure components that were otherwise completed
(e.g. surfacing of primary access roads) and the addition of a pilot in-
service training program. These additions were made possible as a result of
effective cost containment (running at about 5Z below appraisal estimates,
including contingencies) and the devaluation of the Pula.  There were also a
few minor reductions in some of the project components, namely, reduction in
the number of vending shelters from 125 to 40, healthposts from 12 to 5 and
community centers from 3 to 2, which also contributed to the cost savings.
Part of these savings was also used to finance consultancy services in Lobatse
and Francistown in preparation for a proposed third urban project, and
relevant sections of the loan agreement were amended, including the addition
of a new Part H to Schedule 2, in January 1983.



7
3.04      The Closing Date was extended twice, initially in December 1982 to
accommodate disbursements as only 64Z of the loan had been disbursed at that
time (para 3.37). The second extension took place in December 1983, largely
to allow time for completion of the amended project.
C. Physical Progress
3.05      Physical works were well-phased and efficiently implemented within
the contracted period with minor cost and time overruns as indicated in the
contract data in Annex 1. Implementation delays did occur during execution,
and these were related primarily to the non-physical components of the
project.   The exercise of demarcating boundaries of plots in the squatter
upgrading areas proved to be more time-consuming and labor-intensive than had
been anticipated, particularly in Francistown. Delays experienced during this
exercise triggered a sequence of setbacks in the issuance of Certificate of
Rights (CORs, the tenure instrument), the disbursement of bzilding materials'
loans and consequent home improvements.   As a result of the lengthy time
elapse, the average loan for building materials had to be increased to reflect
price increases. Delays in the issuance of CORs also slowed enforcement of
collection of payment due as liability could be established only after a COR
was granted. While some delay is inevitable when introducing relatively new
concepts, it could have been minimized and the cost burden on the beneficiary
reduced if the institutional capacity of the Department of Surveys and Land
(DSL) had been more realistically appraised and timely technical assistance
provided or increased after implementation started.   Moreover,  it became
apparent during implementation that the software problems experienced during
implementation reflected major institutional issues and a longer time frame
for their achievement would have been appropriate.
3.06      The details of physical progress of components in both towns are
provided below, and their implementation schedule is shown in Chart 1.
A. Francistown
Roads, Stormwater Drainage and Sewerage
3.07      Contracts for roads and stormwater drainage works were awarded in
June 1980. Construction started in July 1980 and was completed on schedule
in July 1981. Final costs of P1.26 million were 3Z below tender amount. The
quality of work was average.   Close and competent supervision by project
consultants identified the need for the contractor to rectify flaws in
workmanship during execution.
3.08      Earth roads in settlement and upgrading areas implemented by force
account of the Town Council started in August 1980 and ended in December 1984.
This lengthy execution phase reflects a period of work stoppage by the
Francistown Town Council (FTC) as the stormwater drainage could only be done
upon completion of back-filling of water supply trenches then being undertaken
by a different contractor.   Cost of force account work amounted to PO.13
million for road works and ancillary works on sleeves for power lines, etc.



8
Water Supply
3.09      Work on the secondary water supply system commenced in September
1980 and ended in October 1981.   Simultaneous work was undertaken on the
primary water system by the Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) during September
to December 1980.   A high standard of pipe-laying and good quality of
materials and works in general were maintained.   Savings resulted on the
construction of the secondary system because of lower than estimated
quantities of rock excavation and savings on contingencies.  Final cost of
PO.78 million compares favorably with the contract amount of Pula 1..4
million, reflecting cost savings of 17Z.
Power Supply and Street Lighting
3.10      Work was implemented by force account of Botswana Power Corporation
(BPC). Delays in the delivery of materials from BPC suppliers for completion
of the secondary electrical reticulation led to recurrent periods of
interruption, a four-year execution period, and a final completion date of May
1985. These delays did not have a significant effect on final costs of PO.50
million or 4? above estimated amount.
Refuse Vehicles
3.11      The council began acquiring refuse collection trucks in November
1979. By 1985. a total of 10 vehicles, including vehicles ior the Self-Help
Housing Agency (SHHA), were purchased at a total cost of PO.24 million.
Community Facilities
3.12      Construction of two primary schools (Monarch and Somerset East) was
completed in June 1981 by the lowest bidder out of six pre-qualified bidders.
Initially, consideration was given to scaling down the school plans as all the
bids received exceeded appraisal estimates. After consultation with the Bank,
it was agreed, however, that it was unlikely that lower bids would be received
or that construction time could be saved by this course of action.   The
completed schools cost PO.63 million, or 212 above estimates.   They were
handed over to the Town Council and put to effective use at the beginning of
the third school term in September 1981.
3.13      Construction of one clinic (Somerset East Extension)  and three
health posts (Somerset West, Monarch and Riverside South) was completed in
October 1981, at a total cost of PO.12 million, including equipment and
furnishings. The number (6) of project health facilities in Francistown was
reduced by 50 percent following a decision taken by the Ministry of Health.
The costs were reduced by only 9? from the appraisal estimates. Had all the
health facilities been constructed as originally envisaged, the costs would
have exceeded the appraisal allocation for this component.
3.14       The  loan agreement provided for one community center  to be
constructed in Francistown at a cost of Pula 99,000.   The councillors of
Francistown were not in favor of building a community center on the site
proposed for its construction, preferring instead to have a Civic Center



9
erected in its place. The Bank could not agree to this change because of the
much higher costs involved. This component was therefore cancelled and the
savings allocated to the building materials loan component.
Low-Cost and Conventional Commercial/Industrial Sites
3.15      Construction of vending stalls was done on schedule. A considerably
reduced number of vending shelters was built (i.e. only 4 out of 65) in
Francistown, at GOB's request, because existing stalls built under Credit 471-
BT were not being fully utilized. The four lockable vending stalls built in
Somerset East Extension amounted to P9,200 with no cost overr- as.   The
commercial and industrial plots (a total of 73) were wholly financed by the
GOB.
Plot Allocation and Development
3.16      Plot allocations were approached by the Councils in a systematic
way. Both towns began with a small batch of about 25 approved applications
and followed through the various steps to occupancy. This helped them to go
through the procedures and identify any possible wrinkles in the system.
Because of the requirement that a sanitation unit substructure be completed
before occupancy of a plot, the allocations were paced with the contractors'
work. Allocations proceeded slowly in Francistown. The primiry reasons were
identified as:
(a)   staffing constraints  --too  few  technicians  to  cope with  the
requirements of assessing proposed improvements by beneficiaries,
providing guidance on affordability, reviewing technical soundness
of building plans, and supervising of self-help construction;
(b)   the fact that the issuance of CORs -- a prerequisite for the
provision of building material loans -- was delayed in the squatter
upgrading areas because of plot demarcation constraints; and
(c)   to some extent, delays in infrastructure development, specifically
in the Donga area.
3.17      Some 1,844 serviced residential plots were allocated and CORs issued
for all of them. Similarly, approximately 3,545 existing plots in squatter
areas were serviced and secure tenure granted. Average developed plot size
was consistent with appraisal expectations of 420 m2.  Of the residential
plots in the Somerset and Donga areas, approximately 95? are now occupied, the
remaining 52 consists of undeveloped plots or plots which have been
repossessed and awaiting reallocation. Total development costs amounted to
P1.33 million or an average unit cost of P245 per plot.
3.18      A  total  of  approximE.tely  1,600  loans were  granted  for home
improvement in the settlement areas (new housing as well as improvements to
squatter dwellings). The total volume disbursed as loans as well as on a cash
sales basis amounted to P1.13 million, about 92 lower than appraisal targets.



10
Sanitation
.
3.19      Substructures for pit latrines, type REC II, were built in the
project areas during 1981 to 1984 by small contractors at the cost of about
P 400 each (1981 prices), financed wholly by GOB. All occupied houses in the
sites and services areas have completed sanitation units. In the upgrading
areas, the percentage with superstructures is about 25. The FTC believes that
residents are reluctant to build superstructures for affordability reasons,
but this has not been empirically supported. One pit-emptying vehicle, type
8revac, has been donated by the UK Government. Pit-emptying is currently free
of charge as no suitable rates have yet been established.
B. Selebi Phikwe
Roads, Stormwater Drainage and Sewerage
3.20      Construction  of  primary  roads  and  sewerage  was  carried  out
satisfactorily by contract though slightly delayed due to unusually heavy
rains during the construction period. Works were completed in September 1981
at a total cost of PO.6 million, some 212 lower than the tender amount.
3.21      All earth roads and drainage works implemented by force account of
the Town Council in the new settlement areas of the South East Extension, the
Western Areas and the Botshabelo North upgrading areas were satisfactorily
completed by October 1981, after a delay of 18 months, at a total cost of
P0.09 million, or 252 below the estimates. Additional repair work was carried
out on a culvert crossing Tshekedi Road which overflowed during heavy rains.
At the request of HLGL, the Bank agreed to having a new culvert built with
project funds. Work was carried out by contract during May to December 1982
costing an additional PO.13 million.   Further road upgrading to gravel
standards was undertaken during July 1985 to December 1985 following agreement
between the Bank and GOB to utilize a portion of the project savings for this
purpose.    In summary, the total roads and drainage component amounted to
P1.02 million, or 182 below the estimated value for this component.
Water Supply
3.22      Secondary water reticulation was carried out by force account of
the WUC in the Western Areas, South East Extension and Bothsabelo North and
South.   Delays were experienced in the materials' tender for Botshabelo
NorthlSouth caused by delays of the Selebi Phikwe Town Council (SPTC) in final
road-reserve/plot drawings, plot demarcation and COR issuance. The exercise,
started in October 1979, was completed in May 1982, some 8 months later than
anticipated.  The total cost of PO.63 million was 11Z below the estimated
value.
Power Supply and Street Lighting
3.23      Work carried out by BPC under force account proceeded well although
with minor delays due to late delivery of materials. Completion was expected
by May 1982 but actually took place in December 1982. Additional work on the



i1
street lights was completed in January 1985. A total of 55 lighting circuits
and day light switches have now been installed. It was found that metering
of street lights was not only more cost-effective, but the new method brought
Selebi-Phikwe into conformity with the other major urban areas in Botswana.
Total costs amounted to PO.24 million, or PO.14 below tender value.
Community Facilities
3.24      Due to poor performance by the initial contractors and early
contract terminatioa, construction of the primary schools was delayed by about
6 months. The three schools were completed in mid-1981 and were officially
opened in January 1982.   Total costs of this component amounted to P1.1
million.
3.25      One clinic and two health posts in Botshabelo South and in South
East Extension were completed ahead of schedule and handed over to the Council
between May and June 1981. The health posts were subsequently upgraded to
clinics in 1985 partially supported by project savings.   Total costs were
about P0.23 million, including the costs of procuring equipment and
furnishings. Similar to the experience in Francistown, the number of health
posts and clinics was reduced from 7 to 3 following the recommendation of the
Ministry of Health. Likewise, had the original seven been constructed, the
total costs for this component would have doubled the appraisal allocation for
this component.
3.26      Two identically designed community centers were constructed in
Botshabelo North and South-East Extension. Each center consists of an open
courtyard with a stage and lecture rooms, offices and toilets partially
comprising the enclosing walls. Total costs were kept within the tender value
of P0.12 million.
Low-Cost Sewered Plots
3.27      A total of 179 low cost sewered plots were developed by end 1982.
Allocation was extremely slow; between 1982 and early 1985, only 152 were
allocated. While full allocation has now taken place development has been
retarded by lack of affordable financing for housing construction.   So far
only 8 have been developed.
Plot Allocation and Developnent
3.28      A total of PO.97 million was disbursed as loans for home improvement
and construction in the new developments as well as in the squatter areas.
The remainder of P263,600 consist of building materials disbursed on a cash
basis and existing inventory.
3.29      By end 1987, a total of approximately 2,420 plots were rationalized
and allocated in the squatter areas of Botshabelo, 'Western areas and South
East Extension.   In the new settlement area a total of 2,115 plots were
allocated and developed. Average costs of development is estimated at P219
per plot.



12
Sanitation
3.30      All plots in the upgrading and low cost housing areas were provided
with latrine substructures constructed by small contractors and financed by
central government loans passed on to the town councils. The superstructures
were to be built by homeowners.  Similar to the experience in Francistown
residents in the squatter upgrading areas have been slow to build
superstructures.   Preliminary estimates are that about 25Z of squatter
residents have built superstructures; there is evidence, however, that the
substructures are being utilized even in the absence of built-up
superstructures.
Low-Cost Conventional Industrial and Commercial Sites
3.31      A market place with 28 lockable stalls plus an open shelter was
completed and handed over in August 1981.  Total costs were contained within
appraisal estimates and tender value of P0.05 million.   A total of 78
commercial plots, 42 small industrial plots and 7 horticultural plots were
developed in Selebi Phikwe.  This component was wholly financed by the GOB.
Components Common to Both Towns
(a)   Demoastration Houses
3.32      Seven low-cost demonstration houses equipped with latrines, were
constructed by small contractors in late-1980 in Francistown and five in
Selebi-Phikwe at a total cost of P48,315, or an average of P4,000 per housing
unit. These were financed wholly by the GOB. In Francistown the houses have
been leased to Council staff. In Selebi-Phikwe, they have been approved for
rental on the open market.
(b)   Studies
3.33      The Applied Research Unit of MLGL became fully stafEed with four
sociologists  by  1981.    They administered  the baseline  survey  in both
Francistown and Selebi-Phikwe on the health and nutritional status among
periurban residents.  The findings were reported in 1982 and were utilized
during project implementation. Simultaneously, a nutritional study conducted
by the Nutrition Unit of the Ministry of Health monitored the weights of
children to establish which children needed supplemental diets and whose
mothers needed information on preparing nutritionally scund meals. The survey
was done through a random sampling of beneficiaries of the first project in
Francistown and the target population of Urban II project's upgrading areas.
The findings of this study were useful in augmenting the data that were being
submitted by clinics and health posts at that time.   The findings also
provided a basis for evaluating the project's health impact and designing new
health/nutritional initiatives and program modifications.
Pilot In-Service Training
3.34      The training component was designed to develop and deliver job-
related in-service training programs within the context of the decade plan



13
(1982-1992)  for local government service manpower and development.   The
beneficiaries of the 18-month inservice training, a total of 300, were limited
to Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe and the Central and North-East District
Councils.   Training programs were designed to be highly job-related and
delivered by on-the-job training methodology. Target recipients for training
were drawn from staff cadres in the broad local authority functions of
administration, technical operations, financial services, and commwnity
development. An in-service training unit (ISTU) established in May 1985 to
implement the pilot program comprised four expatriate training specialists,
each with a counterpart, covering the functional groups to receive training.
The program made rapid and encouraging progress (para 4.07).
D. Costs
3.35      A detailed breakdown of actual project costs compared with appraisal
estimates are provided in Annex 2 and are summarized  below.  Actual costs
expressed in local currency (Pula) show a cost overrun of 21? brought about
largely by project modifications, including a slight expansion, and a
progressive devaluation of the Pula.

E. Financing Plan
3.36      The estimated and actual project financing plans are summarized
below. Withdrawal from the proceeds of the loan, by project component, is
provided in Annex 3.  The Bank loan of US$8.0 million (P6.7 million) was
expected to finance about 642 of total project costs, or the full foreign
exchange cost of US$6.9 million as well as US$1.1 million in local costs. The
disbursed amount of US$7.4 million financed the full foreign exchange costs
or 582 of total project costs.

F. Disbursements
3.37      Withdrawal from the various categories of the loan is shown in Annex
3, annual disbursements are shown in Annex 4, and accumulated disbursements
from the loan by quarters compared with appraisal estimates are given in Chart
2. Actual disbursements lagged behind appraisal expectations by a margin of
about 51Z during the early phase of implementation (1979-81). By end-1982,
the original Closing Date of the project, only 64: of the loan was disbursed.
At the request of GOB, the Bank twice revised the original Closing Date to a
final date ot June 30, 1985 to accommodate the delayed execution of the plot
demarcation process and issuance of building materials, loans. At the time
of loan closing, the undisbursed amount of approximately US$564,000 was
cancelled.
3.38      In retrospect, it appears that the Bank's appraisal projections for
loan disbursement. particularly during the earlier stages of implementation,
failed to recognize the startup delays brought on by delayed loan
effectiveness. The Bank also failed to be realistic about the institutional
capacity to execute plot demarcation and issuance of CORs.   It should,
however, be noted that the GOB's practice of submitting applications for 64Z
disbursements of expenditures, irrespective of the category under the loan
agreement (the higher percentages were not utilized), also contributed to the
lagging disbursement profile.
G. Procurement
3.39      Procurement of civil, electrical and building works was conducted
according to international competitive bidding (ICB) for contracts for civil
works totalling P3.1 million and building works totalling P1.7 million. Works
amounting to PO.25 million consisting mainly of road construction, electrical
and water supply works were carried out by the councils' force account. This
decision was based on the demonstrated capacity of the utilities to execute
force account efficiently.   The building materials' supplies were awarded
according to local competitive bidding procedures. The latter was justified
on the grounds that the materials were intended for a loan program that would
require procurement in small increments, and there were sufficient local
suppliers to ensure competitive bids.



15
B. Reportir.g
3.40      During the period of relatively intense physical implementation,
quarterly progress reports were sent to the Bank regularly through end 1982.
The quality of the reports was satisfactory; the reports were not merely
limited to the physical accomplishments, but also included analysis and
reporting of project implementation tasks and effects. The frequency of these
reports was interrupted for about two years between 1982 and 1984 after the
departure of the Urban Development Coordinator.   Temporary arrangements
whereby two professionals from the NLGL were assigned to work with the
Assistant UDC in Francistown helped with the preparution of the final
Consolidated Progress Report which was sent to the Bank by June 30, 1985.
3.41      The quality of reporting on the physical progress was adequate;
reporting on the cost recovery situation improved gradually after the FTC and
SPTC began to follow the reporting format agreed upon with the Bank. The new
format permitted a clear determination of the number of people in arrears, the
amount Jn arrears and the aging of the arrears which allowed the councils to
take remedial necessary action.                                               4
3.42      In addition to the quarterly progress reports, audit reports for
the FTC and SPTC for each fiscal year were sent to the Bank within twelve
months after the end of each financial year as covenanted in the loan
agreement. This was facilitated by the strengthening of the Local Authority
Audit Office in 1980 through additional training at the Botswana Training
Center on Financial Administration (BTCFA).
I. Compliance with Covenants
3.43      As detailed in the table below, the GOB was in compliance with the
major covenants except for three: (i) cost recovery; (ii) preparation of
quarterly reports; and (iii) which is related to (ii) above, filling the post
of the project urban development coordinator.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Physical Works
4.01      Roads, stormwater drainage, and sewerage constructed by contractor
and force account in the new housing developments as well as the upgrading
areas are receiving adequate maintenance by the town councils. Additional



17
works carried out on an existing culvert crossing the Tshekedi Road has
resulted in considerable improvements in run-off. Roads in the Botshabelo
upgrading area of Selebi Phikwe were found to be too minimally designed to
withstand the floods of early 1988 which caused considerable damage to
property and subsequent relocation of families who completely lost their
dwellings; plans are underway to undertake further upgrading of this area.
4.02      The water reticulation system in project areas serving approximately
20 families to one standpipe is providing regular, safe and reliable supplies.
Approximately 402 of the families in both project towns now have on-site water
connections.
Low Cost and Conventional Commercial and industrial Sites
4.03      The majority of commercial and industrial plots developed under the
project have not been allocated or reallocated following repossession. One
of the reasons for the slow progress in this component has been the failure
to come to acceptable terms with the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC),
the financial intermediary proposed at appraisal, to provide seed capital to
intorested entrepreneurs.  The Bank's appraisal proposal to set up a small
pilot credit scheme never flourished.  Similarly, the proposal to allocate
the horticultural plots to women did not receive the full support from the
town councils largely through lack of staffing to monitor this aspect of the
project: the majority of employees on these plots are male based on a survey
of these plots (carried out during preparation of this PCR) in Selebi Phikwe.
4.04      According to the loan agreement, monthly charges for the stalls
provided under the project were to be calculated on the basis of the recovery
of the full capital costs, together with a premium of 252 of such cost, plus
interest at the rate of 8.25? per annum for 10 years.   This would have
resulted in a monthly rental fee in excess of P20 per stall. This fee was
considered an undue hardship and not competitive with fees charged for similar
facilities. The terms were then revised to provide for a recovery period of
25 years and an interest rat.e of 52 per year, lowering the monthly charge to
P14. In spite of the Councils' efforts to recover the economic costs, they
have been unable to enforce these costs; the vendors are now being charged
only a nominal P10 per month which meets their affordability and willingness-
to-pay, but which reduces the potential for replicability.
Home Improvement Loans Program
4.05      The project provided loans to be passed on to beneficiaries for
purchase of materials from project stores.  'While the program helped the
beneficiaries to benefit from the savings inherent in bulk purchases, it
turned out to be less effective than had been anticipated. It is difficult
to determine precisely the amount of materials disbursed on a loan basis as
the record-keeping was defective, and a rectificatIon exercise led to marginal
improvements only, but interest in the materials' loan program waned during
the project leading the Town Councils to sell items on a cash basis on the
open market. Materials remaining in the stores were liquidated in early 1988.
4.06      The  use  of  materials  loans  programs  might  be  more  closely



18
scrutinized in future projects in the light of (a) government's policy to
promote traditional building materials (project stores generally encourage
higher building standards); (b) the costs associated with newly-created
project stores; and (c) the administrative capacity to run these stores.
Low-Cost Sewered Plots
4.07      Final allocation of these plots has been slow.  Initial delays were
due to the time needed to determine the most satisfactory tenure arrangement
for these plots. It 'Aas suggested early in 1981 that the CORs could not be
assigned to them and that the only alternative -- fixed term grants (FTGs) -
- should be considered. However the FTGs required the full payment upfront
which, by definition, reduced the number of low- to moderate-income persons
who could qualify for these plots.  The plots have now been allocated to
middle income families on an FTG basis, but housing construction on these
plots has been delayed largely by the unavailability of mortgage financing.
The appropriateness of the tenurial instruments (FTGs and CORs) for low-income
housing programs in Botswana have been the subject of an in-depth analysis,
the findings of which have been recently published by the Bank in the Housing
Sector Review (Report No. 7126-BT, February 12, 1988).
Cost Recovery
4.08      Collection of service levy and building material loans' payments
persisted as a serious problem in both project towns, which has compromised
important policy goals of the project -- self-sufficiency and replicahility
of urban development. In spite of meritorious efforts of the town councils.
the legislative and judicial arms of the GOB to rectify the high rates of
default, the level of arrearages remained at significantly higher levels than
stipulated in the loan agreement.   This situation essentially reduces the
effectiveness and creditworthiness of the town councils and undermines chances
of project replicability. A detailed discussion of this issue is presented
in Section V.
Pilot In-Service Training
4.09      The program was rated a success by a Bank training specialist during
a November 1985 interim evaluation mission. The program's effectiveness was
determined to be due to its clarity, simplicity and its practical orientation.
The level of trainee participation was perceived to be high. Some aspects of
the program were highlighted as requiring follow-on attention to ensure the
success of replicated efforts, including the need for internal coordination,
and appropriate selection of trainees and trainers.   Based on this pilot
experience, the GOB at the urging of the chief executive of the local
authorities recomended that a separate project be undertaken. The lessons
were carefully considered and incorporated into the design and implementation
of the now ongoing Selebi Phikwe Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2695-BT)
which forms part of an expanded three- to five-year operation addressing
training needs of all local authorities in Botswana.



19
Sanitation Program
4.10      The Ministry of Local Government and Lands selected the pit latrine
type REC II (a double vaulted improved vented pit) as the preferred type for
low-cost sanitation in urban areas. This type offered a practical compromise
between more and less costly solutions.   The basic system offerred the
following advantages:
(a)   easy transferability from one pit when full to the other;
(b)   3 to 5 years for the local authority to empty a full pit;
(c)   familiarity and social acceptability;
(d)   standardization which facilitates.construction quality conttrol; and
(e)   uniformity in costs thus simplifying bookkeeping and hence cost
recovery procedures.
4.11      The Bank's supervision missions we.e concerned with the GOB's
decision to select the REC II for the reasons of affordability on the part of
beneficiaries and financial viability on the part of the town councils. The
additional cost burdens on the already weak local authorities conflicted with
the GOB's commitment not to subsidize the urban areas. The cost of the REC
II, including a simple zinc superstructure, a pedestal and vent pipes is now
estimated at P1,000, which approximates the cost of an affordable habitable
room. Moreover, its system for pit emptying requires that towns develop an
additional maintenance capacity demanding additional equipment and manpower
for each town. In the context of poor cost recovery now being experienced by
the local authorities, it has become apparent that the sanitation investments
would have a substantial negative impact on town council finances, and hence
on Government policies of self-sufficiency for the urban areas.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE
A. Performance of the Borrower
5.01      Overall supervision of the project on behalf of the GOB was the
responsibility of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) attached to the MLGL.
The PCU, basically one person -- a project coordinating officer-- was expected
to supervise the construction of house improvements with the assistance of
Low-Cost Housing Officers and the Housing Departments of the two councils.
This was done effectively by an expatriate project coordinator during the
first two years of implementation and by a local assistant coordinator during
the remaining years. At the end of the project the assistant coordinator
returned to his former job at the MLGL. In principle, institutionalization
of the lessons of the project took place by this process although one can
question its effectiveness given the level (assistant) of the staff selected
by the GOB to fill the position.   On the other hand, however, the GOB
demonstrated its commitment to institutional development through efficient
recruitment and good coordination of PCU staff with the MLGL throughout



20
project execution.  The design and supervision of all infrastructure works
(except water infrastructure in Selebi Phikwe which was done by WUC) was
contracted out to consultants appointed by the GOB. This arrangement turned
out to be satisfactory.
5.02      Institucional support in the form of technical advice from Low-Cost
Housing Advisore (financed by the Foundation for Cooperative Housing, USA) was
critical to the plot allocation and housing development process. The Finance
and Accounts sections of the councils were strengthened with recruitment of
additional qualified staff.   The addition of this staff and the analytic
capacity of the housing advisors were found to be particularly essential in
rectifying the records of the councils as the Town Treasurer and his staff
were unable to attend to housing m&zcf-rs other than by incorporating completed
summaries  of  the  Housing  Deprt. ants'  affairs  into  the  Treasurer's
accounts.  These arrangements in  'e-ospect turned out to be satisfactory
solutions needed to expedite the project.
5.03      The institutional bottlenecks which arose during implementation
impeding progress with the software components of the project (e.g. plot              -
demarcation and issuance of CORs, faulty recordkeeping and slow collections
of building loan repayments), stemmed largely from the duplication of
responsibilities among the agencies concerned with housing.   The limited
manpower available for urban housing programs was not effectively deployed
under existing arrangements. The SHHA, for example, performed tasks such as
debt collection and management of housing materials' loans (in addition to its
other functions), which could have been more effectively handled by other
existing agencies which were comparatively better equipped for those
functions.   Simiiar overlaps and unclear lines of responsibility existed
between the local authorities and Departments of the MLGL, which hindered
progress.   As urban housing programs in Botswana continue to grow these
inefficiencies will increasingly hinder effective management; the timing is
appropriate for a basic revision of the allocation of functions among
institutions.
B. Performance of the Bank
5.04      Generally,  the  Bank's  interactions  at  all  times  regarding
identification, appraisal and implementation of this project were highly
valued by the Borrower.  The Bank's assistance was appreciated on clarifying
policy questions relating to the appropriate urban tenure instruments, cost
recovery, pricing and standards.   Frequent exchanges during regular Bank
supervision were found most effective and helpful in deepening mutual
understanding on relevant urban issues aided in part by continuity of staff
during supervision through the project cycle.
5.05      There were about 2.5 supervision missions per year (13 staff weeks)
in the early phase of the project and 1.8 missions per year (25 staff weeks)
in the later phase of project execution. Mission coverage of the critical
issues and components of the project (plot allocation, land tenure, technical
assistance  on  low-cost  housing)  was  thorough.    Because  of  budgetary
constraints, supervision of the employment component and monitoring of the
changing position of opportunities for women under the project vis-a-vis



21
formal and informal employment fell below the expectations articulated at
appraisal.
5.06      In retrospect,  it appears that the policy objectives were too
ambitious to be achieved under a single project. Expectations at appraisal
might have been scaled down to reflect the difficult cost recovery experience
under the first project, the difficulties in achieving marginal reductions in
the delinquency rate during project preparation and the socio-political
realities in Botswana. This project might have more appropriately focussed
attention on establishing the basic building blocks to achieve the desired
policies  in the long term.   More emphasis might have been placed on
strengthening the Town Councils in the key area of financial management,
including basic record keeping, and also in developing and implementing
community participation and education programs which are essential to
encourage beneficiaries to pay.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Cost Recovery
6.01      Past  self-help  housing  schemes  in  Botswana were  financed  at
subsidized interest rates and recovered only a small part of allocable
investment costs. This project was planned to be the first to recover all
allocable investment costs for housing and infrastructure from the ultimate
beneficiaries. A total of P7.7 million or 732 of total costs was expected to
be recovered from beneficiaries; another 82 covering the recurrent costs of
operations and maintenance, were to be recovered through general revenues of
the towns and the remaining 192, for community facilities and a proportion of
technical assistance, to be financed by the Central Government on a non-
reimbursable basis. As detailed in the table below, the actual results were
quite close to expectations. Some 702 of total costs are now recoverable from
beneficiaries; 4? from the Town Councils; 202 from the Central Government and
the remaining 6Z from the Utilities (BPC and WUC). Approximately 10 percent
of project costs would have been recoverable from the Town Councils (bringing
the proportion in line with appraisal expectations) had they not been divested
of their responsibility for providing water and electricity. Annex 5 details
the terms for recovering the costs of specific project components.

/5    The costs of servicing the commercial and industrial areas were financed
wholly by the GOB. Cost recovery is the responsibility of the DSL through
the sale of 50-year fixed term grant titles. The vending stalls were
expected to be rented at economic rents to recover 125% of costs, amortized
over 10 years at 8.25%, but this did not materialize for affordability
reasons. The vendors are now being charged only a nominal fee.

6.02      As reflected below, collection performance of annual amounts due in
service levy charges has been much weaker than had been anticipated. The
service levy is structured to reflect local authority debt servicing
requirements on housing-related infrastructure investments, as well as the
recurrent costs of operating and maintaining urban and housing services \1.
The levy covers a significant proportion of project costs.

6.03     Collection of the service levy remained in the mean range of about
65Z annually implying that over one-third of annual amounts due was added each
year to the accumulating debt owed by low-income plot holders to the town
councils. The town councils' SHEA monthly statistical reports showed that in
September 1985, ,ome 68Z of SHEA target population in Francistown and 572
\1   The  service  levy was designed to cover a number of repayment
obligations including elements unique to the SHHA housing. Thus it
covers general city maintenance and scrvice overheads, SHEA
department overheads, as well as capital and interest payments on the
infrastructure costs in SHEA areas. Since no debts on infrastructure
are retired through the service levy, the charge continues in
perpetuity.    Moreover,  the  service  levy  for  SHHA  plots  is
recalculated periodically to take account of the capital, overhead
and maintenance costs of new SHEA plotholders. The result of this
has been that the levy has increased rapidly in recent years. The
gap between the levy and the rising costs it is supposed to cover has
widened as the councils have chosen not to increase the levy during
the past several years, thus eroding the economic base of the SHEA
program.   The Housing Sector Review, 1988 has recommended the
elimination of the levy, replacing it with a progress rate structure
based on a new tenurial system.



24
in Selebi Phikwe were in arrears of over 90 days. The percentages of arreai
related to repayments of building materials loans were reported at 49Z and 4:
respectively, in September 1985 for Francistown and Selebi Phikwe.   The.
ratios have not changed significantly during the last three years.
6.04     Collections were  initially made difficult by  inadequate  recol
keeping which obscured the payment performance of individual plotholders.
therefore became difficult to establish the number of people in arrears, ti
amount in arrears, whether of the service levy or building material lox
repayment and whether of 30, 60 or 90 days in arrears.   The councils wei
unable to take timely action on the emerging arrears situation. These initit
difficulties were attended to with the hiring of a low-cost housing office
who introduced improvements to the data base and data analyses, which improve
understanding of the reasons for the growing arrears.
6.05     Poor collection was thereafter exacerbated by GOB's decision t
gradually increase the service levy charge to economic levels. The effect (
this measure was to increase the levy by 400? during 1981/82, from the nominr
P1 to P5 per month with a further increase in April 1982 (to P10 per mont!
to make the levy fully economic.  This charge covered the operating costs
SHHA, rofuse collection, road maintenance, toilet substructures, stree
lights, water charges and an assumed default rate of 5Z.   The increa-
inevitably had a dampening effect on payments; charges were subsequent:
lowered to affordable levels determined by the councils. Current charges ai
P8.50 per month, which is about 35 percent below the economic fee of P12.'
per month.
6.06     Additional actions taken during the course of the project to increas
collections include: (i) acquisition of computers; (ii) revision of son
ineffectual legal procedures, including the introduction of a primary role fc
the urban customary courts to take action against defaulters; and (iii
request to the GOB to amend the State Land Act regulations, 1985.
6.07     The experience with the court system was not entirely satisfactoz
largely because of the heavy load of warrants at the courts which held greats
priority. Court-appointed messengers commissioned to deal with service le%
defaulters could not keep up with serving the large number of warrants
Related to the delays with court action were inadequate procedures under ti
State Land Act requiring that plots repossessed by the Town Council t
disposed of at public auction. This clause ran counter to the spirit of ti
scheme, namely, to target shelter to the lowest income people. Consequentl1
the SHHAs were reluctant to proceed vigorously through the court system unti
revisions to the procedures were made.
Affordability
6.08     The design standards of the project have been kept relatively modes
Annex 6, and this is reflected in the relatively low unit costs of variot
plots (paras 3.17 and 3.29).
6.09     Based on an analysis of the incomes of the beneficiaries of th
project and urban household income data for 1985 supplied by GOB, household



25
with incomes below the 20th percentile or at incomes of leas than P100 per
month can afford the basic monthly payment for a newly serviced site and
building materials loan of P20/month, including the service levy. 'When the
costs of construction are added, however, the poorest are excluded, as only
families with the 25th to the 40th percentiles could pay the full dwelling
(low-cost) plus infrastructure costs. The affordability of the SHHA housing
becomes more adverse if the cost of land were included in the affordability
calculations (the costs of land are generally excluded in GOB analyses).
Finance
(a) Administrative
6.10     The administrative and accounting capacities in FTC and SPTC were
strengthened with technical assistance provided under the project, which has
led to basic improvements in the production of timely information through the             V
accounting system. Management information (computerized to a limited extent)
and budgetary control systems are now in place, but these would require
substantial further strengthening.
(b) Municipal Finance
6.11     The Town Councils were expected to realize annual surpluses of
revenue from rates, taxes and levies over their recurrent expenditures and
contribute to debt servicing. Several means were identified at appraisal to
assist the councils to achieve these financial viability goals, including:
(a) deduction of local government tax from all central Government
employees and Botswana national working in South Africa, and part of
these funds be distributed to the councils to assist in shortfalls
in their r-evenue account;
(b) regular adjustment of (i) property taxes and (ii) capital development
levies by an amount at least equal to the rate of inflation;
(c) increase local government tax by an amount at least equal to the rate
of inflation; and
(d) that cost sharing formulas for specific social programs such as
health, community and educational services be modified so that the
Central Government would finance a larger proportion of the costs.
6.12     Over the period 1982-86,  the town councils have experienced a
worsening imbalance between their expenditure requirements and revenues. At
appraisal it was felt that by divesting the councils of their poor performing
utility responsibilities (for water and power), they would begin to generate
cash surpluses and a comfortable liquidity position. Several years after the
divestiture, however, the councils are still not showing signs of
profitability. This situation is critical because of the rapid urban growth
rates and rising unit costs on the one hand, and the limited economic base of
these cities on the other. An in-depth analysis of the fiscal potential of
these cities might be included as part of a technical assistance package of



26
a follow-on project.
6.13     Another reason for the financial situation of the councils is the
failure rf the GOB to meet the fiscal goals agreed on at appraisal ((a)
through (d) above). The pooling of local government tax never occurred, as
it was not accepted politically. While the indexing of the property taxes and
capital development levies was done at relatively frequent intervals, the last
adjustment being in 1985, implementation was difficult and collection
performance of the service levies has been poor in the two councils.  The
local government tax, which over the five-year period (1981-85) has been
yielding over P1.0 million annually to the two councils, was abruptly
abolished in January 1988 by decision of the Ministry of Finance, without
consultation with the MLGL and the Councils.   The basic reasons for its
annulment were cited as its inequity, as payments could only be secured from
the formally employed; the high administrative costs involved in attempting
to identify the evaders (basically the self-employed) and in getting them to
assume their tax liability would render the effort ineffective. Current plans
are to have the former local tax replaced by more buoyant and f3exible sources
of local revenue,  such as user charges,  and sales taxes.   Finally, the
recommendation to have the Central Government finance a larger proportion of
the costs for social programs ((d) above) was never accepted by the Ministry
of Finance.
6.14     The actual financial results of the town councils for the past five
years are provided in Annex 7. The results of their dctual recurrent account
for the period 1982 to 1986, and the projections for 1988 and 1989 are
summarized in the table below. What is of concern in the table is the steady
increase in the volume of grant transfers from the central Government to cover
deficits, rising from PO.46 million in 1982 to P5.5 million by 1989. The town
councils' liquidity crisis would continue well into the 1990s as they are
required to service the Bank's loans (passed on to them through a subsidiary
loan agreement with GOB), service net recurrent expenditures as a result of
the project, in addition to responding to growing expenditure requirements.
6.15     Appraisal ideas to have the additional costs associated with the
increased levels of service cross-subsidized by higher income groups, have
turned out to be unfeasible. The effect of cross-subsidy through property
taxes has to be ruled out in the short- to medium-term as a result of the
increased proportion of low-cost plots to high- and medium-cost plots,
particularly in Francistown.  The councils must seek ways to identify new
fiscal instruments in order to remain financially viable and autonomous -- a
difficult challenge given the trend outlined above, i.e., decreased revenue
authority, increased expenditure requirements, and, inevitably, increased
reliance on central Government transfers.

VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Economic Benefits
7.01     As  anticipated at  appraisal  the project has  provided  for the
expansion of Botswana's major mining and commercial towns, redirecting public
investment to the greater benefit of low-income people. The project provided
direct benefits to about 10,000 households, about 70Z of the 1986 population
of both towns (assuming an average household size of 5.5), which slightly
exceeds appraisal expectations (60Z).   The policy improvements introduced by
the project -- cost recovery, the beginnings of a mortgage system for all
income groups -- would outlast the project itself and help Botswana to cope
with its exceptionally rapid rate of urbanization. Although the GOB promoted
the use of indigenous building materials for home construction it was not
accepted by the beneficiaries. This thwarted two major goals of the project
i.e. preservation and development of traditional building techniques, which
is the least cost alternative, and assistance to the informal sector building
industry.  Had the traditional techniques been used the capital/labor ratio
for housing construction would have substantially been reduced and jobs would
have been created for low-income workers.



28
B. Rates of Return
7.02     In recalculating  rates  of  return,  all  costs  (engineering  and
supervision,  site  preparation  and  servicing,  primary  infrastructure,
administration, home improvement loans, physical contingencies. private
investment,  and maintenance) have been included.   Costs associated with
community facilities have been excluded because the complementary benefits
cannot be quantified.
7.03     Benefits from investment in residential development in the new
housing settlements as well as in the upgraded areas were based on imputed
rental values and increases in rental values, respectively.   Rents were
determined on the basis of rents paid by lodgers in the project areas and
information provided by the town councils from a survey of dwellings
constructed by the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) in the Francistown and
Selebi-Phikwe areas. Room rents in the SHHA sites and services area have been
estimated at P 30 per month, which reflects existing rents paid by BHC low-
cost housing tenants, i.e. P31.50 per month per room. Room rents for the low-
cost sewered housing plots have been estimated at P40, or 50 perctnt of
current value of a room in a comparable development.   The reduced imputed
rental value can be justified on the basis of the slow pace of development of
the low-cost sewered plots. The additional rental value for a SHEA hut in the
upgrading areas, as a result of improvements, has been estimated at P10, and
P5 for housing units affected only by improved services.
7.04     The benefits come on stream in phases beginning in 1981 when
occupancy started in the new developments. On the basis of these assumptions,
the ex-post weighted average economic rate of return for the expanded sites
and services and upgraded components representing about 80 percent of total
project costs has been calculated at 17? which compares favorably with
appraisal estimates of 182. Details of the cost and benefit streams are given
in Annex 8.
7.05     The rate of return on commercial, industrial, and horticultural work
sites, could not be recalculated at completion for lack of the relevant data.
It is likely that the rate of return would be below what was expected at
appraisal because available data on market and vending fees show that they
have been set below economic prices. Theoretically, rents could be raised to
cover the full costs (capital plus operating and maintenance), but this might
have the undesirable effect of reducing the amounts collected, or encouraging
tenants to avoid the market and commercial sites altogether in favor of
squatting by the roadside which has its negative externalities. Moreover, the
total cost of this component representing about 1? of total project costs
would not have a significant impact on the overall rate of return of the
project.
7.06     Primary infrastructure for electricity was provided under the project
to provide street lighting and make possible connections to community and
commercial  facilities.   Likewise,  water  infrastructure was provided  to
increase supplies to low-income residential and commercial areas and also to
allow for continued town growth. The value of these benefits has not been
measured separately in the ex post analysis; some of it has been included in



29
the imputed rental value of project housing development.
7.07     VhUle the health, education and social integration which clinics.
schools, and community centers provide cannot be quantified, they have
enhanced the value and benefits of the project.   The SHHA low income
communities in the two towns now have access to 5 additional schools and 7
healthposts and clinics.
7.08     The commercial/industrial components, including the horticultural
component created a total of approximately 300 additional permanent jobs in
the two towns.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
A. Conclusions
8.01     The second urban development project financed by the Ucrld Bank in
Botswana has successfully provided urban services to approximately 50,000 low
to moderate income residents in new and upgraded developments in Francistown
and Selebi Phikwe. The physical works were efficiently carried out and the
quality has been sEtisfactory. The capacity of the town councils to undertake
further urban development projects has been partially strengthened by on-the-
job training, technical assistance and in-house experience.  Project costs
have been well contained within the original cost estimates.
8.02     The most significant aspect of this project has been its impact on
housing policy in Botswana.   Essentially, the project (a) introduced the
concept of paying the full cost of developing and operating low-cost housing
schemes by revising standards downward; (b) concentrated on developing
squatter areas; (c) raised the income ceiling to attract a wider income range
thereby encouraging non-polarized residential development; and (d) identified,
through a process of learning by doing, the most appropriate tenurial
instrument (i.e. replacement of the CORs with the FTGs) for urban areas. This
project, together with the first urban project in Francistown have had a
substantial long-term programmatic and institutional impact, not only in terms
of increasing the supply of legal, environmentally acceptable shelter, but
also in laying the right policy framework to allow these achievements to be
replicated in the long te.m.
8.03     The use of materials loans program could be more closely scrutinized
in future projects in the light of (a) the policy of government to promote
traditional building materials; generally materials stores encourage high
building standards and fail to recommend the use of local materials which they
do not supply; (b) the costs associated with newly-created project stores; and
(c) the administrative capacity of the relevant agencies.
8.04     The experience gained from project evolution suggests that a program
should now be developed for providing a wide variety of options for low- and
moderate-income households, which might now include fully-serviced (water-
borne sanitation) plots, increased densities, internal cross subsidization,
and in which the market determines demand preferences. Financing mechanisms
need to be developed for moderate income housing. Had such a range of options



30
been available to low to moderate income families, the low-cost sewered plots
which have all been developed and allocated under the project would have been
completely built up as had been anticipated at appraisal.
8.05     The institutioual problems encountered during the implementation of
this project, stemming largely from inadequate a:rangements for housing supply
(managemeDt of housing materials loans, debt collection, operation of building
materials stores, issuance process of CORs) have been fully analyzed and
documented in the Housing Sector Review, 1988.  Based on the findings and
recommendations of this Review, existing agencies would continue to play key
roles in the housing development process, but with a more clearly articulated
framework, and with areas of responsibility more specifically defined. Plans
are underway by the GOB to streamline the institutional framework for housing
programs. A follow-up urban development project now under preparation would
pursue these important institutional goals of the GOB.
8.06     Significant improvements in cost recovery would be necessary in order
to place the town councils on a sound financial basis. Alleviation of the
cost recovery problem will require consideration of several underlying
difficulties concerning land tenure and cost recovery instruments. It will
be necessary to eliminate the service levy (currently very ineffective) and
the COR and replace them with a progressive rate structure and a new tenurial
instrument already partially in use, the FTG. In removing the service levy,
the outstanding debt comprising arrears and unpaid capital could be assumed
into a new debt instrument and then serviced by the beneficiary.   Cost
recovery will also be enhanced by a rationalization of institutional
responsibilities that emphasizes functional specialization by agency, a
reduction in duplication of function, and enhancement of local authority over
revenue raising. An enlarged program for community education and community
participation would also increase the likelihood of beneficiary commitment to
pay.
B. Lessons Learned
8.07     The following are the main lessons to be derived from the experience
of this project:
(i)  Collections of payments due from low income communities is
difficult, particularly in contexts where the historical and
traditional precedence is lacking; the project might have
anticipated this difficulty and might have taken steps to secure
maximum cow- -.y participation throughout the project cycle.
The opportunity to encourage or pursue community participation
should have been grasped early in the planning phase when it is
most appropriate to influence beneficiaries' commitment and
willingness to pay for services provided under the project;
(ii) The Bank might have been more realistic in its expectations to
promote the use and development of indigenous home construction
techniques and materials in the urban areas. While the use of
traditional techniques would have significantly reduced the
capital/labor ratio for construction thereby allowing greater



31
access to project housing to more families at the lower end of
the income scale, beneficiaries showed no interest in utilizing
these techniques. The use of traditional materials would also
have stimulated employment of the informal sector. These types
of policy objectives must be matched with the preferences of the
intended beneficiaries determined through socio-economic surveys
and a carefully designed program of community participation;
(iii)In principle, there are savings inherent in bulk purchases of
materials and these can be passed on to the intended
beneficiary.  These programs are difficult to administer and
should be subject to greater scrutiny at the planning phase of
the project. Materials loans programs, particularly when new
project stores are created, have high administrative costs and
fail to promote use of local materials which generally do not
fall under the control of the stores. In the context of this
project an element of contradiction has emerged in terms of the
GOB's policy to promote the use of traditional building
materials and the inclusion of a materials loans program;
(iv) Minimal services should not necessarily compromise sound
technical standards.   Low cost schemes should be subject to
stringent design standards as other schemes. It appears that
a more careful design would have taken account of the flooding
potential in the squatter areas in Selebi-Phikwe; families might
have been resettled during the resettlement phase of the
project, and the severe damages and hardship caused by the heavy
rains of early 1988 might have been averted; and
(v) The accounting and recordkeeping standards in many African towns
and cities are quite low; Francistown and Selebi Phikwe are no
exceptions. Being aware of these shortcomings, the appraisal
team should have taken adequate and timely measures during
project preparation to carefully appraise the actounting systems
and procedures of the Town Councils and introduce an action plan
(e.g. for improved mechanization, introduction of computer
software and training etc) to improve their capacity in the
short term.   This might have helped to prevent the chaotic
recordkeeping of beneficiary records which ensued and subsequent
difficult cost recovery. Correspondingly, more resources could
have been spent on technical assistance and training to help lay
the fundamental basis for improved record keeping and
collections.

I Unable to establisb the cash flax changes as a result of Urban It
because separate records were not established until 1996. haed
an recoaendations of the auditors of the 1984JS5 Accounts, the FTC
agreed to set up seWprate Urban 11 recrds by 1996/87 and to put past
records in order.
Moves not include capitalized interest because of a flaw in the
accounting procedures at FTC. Prior to F71992. all deferred charges
created before that year were written off. Since then, nothing was
written off, thus the figures appearing in subsequent statetents
have not been very meaningful.

Ex-Post Economic Rate of Retutn Calculations
The following assumptions were used in the calculations of the ex-post
economic rate of return (ERR).
General
All prices have been expressed in 1986 constant terms.
Costs
1.    Infrastructure costs include all costs of preparing and servicing
residential sites, i.e., costs of water, electricity, roads and
earthworks, both on-site as well as off-site.
2.    Housing  construction  costs  come  from  two  sources:  (i)  home
improvement loans and cash sales; and (ii) the cost of construction
based on data collected at completion, estimated at 75 percent of
the value of building materials.
3.    Costs of administration, engineering and supervision estimated at
75Z of the cost of the total technical assistance provided under the
project; the remaining 252 being attributable to the commercial and
industrial component (not included in the ex-post ERR) which was
wholly financed by the GOB.
4.    Operating and maintenance costs estimated at 1U of total development
costs, including labor costs.
5.    The costs of building tie community facilities have not been included
in the cost stream since associated benefits cannot be directly
quantified.
Benefits
1.    The benefit stream has been calculated on the basis of imputed rental
values of the following: 3,959 new housing units at P30 per room per
month. The houses come on stream as ready for occupancy as followst
356 in 1981; 1,069 in 1982; 1,267 in 1983; 633 in 1984; 317 in 1985;
237 in 1986; 40 in 1987; and 40 in 1988. A total of 179 low-cost
sewered plots whose rental values have been estimated at P40 per
month. Imputed rental values have been assigned beginning in 1983
when the plots became fully serviced.
2.    Rental values in the upgraded areas have been calculated on the
following basis: li) additional rents of PS per month on 50 percent
of the units (2,984) largely attributable to the introduction of
improved services; and (ii) additional rents of P10 per month on the
remaining 50 percent of the units attributable to home improvements
and expansion made possible by the project.

Attention: Operations Evaluation Department
RE: BOTSWANA-SECOND URBAN PROJECT (LOAN 1584-BT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Please refer to the Project Completion Report dated
October 11, 1988 which you have sent to this Ministry along with
a covering letter thereto dated July 31, 1989 in which you solicited
our comments on the report.
2.      We appreciate the Bank's efforts in comprehensively documenting
the experiences, successes and short comings in the implementation
of the above project.
3.      We concur with the report's conclusion that to a large extent the
objectives of the project have been achieved. We also agree that
many problems which merit some comments were encountered in implementing
the project. Problems which the report highlights are:
. Duplication of responsibilities between local authorities
and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands.
Shortage of qualified personnel.
 Inefficient service levey collection and building material
loan arreas recovery.
. Need for public health education on proper sanitary
practices.
Promotion of use of local building material.
We will consider the suggestions raised in the report in future
design of urban or similar projects in order to overcome the problems
encountered during _mplementation.
Finally we would like to comment on each conclusion in the
report as follows:

CONCLUSIONS
8.01    Points raised on this paragraph are indeed true and
correct.
8.02    Full cost recovery is very much appreciated, however
there are certain constraints which hamper its realization.
Among the constraints are:-
- Affordability;
- Cultural and traditional beliefs that the land
belongs to our forefathers therefore we cannot pay for iti,. thi&
if anything the Government should pay.
It is hoped that future generations will be in a better
position to understand the reasons for paying rates.
(a) This point is correct.
(b) No comment with regard to this point.
(c) This would only work to a certain extent, because some
people from the low income group would not afford
replacement of CORs with FTGs.  We would rather
recommend that the low income group be given the
option to choose either one of the schemes.
8.03    (a)  Both modern and traditional materials could be stored
by an institution which is involved in low cost housing. Research
on local building materials should be conducted to determine the
traditonal building material feasible for the low income group.
8.04    There is a general concensus that, affordability permitting,
sewage systems should be provided in all areas including the low
income housing areas. Revised Earth Closet (REC) II should
gradually be phased out for health and maintenance purposes.
8.05   This is true, in addition the Government of Botswana
is encouraging private sector involvement in housing delivery.
8.06    Regarding this paragraph, refer to problems highlighted
in paragraph 8.02.

In addition, we would also support Community participation
in similar schemes in future where people will be in a better
position to understand the reasons for paying rates.
B. LESSON LEARNED
8.07    (i)  We fully agree with the concept, but it is not easy to
practically implement it. It is not easy to change
people's attitude over a short period of time.
(ii) No comment
(iii) Partly true, hence we are carrying out "coucher system"
pilot project which may be beneficial not only to the
local authorities but to beneficiaries themselves as
well. This system enables benefiaries to purchase building
material directly from suppliers using vouchers provided by
Councils.
(iv) T3rie, we agree with the report.
(v) Also true
Statistical figures are also correct.
5.       We would  like to take this opportnity to thank the Bank for its
support towards our various development programmes.
Yours faithfully,
S. S. G. Tume
for/PERMANENT SECRETARY
