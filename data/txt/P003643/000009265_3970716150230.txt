The region along the highway is the heart destrict of Xinjiang economic development
with dense population. The project will improve econornic developrent of this region .and re-
suIt in sorne problems against surrounding environment. The purpose of this assessment is to
investigate environmental background values of air.soil and crops in the evaluation area a-
long the highway.to investigate and predict the scope and degree of effect on regional envi-
ronrnent during construction.to prove technically feasibility and economically reasonableness
of environmental protection measures against the project. to present environmental protection
contermeasures to provide scientific basis for the project designing and the administrative
policy-making departnent- so as to reduce impacts of the project on surrounding enviror-
ment to the allowable extent and to attain the coordinated development of economy and envi-
ronmecntal proxection.

Chapter 2 Introduction to the Project
2.1   Signi'iaica Of costcting U-K Highway
U-K highway is situated in the northern foot of Tianshan Mountains and souther bor-
der on the Junggar Basin. The starting point is Urumqi. capital of Xinjiang. The terminal
point is Kuitun ,a developing city. The region along the highway has been know as Gold Cor-
ridor whose polities .economy and culture ae flourishing.was placed on one of 12 nmjor eco-
nomic belt being developed in 96's by Chian government.
U-K highway is a,part of the west section of national highway 312.which from Lianyun-
gAng in east to Yili ,Xinjiang in west ,is one qf lorgest national mnain highwav.the main high-
way passing through the nost provinces and Cities and a part of Euraisa Bridge.
Xinjiang is multi-nationalities region with a vast territory and abundant resources .especial-
ly. with abundant reserves of coal and petroleutn. but its highway transportation is back-
ward .which be Some one of the restrict factors of economic development of Xinjiang. To speed
up the economic development, the tempo of construction of the main road of highway must be
quickened.
When the Autonomous people's governent carry out the policy of 'op;nning up to the out-
side incline to the western of China'and 'introducing exterior and contacting with interior.
contacting with the east and importing to the west' ,The basical installation such as tran.;-
porcation ,telecommunication and ports are set up to form a last and efficient communica-
tions network. Construction of the highway will play an important role in not only improving
transportation condition and econinic develpment Along the highway.but also improving in-
vestment environment, attracting foreign capital. developing a open pattern economy,setting
up transit basis of internal and external commodities in Xinjiang and even the w, stern China.
2.2   lhe Trend of the Road Line and the Major Control Points
The starting point o[ the highway is Wulapo in 1OKm from Urumqi city,which join with
Turpan - Urumqi highway. The terninal point is Kuitun citv. The highway pass the west
railway station of Urumqi, Changji city. Hutubi county, Manasi county, Shihezi citv and
Shawan county. The whole line of U-K highwa. is 256Km long.
The major control points are: Unrmqi citY ,the west railway station, Changji city, Hutubi
county,fork of Hu-Ke highway,Letuyi,the west uf Manasi,Shihizi c;:y,Shawann county,
Anjihai etc. The terninal point is fork of Du-Ku highway in the south of Kuitun city . The
line location and trend see Fig 2.

3. 1. 2 Earthquwke
This highway is situated in lunsan Mts sesmnic bet of XInang middle part seismic regionL
10 earthquakes with 6 and over 6 magTmtade.over 5 intensity were took place in 1916-1965.
In light of Earthquake Intensity Map of Xniang Uygur Automomou Region drwn in 1986
and Earthquake Intensity Division Map of China publshud in 199O,WuIapo-Diwopu 
bekngs to 7 intensty distict.Diwopu-Jingou River is 6Mingou River-the western border
of Shawan County is 7. In secton of the wstern border of Shawan County-Kuitun ity.the
south of U-co highway is 8.and the north is 7.
3. 1. 3  Hydrogedogy
in geological strutre,the area belongs to the nouhern part of depression belt in the fringe
of   r        .ountains,whose despositio layer of Qurnary period is of lre thickness.
which provides good condition for deposition of ground water. The existin U-Y highway is
took as the dividing line. In the south.it is upward part of dip plin in hont of Trashan Mts.
There are single pebble aI  gravel preatc wate layer whose water pernmeability is very
good m its water-bearg staum. Its slope is about 1Y. Its surfice runowff is well-condi-
tion,and its hydraulic sope is 5-6-. The buried depth of groundwater is under saozs me-
tre.total ion cozicenuataX  is 0. 58g/l as bicarbonate ion-calcium type water. In the nwth.
wthin range of 2-3Km width,there is middle part of the dip plain . The kpositing layer of
Quaternary is at botom as sand-gravel mixed layer and at top as desposition stucture with
sub-sand soil Its buried depth of ground water is 5-1lOn u    sue. It is good dranim-
age. It is the main irrigation agricultural areas at preet. In arens between dip at the frizge of
flooding and alluvial fan and alluvial pla.mIts landKmns tum  genItlis ock Iezure turns
into fine fron coarse. Its water permeability goes weakness to cause raise of water table.
Therefore, the overflowded belt of ground wae is formed. e buried depth is 1- Sm.
which are often overflowed as sprng and swamp.  contems high-saline. and beogs w sul-
fate-chloride-bicarbonate ion-sodium type water. In addition,there is aquidude (water
-12-



bearing strata)with Tertiary clastic tock in Yanalike mountain,Urumqi. Its crevice water is
poor,and its water quality is bad.
3.1. 4 Topography and Soils
This highway is situated in north slope of Tianshan Mountains.on southern fringeof Junggur
Basin. Its terrain is high in sorth and low in north . There is Gurbantunggut desert on north
of this highway. Tianshan Mountains from west to east is on south. Landlormalong the high-
way is the flooding and alluvial plain in the north foot of Tianshan Mountains ,*hich consists
of large or smaLl and new or old flooding and alluvial fans. There are two large landforms dis-
tricts:the low mountain and hill destrict (Wulapo-Diwopu) and norther-clined flooding
and alluvial plain in the south of Juggar Basin (Diwopu-Kuitun).Ihis area is one desert lan-
scape. Main soil type are desert sirerzem .brown desert soil. Some intrazonal soil (bog soil,
meadow soil and saline soil) which are despersed over both sides of river vrith ground water
belt.
3.2      Ecological Environmnental Status Quo Monitoring and Assessment
The ecological environment along the alignient was investigated for three tires:April,Julv
and October,1993.
3.2.1    Vegetion Status Quo ad its Assesment
The natural vegtation of the evaluated ares along the highway mainly is zeric or super-

B. Clump grass group
15. Achnatherum splendens
range vegeution are 2 types.4 sub -types.7 groups and 15 formntions in the evaluated ar-
eas.
Artemisia borotalense Formation is despersed widely in range along the highway, which is
rainly made up of Salsola offinis S. soda.Ceratocarpus arenarius,Tetracme quadricornis. Er-
emopyrum onentale etc. ,besides A. borotalense,a dominant species.with its total cover de-
gree of 15% .the wet yield of its S76Kg/ba .and hight of 10-30cm . In Reaumuria soongonica
Formation .the species composition is simple and few Ceratocarpus arenarius and Salsola sp.
were seen. the Formation is with wtal cover degree of 10-25%,the wet yield of about
750Kg/ba,hight of 20-30cm (shrub layer, herb layer is 10-20cm). Petrosimwonia sihirica
PFormation is made up of P. sihirica ,Salsola sp. and Ceratocarpus arenarius etc. with hight of
10-20cm ,total coverage of 20-35%.the wet yield of 1370. 5Kg/ha.
Glassland auility is evaluated as the 5 clases and 8 grmdes in our report. Glass refer to
herbages quality in range. Herbage are divided into excellent ,good ,middle.low and poor.on
the bases of palatbaility .utilization ratio and nutritive value of plants in community. At pre-
sent,the division of class of grassarnd is mainly on the basis of palatability of piant.as wel as
proportion ot weight of each herbage in community. According to 'National Grassland Re-
sources Investigation Outline. 'its sandards are as foUows:
class I :excellent herbage cover over 60%
-las  I :good kerbage cover over 60%,excellent and middle cover 40%
class I :middle lbae  cover 60%S.good and low 40%;
cls IV Jow herbage cover 605S middel and poor 40%
class V :poor herbage cover 60%
Grade are divided into eight dass(1.2,3,----8),on the basis of the fresh weight of the aerial
part in commuity .Its stndards are as folows:
Grade 1:>12000Kg/ha
Grade 2: 9000-12000Kg/ha
Grade 3:6000-9000Kg/ba

Grade 6:1500- 3000Kg/ha
Grade 7:77'-l5SOOKg/ha
Grade 8: <750kg/ha
For the range qualitv of the evaluation area. there is not exellent range. The proportion of
good range is lower with 8. 82Ye, medium range is 55. 88% ,low range is 35. 29 Y%. It shows
that the natural range of -the evaluation area is medium and pratly low. The yield of range is
generally low. The proportion of -seventh-grand and eighth-grade range is 89. 41Yo,the
proportion of fifth-grade and sixth-grade is 4. 71% ,and the proportion of second-grade.
oz..y one type,is 5.88%.
3.2.2 Woodland Status Quo and its Assessment
There are no natural forests along the highway. Besides field protection forests Manasi For-
est Farm and Forest Farm of Ganhezi,Hutubi were set up in the evaluated area.
Manasi Forest Farm is plain that,which is directly under Xinjiang Forestry Departmiet.with
total areas of 5944. l8ha ,among it,Forestry land 602. 14ha. the stored volumes is 49559rns,
most part of that is middle and young growth,the structure age of stand is as follow -young
growth is 271. 55ha ,counts for 54. 22% of forest land, niddel is 216. 76ha. 43.6% of forest
land;mature timber is 7.89ha,1. 60%. Areas of forest is 496. 2Qha, among it,timber forest is
40966. 47m3, 82. 66 % of total stored volumes; Shelter forest is 2036. 87m3.4. 11%;special
forest is 6556. 66m',13. 23Y. Main tree species are Populus canadensis.Fraxinus sodgiana
and Ulmus leavis etc. The most part of woodland were dispered in raorth of the present high-
wayvthe coverage rate is about 50%. In south of the present highway .owing to arid,only
few Ulmus sp. and Fraxinus sp. are scattered about . The land metioned above will be
planned to farmland for rational use.
3. 2. 3 Wild Animals Status Quo and Assessment
Among the vild animnals of this area,. Insecta and Arthropoda make up the largest quantity.
As they are the inferior animals wit high rate of reproduction and extreme adaption to their
environments so they can't be taken as the emphasis in this assessment. In faunal division
the area along the highway belongs to Wusu and Qitai Desert Unit.which is the mainlv recla-
mation area of the northern foot of Tianshan Mts. In the composition of wild animal-it show
that Junggur desert animals inter -penetrate with oasis field animals - There's not any pre-
cious or endangered species along the highway.
At the evaluated area,composition of wild animar is simple. The conunon species is Bufo sp.
of Anmphibian.Eremia velox and phrvnocephalus sp. of Reptilia.which destributed widely to
desert belt of the northern Xjnang. The dens .wlt birds are Passer montanus ,Calan-drella
cirnerea etc. which are desert cosmopolite spec.er. There are no large mranals. Glires makes
up the main part of the mammals,such as ,'4eri:.C.-s ervthrourus ,Mus musculus and Cricetu-
lus nigratorium etc.

jiang;the heavy in dustry total otitput value makes up 77. 58%,the average speed of growth
is 13. 09% per year--1. 49% faster than that in the same period in Xinjiang.
Xinjiang heavy industry is mainly in Urunqi .Changji prefecture and Kelamayi ;light industry
mainlv in Urumqi,Shihezi and Ydli.The highly concentrated departniants,for example ,oil .
steel and iron ,nonferrous netals, coking and coke chemical industry etc. are mainly in U-
rumqi,Changji,Kelamayi.
In 1991 the total industrial and agriculttal output value of the four cities and three counties
along the draft highway was 141. 24 burdred million yuan (fixed price in 1990, the same
below) --37. 31% of the total output value in industry and agriculture of the autonomous
region;the proportion of the area in 1980 rised 8. 57% than that of the autonomous region in
the same per od. The national output value as a whole was 97. 03 hundred miillion yuan--
32.8% of he whole rigion;3. 8% higher than that in 1980 . The naticaal income was 74.49
hundred million yuan--30. 53% of the whole region;4. 92Yhigher than that in 1980. From
1980 to 1991 the average growth of the total value in national production, industry

3.3. 3 The Production of Agriculture & Animal Husbandry
3. 3. 3. 1 Agriculture production :With fertile soil the production along U--K nighway is
prosperous. From Hutubi to Urumqi one person owns 2-3 mu culirvate land, and 3-5 mu
for each from Kuitun to Hutubi line. This area has been the main base of grain ,cotton,sug-
ar,oil in Xinjiang because of it rich heat,enough sunlight.smooth terrain.fertile soil,com-
plete water conservancy and growing. In 1992 the planted area reached 580.83 ten thousand
mu --50. 41Y are grains, 29. 95% cash crops .others such as vegetable,melon & fruit.
forage are 19. 64 %. Among the grain crops wheat comes first ,corn and bean second;among
the cash crops cotton comes first,oil -crops and beet second . The muin growing area and
output along the line in 1992 is seen beloin table 3-5.

The natural aninal husbandry within the conunentary is mainlv concentrated in the place
from Shawan ,Anjihai to Ku:tun . Desert grassland is the natural view here. The grass output
is lower. 1-1. 5 hectares grassland can feed about one sheep unit ,mainly for some groups of
cattles passing by during 4-5 months in spring or 9-11 months in fall per year. Most of the
groups are sheep. Each group is about 200-300 sheep fed by several herdsmen families.
3.3.4   The Backgrouno of Lead in Soil & Grains
In order to get a right commentary on the lead amount in soil and grain along the U-K line,
We're scattered 4 points along the line ,collecting soil.wheat to exazmine. There are at least
'netres from each sample to c -rying highway,Its result can be seen below in talbe 3-8

3. 4 Tourism Resources
Since the old davs Urunqi has been a fertile natural pastureland called Beautiful Pastureland
by herdsmen. She is a shinning peral at tne foot of Tianshan Mountains. In recent years its
municipal administration has taken a quick step,showing a modewn capital city wiEh natural
feathers. Urumqi has manv other natural sceneries and well know places besides Hongshan
tower and Jian lake. Nanshan forest is not only a rich animal husbandry hase .but a summer
resort for tourism. The famous chrysanthemum is Gangod.water-fall in white Poplar gully
and forest spring in Miaoergor gully have been natural sceneries sinc2 history. Yanerwo
scenic spot has manv big trees. fragrant green grass with Urunrqi river passing through.
ShuimogouNwater rnill) gully spot wth hot springs scattered nearby,forest wares and waver
sound are always heard. It's reallv a good place for tourism and convalescence.
Shihezi and Kuitun are two representative cities newlv built. located in North Xinjiang.
There are progranunes for the urban districts. The blocks are tidy ,groupsof buildings are a-
mong fruit gardens . Tha:'s a graden style. The symbol o! Shihezi is the sculpture- -the
first ploughshare of army farm,in the city's centre.
The Nanshan scenic spot, located in Shawan county, owns great and strange -reen mnoun-
tains,singing springs and colorful flowers. There's a pastureland for Kazak herdsmen near
Dazi temple. Here are often held national physical activeites. Another nice place is Ningliahe
gouge. Besides ,'ingouhe hot spring .located in Shawan county,cures sikness slowerilv among

Moving north from Shihezi .Shawan .you may go further into the desert - -Gurbantunggut
where you can watch sunrise and surnset .climb sandhills .cross desert. You may enjoy the se-

3. 5     Acoustic Environmental Status Quo and its Assessmet
3.5.1   Investigation and Monitoring of Ac-bustic Environental Statm Qua
According to the Method of Measuring CIty Enveronment Noise(GB3222-82),Julv-Au-
gust 1993 the sensitive points of noise wtre monitored such as schools and residential areas
within the evaluated areas.for the sake to protecte the health of people.
19 sensitve noise points along the highwav were determined.among it,schools 4.and l.resi-
dential areas 15(2 along the link line). Its distibution location and monitoring date see 3-5
-1 to 3-5-4.
3. 5. 2   Assessment and Analvsis of Acoustic Environmental Status Quo
To know well level of acoustic environmental status quo at sensitive noise points along the
highway and evaluate scientificily and describe the degree of noise pollution.the existing a-
coustic enveionment within the evaluation range is evaluated according to the four grades of
table 3-5-5 below.

According to the assessment of the status quo.the acoustic environmental quality within the
evaluation range is good.the background level is often less than 50dB in daytime as well as
less than 4OdB at night. The environmental noise is mainly in the form of the traffic noise in
existing rural highway,railwav and airport. No noise level of 19 sensitive noise points are
over standard. There are Gobi and desert areas where people are distributed scarcely along
the highway,and a part of field and borrowing site,so.
In a word ,all the existing acoustic environmental quality is good within the evaluated range.

3.6. 1 Moinitouing and Evaluation Standard
(DLocation of monitoring points
According to the topograpgy and meteorological condition and the social and ecomonic sutia-
ton along the highway,7 monitoring points were determined, besides of these,2 points were
determined in Xishan and Charxgi link line. Location and features of every points see Fig. 2
and table 3-6-1.
'2)Monitoring factors and method
Accordirg to the demand of the outline of this assessment and the environmental impact
cnaracteristic in construction and service of highway,NOx,CO and TSP were determined as
the nainly monitoring factors this assessment. THC and Pb were monitored at some spots.
Monitoring method is on basis of Technolohy Standard of Environmental Monitoring and
Monitoring and Analysis Method of Air and Waste Air issued by NIPA.see table 3-6-2
arnd 3-6-3.
(3)Monitoring time and frequency
The monitoring time are Mar. 1993(winter)and July 20,1993-Aug. 5,1993(sunmer). In ev-
ery season ,monitoring were varried out in two stage. the monitoring frequency is 4 times one
day ,continuing five days (8: 00,12C: 00,16: 00,20: 00,BeiJing time).

3. 6. 2 Moni!oring Results and its Analysis
I)NOx
The detection range of NOx is Y-0. 172mg/b'3.Range of mean daily value is 0. 004-.
lllmg/m'.excet Xishan point.daily value and once value the rate of the exceed stanc'ard is
respectivdy is 20% and 5%S in winter.the value of the others points is not excedd standard.
2)TSP
The detection range of once is Y-1. 230,Range of daily value is 0. 015-0. 610mg/m'.the
rate of exceed standard of once value and daily value of Xishan point is respectively is 5% and
100% .and in LiangcHouhu point.the once value is 5% in winter.the rate of exceed stndard
of Slihezi Building Material Wark(Shihezi BMW) is 10 %.In swmmer.the value of mean 5
day in XiShan is exceed standard 0. 7 times. the valne of the others points is not exceed stan-
dard.
(3) CO
The range of once value is Y-9. 01mg/rn Ail points is not exceed standard ,daily value is 0.
11-4.41mg/c3 ,expect Liangshouhu point;the daily value is exceed standard 20% ,tbe others
points is not exceed standard in winter the mena 5 day value is not exceed standard in win-
ter.
3.6.3    Results of Assessment
1)1he mean daily value along the U-K highway is not exceed the Grade I atmospheric
standard in Ambient Air Quality Srandard,expect Xishan point the value of TSP is exceed
standard in somerime.this result is affected by Urumqi air qualitv.
2) Mean value of indivedual standard index each polutant, the summers is better than
winter's because the temperature is higher.the wind is stronger of Xajiang in summer.
3)The Air qualitv along U-k highway is good,the index of pollutant is lower than the stan-
dard.

3. 7    Pollution Meteorological Conditon along Alignnment
On the basis of meteorlogical data of S years at 6 neteorological station along the highwAy,
pollution meteorological data of Urumqi,Changji.Hutubi.Shihezi,Shawan and Kuitun vere
calculated. Atmospheric environmental pollution state along thehighway will be forecastid,
on the basis of these pollution meteorological data.and forecasted rollution sources of high-
way.
(1)Urumqi
a. Wind and wind field characteristics
Wind of spring and summer are excessive large in Urumqi ,and most of its direction ore north
and northwest. In fall .it is nouthwest wind at most. In winter .It is current to south wind.
4verage wind speed is 2. 2m/s.Still wind frequencs 20%. Days of gale(>17m/s)is 12. 2.
Characteristics parameter of wind and wind field in Urumqi see table3-7-1-3-7-4 and
Fig 2-7-1.
b. Frequence of atmospheric stability
The atmospheric stability is an important parameter for study of atmospheric dif.usion pro-
cess. the rate and the degree of atmospheric pollutants diffusion mainly depend on types of at-
mospheric stability. Using Parques -Tenel classification, frequency of atmospheric stability
of Urumqi were classified and counted,see table3-7-5.
(2)Changji
a. Wind and wind field
Its results see table3-7-6-3-7-8 and Fig 3-7-2.
b. Temperature inversion
The inversion layer strongly controlles the atmospheric vertical movement,is one of impor-
tant factors effecting on dilution of atmospheric pollutant ,wbich is unfavourable to diffusion
and dilution of atmospheric pollutant and aggravates atmospheric pollution degree.
Characteristics of inversion layer in Changj see table3-7-9.
c. Frequence of atmospheric stability
Its results see table3-7-10.
(3)Hutubi
a. Wind and wind field
Its results see table 3- 7-11-3-7-13 and Fig. 3-7-3.
b. Frequence of atmospheric stability
Its results see table3-7 --14.
(4)Shihezi
a. rind and wind field
Its results see table 3-7-15-3-7-16 and Fig. 3-7-4.
b. Frequence of atmospheric stability
Its results see table 3-7-18.
(5)Shawan

a. Wind and wind field
Its results see table 3-7-19-3-7-21and Fig. 3-7-5.
b. Frequence of aunaspheric stability.
Its results see table 3-7-22.
(6)Kuitun
a. Wmnd and wind field
Its results see table3-7-23-3-7-25 and Ftg. 3-7-6.
b. Frequence of atnospheric stability
Its results see table3-7-26.

Chapter 4 Forecast of
Environmental Impact and
Mitigation Measures
4.1 Discermment and Screening of Enviroomental Factors
4.1.1 Characteristics of Environmental Impact Caused by IiBghway Project
Environmental impacts caused by highway project are in many ways. The basic impacts
are those to atmospheric quality, acoustic environment, wildlives. social economv. land uti-
lization. agriculture and animal husbandary, meanwhile, the highway projec: can also induce
changes of some other environmental factrs.
(1)Atomospheric quality It includes traffic volume, exhausted gae from motor vehicle
and dust by highway construction.
(Z)Noise: The impact includes the disturbance to sensitive areas such as residential ar-
eas, hospitals, schools, cultural and educational institutions, offices and public places of en-
tertainment, ect.
(3)Range vegetation: Some range vegetation is directly occupied by highway and tram-
pled during construction.
( O)Agriculture and animal husbandry production: The highway construction directly oc-
cupies some cultivated land, range and forest bet, which adversely affect the agriculture and
animal husbandqy production. The highway can affect the migration of livestocks tu some ex-
tent. The exhaused gas of automobiles can affect the quality and yield of crops in the area
near the highway.
(S)lrrigation svstems: The operation of some irrigation systens may be affected if they
are not take into account in design phase of the highway when it cut across the irrigation sVs-
terns.
(6)Evironznentci aesthetics: The field vision will be hindered; The high slope. high
bridge and expressway will destroy some natural soenery of the district but will add some
new manu-made architectural scenery.
(7)Social activities, conditions of work and study: After the Construction of the high-
way. the forma living, work and amusemnt dstricts will be seperated so that people's social
activities- amusement and studv conditions will be affected.
The obvious effect is that involved in resetdement which will change the wav of life and
work.
4.1. 2 Screening of Environmewnal Impact Factors
-59 -



Main factors of enviromnent impact of U-K highway are screened by Delphi Merhod,
on the basis of investigation of environmental condiuon along the route. reference to the
trainig material on EIA nf project assisted technically by the Exploitation Bank of Asia.
(I)Principle of selecring exper s
(DRepresentativitv
Twenty -eight exper. ',e e choosen in all wtose specialties cover twenty scientific
fields such as ecology, cco-an- '-onmental monitoring, environmental geography. economic
geography, environmental chtmniscry, zoology, botany, agronomy, agricultural division,
meteorology, hvdrology, hvdraulic engineering, natural geography, EIA management, nat-
ural protection, grassland protection, highway engineering and highway management, ect.
©)Authoritauiveness
Choosen experts are from different departrments and are personnel in a specific field. Se-
nior technical post cover 80% arong them, who participate in reiew of EIA reports in Xin-
jiang many times, and are engaged specifically in EIA and its maragement with plentiful ex-
periences and relatively high research level.
-Fam.lianty
Experts were acquainted with er'vironment along the alignment and show up once in
worksite at lest. Some expel ts -vent in for various scientific investigations and researches in
areas.
4.1.3 Method of Initial Assessment
20 likely enviromnental impact factrs were selected - and arranged it in tables to con-
sulted experts.
The effecting degree of every parameter is ascextairna, according to the effecting ex-
rend, intensitr and time of environmental factors in evaluation area, present environmental
value along lute and the reality to miitgace the adverse effects.
The project construction will result in effect or no effect on the en-vronment of evaluated
area. Degree of the integral effect (including beneficial and adverse effect) was divided into
slight, small, medium and mighty effect.
Each effecting degree is quantitatively conducted into 1, 3, 5, 7, to be appropriate t
calculaton, "+  refers tO beneficial effect, -a refers to adverse effect. N (W refers to no ef-
fect. See table 4-1-1.
Tab. 4-1-1       Quantitative grades of epvactl ip   degree

quantitative grades   0          ±1             3           ±5           +7
Screening of environmental parameters
The estimate value is selected primarily, after even value of quantitative estimated val-
ues of every factors of effects on this project plus or subtract standard deviation, after the es-
-60-



timate values arc evened within extent of preliminary selection . the initial evaluation values
of effecting degree are calculated with formula below:
Y,=mnin(E,-X)
Where: Yi,-refers to grade j affecting degree of parameter i
EJ-refers to quantitative value of grade j
X -mean estimation value for parameter i after initial selection.
Result of initial environment assessment
Expert's assessment results of the project's impact on environment are see in table 4-1

4. 2.1.1 Impact upon range vegetation
Filling and digging in a project seize and destroy grassland and farmland. There two
side: (1)permanent seizing because of highways, which is irreversible: It changes the land's
usage. it from land for agriculture and animal husbandry to that for pernanent highways.
(2)temporary destroy: Machines and workers under construction ruin the earth, which is
temporary. As time goes on some certain rneasures are taken. It will be as it was before.
That's reversible. It doesn't cl-ange the usage of land. Sometimes the influence is serious
though it is temporary. So cautions must be taken. If not. it would make greater loss to the
environment. See table 4-2-1, the cubic metre of earth and stone.

land: uses 19 hectares vegetable field--1. 5 % of the total.
The farming land to the east of Hutubi is less than that to the west for each. So the pro-
ject influence upon agricultural prodution is greater to the east section of Flutubi. Neverther-
less. owing to the larger farrning land for each in Xinjiang, the influence will be smaller.
T'he seized 118. 3 hectares grassiand and the decreased amount of feeding cattles-- about

section is 800-1000 metres above sea level and its relative height is 50-100 metres. Its sur-
face rock is seriously weathered and its terrain is cut great;y. i% great amount of digging,
filling and throwing away ruins the natural soil structure. The surface soil ow  itronger c
pacity against corrosion is a little in the proportion of earth and stcne. Digged and filled
earth with loos.. s:ructure contains little organic matter. So its caDac.ty a'ainst corrosion
turns fe-ble. A.    man -made terrian will grea4ly affect the Ic  of vrace: and earth. In
most cases, the      .de is 1  15 and the high-piled section n.*q    20 metre. or so. Tne
terrain of obta;,   dnd throwing earth is neither flat nor tidy. brid'ts and eltvatecl con-
structions will aiso need filling or digging. Then comes the hidden factors of water ani e-rth
loss.
1) Assessment model of soil erosion
The loss in a project is commnented by American Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)
*.hicn .s proposed according to the exarnination over about 10.000 certain areas for 40 yearr
by American Ministry Water--Earth Keeping Bureau. Below is the formala:
A=R*K*L *S  *C*P
where:
A-quantity of soil erosion per unit area in a certain rainfall period. unit: t/ha.a
R-erosion factor
K-Soil crode-abilitv factor
L-Slope length factor
S-gradient factor
C-covering and management [actor
P-Keeping method factor
Americar. Agricultural Ministry savs the equation is for forecasting the soil erosion per
year under certain conditions, so as to provide basis for soil protection plan. Later, it has
been proved that it can be used in a biggxr construction. e. g. highway and so on.
This report does a further revision to the equation by using the study rneterials of Na-
tional Environmental Protection Bureau. South China Environmental Science Research Insti-
tute.
The section passing Urumqi is located to the west of the city. Because it is lack of de-
tails about amount and hevtness, the rain amount of corrosion once can't be commented.
And it's hard to calculated R factor, so we choose the following experienced formula bv
South China Environmenml Science Research Institute.
R= i 1- 735X  10X5"VVPn
i-l
where: i=month number
Pi =average rain amount per month for years (mm)
P=average rain amount per v-ar for years (mm)
The rainfall reference is from the monitoring referene of 15 years (1976-1990) of U-

2) Assessment res'ilt
OlDynarmic change of soil erosion
Knowt, in USLE- R. K. L. S four factors are the main ones of soil erosion and the im-
portant reasons of soil erosion under construction. Ra;ntime distribution decides the time of
soil erosion. According to the rain reference for years in Urumqi region, rainfall is not bal-
anced in a year. It rains most at the beginning of Summer and at the and of autumn. The
makimum rain is in 5 months: June(42. 5mm). May(31. 9mm),April(33. n1mm), September
(31. 5mm) and October(27.'8mm). The total amrunt in the five months makes up 61.5Y of
che v.iole year amount. Its R Value amounts to 87% of the total R Value in the whole year.
Therefore, the time of soil loss in Urumqi Section basically happens in June, May, April,
September, October. That's the key d5me.
Besides, rainfall greatness affects R Value a lot. The greater it rains in a unit time, the
more ser; s the so;l erosion is. AccordJing to monitoring reference the mraximum daily rain-
fall in Urunqi is 57. 7mm, happening in June. making up 20. 90S% of the average rainfall and
12.8% of R Value in a year. So summer should be the important period for protection.

a)Avoid construction in raiu' season
b)Since the surface eardi contains higher amnount of organic matters and ta:. ri. factor

the process of filling. the surnace earth should be riUed back on the roadbed surface as much
as possible. esp. in high liUld section.
c) LS value affects much to tne erosion amount. Besides reasonable construction and,

There will be one bridge every 3. 94 kilometres long. Bridge construction may result in
river's pollution. Workirng in the seasor. wvithout water can hardly affect rivers, if not. rivers
will be made dirtv owing to the following causes: Building materials by rivers will drop into
the water; the sand and mud on .iver beds will be made to float; drained water with a great
amount of sand may temporarilv increase the sand amount in lower section of the bridge.
The above gridges are contributed in the section- from Toutunhe to Kuitun. 100 of the

the time when water is enough, that's OK. But in Spring when it is drv. engineering and ir-

4. 2. 6 Impact on Eco-environment in Operation Phase
4.2. 6. 1 Impact analysis o! the installations along the line on water environment
The installations are divided into two sides: one is management. the other is service.
There're two management offices and four districts; four service districts. four parking
places.
The waste water from rmanagement installations are mainly waste water in life and a
small amount of noncontinuous drained water for keeping the machinery well. The pollutants
are mainly organic matters consuming oxygen. anion detergent. nitrogen. phosphorus. fats
and petroleumL
Following the numbers of the management staff in Turpan - Urumqi - Dahuangshan
highway, the 3 districts in tJrunqi, Changji. Shihezi. each has 250 people. Urumqi office
has 250. Kuitun offiec has 400 people. There're 1400 staff in all.
Aczording to the state's suggested staodard amount of water used! in 2000 vear: a small
city 70. 90 litres. a middle-scaled citv 100-150 litres. a uiarge-scaled city 140-200 litres
pe.; day for each. And our highwav management installations take the standard of 150 litres
per day for each as a calculation of the waste water in life:
Q=0. 365 A * F
where:Q-Waste water in life (10.0Omn3/year)
A-yearly population (ten thousand)
F-average waste water pg i person (litre/day)
0. 365 -unit conversion coefidcient
Take F as the waste water in life in wonitoring year.
So. the waste water in life in the distn:Xts is:
Q=0. 365 XO. 14X150=7. 665 (ten thousand m3/year)
-67-



The drained water of management finally runs into farming irrigation svstem. If it went
into Toutunhe river (yeariv runoff 2. 35 hundred rnillion ml). the proportion of waste water
and runoff would be onlv 0. 0003. It's clear that the waste water is small, because of the
fewer staff.
Service districts draining is nainly waste water in life and in washing machines. The
wastes contained are mainly organic matters consuming orygen. petroleum and anion svn-
thetic detergent ect. The organic matters consuming oxygen in typical waste water may go to
hundreds of milligrams per litre (BODs 100-300. COD25O-1000). There're not many staff
in service districts. There's much water used in washing machines in the waste water of life.
The organic matters consuming oxygen won't be great, generally, tens of milligrams per
litre. Petroleum mrainly from reRairing, washing nuchines, should be controlled.
4.2. 6.2 Forecast of lead pollution in operation phase

The following uodel of soil pollution is used in accordance with the traffic volume in the
forecasting years:
W=K,K:--K+R,IKK   EX+RzKIK2  -&-K+RE                    (1)
Where: W,-amount of t.e remains of lead in n vears;
K-ratio of the remains of lead year bv year;
R-input value year bv year;

(2)Calculation of soil environment capacity
Soil environment capacity refers to the naximum acceptable citmulant of pollutant in
soil. The following model is used wo calculate soil environment capicity:
Q= (CK-B-CP) XG
Where: Q-soil environment capacity(mg/kg)
CK-standard of soil environment(mg/kg)
B-soil lead background value(mg/kg)
CP-; ead input amount(ng/lkg)
G-weight of one mu topsoil
In comparision with pollution condition of soil lead, the calculation model of soil envi-
ronment capactitv is simplified to be G= (CK-B-CP) X1, that is unit mass soil environ-
ment capacity of lead. Thus. the mnaxiumu capacity of soil lead in forecasting years along Ehe
planning highway is calculated by this model to be in table 4-2-&

(3)Assessment
It can be seen from Tab. 4-2-7 and Tab. 4-2-8 that lead contents in soil along the
roadsides go up with the increase of traffic volume. adverselv. the environment capacities of
soil lead decrease. From 2000 to 2020. except the lead contents in soil of windward side a
long Wugongtai - Shihezi and Shihezi - Kuiu sections are within background range. the
lead contents in soil along the highway go up tO safe level.
On the basis of forecast analysis and analogy ivestigation. the lead pollution in assess-

ment area along both sides of the hiwhway belongs to background or safe level, which has
small effect on environment.
4. 2. 7 Impact on migration of livestocks in operation phase of the highway
The agriculture of the area along U-K alignment plays a leading role while the animal
husbandary takes 3 second place and the output value accounts for less compared with that of
agnculture. for example. it only acco;t-s for 18. 4% and 15. 05Y in Changji and Manas
County. respectivelv. Most of the herdmen are Kazak. The migration of livestock focus in
spring and autumn and amasses in Anjihai-kuitun section. Right now 374 passageways are
designed in U-K highwav. and 3 mdium briges, 14 small briges and 32 passagewaYs were
designed in Shawan's Ajihai to kuitun (5 tkm) setion which can meet the requirement of
transmigration of livestoak.
4. 2.8 Environment impact of Pacling Wo-k for Coal Goaf
The coal goaf locates in the hilly area along Wulapo-Xishan section, section K15+900
-K18+660 to be excat. with length of 2. 74k1m. The altitude difference of dhe hilly area is
60.
The goaf stratum is mainlv compo.sed of mudstone and sandstone of furassic Period.
with slope angle of 70, consisting more than twenty coal rakes with thickness of 0. 7-20m.
With the development of dozens of faults and 8 seismic intensit,v. the complex geclogic struc-
ture has some great effect on the highway construction-
It is suggested cement and fillers being nixed and being filled into goaf holes by way o'
high pressure rough drilling holes in ground to form induration so as to reinforce the ground
and to meeE the stabilitv and load -bearing capacity of the highway project.because: (a)the
filling matterials are 20% Cement and 80%a loess soil and no chemicals except CaCI2 will be
used for quicken Solidifv. (b) the quilitv of gronnd water is not good, the ground water
around the site is not used bv local residents. So after the treaturent. the safety in highwav
project will be ensured. th risk will be reduced, and there won't be adverse impact on envi-
ronment.
The requirements of environment protection. as menticd for other construction sites,
shall be firmlv complied with in the construction of this section. including the dearance of
work site after construction. The safety. measures such as effective lighting installations are
needed in the construction.
4.3 Forecst and Assessm t of Acoustic Environment
4. 3. 1 Forecast of Acoustic Environment in Construction Phase
The consucton of high grade highway with a large scale lasts a long poriod. The noise
of the construction equipments during the construction will obviousil affect the workers on
the spot and the surroundings along the route. The impact of the noise upon environment in
construction is analysed and evaluated according to the standard for labor hygiene and starz-
dard for environment noise of our countrv and in combination with the noise ..f construction

in highway construction of China.

2. Forecasting analysis and assessment of noise
It can be seen from table 6-8 that the mechanical noises daring construction arc much
high. In addition. the accumulation of all kinds of noise such as the noise of earth and stone
tronsport. pneumatic drills and demolitions will make the noise value much brigger and the
noise radiation range larger. According to the sta.idard for environment noise (Tab. 4-3-2
and tandard for labor hygiene, the vmechnical noise will excecd standard and affec: the
wo .;.rs on the spot and the surroundings. The noise measuring results of GuiHuang high-
war construction shows that the noise during construction makes the acoustic environment of
G. zhou Engineering College 130-200 meters far away from operation site increase bv 10-
12dB. see table. 4-3-3. It shows that the disturbance of constructirn noise is serious.

According to acoustic principle. the high cmbankuent, trencb and high flyover crossing
bridge can be considered as a kind of sound-proof protective screen. and an acoustic shadnw
area is fromed neraby, its attenuation can be calculated through path difference and Feinier
number and certain tables See figure 4-3-1.

The a tenuation for noise spread because of the distance and the absorption by cover on
carth surface can be obtained. The area through which the highway will pass is farnland and
deserta. so a C. S within the evaluation range along the whole alignment of the highway.
(The effect of buildings along both sides of higway on the spread of noise.
The buildings along both sides of highway have impeding effect on the spread of noise.
The noise attenuation is calculated by table 4-3-9.

4.3. 2. 5 The forecast of traffic noise of the highway to be built
According to the feasibility study of U-KS highway, the highway is double ways traf-
fic with four lanes. The calculating e. cor is less than idBA Li '-cordence with the foreasting
comparision between the equivalent double ways traffic and the one way traffic by the depart-
ments concerned in our country. AST 386 microcompuer is used in this eva!uation, based or.,
the cross and structure of each secion of the highway to be built. The year limrits of the cval-
uation are 2000, 2010 and 2020. the forecasting of traffic noise has taken in daytime and at
oight '.ur the each section of the highwav tc be built. The calcuiating proccdure is seer, in fir-
gure 4-3-2.
4 3. 3 Acoustic Environment Impact Assessment
4. 3. J. I Analysis of environment impact on the sensitive noise points
The sensitive noise points within the assessment range include towns and citys, vil-
lages, farm teams, enterprises and institutions. ect. According to the investigation of the ar-
eas which the highway a be built will pass, there are 19 sensitive noise points along the
whole alignment. as design speed, of cause, if the actual speed is slower than design speed,
the noise value will be less than forecastuinig value. The acoustic environmental qualities of
the three forecasting years of 2000.2010 and 2020 are shown in table tab:_ 4-3-10-4-3
-12. The traffic noise forecast and evaluation of the highway to be built show that the a-
coustic environment quality within the evaluation range tends to worsen with the inerease of
the traffic volume. The traffic irolume in daytime of Xizhan -Bagang -Changji - Hutubi -
Manas -Shihezi section reaches to 300C an hour which leads to obvious increase of traffic
noise along roadsides; the traffic noise along roadsides of Manas - Shihezi - Kaziwan -
Sha.-van significantly increases as a result of the increase of traffic volume ratio between day-
time and night. The equally acoustic degree lines of 70d3 (A) in daytime and 55dB (A) at
riight aleng the -w.hole alignment in 2010 and 2020 are see in figure 4-3-3 and 4-3-4.

Among nineteen sensitive points of noise in the assessment scop along the whole align-
meat, there will be two.ten and forteen points to be obviously affected by traffic noise in
2000. 2010 and 2020, respectively.
The operation of *U-PK highway will affect the acoustic environmen- within 200m a-
long both sides. The sleep. rest, work and learning of people in some sensitive arear of noise
wAill be affected. These will reveal mairly in the sections where the noise obvicusly exceed
the standard. Effective measurements shall be taken to prevent the noise from effecting
people's normnal life and work.
2. Measurements of noise mitigation
According to the construction pace. increase of traffic volume during operation. effect of
noise which exceeds the standard during operation, feasibility of mitigating noise. invest-
ment of envirorunental protection and economnic profit. the following measurements of noise
mirtigation are zeconmnended which can be taken by stages and progresively.
() In order to avoid the alignment. from cutting through much more sensitive noise
points which resu,, in significant noise impact on sensitive points. difficult mitigation mea-
sures and increasing cost of treatment. propose the desinger to adjust and revise the align-
ment in the final design to avoide sensitive points as much as possible in accordance with the
condition of designing parameters and technic index. The scale of adjustment can consult the
line of equallv acoustic degree shown in figure 4-3-3 and 4-3-4, that is , the distance
between sensitive points and roadside should be above the line of 70dB(A) in davtime and
55dB(A) at night.
(2)According to the assessment two sensitive points. Changfeng Sidui and Yuanhucun
Yidui. will be obviously affected by traffic noise in 2000. "Measures for environment protec-
tion and constouction project shall be spontaneous in design. corstuction and operation" . as
our environment protection policy demands, the measures for the two points will be taken as
follows:

mitigation measures.
(6)Strengthen the environment management along the highway. Because the traftic
noise is significant at night, driver should reduce automobile noise as much as possible dur-
ing 23  00-9: 00 at night.
4.4 Forecast and Assessmaet of Atmospheric Environnent Quality
The impact of the project such as dust and asr.halt smoke in construction ph-se and tail
gas of automobile in operation phase on sensitive points is emphasized.
4.4.1 Ibmpact on Atmospheric Environment in Construction Phese.
(D)Analysis of dust impact during construction period
The dust impact from digging, filling and carrying of earthwork on sensitive paints a-
long U-K alignment will be qualitatively analyzed.
(j There are 5 residential areas along Kooo-Ko29 section, of which the residential :.:
near Xlzhan grade sepe:ation will be resettled. This secticn is Mainly in mountain areu  dc
large quantity of diggging and filling but small quantity of carrving which will cause t: r  avy
dust. meanwhile, the carrying of buildinjy materials by way of makeshift road will ca :  con-
siderable dust which will affect two resident areas with population of over 2,000, located in
K24+100 and K27 section.

©The main alignment of K029-K265 section. from Xizhan-IKuitun. passes through
three cities and three counties. the terrian in this region is some smooth and open. The resi-
dent areas along this alignnent are small villages of less population because the alignemtn
has been avoided denselv populated citie and towvns in design phase. Gathered earthwork bv
bulldozers and scrapers for the roadbed construction vvill cause unheavv dust which has little
impact on residents. The transport of building materials bv way of makeshift road and un-
loading of earthwork will cause much dust which has comparatively great impact on resident
areas especially in Sanpin Farm. Liangzhoufiu. southern suburb of Shihezi and Gongvishi
Batuan. ect.
®The connective highway between Shangshahe and Westem Railway Station of Urumqi
(Xizhan) is the first grade one. 17km in length. located in agricultural area oF northern sub-
urb of Urunqi. The earthwork lor roadbed consteuction mainly depends on carrying by way
of makeshif road which will cause heavier dust and affect the residents of Henan Village and
Xiao Diwopu.
(2)The analvsis of the atnospheric environment impact caused bv asphalt mixture.
The big problem in the highwav construction is the air effect produced by the bituri-
nous concrete nixture. But till now. the standard for the asphalt smoke and benzopyreen on
air quality hasn't been formulated. Here only put forward some suggesition persuant to the
present domestic asphalt mixer and ts monitoring situation to supply some references to the
highway construction and mnanagement. At present. the major asphalt mixers at home are
LZNHOFBM 90 mnixer made in C-errnany. Singapore- with 80-IOOT/h output and fall con-
fined and second dedusting installation; V/3-5 asphalt mnixer made in Gerrmanv with multi
dedusting installation; MAZL complete equipment made in Italy with 160T/h production a-
bil-tv.
At present, the asphalt mixed being used in Xiniiang are the Xinxeteiguang/60 mixer
made in Japan with the abilitv 6OTr-; L30 mnixer made in the Hongqi Machenical Plant with
power 30T/h; L20 mixer with power 20T/h rade in Zhenjiang Mine Machenical Plant. The
mnixers use vapour and heat to melt. After gravels are mixed. dedusting installation is sup-
plied. So the asphalc smoke consitencv is comparatively less.
According to the GB4916-85 industrial pollutant asphalz emission standard: the first
grade is 150mg/m3 asphalt smoke (the pecanitted emission consi%tencv is eight hours); the
second grade is 200mg/m'asphalt smoke. (3)Measures

4. i. 2 Forecast and assessment of atmospheric environmet.t impact in operation phase
The designed operation period of U-K highway is 20 years. The forecasting year of
this assessment is 2000. 2010 and 2020.
1. Selection of items
(1)Selection of assessment factors
The main pollution source during the operation period of high grade highway is the e-
mission of vehiele's waste gas, wlhose main compositions are: CO. NOx, C.H.. Pb. and a
little amount of SO2 and raised dust. We select three items for forecasting and evaluation:
CO. NOx, and C.H..
(2)Forecast of pollution source
Because of the high grade highway. vehicle's flow is large. speed is high, so we can
suppose the waste gas emission source is a successive line source, whose intensity oniv reiate
to the emission of single vehicle and the flow of vehicle
On basis of OD resuIts and forecast of trffic volume ?rovided in the feasibilitv study re-
port - tie traffic volume mainlv distributes at 07: 00-23 : 00(Beijing time' in a day ,and
less traffic flow at night. So the forecast and assessment of pollution source and atmospheric
-88-



pollution condition in daytime will be emphasized.
The pollutant emission of single automobile ol various tvpe is referring the standard
(($1164 -89). and combine with the condiation of automobile running and environmental
tempteracure to determine. the traffic volumes provided in the feasibilitv study of the high-
way. the amount of pollutant's emission of each section in forecasting years can be obtained
bv the following formular:
Q,=  lN.E,/3600)
_-I
Where: WL -the amount of pollutant's emission on a certain road(mg/m. s)
N,-the flow of automobile type i (number/hour)
E -the emission amount of automobile type i at designed driving speed
m-the number of tvypes
By calculating, the emission of three items of pollutants of each section in forecasting
years of peak hour '-'jme- davtime normal volume and average volume are seen in table 4-
4-1.4-4-2 and table 4-4-3.
the probability of peak Volume is 4. 2%. the automobile volume in 7 : 00 to 23  00 is
daytime volume. the probabilitv of the Volume is larger than davtime Vclume. is about
404.

(3) Forecasting mode and parameter emending
()Forecasting mode
This evalution use line source diffusing mode to forecast the influence of vehicle's waste
gas upon air circumstance.

f    I                   (Z.JLH),        (Z-H-
f= lexrO'-V)(exp[-  2-;   ]+extp[    2i 
C-forecasted diffusing density of air(mg/nm')
QL -line source intensity (mg/m. s)
U-local average wind speed(in/s)
ac,-horizontal diffusing parameter in the directuon perpendicular to wind direction.
a. -vertical diffusing parameter
H-effective source height
Line source diffusing calculation relates to wind direction. this evaluation calculates the
density in three cases: wind direction is perpendicular to the road. wind direction is parallel
to the road. wind direction and the road intersect at any angle:
A: W-nd directions is perpendiuler to the roaca:
C(_X IG. 0)=F-ZK x v; CFZN
X is the distance between the calculated spot and road centre:
B: Wind direction is parallel to the road:
^(Y.0,O)= =1       Q
Y-the distance between the calculated spot and the road centre:
C: Wind direction and the road intersect at anv angle during the period when wind direc-
tion change from parallel to perpendicular, densitv changes drably. so we can estimate the
densitv when the two intersect at anv angle bv the simple interpolatior.. if the included angle
is V(t<9O). then:
C(4S) sin 4>(vertical).cos IC(parallel)
@ Diffusing parameter emending
Diffusing parameters are determninated according to the method recommended bv
GB13201 - 91and assessed according to the underlving surface of rural open terrain.
Vehicle's emission on the road is not ideal line source. because when vehicle is running on
the road at a high speed. the air will be disturbed_and make waste gas form a primarv mixed
width and height. In order to make the densitv calculation more accurate. we make a norni-
nal source emending refer to the road width. add a primarv value a. to a,(X) in calculation
rnode and get:a,(X) =a,o+rzXz
(4)Forecast of pollutant densitv
-96-



Because of the Vairetv of the main wind direction alorg the alignment, pollutant densitv
ia daav ties in three cases is estiniarted. wine direction is vertical to the alignment . wind di-
rection is paallel to the alignment. wind direction and alignuent intesect at 45' angle. the
three probability is 9%. 10% and 25% respectivi:y. The neutralitv (D) of atmcstheric sta-
bilitv which is frequent in daytime is Choosen. The forecasting range is the area within 500m
from each side of the highwa . the stability (E) of atmospheric stabilitv which is frequent in
nighttime to sensiutve point is choosen.
(j:The concentration of NOx. CO. TCI at one time in daytime of normal volume.
The concentration of CO and TCH a. one time along all section in three forecasting years
do not exceed the standand. the maximum concentrations at one time in the area of 20m a-
long Bagang-Chang Section, When w;nd dcrection is vertical to the lighway. The concen-
tration of 00 is nl. 215mg/mn'. TCH is 0. 058ng/mr in 2000; CO will be 0. 386mg/m'. TCH
will be 0. 107mg/m' in 2010; to 2020. CO is 0. 617mg/mr and TCH is 0. 170mg/m'.
The concentration of NOx of somne section in three forecasting years exceed the stevn-
dard in varying degres at daytime volume. the calculation result can been seen in table 4-4
-5. It can he seen. in 2000 the concentration of NOx is exceed standard only in Bagang-
Changji section. the range of exceed standard is within 25m. the orther stction is not exceed
standard; in 2010. the concentration of NOx in 10 Sections is exceed standard. the maximum
coacentration is 0. 302mg/m' within 20m at Bagang-Changli section. the maximum ronge of
exceed standard is 80m - in 2020. the concentration of NOx in 14 sections is exceed standard.
Bagang-Changji Section the concentration of NOx is 0- 507ng/rn'. the maximum range of
exceeding standard is 160m. when wind direction vertical to the highway. The probabilitv of
exceeding standard is less than 9%. The range of  ag standard of one-time coucentra-
tion.whin wind direction parallel to the highway.    to 70m.
©Environmnental impact forecast in peak hour volre
The peak hour volume refer to maxmumn traffic volume in dav (24 hours)in service phase .or
period of maxrnum tail -gas exhausing volume. Its pollutin concentration is concentration of
mnost serious pollution along both sides the road. There is the peak hour volume at 11 -19 in
day. In this time .the nost bad pollution meteoualogical condition does not present forecast
calculatation are made as medium stability degree. (D)
a. One time concentration forecast
The concentration at one time in peak hour volume can be seen in table 4-4-6. It can be
seen from the table. tLhe maximum concentration of CO and TCH in 2000. 2010and 2020 along
both sides of the highway do not exceed the standard. Taking Bangang-Changji -Section-
the most serious pollution section .as example Maximum impact concentration of two kind of
pollutants along sides of the highway CO 0. 44lng/m'.THC 0. 120mg/m' in 2000;CO n.
788mg/m'.THC 0. 220mg/m3.in 2010;CO1. 259mg/mn'.THC 0. 362mg/-n' in 2020
The concentration of N;Ox is largest at peak hour volume. concentration and its extent in rar-

It can be obtained by adding the nuximum ccncentraton at peak hour volume and the con-
centratior. of the status quo of the resident areas T he probability is verv small. Addcording
to pollution meteorological condition and location of resident area.the probabilitv emefging
the concentration of exeeding standard at all resident areas will be under 0. 5% . most part of
it is under 0. 2Y:

-C;Forecast of atmospheric pollution in resident areas along the alignment
The purpose of the  orecast mentioned before is for the resident areas along the
alignemtn. the objective of environment protection in this assessment. It is necessarv for
putting forward the rationalizaL-on measurements for the atmospheric environmental protec-
tion.
The forcast of atmospheric pollutant! concentrations and the contriburion ratios of tail
gas pollution from automobile in operation pnl= _      atmospheric polltuion in resident areas a-
lonsg the alignernnt can be obtained uy adding the forecasting concentrations of highway sec-
tiolns and the concentrations of the status quo oi the resident areas. The forecast results of
the resident areas are seen in table 4-4-8-4-4-10.
It can be seen from result that. TCH and CO efiect on residential area is slight but NOx
impact is obriously . becaute of the background of NOx is low. so th contribution rotio of ve-
hicle gas to atmosphare of residential area is larger. it mnake the value of NOx concentration
to much higher than background. the concentration of Sanpin liudui and Yuanhucun is ex-
ceed standard in 2020. the majoritv residential area is near the standar.
4.5 Aznysis of Impact on landscape Environment
The U-K highway will be the highway of the [on est in length. and the highest class in
X'njiang in recent years to come. The landscape of the hg-h grade highway reflects the su-
nerb skill of designer which can giv-e the tisitors a favoible impression. The region which
-8 v-



the U-K highvray will "a&s through is the typical man-vade oasis. Cities. twons and vil-
lages are linked by the highway. which can give people a pastroal picture of the northez..
scenery. In a driving autonobile on the highway. imagining the barren :and in the past turn-
ing into the beautiful field today and the hardships of cultivators in those years. you can feel
the unique charm of humane Landscape. The harmony berv een the alignment and the natural
landform and terrain. in addition to the i zposing grade seperations and large bridges, the
dirversity of humane landscape can also be increased.
4.6 Lnd Qccopation and Resettlement
4.6.1 The total land occupation of U-K highway is 1310ha. among which che occupa-
tion of each kind of land is seen in table 4-6-1.
Tab. 4-6-1     Land occupation of U-K highway    unit: ha
range   cropland  vegetable plot    grassland    orchard [woodland   others
118.3    754.6         754.6          F. 27        9.06   116.8         318
The land resource along the alignment is abundan. the land occupation of the highway
onlv accouts for a small proportion. and suitable compensation for land occupation -ill be
fulfilled. The requisition of land is nor difficult because no special land such ds mosqurs and
graveyards of minority nationalitv is occupied.
4. 6. 2 There are fourtv places involved in removal in the assessment scope. among
them, a small amount of places are removed resulted from being cut across by the highway.
The conditions of all kinds of buildinds involve in removal are 1670 rooms and 33185.
Zm  in all, the people affected involve in resettlement are 1280 persons.
The impact of U-K highway on the involuntary resettlement is slight because the resi-
dents are relatively scattered result frowm vast territory of Xinjiang. Besides. the population
pressure and the pressure of cultivated land are not high in the immigrated area because of
srnall scale of resettlement.
4.6. 3 Resetdement
The plan of land requisition and resettlement is worked out bv department concemed.
required as follows:
(DDraw up thie detailed schedule of resettlemenr . ensure the resettlement is done before
the construction of the highway.
(2)The resettlement is done after the agreemert of migrants on their reseatled place.
(3)Ensure the living standard of migrants after resettlement not to be below that before
resettlement.
(4)The prioritv of obtaining emplovment and rraining for the residents affected should

be tanken into accc unt reasonably.
4. 7 Ipact of this Project on Presens Traffic in Constructon Phase
4. 7. 1 Main Impact Factors
4. 7. 1. 1 A great quanti-v of building -road materials will be carried through present
road. It will lead to -ncrease volume of traffic and jam on the old r3ad.
4. 7. 1. Z Planning toad vill intersect with present r6ad. in some section. particularly
large interchange project. It will lead to hindrance of road and jam of traffic in section durirg
construction.
4. 7. 2 Tr.xnsport and Site of Building-Road Materials
. 7. 2. 1 Cubic metre of earth
The greater part ol section are fill section, except section through the territery of U-
rumqi City. The most part of cubic metre of earth obtain fromn the borrowing site from far
awav the highway (Wuxi railway station-the west of Shawan and Wuxi railwav station-
Shangshahe) and the borrowing pots in roadsites (the west of Shawan-Kuitun).
4. 7. 2. 2 Stone
Except Wulapo-Xishan section. the carrving distance of the greater part of section are
far away the highway. sites of stone materials are distributed in Tianshan Mountains. The
most fast distance is up to 48-73. lkm (Weatern railway station of Uruanqi-Shihezi). Main
stone sites.are Wulapo (Jianquangou Dongshan), Xlsha.--Urumqi (Xishan highway), Nan-
shan of Shibezi (Kaziwan-43 Tuan highway) .Nanshan of Kuitun (Bavinggou).
4. 7. 2. 3 Gravel
Gravels that use in roadsurface are drawn from local gully. gobi and flood land along the
highwav. which can be extracted in all seasons.
4. 7. 2. 4 Water in irrigation canal are used [or construction besides little dumpping from
river and well.
4. 7. 2. 5 Others
Steels. timber and cement are suppplied mainly from Urunqi. Geaeral asphalt are sup-
plied from Kelamnavi. Diesel oil and gasoline are supplied from Urunqi and Dusbanzi. Its car-
rying distances are from 27 to 155km.
4. 7. 3 Quantity of Building-Road Materials and its Traffic Effects in Various Section
Quantitv of building-road materials and is traffic flow(vehicles/day) in various section
during construction see table 4-7-1. in which:
2(guantities of materials/carrying capacity of truck)
Traffic flow-           carrying times of material
For the carrving capacitv of truck. it counts for 4m3 or t. the carrying time of No. 1 is
900 davs. No. 2-8 is 300 days and No. 9-11 is 600days. Quantity of earth is m3nlokmn in
all section.
ludged by type of carraing materials. freight volume of earth and stone is overwhelming

najority. counts for 87-95%. Take Wulapo-Xishan section as example. the traffic flow
caused bv carrying earth and stone are 397. 39. counts for 92. 25 Yo . other materials is 30. 77.
counts for 7. 15 %. In Xizhan-Shihezi section. earth and stone is 3959. 10. 87. 57%. other
is 492. 0, 12. 43%. Thus. traffic impact during carrying earth and stone would be mainly
considered.
judged by highwav grade of various section. the freight volume in expresswav section is
more thar. grade I section. Take earth with far-carrying as example. in Xizhan -Shihezi
section belonging to expresswav is 636. 34. in Shihezi--Kuitun section is 511. 27; In Wulapo
-Xishan section belonging to grade I is 228.16. Thus. traffic impact in expressway section
wo 'd be emphatically considered.
'To sum up. suppose all materials are carried at the sanme time. The increased total flow
is 397. 39 in Wulapo-Xishan section. Xishan-Xizhan section is 819. 00. Xizhan-Shihezi is
3959. 10, Shihezi-Kiiitun is 3190. 70, Shangshahe-Xizhan is 1123. 54. In expresswav sec-
tion. the increased flow in Xizhan-Shihezi section is higher. In grade I. that in Shangshahe
section is higher. tney are 10%-30% more than the present traffic flow.   -
It must be paid attention to that the traffic flow increased by carrving materials in vari-
ous section is total sum at every part in this section. For some point in this section. its flow
is far inferior to this numerial value. Onlv a few vehicles pass through all this section. be-
cause that the carrying distance is differ for each mnaterials.

There are 420 forks along whole planning highway. the most proporion of which is
tractor way and paverment which a little effect on traffic. The interchange's crossing with
the higher grade highway at present which nore effect on present traffic. will be cosidered
emphaticallv, see table 4-7-3.
Consructing these forks project. particularly interchange, the special traffic safety staff
umst be provided. and traffic sign must be installed, in order to trafi{c safetv and unblocked.
such as forks of Xiaodiwopu. Wugongtai. the west of Shawan. Anningqu. Bagang. Hutubi

4. 7 5 Measures
1 As far as possible local material are used, forbiding long-distance-transpont. espe-
cialv, in carrting earth and stone- Of course, appropriate centralized excavation cannot be
ruled outt, for the purpose of enrironmental protection.
2. Having consulted with coinmunications and public security department. contractor
would direct specially traffic in construction period. Particularly, in these secrion such as Xi-
aodiwopu. Wugongtai. the west of Shawan. Anningqu. Bagang, Huubi. Manasi Road of
Kuimtn ec  traffic post would be suengthend or set up. Under special circumstances. in
these forks and otber forks, traffic safty staff would be sent or augmented. to disperse peo-
ple and motors in these sections.
3. In construction phase of these forks. the traffic sign must be installed and the traffic
safety staff must be provided. Makeshife road of constucjn would be remained,- in order to
motor's passing through.
4 Large quantities of concentrated transport would be away from   ansport peak in pre-

sent road. as far as possible in earlv morning or at night.
S. Makeshift road of construction would used to the full. so as to mitigate effects on
traffic.
6. Makeshift road would be constnrcted in land which hardlv was used for agriculture.
Farmland. grassland and woodland can not be occupied.

Because of the temporal road have feLlow good point:
(I)Temporal road take up the farmland. grassland as few as possible.
(Z)Temporal road is far awav frow residental area (at least 200m).
(3)Temporal road dosen's pass through the sensitive point, So, the temporal road im-
pact is vary smalL the dust and noise impact is vary slight.
4. 9 Risk Analysis
Risk analvsis is directed against anv kinds of potential harms of U-K highway project
to human health and envtronment during construction and operation period .and to pu: for-
ward preventive measures against risk. It includes the followings:
4- 9. 1 Constructi- Phase
1. In view of high grade- strict qualitv requirenment. much manv specific items and bad
conditions in construction. it is suggested that the owner select the contractor by wav of in-
ternational competitive bidding who is able to complete the project both beneficially and em-i-
- 104-



ronmentally. Rules for ve:sting quality are required in the whole construction period.
2. Land requisition and resecdement shall be done suitablv in accortdance with policy con-
cerned and agreement reached ini public involvrnent so as to avoid social problem:s and inter-
fering with construction process.
3. Dangerous dnving conditicns may be formed because of crowed vehicle and seriously

isting roads are used for transportation of construction materials. adequate actions to direct
traffic shall be taken when roads are jammed. Efficient lighting equipmentts and safetv siags
shall be n:stalled on temnporary roads to get rid of accidents.
4. Blasting work is dangerous to constuction workers and residents nearby. The work
amasses %in the Yamalik mountainous section. 2km in length. Blasting time, signals and
guarding tines shall be stipulated. People. livestock and vehicles in dangerous areas shall be
excavated before blasting. Management and usage if blasting materials shall strictly follow
safty requirements of public safetv der irtment. Besides. the area where this section located.
belongs to stratum of coal measures. some places have been mined and most of them have
sunk to form pits which were only filled by loose marerials. The dangerous areas shall be de-
termnined before construction to avoid danger to construction workers and equipments.
5. Education and management of job -safety shall be strengthened. safetv regulations
concerned shall be strictlv obeyed in the section where accidents are probably occur. Con-
struction workers and equipments shall be strictly prohibited in the easilv sunk areas deter-
mnined where Yamalik section located. Work of removing high -tension lines in thunder and
lightning shall be forbidden. Education of hygiene. prophylaxis and treatment of disease of
construction workers shall be strengthened to avoid disease spreading or infecting between
workers and local people.
6. The great quantitv of unlocal construction workers may cause adverse impact on envi-

these sections. rioropriatvw> protective nreasures shall be taken to avoid unnecessary loss.
8. Constrw-tioz. of grade seperations in eight intersections berween railway and U - K
highwy (induding Snangshahe -Xizhan connective line) shall be oordinated by railway dc-
parmnent concerned to avoid disturbance or danger to normal Oper . iL: 'f railway.
4. e. 2 Operation phase
The risk in operation phase is directed against traffic accidents e   -aking of dangeron
rnaterials which are harmful directly or indirectly to people and envirc ..meat. Because U - - K
high grade highway has the advantages such as perfect facilities, wide field of vision, less
winding course. reducing the effect of accumulated snow. avoidance of mixed transport and
avoidance of disturbance caused by crossing of people . livestock and vehicles, the traffic acci-
dents will be lower in comparisie3n with the F.:-sent highway. Accorca: - to foreign mraterials,
tbe craflic accident ratio of high glade highway is 25 per cent of t-.,t  ordinary highway
*vith one way traffic of double lanes. The operation references of ten expressway put in use
. CE na indicate that the traffic accidents -re obviously lower than those of their fonr.n.
ev,n ii the driving speed is nigher and the =:aaic volume4 are larger. In the operation. period
frorn July 1974 to October 1980 of Zhougshan Expressway in Taiwvan, tne traffic accident ra-
tio is nnlv 0. 14/1' O vehicles. km. the analysis of traffic accident causes indicates that. among
all traffic ic'idents. insufficient distance between two neighboring vehicles accounts for 28.
95. imrr:roper change of vehicle lames accounits for 23. 6%. tire bursting accounts foi 14.
A  , .rnechanical failure accounts for & 2% . furiou s driving accounts for 6. 4   , fatigue driving
accounrs for 3. SYa. driving when runk accounts for 1. 7% ,improper loading accounts for 1.
6 % and others accounts for 11. 4%. It shows that the accidents cLused by violation of traffic
regutations and poor conditions cf vehiclz account for gre; -er part of total accidents. As ref-
erence. because the technic'ue stanaIrds and safetv facilities of U-K highway are guaran-
teed. the traffic accidents oi U-K highway can be rduced by means of offective mesures
such as managerten: of vehicles and traffic sa{etv. improvement of technique quality of driver
and strengthening education of sale and civilized driv.ng. The probability of suddent acci-
dents such as leaking of dangero3is anc' po-onous mater;als is small, but the importance must
be attached, because the har.rfulness is mrc:- serious orce this kind If accident occurs.
Poentialy dangerous materials transported include corrosive mterials (e. g. acid and al-
kali) , active materials (e. g strong acid and alkali) and poisonous materials (e. g. heavy
metals . agricultural chemicals . solvent and petroleum-base fuel), ect. These mteri-ls can

oil) accounts for 21. 7%. mineral builciing materials:account for 5. 95%. cement accounts for
3. 73%. chemical fertilizer and agricultural chemicais account for 3. 58%. nonmetallic mine
accounts for 1. 77% and metallic mine accounts f4  0. 94%a. The environmren and human
health may be harmed once the accident of transporting these materials happens. In vi-w of
agriculture and animal husbandry area makes up 70 percent of the region where U-K high-
way passing through. the accident mainly harm the agricultural eco - system. Petroleum
transportation in this region constitutes a bigger proportion, tdi freight volume of petroleum
among Urunqi. Changji. Hutubi. Manas, Shihezi, Shawan, Kuitun. IK;amay and Dushanzi
constitutes 85. 56 percent of total freight Volume of petroleum. and the freight volume of
petroleum on the new highway vill increase with the development of petroleum industry in
Xinjiang. In the transportation of poisonous chemicals, agricultural chemicals constitute a
certain proportuon, they are divided into six types: insecticide miticide. germicide. nemato-
cide, herbicid and raticide. Their toxicity can be classified into four level: particular. severe.
heavy and medium on the basis of toxic effect on higher animal.
The major cause for the traffic accident o! the present highway in winter is the accumu-
lated snowv on road surface. Adequate measures such as limiting driving speed shall be taken
to avoid accident before the clearance of snow on road surface. The bad fog is another major
cause for the traffic accident in winter. measures such as close of the highwav during bad
fogs shall be taken.
In order to limnit the scope and extent of harmful accident and mitigate the loss and
harmfulness. the following measures shall be taken:
(D)Set up a contingency command organization of U-K highway.
The organization shall be constituted by leader from adninistrative deparun"nt of U-K
highway and leaders from subordinate offices of fire -fighting, envircr.nent protectior and
safety, which is in charge of working out contingency plan. organizing contingencv team and
inspecting hidden dangers of major accident.
(2)Work out contingency plan
The plan shall indude the duty and task of the organization. alternatives of contingencv
techniques and treatment procedure. disposition and distribution of equipments guarantee
and deployment of manpower and material resouces and monitonng of accident develop-
ments.
(3)Disposition of contingency equipments
Small-sized equipments for contingeny treatmen -f various accidents such as clearing
and retrieving equipments shall be provided.

5 Analysis of
Partial Alternatives
5.1 Comparation Principles of the line Plans
(-)According to the project features; the natural conditions and farming, forest ar-
rangement in Xinpiang. thinking about in invironament protection, how to choose the line. the,
principles are below:
(D)Main lines of national highway should be in smooth, fast principle. short distance.
cutting construction investment, and transportation cost.
(2)Try to avoid the areas of bad 'onditions in engineering geologv and hvdrologic geolo-
gy.
(3)Try occupy farming land as little as possible. Keep clear of farming and forest field.
If vou have to do so, occupy the lower-class in stead of highet -class land or grassland.
(4)Try to keep av--s from dense population. schools. hospitals ect. Try to match the
plans of towns and -t-es. That's near but not into, away but not far, convenienf but not dis-
turbing.
(5)Try avoid or go arouned relics. historic site ect. for example. historic graves, becon
towers.
(6)Make a good deal vith the relaticnship of various important insrdllations present and
drafting avoiding the disturb :ne another e. g. railway. high -tension network, petroleum
pipeline, underground cable. large scale enterprises and mtlilitary installations.
(7;Try not to occupy some special land. e.g. minorities graveyard. mosque etc.
(8)Try to cut irragation network along as little as possible.
(9)Try follow the direct motion of the leading wind.
(IO)Try to more fewer inhabitanis and the like.
5. 2 Axalysis on Each Atlerntives
1 L Urunmi transit plan of U-K highway: The begining of U-K  highway located at
WulaPo. the southern suburb of Uruznqi is link2d with the draft highway of Turpan-U-
runqi -Dahuangsban. Here are two plans while passing Urumqi:
(DINew transit plan: Th begining is at WrliaPo. connected with the south section of T
-U-D highway. It goes to the northwest. passing Cangfanggou highway at the west of Er-
shidian maintenance squad. lThen . to the north througl the place 2 kilometres awav from the
west of Yamalike mountain. crosses Xishan highway. Continuouslv. to the north. crosses
over the railway of morth station. Then. to the west , over Xlzhan railway, it goes to the
-108-



north of west station of Urumqi. linked with the joint line of Shangshahe-Xizhan. The new
transit line is 29 kilorctmes long.
(2)Cbange and make use of the prcsent transit line: The preseni transit line is from
Wulapo. cement plant. South station, the mouth of Hongshan. Jiujiawan. to timber mill.
23 kilometres long.
Compared with the present transit. line the new uransit plan can avoid the distrubance
between national main line and citV traffic. The line's direction is smooth and quick with less
pulling and moving. In the prinicile. 'Near but not into the citv', the new line can not onlv
make a good use of the present highway but also play an acuve part in the nmarching of U-
rumqi. It's of little environxnent pollution. mwall amount of inhabitants nuxion. So the new
cransit line is recommended.
2. The south north plans from Xizhan -Wugongtai
(D)The south plan: It starts from the intersect of Xizhan, along the south of Sanping
open district. through to place 2km away from the south of Sanping farm. niver the place
8km away irom the south to Changji. It goes west over Shanr r-he river and goes northwest
along the place lkm away from the north of Kelamavi -Urumqi petroleum pipeline to the
place 4 5km away from the south of Hutubi county and runs side by side with Changji -
Hutubi second-class special highway to Urumqi. The whole length is 62. 675 Kilornetres.
(2)The north plan: it's at the northern side of U-Chang first-class highwav. begin-
ing with Urumqi airport. connecting with the joint line of Shangshahe-Xizhan-
It goes west through Urumqi social welfare. May Day farm. over Toutunhe river near
Liugong village, through the place about one kilometre away from the north of Changji citv.
continously to Yushugou village, crosses ove the Chang-Hu second-di'ss special highway
and goes side by side with it. The highway will be set up by stages. It goes Wugongtai.
linked with the south plan. The length is 64. 689 Kilometres.
Compared with tle north, the south plan has the following good points:
a. The inhabitants is relatively scattered. In the north areas it is dense in population a..
-ne resettlement work is greater because it goes through Urumqi social welfare. mental hos-
pital
B. There's less noise and fewer atmosphere-sensitive places. Not hasing specially pro-
tected areas and many populations, the construction wvill cause smaller loss of environrment
with less investment for protection.
C. Smooth quick line. reasonable direction. good geology conditions.
d. The line arrangement matches that of towns and cities along the line.
e. Be convenient with little dust. The line is basicallv to the south of towns and cties a-
long the line, in the range of flood before mountains. It has good geology conditions. Cubic
metres of ea-ch and stones won't affect towns cities. In most sections earth and stone can be
obtained in the right place. So construction dust won't do any harm the people.
The south plan is reconunededc

3. Shihezi Section Plan: Shihezi is one of the biggest controllers along U--K highway.
If the highway passes Shihezi. there're two plans. the south and the north
(l)the South Plan: Passing by Wugongtai the line runs through the place 5km away to
the south of Manasi county. It crosses over the special railway for Manasi electric factorv.
At the south of North Xinjiang railway. it strectches toward northwest over Manasi river.
then to southwest. over the northern railwa,v. to the south about 4km. it goes west along
the railway. It ens at Xinghuo commune of Shihezi. It's 32. 4km long.
(2)the North Plan: Passing by Wugongtai it runs through the place 2. 5km away from
the south of Manasi town. then if stretches toward northwest and crosses over the special
railway for Manasi factory. Urumqi -YiIi highwav and Manasi river. To the north of U-Y
highway and the south of artillery regiment. it goes to the north of Shihezi to the south
west. then over U -Y highway and the railway of North Xinjiang. it joins the south line.
The whole line is 35.95 Kilometres long.
After actural investagation the south plan is superior to the north:
a. The farmxing land used in the south plan is much less than that in north plan. The
land along the south line is lower-class land. with thin cultivated horizon, lower amount of
organic matters and poor soil fertility. And the north is rich in soil with certain scale forest
network of farmning land.
b. There is little work in resettlement. having a small popu!ation. It's also convenient
for constructon.
C. A little dust pollution to Shihezi. Carrying the large amount of earth stone cubic will
inerease th pollution of dust noise if the north line plan is accepted.
d. The south project with good geology, is convenient for carrving bilding materials.
Most sections can do it at the very site.
So. the south plan is reconmmend.

6.2.3 Noise Forecasting Results of marious feeders
6. 2. 3.1 Xishan feeder highway *
The nise forecasting results at different disunces away from roadsides in service phase
in various forecasting years see mble 6-2-6.
In day. mean yariv values in various forecasting years will be not exceed the standard
of 70 dB(A). At night this values exceed the standard in various years and its range is within
lOm away from roadsides in 2000; within 20m in 2010; within 25m in 2020.
6. 2.3.2 Changji feeder highway
This forecosting results see table 6-2-6. In day, there will do not exceed the stadard
of 70 dB(A) in 2000 and 2010; there will emceed the standard and its range is within 13m
away from roadsides in 2020. At night, this forecosting values exceed the standard and its
range is within 7r away from roadsides in 2000; within 12m in 2010; with in 25m in 2020.
6. 3. 3 Manasi feeder highway
This forecasting results see table 6-2-6. Its values will do not exceed tde environmen-
tal stardard of 70 dB(A) in dav and 55 dB(A) at night in various years.
6.2.3.4 Shihezi feeder highway
Its forecasting results see table 6-2-6. In da,v its values do not exceed the standard in
2000 and 2010; its values exceed the standad in 2020 and its range is within about 7m away
from roadsides. At night. its values will exceed the standard anD its range is within about
7m in 2000; writhin about 27m in 2010; within abouE 40m in 2020.
6.2.4 MItigation measures
It is s;ested that use of land in sides of the road be controlled strictlv. Except for the
land for commerce- the noise -senstive buildings will be allowed to set up (eg. hospital.
school. residenral area ect. ) witiin 30m awav from roadsides along Xishan. Changii and
Manasi feeder (within 5Om along Shihezi feeder). with regard for the growth of naffic flow
in-future
At present . arta along Xisbha feeder highway have come to streeaziuton ted As max-
imum exceeding value of noise-senstive buildings is 5. 0 dB(A) in addition . buildings struc-
ture is double window and door in Urumqi and its soud insulation volume is about 10. 0 dB.
for exsisting buildings awav from roadsides. the effect of noise on it is little. Along otber

6. 3. 2 Forecasting results of pollutant concentration under peak hour traffic volume
Under peak hour craffic volume, the forecasting results of air environmental impacts see
table 6-3-4. The results show that in 2000. concentration of three pollutaLnts in tail gas do
not exceed the standrid in 4 feeder highwavs. In 2010. onlv NOx concentration exceed the
standard within ZOm awav from roadsides in Xisban feeder. when wind direction is vetical to
the lMighwmy and its maximum one-time values is 0. 177 mg/3. There are not exceeding
values in other feeder highwavs. In 2020. concentration of CO and THC do not exceed the
standard in 4 feeder highways. NOx concentration exceed the standard in Xinshan .and Shi-
hezi feeder highways, its uxiumu concentration values of 20m is 0. 246. and 0. 177mg/m3
and its range exceeding stndard is 60n and 40 n. respectively.
6. 3. 3 Forecasing results of pollutant concentration under general day traffic volume
Its results see table 6-3-5. Under general day traffic volumne, the one-time concen-
tration of three pollutants do not exceed the standard in 4 feeder highways. in 2000. 2010
and 2020. In 2020. or the heavy pollution period. maximum one-time concentration within
20m away frm roadsides: CO is 0. 294mg/m', THC is 0. 061mg/m', NOx is 0. 104mg/mr in
Xishan feeder; CO 0. 088. THC 0. 018. NOx 0. 11J in Changii feeder; CO 0. 017. THC 0.
004. NOx 0. 006 in Manasi feeder; CO 0. 215. THC 0. 044. NOx 0.076 in Shihezi feeder.
6.3.4 Forecastation of impacts on air-sensitive areas
There are no special air-sensitive areas along 4 feeder highways. TIere are some resi-
dental areas. due to these feeders link U-K mam ine with cities and towns passed by the
highvway. In service phase. three pollutants of tail gas will effect on air environment along
feeder highways. There is street of old citv proper along Xisban feeder, where a qualiry of
residental point have been se up . But irs mean daily concentration will not exceed the stan-
dard in 2000. 2010 and 2020. Along Changj feeder. there is a section of street near Changji
city proper, its pollution concenuation will not exceed the standard in different forecasting
vear. Along Manasi and Shihezi feeder, no the centratized resitental areas are sidpersed.

tent along the highway would be polluted hence the health of inhabitants along the highway
would be,harmed.and th. production ,Jiving vmaterudis would suffer losser.
1. 118ha desert grassland and 754ha faruaand will be ocoupied by the project. 283337 trees
will be cut.it means lossing 3 million yuan(RMB).
2. Losses made by pollution on people's health. There are about 24500 people in the evalua-
tion range If the half of people in evaluation range are effected by project.their health will be
done harm on by air poUution and traffic noise due to the project.

imnvestment.
2. Social benefit:U-K highwav project.will bring grant push forward to social economy in
the region along the highway. produce politive factors for to rich and free form agriculture.
that can be play a important role in proveting economic and culture development along the
road egion.After construction .the traffic accident will be reduced.the condition of commuzii-

Chapter 9 Public Involvement of
Environmental Impact Assessment
Public involvement is important to understand bctth the nature and extent of any social
or environmental impact a.nd the acceptability of proposed mnitigatory measure! %praEiculayly
to affected groups and to make thc EIA rep6rt available at some public placc ac'cessible to af-
fected groups for their review and comment.
This process is a valuable wav to impove decision rakirg ,to a~btain feedback on the prepara-
tion of EIA and draft report .and to increase communitv cooperation in impleminting the rec-
ommendations of the EIA.
U - K highwav construction will run across many resident districts .government offices
schools and .ndustrial enterpuises and agricultural units with a vast range and a large popula-
tion . In order to make the prblic invllvement of the puojict estimation represent the
resident's opinion we had a wide public opinion investigation bv visiting.phonc consultafion
and public opinion poll.
9. 1 Chosen pnndple of consulted people
1. The residents within Ikm from both sides of the highway.or the people involve in
working and learning in this range.
2. Choose minoritv natiora!ities(Uygur.Huizr)as much as possible.
3. Choose consulted people in region with out anv inclination of profession .sex.educ-tional
levele and party groupings.
4. Choose Ean.ous people and deputv to the: NPC.
9.2. Consulting items
Let the consulted people fill the consulting forms fredly after they know the various im-
pacts of the highway(ig. land occupation ,noise)on their environment.
1. What and how will the the highwav bring about impacts on vour work.life .entertainment
and societv.
2. What are vour opinion of the highway:Agree desagree or opose?
3. Do vou thind wether or not the highway will result in national discrimination or changing
nation;l life custom?
4. Discussing the effecting of the project with famous people and deputy to the NPC_
9. 3 reaolt:
Two hundred consulting forms were distributed.anong thim ,one hundred and twenty-
six were recieved.The total of person-times consulted and polled is one thousand. among
them 200 person-times bv poUing .200 person-times by telephone consulting and 300 per-

son-times by consulting meeting.discussing 300person-timres . Among the persons. peas-
ants and herdsmen accornt for 42 percent,another 58 percent are woukers and urban inhabi-
tants  The minority nationalities (mialy Uygur ain Kazak) account for 47 persent of the
tatal. the persons of over seriorniddle school eductaed levtl account for 20 percent. As a re-
sult.37 percent considerde that the pronct has corsicdrable effeCEt . their lives.work,learn-
ing and entertainment;41 perLent consiuerde that ti,e pkoiect has snail effect on them; 22
percent considerde that the project has no effect on them..60 percent agree the projict.and
considered that the highway would imprrve tia.. troffic condition and spur the econoszi de-
velopment of their region.and there would be both:ng but advatage; 2S percent considered
that the project has nothing to do with tl64r  at -ere would be neither advantage nor disad-
vantage 15 percent disagree the proe-    sidered that the higkway would damage their
farminand grassland.forest or buildings .    .ange their nounal life st les.among them.14.
8 percent would the project if gorvenment recover thrir damage.and the other 0. 2 percent
had an intransigent attitude and considered that govermnent couldn't recover their damage in
view of their good surrounding s and fa rnland, for example ,the private mznagers of board
and lodhing of Changjii sawan section considered that the changed alignment would reducte
their incomes because of the loss of customers and governrment couldn't fuUy recover their
damages.
9.4 Discussing with famows people nd deputy to the NPCF of this project.
This project is belong to the pubilc capital constrction. One of the main aims is to help
the minouity nationality arcs to make a prosperous econon. to get out of poor and to reach
common prosperous together with other areas.
At present. the nationliyt d:scriminarion is due to econnic and cultruai difference between
nationalities in the world. IEs main causes are ignorant and backward. ln' abiters of different
nationalities along the highway will benefit from the project. After this project is completec,
it will promote the econmioic and cultural development in areas along the highway ,and even
whole Xinjing .northwesv China. The minority nationalities along the highway could Fully use
this project to develop its economy and culture reduce the distincticn with. other developed ar-
eas and nationalities. Therefor. this project does not result in nationaCivt discrnination. Tle
public of different nationa'ities agreed our idea in the public opinion poll.
The particular useland an.: building(eg:k;:a&eyaur.mxosqur,etc. )are not took over for use or
removed in the district along the planning hzghwya. Therefore .it eould rot chang the nation-
ality custom in this areas.

Chapter 10 Synthetic Conclusion
and proposals Concerning
Environmental Protection Measures
10.1  Synthetic concdusion 
10. 1. 1 Natrual and eco-environmental
(1) There are not rare plants and animcds along the U -K highway.
(2) soil erbsion possible imp3cts will be slight of this project.
(3) Water quality impacts is rather small and short-tir;! during construction phase.
(4) The project will take up 754ha farmland- 118ha desert grassland. Which will have some
adverse effect on the agriculture and husbandry.but the effect is slight.
(5)  In highway operation phase.the soil and crops is can't be polluted by the lead of tail
gas.
(6) 283337 trees will be cut,with afforestarion engineering by road to compensation .
(7) The irrigation sysrem will be effected during construction phase.
(8) The livestock transmigration will be effected.the effecting is roncentration in sawan-
Kuitun section.the passagewayv wi  be built,this effect is solution.
(9) This project will be coordinatd with natural landscape.and to develop the life quality of
people along the highway .
(10)  The partiavlar u eland and building are not took ever for use or removed in the dis-
trict along planning highway.the area of land be occupied is not large.so the working of req-
uisition is not difficult.
(11) The probability of dangerous goods leakage is varv small in operation phase.
(12) The main effect on atmosphere is dust and smoke of asphalt in construction phase.
The quality of atmosphere of I sections is exceed standard . in 2000.10 sections atmnosthere
quality is exceed standard in 2010.14sections in 2020.but the probability is less than 9%.
(13) The status qao of noise in sensitive spot along t i. ghwav is good - the bac. -,'nd of
noise is lower than 50dB in dav and lower than 40dB in night,the st3tus qao of the 19 noise
sensitive spot is not exceeding standard.
10. 2   Removal or Mitigation Measurements of Adverse impacts
10. 2. 1 Environment Protection in Design Phase
1. Alignment seiection-The alignment should be selected to avoid cities .twons.resident ar-
eas and woodland as much as possible -and to mininmze the acquisition of farmland and grass-
land.
2. Location of material borrow sites:Reasonably determine the locatior. % material borror/
-127-



sites and take the protection of environment around it into account. In the less or no populat-
ed area. use locally available nmaterials. the sites should be located on the leeward and far
away from the area (the distance should be over 500m). ,. quisition of farmland, woodland
and range should be as less as possible.
3. The highway rnay form the barrier to local people's activity and livestock migration result
from its sgperation of resident area .farmland tnd range .so reasonable passage such as culver:
should be designed to meet the requirements for migration of livestock.crossing of local peo-
ple and vehicles. In Anjihai - Kuitun section. the fixed section of livestock eransinigration .3
mourn bridges. 14 smnall bridges and 32 passage ways were designed to meat the cioestock
tra'nsmnigraticn crossing of cocal people and vehicle.
4. In the scetion which locates in farmland.no excavating and borrowing work in the area be-
yond requisition scope.rnaterials for roadbed filling be borrowed in unculti%.ated area or gobi-
Avoid accumulated water in roadbed and roadsurface from directly draining into farmland ir-
rigation system and river.
4. In the scetion which locates in farmland,no excavating and borrowing vwork in the area be-
yond requisition scope. materials for roadbed filling be borrowed in uncultivated area cr gobi.
Avoid accumulated water in roadbed and roadsurface from directly draining into farmrland ir-
rigation svstem and river-
5. In addition to 1 above,take into account the noise and dust puoblerns at residendal areas.
6. Land requisiton and resettlement:The plan of land requisition and resettlement is worked
out bv deqartment concerned.required as follows:
(1)Fullv understand the tvpes and area of requisited land.quantity of removed houses.quan-
titv of affected people and their economic conditijns.
(2)Determine the compensative standard of land requisition and other puoperty loss accord-
ing to laws and regulations concerned.
(3)Work out the plan of resettlement. Ensure the living standard of migrants after resettle-
ment not to below that before resetdement.
(4)Take into account the resettlement of residential area near the highway seriously affected
bv noise and air pollution.
7. In consideration of soil erosion. alignment should avoid unstable geological section
from landslide. In Yamalik section. slip protection and drainage facilities should be de-
signed.
8. In section where salinization exists. the surface layer of salinized soil should be re-
moved and be reasonablv placed. not be put in farmla.d. woodland. river and irrigatin sys-
tem.
9- Bridge and culvertu should be designed to meet requirements of safe dischange of
flood.
10. Take into account the protection of irrigation svstemL In principle. the present irriga-
tion svstem is retained.
-128-



11. Waste water from service area should be designed to be dhcharged into local sewage
drainage svsterm
10. 2. 2 Environment Protection in Construction Phase
1. Noise
The working time should be properly arranged if work site near residential area. The
noisy work should be undertaken in dav time(9 ' 00-23  00). Try to forbid constructing at
night. Near the schools. noisy work should be arranged after school or during vocation.
Avoid starting at a time along the whole alignment and the mnixed time scheme.
The site for concrete mixing and the road for material carrving should be located far
away from sensitive noise points. The distance to the points should be over 500.
2. Dust and asphalt smoke
All reasonable steps. inculuding watering, shall be taken to mininize dust pollution bv
construction works, particularly in places near twons and other densely populated areas.
Goods yards shall be covered or watered to prevent dust pollution. Refer to reference. one
day water 1-2 times. reduce the dust by 50-70%. By this method, controll the dust pollu-
tion in Wulapo. Shihezi. Shawan. Anjihai and Kuitun sections. Asphalt mixing sites shall be
located at lest SOOm from residential areas on the lee side of the wind directon. and asphalt
rmixers sball be equiped with a dust collector.
3. Conservation of biological resources
(l)Farmland and forest shall not be damaged. In the pressed and felled sction, trees
shall be planted carefully and make them recovered to the former condition after construc-
tion.
(C)Construction trucks shall be dirven on the ternporarv road so as to avoid damage to
the farmland and pastureland.
(3)Education of construction workers shall be strengthen on protection of natural re-
sources. Adequate measures. such as septic tanks or sewage treatment facilities, shall be
taken at the construction camp sites, and grabage shall be collected in garbage cans on fixed
places and disposed regularly.
(4)After the removal of materials borrow sites and mixing sites. the sites shall be rea-
sonablv deared so as to awoid dust by wind or soil erosion and water pollution bv surface
runoff.
(S)AJI necessarv steps shall be taken to privent earth and stone from silting up iver . wa-
ter channel ,or the existing irrigation and drainage systems.
4. Traffic and transportation management
(M)Adequate sctions to direct traffic shall be taken in consultation with Cormnunications
and Public Securitn Department.when roads are Jammed dusing construction period.
(2)Transportation plan for construction muterial shall be develoqed to avoed the trans-
portation at traffic peak time for existing roads.
'3)In section where the existiong highway will be used .construct subsidiary road before
-129-



construction of the highway.
(4)In Yanalik section .the dangerous areas shall be determined before blasting, and
people .livestock and valuables within these areas shall be evacuated in tine,and be strucdy
prohibited to pass through during the blstiwg . Safety lockout post shall be seE up in order
for people and vehicle not to pass througgh untill blasting ends completely Blasting shall not
be done during the peak work period so as to avoil unjuris and deaths of people and traffic
jam. Advanced techniques such as directional blasting shall be adopted to minimize adverse
effects on environment.
10. 2.3 Environment Protection in Operation Phase
1. Noise
(1)Strictdr control the quality of the road surface in corsteuction period. Enhance the
protection and care for the road surface in operation period to reduce the noise caused bv the
uneven road surface.
(2 )Enhance the traffic management. Stricdtv carr out The allowed noise standard for
the vehical-issued bv the government.
(3)The planing residential areas are forbidden to be built in the ranRe of noise inpact.
thev should be located over 200m away from the roadsides. Control the residents along the
higbwav to migrate near the roadsides.
(4)The scheme of the facilitv for noise attenuation shall be adopted in the section
nearsensitive noise points when the traffic volume reaches to a certain degree based on the
results of monitoring.
2. Air pol:urion
(1) Although the predicted results.particularly long-term NOx
concentrations exceed the assessment criteria.the worst meteorological conditions will not
frequently occur under the peak traffic volume o£ the day.
(2)The vehicle emissons standards will be strengthened in the future in China .but this is not
taken into account in this assessment.
(3)The following mitigation mmeasures are adopted in this project:
a. to strengthen annual vehicatc emissions inspection to immprove vehicle maintenance and
management and reduce vehicle emissions;
b. to undertae vehicle emissions and noise inspections at toll stations such as Urunmqi.Shi_
hezi and Kuitun and not to allow vehides violating regulations to run on UKl;
c. to plant trees and forests around the sensitive sites to reduce air pollution problems :and
d. ro carrv out air quality monitoring during the operation phase to eariv detect any signifi-
cant air pollution problems and to take necessarv measures.
3. The Pubilc Securitv Department shall be informed before carrfing dangerous chemicals.
and specify time.routes and pralcing places of vehicles to carrv these chemicals The vehicles
and drirers shall be inspected. Experienced drivers with high -live1 techniques are required.
The dengerous sign shall be painted on the vehicle. Transport of dangerous chemieals shall
-130-



not be allowed dwuing the peak tiae. Mixed transport shall be stricdy prohibited. Other peo-
ple are not allowed to ride. Signs shall be set up in the envuironmentaly sensitive areas such as
nvem,farnmand,forest belt and residential areas in order to warn duivers to pay spedial at-
tention.
4. Enhance the studv and obedience of the traffic laws and regulations and form a good
traffic environment. After the highway is in operation.traffic laws and egulahyons shall be
structlv obeyed and the drivers quality saU be strengthened in order to get rid of the careless
idea of driving on the high gra  highway.
