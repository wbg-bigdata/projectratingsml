                            SCHEDULE 5
                          Special Account
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the  term  "Eligible  Categories"  means  Categories (1)
through (7) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "Eligible  Expenditures"  means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
the Project and to be  financed  out  of  the proceeds of the Loan
allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in
accordance with the provisions  of  Schedule  1 to this Agreement;
and
     (c)  the term "Initial Deposit" means an amount equivalent to
two million and five  hundred  thousand dollars ($2,500,000) to be
withdrawn from the  Loan  Account  and  deposited into the Special
Account pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for Eligible Expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this  Schedule.  The  Borrower  shall  make  withdrawals  from the
Special Account for payments of Eligible Expenditures on the basis
of the evidence that  the  Bank  shall have reasonably determined,
and shall debit the Special Account  with the amount in dollars so
withdrawn or with the dollar equivalent of the currency other than
dollars in which the payment was  made, determined on the basis of
the rate of  exchange  between  the  dollar  and  such currency in
effect: (i) on the date  of  each  payment, if the withdrawal from
the Special Account  in  respect  of  such  payment  has been made
within 90 days of the date of  the payment, or in the case of Sub-
loans under Parts A and B  of the Project requiring prior approval
by the Bank, on the date  of  each payment if the request for such
approval in respect of such  payment  has been made within 90 days
of the date of the payment, provided, however, that the withdrawal
from the Special Account in respect  of such payment has been made
within 30 days  of  the  date  on  which  the  Bank has issued its
approval  of  each  such  Sub-loan;  or  (ii)  on  the  date  each
withdrawal shall have been made.
3.   The Bank may, at  the  request  of  the Borrower, withdraw on
behalf of the Borrower from the  Loan Account and deposit into the
Special Account the Initial Deposit.  Thereafter, and on the basis
Page  17
of  requests  by  the  Borrower  furnished  to  the  Bank  at such
intervals as the Bank  shall  specify,  the  Bank shall further so
withdraw from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the Special
Account such amounts as shall be required to replenish the Special
Account for Eligible Expenditures, but only to the extent that the
amount of any such deposit,  together with any amount remaining on
deposit in the Special  Account  as  of  the date of such request,
shall not exceed, in the  aggregate, the equivalent of the Initial
Deposit. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree, each such deposit
after the Initial Deposit shall be  withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective  Eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by the
evidence supporting the  request  for  such deposit furnished pur-
suant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.
4.   Prior to or at the time of each request by the Borrower for a
deposit by the Bank  into  the  Special  Account after the Initial
Deposit, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank in respect of each
payment made by  the  Borrower  out  of  the  Special Account such
documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request,
showing that such payment was made for Eligible Expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph  3  of  this
Schedule, when the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the Categories, minus  the  amount of any outstanding qualified
agreement to  reimburse  made  by  the  Bank  and  any outstanding
special  commitment  entered   into   by   the  Bank  pursuant  to
Section 5.02 of  the  General  Conditions,  shall  be equal to the
equivalent of twice the  amount  of  the Initial Deposit, the Bank
shall be entitled, after consultation with the Borrower, to reduce
the percentage of disbursements  for Eligible Expenditures or take
any other action which will  ensure  the  Bank that by the time of
disbursement of the total amount of  the proceeds of the Loan, all
deposits (including the Initial Deposit  made by the Bank into the
Special Account) were made for Eligible Expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall  have  determined that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any
amount not eligible  for  financing  by  withdrawal  from the Loan
Account; or (ii) was not  justified by the documentation furnished
pursuant  to  paragraph  (4)  above,  the  Bank  shall  notify the
Borrower of such circumstances, and if,  after a period of 30 days
from the issuance of such notice, an amount equal to the amount of
such payment or the portion  thereof  not so eligible or justified
has not been deposited  by  the  Borrower into the Special Account
or, if the Bank shall so  request,  refunded to the Bank, the Bank
may, without in any way  restricting  or limiting any other right,
power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, refrain from
making further deposits into such Account; and
     (b)  If any amount  outstanding  in  the Special Account will
not be required to  cover  further  payments for Eligible Expendi-
tures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, and
unless otherwise agreed  by  the  Bank,  refund  to  the Bank such
amount then outstanding in  the  Special  Account for crediting to
the Loan Account and immediate cancellation.
