MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEANATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY DEVE.LOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Bank loan
of US$145 million and development credit of SDR 44.2 million (US$55 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. US$100 million of the loan for the
Technical Development Fund would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace,
and the balance of US$45 million for the venture capital component would be
for 16 years, including 7 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. The proposed credit for the technology services component
would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The proposed loan and
credit would help finance an industrial technology development project. The
project is expected to be co-financed by a grant from the Government of Japan
of US$2.5 million equivalent.
2.       Back round.  Recent liberalization of the industrial regulatory
framework is promoting competition and stimulating industrial growth and
technological change. The results have been impressive with 9% p.a. growth in
industrial output since 1985 and more than 25% p.a. growth in real terms in
manufactured exports over the past 2 years.  After two decades of stagnation,
total factor productivity of manufacturing industry increased between 1981 and
1987 by 4.2% p.a., indicating that firms are already responding to the more
competitive environment by boosting their productivity. To survive and grow,
firms now need to improve productivity and product quality further and
therefore are demanding improved technology and increasing investment in R&D.
3.       Previous policies and institutional development efforts for
industrial technology development (ITD) have focused on technological self-
reliance and government financing and carrying out of R&D on behalf of
industry. The Government is now evolving an ITD strategy which emphasizes:
increased development and commercialization of technology relative to basic
research; more participation in, and financing of, R&D by industry rather than
the Government; and a greater reliance on technology imports and thereby
channeling domestic resources more efficiently to complement, rather than
substitute for, technology that can be obtained from abroad. The greater
openness to foreign technology is evident, inter alia, from the encouragement
of foreign investment, which has grown 12-fold in dollar terms in 10 years,
and the easier access to technology imports, as evidenced by the number of
technology collaborations approved each year in the late 1980s, which have
tripled compared to 10 years earlier. The emphasis on transferring greater
responsibility to industry for domestic ITD is demonstrated by the increased
participation of industry on the boards of public sector research institutes
(RIs); limits on budgetary support to RIs coupled with incentives for them to
seek industrial contracts; and Government efforts to promote venture capital
to support new technology ventures in the private sector.



- 2 -
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since some of the major elements of
a technology strategy are still being formulated and others remain to be
implemented, Bank participation at this stage can have a major impact on the
long-term orientation of technology strategy toward supporting a more
competitive industrial environment. Previous Bank studies of various
industrial subsectors and the regulatory environment, culminating in the
report on Policies for Industrial Technology Development (No. 6715-IN, May 11,
1987), as well as subsequent dialogue on issues and policies related to ITD
have provided input for the Government's technology policies. Bank
involvement in project preparation has already had an impact on the plans and
strategies of selected research and stqndards institutes and, with support
from the IFC, on the institutional strl!cture for venture capital. The Bank
would continue to monitor and advise on the policy and institutional aspects
of venture cspital development, the evolution of more service oriented
technology institutions and increasing access of enterprises to foreign
technology. More broadly, Bank participation in industrial technology
development complements other Bank efforts to promote increased industrial
competition and modernization, improve competitiveness of key industrial
subsectors and train technical manpower for industry.
5.       Prolect Objectives.  The overall objectives of the project are to
facilitate the acquisition and development of technology by industrial firms
in India, and to promote within industry a balanced recourse to existing
domestic technological capability and to increased and easier import of
foreign technology. Specifically, the project would aim to: (a) help build
the appropriate regulatory and institutional framework for venture capital in
India; (b) support increased collaboration between industry and selected
technology service institutions and improve the latter's capability to support
technological development in industry; and (c) provide industry with easier
and greater access to foreign technology.
6.       Proiect Descrigtion.  The project consists of the following three
components:
(a)  Technologv Venture Financing.  This component would support with
US45 million of loan proceeds 4 venture capital schemes set up to
finance and assist ventures for developing and commercializing
innovative products and processes which involve high risk and are
not appropriate for normal institutional financing. Each scheme
would involve the establishment of venture capital trust funds
(VCFs) to be managed by a specialized unit or a separate venture
capital management entity (VCM).1/ The proceeds of the VCFs would
be invested principally in innovative technology ventures through
various equity and quasi-equity instruments (e.g., conditional
1/ Technology Development and Information Corporation of India (TDICI, an
affiliate of ICICI), Canara Bank Financial Services Ltd. (CanFina),
Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation (GIIC) and APIDC Venture
Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Development
Corporation (APIDC).



loans, income notes), convertible debentures and loans. Each VCF
would consist of resources invested by the parent company, and
other investors in some cases. The Loan proceeds would be
invested by the parert company in the VCF and constitute one third
of each VCF's resources. Technical assistance for the four
venture capital entities to the extent of US$500,000 equivalent is
expected to be financed as a grant by tl-" Government of Japan.
(b) Technolo&v Services. This component would be supported with an
IDA credit. Twelve to 15 technology institutions (TIs) would
receive loans (interest-free, but with a service fee) totalling
US$40 million for equipment, facilities, training and technology
collaboration for R&D programs which directly support industry.
Each program would form an integral part of an overall
institutional plan of the TI that provides for increased revenue
generation from its industrial clients and a clearer definition of
its role, in particular vis-a-vis industry. The first six, the
Bureau of Indian Standards and five research institutes (RIs),
have been appraised. A technology group in ICICI would b-?
responsible for appraising the remaining institutions and
supervising all TIs. It would also manage a US$15 miilion *ilot
Sponsored R&D Promotion Fund created under the project to
stimulate industry's demand for R&D carried out with or by the TIs
or universities. This fund would finance loans to industry to
cover up to one half of the costs of R&D projects; the other half
would be borne by industrial firms.   Technical assistance and
training for institutional improvements of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the Bureau of Indian
Standards (BIS) and ICICI, and studies on the policy and
institutional environment for ITD would be supported by the grant
from the Government of Japan.
(c)  Technical Development Fund (TDF) is a mechanism for facilLtating
technology imports by industrial firms, providing them all
approvals promptly, as well as foreign exchange allocations for
the firms' puirchases of technology. The Bank would support
incremental technology imports through the TDF with the third
project component of US$100 million, which would cover one third
of TDF's total estimated foreign exchange requirements through the
end of the 1990/91 fiscal year. Recent modifications of TDF
procedures have removed key constraints to technology imports
under the scheme and provide now for a wide range of imports for
technology upgrading through a fast track procedure. This
liberalization of the TDF is expected to result in rapid growth of
demand for TDF imports.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$410 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$291 million (71%). A breakdown of
project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
7864-IN dated August 15, 1989, is being distributed concurrently.

7.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to:  (a) enter into,
Subsidiary Loan Agreements with ICICI and the Industrial Development Bank
of India (IDBI, see para. 8 below), which stipulate, inter alia, the
amounts and relending terms for Bank financing of venture capital (16 years
with 7 years of grace, during which the interest of 12S p.a. would be
capitalized), and the criteria and guidelines for the management by ICICI
of the IDA credit for technology services; (b) ensure that the four VCMs
can carry out their VC activities, effectively and efficiently and, in
particular, have the freedom to invest the proceeds of the VCFs, using
various equity, quasi-equity and loan instruments, without seeking
government approval, and di-est their shares at prices that they determine;
(c) ensure that access by firms to the TDF scheme would not be reduced; and
(d) establish a mechanism satisfactory to the Bank by March 31, 1990, for
centralizing documentation on TDF imports.
8.       Regarding technology venture financing, IDBI would enter into
Financial Agreements acceptable to the Bank with CanBank, APIDC and GIIC
which define the terms and conditions under which loan proceeds are to be
used. ICICI, CanBank, APIDC and GIIC would agree to ensure that (a) each
VCF management entity (i) operates to promote ctart-up and growth-oriented
technology companies and maximize returns to the VCFs, and (ii) employs
staff of adequate experienoe and background; (b) articles of
association/incorporation, t,ust deeds, and operating guidelines of the VCF
and managing entity are not chenged substantially without approval of the
Bank; and (c) subprojects are submitted to the Bank for prior approval as
required under the terms of the loan.
91.      ICICI has also agreed to:  (a) on-lend the proceeds of the IDA
credit to TIs and for sponsored R&D according to agreed criteria; (b) on-
lend funds to TIs with a service fee of 1% p.a. and a maximum term of 15
years with 4 years of grace and a commitment charge of 0.25% p.a.;
(c) ensure that TIs set up cost accounting systems and comply substantially
with institutional goals for 1989/90 and with laboratory safaty
requirements before disbursing funds to them; (d) on-lend funds for
industry-sponsored R&D for up to 12 years at 6% p.a. during the grace
period and A 14% p.a. interest and/or a royalty payment thereafter, unless
the subproject is proven to be unsuccessful, in which case it would be
written off; and (e) establish a formal review procedure for subprojects
and maintain an adequate staff.
10.      Conditions of effectiveness are the signing of Subsidiary
Agreements as noted in para. 7 (a) above and of a Financial Agreement
betweer IDBI and Canara Bank, all acceptable to the Bank. The signing of
IDBI-APIDC and IDBI-GIIC Financial Agreements would be conditions of
disbursement for APIDC and GIIC, respectively.
11.      Benefits.  The proposed project would support a comprehensive and
integrated approach to developing technology in Indian industry. It would
help firms obtain the technological inputs from abroad, while providing for
more appropriate development of domestic technclogies based on the needs of
industry. Institutionally, the project would contribute to the development



of: (a) TIs whose activities are increasingly financed by industry and
determined by industrial demand; (b) profitable VCFs financing a wide range
of growth-oriented firms using advanced technologies; and (c) key
government agencies supervising policies and institutions which promote ITD
by industry. The proposed project is expected to contribute directly to
more rapid technological upgrading in about 1,000-1,200 industrial firms.
It would also stimulate rationalization and consolidation of policies and
procedures associated with technology acquisition, capital markets and
venture capital, and the operation and funding of the research institutes.
The project would also have a significant impact on laboratory safety in
the entire CSIR network and support a number of research activities related
to environmental protection and improvement.
1.9.     Risks.  An innovative project like tk'.s one is inherently risky
with respect to implementation and repayment by the final beneficiaries.
The project, however, is structured to minimize the risks. The TDF already
functions expeditiously. An effective system for managing the technology
services component is being developed by ICICI which will be compensated
for its services. Appraisal of the first six institutes indicated that
they can be transformed to ITD institutions serving effectively industrial
needs. Each venture capital scheme has been thoroughly appraised and
organizational arrangements have been modified so that they can operate
effectively and profitably.  Two VCMs have had positive experience with
share inves:"ents and divestiture, and a third which has already initiated
VCF operation has revealed a large demand and a capability to appraise
prospective ventures effectively. This component will be supervised
closely (as will the :roject as a whole).
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and of the association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.

La The cost of this component is based on a conservative estimate of the
projected incremental demand for technology imports under the TDF. The
Bank loan would support easier and larger imports of technology for an
amount of US$100 million, and the Government would fund from its own
resources the balanice of the projected incremental foreign exchange
requirements. In order to simplify disbursement procedures, Bank funds
for this component would be disbursed for one third of total actual
foreign exchange outlays for eligible technology imports under the TDF.
