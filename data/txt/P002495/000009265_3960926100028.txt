MEMORANDUM TO     EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDEN.
SUBlJECT: Project Completion Report on Somalia - Technical
Assistance for the Baardhere Project (Credit 1856-SO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Somalia - Technical A.istance for the
Baardhere Project (Credit 1856-SO) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Part II of this report,
normally preparea by the Borrower, is missing because of the political disruption in Somalia.
The main objective of this IDA project was to provide technical assistance (TA), mainly via
the financing of studies and expatriate advisors, to the Ministry of Juba Valey IDevelopment
(MJVD) with a view to completing preparation/design of the Baardhere Project (The Baardhere
Project involves the construction of a large dam, with related hydropower and irrigation facilities,
in the Juba Valley of Somalia). The IDA TA project also had an institutional development (ID)
component (mainly training) aimed at strengthening MJVD's capacity to manage project
implementation.
According to the PCR, the TA project was on the whole successful because it did in fact
achieve its main objectives of determining the feasibility of the Baardhere Project and completing
its preparation. A twinning arrangement between MJVD and an engineering services organization
was evidently a successful one, and the studies, training and other activities were carried out
expeditiously. The near-term institutional development impact is rated as partiaL In the event,
however, deteriorating conditions in Somalia completely halted work on the Baardhere Project
While it is unusual for a Bank/IDA project to warrant an overall rating of satisfactory even
though sustainability of benefits is unlikely, this is such a case.
Because of abnormal country circumstances, it is understandable that the PCR should not
be complete. However, even making allowances for these circumstances, a number of important
issues related to Borrower involvement in project preparation, "ownership" and lessons learned
could have been treated more thoroughly.
Given country conditions, no audit is planned at this stage.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE BAARDHERE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1856-SO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for Technical Assistance for the Baardhere Project in
Somalia for whirb C.redit 1856-SO in the amount of SDR 4.3 million (US$5.5 million equivalent) was
approved on December 1, 1987. Due to the civil war in the country the project was suspended in March
1991, nine months before the official closing date of December 31, 1991. SDR 1.1 million remains
undisbursed. The last disbursement was made on April 30, 1991.
Parts I and m of the report were prepared by the World Bank's Agriculture and Environment
Oparations Division, Country Department II, Africa Regional Office. A draft could not be sent to the
Borrower for comment.
Due to the security situation in Somal!a, no field visits could take place. The report was based
on the President's Report, Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence betwecn
the Bank and Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLEION REPORT
SOMALIA
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE BAARDHERE PROJECT
(CRlDfT 1856-SO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    At the time of project formulation, only 8.5% of Somalia's cultivable land was cultivated, with
water being the main constaint. Studies showed that new irrigation investments would ensure a
sustainable anual growth in crop production of about 5%. The construction of a multipurpose dam on
the Juba River at Baardhere was identified as the main potential for irrigation and hydropower. IDA and
several other donors financed preparation of a number of pre-;nvestment studies but in 1987, an IDA
mission to Somalia fund that the preparation process was encountering serious issues from lack of
coordination and supervision. The mission proposed a technical assistance credit to assist in completing
preparation of the Baardhere Project.
Project Objectives
2.    By providing technical assistance and training, the project was to strengthen the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Juba Valley Development (MJVD) to complete the preparation of the
Baardhere Project and to determine its feasibility and financing so that a sound decision could be taken
about implementation. The project included the remaining studies and specialist inputs needed to
complete preparation of the Baardhere Pioject, and was to strengthen MJVD's capacity to make a
significant contribution to the project's implementation in the event of a decision to proceed.
Project lmplementation
3.    The credit became effective April 1, 1988. MJVD signed a contract establishing a twinning
agreement with an engineering services organization. The arrangement was to enable the Somalis to
benefit from the agency's experience, facilitate the recruitment of short-term specialists, provide Somali
staff with short-term on-the-job training, and support MJVD's capacity to administer and supervise
consultants engaged in planning and design. Ihe final team comprised three Somali specialists (team
leader, irrigation engineer, and economist), and two expatriate specialists from the twiming organization
(dam and specifications engineer). Project vehicles, office equipment, furniture and supplies were
procured. Review of contractor applications to qualify for the civil works construction followed soon
afterwards. A total of 13 trainees were placed in overseas MSc courses and 11 project staff participated
in short-term training in various countries.
4.    One problem encountered by the project was the lack of counterpart funds for operating costs.
To overcome the problem, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a new category of expenditure
for opeaing costs so that IDA funds could be .-eallocated for this purpose.  To completf the



- iv -
environmental work and training program, GOS requested a one-year extension of the credit closing date
to December 31, 1991, which was granted by IDA. However, shortly afterwards, the Government was
overthrown and the Bank group suspended all credits to Somalia. A number of suppliers could not be
paid for goods delivered because there was no govermnent to authorize disbursement.
Projedt Results
5.    The Project achieved its objectives of completing the preparation of the Baardhere Project and
determining its feasibility. Reports produced covered topics such as: drainage and salinity control,
hydrological sedimentation and water quality, ro^kfill embankment alternative design, power optimization,
economic and macroeconoinic analysis for the dam project, surveys of bench mark on the dam site,
tender documents, and prequalification for civil works contractors. Those studies concluded that the dam
was an ecoaomical solution for water and power provision in southern Somalia. Other studies addressed
crucial issues related to the construction of the dam: riparian rights, resettiement, health hazards, water
use legislation, land tenure legislation, refugees, environment.
Sustainability
6.    Since the Baardhere Project is not expected to take place in the foreseeable future, the technical
assistance credit will not have any sustainable impact on the country.
Lessons Learned
7.    Due to the civil war, disbursement could not be completed and a number of goods suppliers who
had not taken insurance against the political risk were not paid by either the Government (which no
longer existed to issue withdrawal applications from the credit) or their country's export credit insurance.
In view of the worsening political situation of the country, and anticipated evacuation of international
personnel, IDA might have instructed the resident mission and the last supervision mission to concentrate
on the project's financial management, including reconciliation of the special account, and clearing
outading payments so that they could be settled before the country plunged into anarchy - the uniquely
dramatic and lasting nature of which was admittedly difficlat to predict. This is a major lesson to be
learned by IDA and suppliers of goods and services in countries experiencing serious social and political
instability.

Sector/Subsector          Agriculture
Background
1.    Of the 638,000 sq km of Somalia's land area, only 13% is suitable for cultivation. Ot this, only
8.5% was cultivated at the time of project formulation, with water being the main constaint. Studies
showed that n   irrigation investments would ensure a susainable amnual growth in crop production of
about 5%. At the time of project formulation, the constuction of a multiprpose dam on the Juba River
at Baardhere was identified as the main potental for irrigation and hydropower. The Baardhere Project,
a complex and costly operation etimated at $300 million, was part of Somalia's public investment
program and a key component of the national development strategy for both the agriculture and power
sectors.
2.    Various feasibility stdies carried out in the 1970s had reconfirmed the priority of the Baardhere
Project. These studies were completed for constuction of a concrete dam. IDA agreed to assist the
Government of Somalia (GOS) in completing project preparation and, subject to appraisal findings, to
finance the project with other donors. In preparation for this, IDA financed studies of future institutional
arrangements, flood protection and resettlement needs, USAID financed an environmentai and social
assessment, and GTZ carried out a master plan for development of the Juba Valley. Detailed design for
an alternative rockfitl dam was also undertaken with Chinese assistance.
3.    Almost all the water flowing ia the Juba River in Somalia is derived from its catchment area in
Ethiopia and partly in Kenya. To assess whether the proposed Baardhere Project would be adversely
affected by water use in Ethiopia, IDA requested Ethiopia to provide details of its water use plans within
the Juba River catchment, and contracted consultants to update an earlier review of likely future use of
Juba River water within Ethiopia. This review, together with other studies conducted by various
consultants, concluded that even reduced flows of up to 33 % would be unlikely to jeopardize the project's
viability.

Project Objectives and Descriptlon
4.    Project Objectives. By providing technical assistance and training, the project was to strengthen
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Juba Valley Development (MIVD) to complete the preparation
of the Baardhere Project and to determine its feasibility and financing so that a sound decision could be
taken about implementation. The prk jee Icluded the remaining studies and specialist inputs needed to
complete preparation of the Baardhere Project, and was to strengthen MJVD's capacity to make a
significant contribution to the project's implementation in the event of a decision to proceed.
5.    Project Description. The main project component was the establishment of a Core AdvLtory
Team within MJVD, consisting of six qWiified Somali sponalists and three expauiate resident advisors,
supported by short term consultants. Tne advisory team was to assist MJVD in supervising consultants
studies and completing preparation of the Baardhere Project and its appraisal by IDA and other donors.
The project was to provide funds for technical assistance, training, vehicles, transit accommodation and
storage, firniture and equipment and incremental operating costs.
Project Design and Organiation
6.    IDA involvement in the Baardhere Project began in 1983, whea the proposed Juba Valley
development program was under review. Later on, when the selection of the dam was reconfirmed as
a priority, IDA fmanced several studies leading to project preparation. In March 1987 an IDA mission
visited Somalia to supervise the preparation of the Baardhere Project, and found that the preparation
process was encountering serious issues, inparticularunsatisfactory supervisionofthepreparationprocess
and weak donor coordination by GOS. In its Aide Memoire the mission proposed a technical assistance
credit to assist in completing preparation of the Baardhere project. The proposal was in line with
Government's desire to complete preparation of the project.
7.    The technical assistance project was negotated in Washigton in October 1987. The negotiations
did not result in any changes in the project. IDA financed US$5.5 million out of a total project cost of
$5.8 million. The project was to be implemted over a 30 month period by MJVD. During
negotiations, it was indicated that, subject to progress of the technical assistance project, appraisal of the
Baardhere Project could take place at the end of 1988.
Project Implementation
8.    The Credit became effective April 1, 1988. The hiring process for the advisory team started
promptly thereafter. MJVD negotiated a contract estabishing a twinning agreement with an engineering
services organization. The arrangement was to enable the Somalis to benefit from the agency's
experience, facilitate the recruitment of short-term specialists, provide Somali staff with short-term on-the-
job training, and support MJVD's capacity to administer and supervise consultants engaged in planning
and design. IDA cleared both the agreement and the experts proposed by the agency. In May 1988 GOS
appointed a Somali expert as team leader. By October 1988 the expatriates were in place, and M1VD
had already started interviewing Somali candidates for the economist and ifrrigation engineer posts. Once
fully established the final team comprised three Somali specialists (team leader, irrigation engineer, and
economist), and two expatriate specialists from the twinning organization (dam and specifications
engineer).



9.    The Advisory Teau began the procurement process in August, 1988. By October of that year
the project vehicles had already arrived 'n Mogadishu. Office equipment, finxiture and supplies, were
procured locally. Review of contractor applications to qualify for the civil works construction followed
soon afterwards.
10.   Selection of suitable candidates for training under the Credit started soon after effectiveness. A
tota of 13 trainees were placed in overseas MSc courses in various disciplines. At the same time, a
program of short term training for 11 project staff was carried out at universities in several countries.
A six-month course to improve English language proficiency of project staff was completed in 1990.
11.   One problem encountered by the project was the lack of counterpart funds for operating costs.
To overcome the problemn, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a new category of expenditure
for operating costs so that IDA funds could be reallocated for this purp-4se.
12.   To complete the environmental work and training program, GOS requested a oneyear extension
of the credit closing date to December 31, 1991, which was granted by IDA. However, shortly
afterds, the Government was ovehrown and the Bank group sus.oended all credits to Somalia. The
project could not be completed and no follow up was possible on the Baardhere Project.
Project Rults
13.   The project achieved its objectives of completing the preparation of the Baardhere Project and
detemining its feasibility. From April 1988 to December 1990, various consulting groups produced
reports related to Baardhere Project preparation, including topics such as: drainage and salinity control,
hydrological sedimenation and water quality, rocdfihl embankment altenative design, power optmizaton,
economic and macroeconomic analysis for the dam project, surveys of bench mark on the dam site,
tender documents, and prequalification for civil works contractors. Those studies concluded that the dam
was an economical solution for water and power provision in southern Somalia. Other studies addressed
crucial issues related to the construction of the dam: riparian rights, resettlement, health hazards, water
use leglation, land tenure legislation, refugees, environment.
14.   The advisory team was actively involved in supervising and coordinating the various consulting
groups and donors, and in reviewing all the studies produced by consultants, including the engineering
studies, the economic analysis of the proposed project, tender documents, prequalification of contracts,
and supervision of tendering procedures. The advisory team reached the conclusion that all the studies
produced left no doubt as to the economic feasibility of the Baardhere Project.
Susanability
15.   Since the Baardhere Project is not expected to take place in the foreseeable future, the technical
assistance credit will not have any sustainable impact on the country.
IDA Performance
16.   After many years of discussions and investigations into the feasibility of the dam, it became
evident that lack of supervision and coordination had become a major cause of delay. The Association
therefore identified the need for technical assistance to speed up preparation of the Baardhere Project.



-4 -
The project was simple and well designed, and was processed quickly. During implementation, there was
constant dialogue with the Government and clse correspondence with the project team. The performance
of supervision missions and the Bank office in Mogadishu was satisfactory.
17.   A total of four supervision missions were fielded between April, 1988 and November 1990, with
good staffing continuity. After the initial period of project implementation, when efforts were put on the
establishment of the advisory team, supervision missions focussed on the completion of the preparation
studies for the Baardhere Project as described above, and on outstanding issues associated with the
construction of the dam, such as riparian rights, resettement and environmental aspects. The last
supervision mission was carried out in November, 1990. It reported a deterioration of the security
situation in the country. Extensive areas had become inaccessible, and there was a high incidence of
violence, with little or no law enforcement. In retrospect, the mission should have concentrated on
supervising the project's financial management, including reconciliation of the special account and
clearing outstanding payments to suppliers. This could have reduced the number of suppliers that could
hot be paid for goods delivered once there was no longer a government to authorize disbursement. This
situation, which would have been difficult to predict, still prevails at the time of the writing of this report.
Borrower Plerformance
18.   Borrower performance was satisfactory especially in light of the political and security
deterioration during project implementation. The lack of counterpart funds was a major problem but all
other credit covenants were in compliance.
Consulting Services
19.   The performance of the advisory team was good. In a letter to the Minister oV National Plannng,
dated November 1988, IDA praised the advisory team for the progress it was making in completing
preparation of the dam project, and for its diligence in preparing monthly reports that were said to be
most informative and useful to all potential donors.
Proje  Relationship
20.   IDA's relat;onship with MIVD and other parts of Goverament was good.
Project Documentation and Data
21.   The credit agreemen: and Memorandum of the President provided an adequate framework for
review of project implementation. The studies conducted under the project were available in the Bank's
files.
Lessons Learned
22.   Due to the civil war, disbursement could not be completed and a number of goods suppliers who
had not Laken insurance against the political risk were not paid by either the Govermment (which no
longer existed to issue withdrawal applications from the credit) or their country's export credit insurance.
In view of thi worsening political situation of the country, and anticipated evacuation of international
personnel, IDA might have instmcted the resident mission and the last supervision mission to concentrate



on the project's financial management, including reconciliation of the special account, and clearing
outstanding payments so that they could be settled before the country plunged into anarchy - the uniquely
dramatic and lasting nature of which was admittedly difficult to predict. This is a major lesson to be
learned by IDA and suppliers of goods and services in countries experiencing serious social and political
instability.
