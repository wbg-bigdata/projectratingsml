MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE
BAARDHERE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for SDR 4.3 million
(US$5.5 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40
years to help finance technical assistance to strengthen the Ministry of
Juba Valley Development (MJVD), so as to complete the preparation of the
proposed Baardhere Project.
2.        Background.  Only about 13 percent of Somalia's land area of
638,000 square kilometers is suitable for cultivation, and with water being
the main constraint, only a small fraction (8.5%) is presently cultivated.
A recent agricultural study, carried out jointly by the Government of
Somalia (GOS) and the Association, concluded that a growth rate in crop
production of about 5% per annum could be sustained if substantial
investments are made in irrigation rehabilitation in the Shebelli valley,
in new irrigation development in the Juba valley, and in improved water
management. Most of the water of the Shebelli River is already exploited,
and the main potential for new irrigation and hydropower in Somalia now
lies in the Juba River Valley through the proposed construction of a
multi-purpose dam at Baardhere. This large project (estimated to cost
about US$300 million) is included in Somalia's core public investment
program and is a key component of the national development strategy for
both the agricultural and power sectors. Starting in 1976, various
feasibility studies (financed by a donor group which includes the EEC,
Kuwait Fund, GTZ and Italy) were completed for construction of a concrete
dam. Detailed designs and tender documents were commissioned with EEC
financing before IDA, in 1983, recommended (a) exploration of a natural gas
field in Somalia which, if proven, could have delayed the need for
hydropower; and (b) studies of an alternative reservoir for irrigation on
the Juba River. Both studies, however, reconfirmed selection and priority
of the Baardhere Project.  Subsequently, IDA agreed to assist GOS in
completing the preparation of the Baardhere Project and, subject to
appraisal findings, to consider financing it with other donors. In
preparation for this, IDA financed the services of an independent panel of
experts and a study of the future institutional arrangements under SPPF
G018-SO (US$0.5 million). IDA also financed studies of agricultural and
flood protection benefits and of resettlement needs through PPF 369-SO
(US$0.75 million). A comprehensive environmental and social assessment
study is under way with USAID financing, and a master plan for development
of the Juba River Valley is being undertaken with GTZ assistance.
Investigation and detailed design for an alternative rockfill dam are also
under way, with Chinese assistance. A final choice of dam type may be made
by GOS following bidding for both rockfill and concrete types, once designs
are completed and found acceptable ou safety and technical grounds.



3.        Riparian Rights.  Almost all the water flowing In the Juba River
in Somalia is derived from its catchment in Ethiopia, and a short stretch
of one of the tributaries of the Juba River forms part of the boundary
between Ethiopia and Kenya. In accordance with the provisions of OMS
2.32, the Association has informed GOS that it should aotify Ethiopia and
Kenya of the proposed Baardhere project. GOS requested the Association to
notify Ethiopia on its behalf, and Ethiopia has responded that it objects
to the proposed Baardhere Project unless prior agreement is reached through
negotiations on water allocations. The proposed technical assistance to
determine the feasibility of the Baardhere Project is appropriate, however,
in parallel to the steps being taken by the Association to resolve the
riparian issues. To assess whether the proposed Baardhere project would be
harmed by the uses of water that Ethiopia might make, the Association
requested Ethiopia to provide details of its water use development plans
within the Juba River catchment, and contracted consultants (Sir M.
MacDonald and Partners, U.K.) to update an earlier review (1978) of likely
future use of Juba River water within Ethiopia.
4.        This review, and other studies by Electroconsult (Italy),
concluded that Ethiopia has a p_-ential to develop some 60,000 ha of
irrigation aloag the Juba River, which, together with other water uses,
might reduce flows into Somalia by up to 35% at full development. Reduced
flows of this magnitude have been accommodated in the project design and
are repoxted by the consultants to be unlikely to jeopardize the project's
viability. The proposed technical assistance project includes
supplementa . power optimizatJon studies which would further test the
sensitivity of the Baardhere Project's viability to reduced Juba River
flows in the event of increased abstractions within Ethiopia. Thus the
proposed project would assist in determining the feasibility of the
Baardhere Project from the water allocation viewpoint.
5.        Project Objectives.  By providing technical assistance and
training, the proposed project would strengthen the institutional capacity
of the Ministry of Juba Valley Development (HJVD) to complete the
preparation of the Baardhiere Project and to determine its feasibility and
financing so that a sound decision can be taken about implementation. The
proposed project would include the remaining studies and specialist inputs
needed to complete preparation of the Baardhere Project, and would
strengthen MJVD's capacity to make a significant contribution to the
project's implementation in the event of a decision to proceed.
6.        Project Description.  The project would establish a core advisory
team within MJVD consist'ng of six qualified Somali specialists and three
expatriate resident advisors, supported by short term consultants. The
team would complement technical assistance financed by the Kuwait Fund in
the fields of irrigated agriculture and legal matters.  The core advisory
team would assist MJVD in supervising consultant studies and completing
preparation of the Baardhere Project and its appraisal by IDA and other
donors. The team would also assist in formulating plans for project
implementation, including water and power charges, train local staff in
preparing and evaluating complex projects, and assist in coordinating
cofinancing arrangements. The project would a1..s: provide the continued



- 3-
services of the panel of experts for the Baardhere Project. The project,
to be implemented over a 30 month period, would provide funds for technical
zssistance, training, vehicles, transit accommodation and storage,
furniture and equipment and incremental operating costs.
7.        Project Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$5.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of US$5.5 million
(95%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Somalia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Techni'-al Annex and a map are
a) o attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations the Government agreed that
the following would be satisfactory to IDA: (a) the quRlifications,
experience, and terms and conditions of service of Somali staff appointed
to the core advisory team; (b) the qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment of resident advisors; and (c) the qualifications
and future positions of Somali staff selected for training. Government
agreement was also obtained that consultant services would be employed in
accordance with IDA guidelines; accounts would be properly kept and
audited; and a special foreign exchange account would be established to
easure timely availability of credit proceeds.
9.        Project Justtfitation and Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The
ability of MJVD to effectively supervise the many consultant studies,
evaluate their findings, ari properly integrate the power, irrigation and
flood protection aspects is presently strained by lack of skilled staff
experienced in such work. The proposed technical assistance would
strengthen MJVD so that sound economic judgments can be made about the
Baardhere Project, and if positive, the project can be properly
implemented. The Baardhere Project, if successfully implemented, would
provide the potential for a significant increase in growth of Somalia's
power and irrigated agriculture, which is consistent with the Association's
strategy for adjustment of the Somali economy towards a position of long
term self-sustaining growth. IDA involvement would ensure proper
coordination of the donors supporting project preparation studies and
comprehensive preparation and appraisal of the Baardhere Project. IDA
would also assist in mobilizing external financing, assuming a positive
appraisal outcome and resolution of the riparian issues.
10.       Risks.  It is possible that the Baardhere Project may not be
constructed, for riparian or other reasons. A decision on the Baardhere
Project would be difficult to reach, however, without the proposed
technical assistance, axd therefore the financial outlay involved is a
reasonable amount to put at risk considering the potential gains from the
Baardhere Project. If the Baardhere Project is not implemented, the
manpower trained under the technical assistance project would still provide
lasting benefits for the irrigation and power 4nstitutions in Somalia which
are presently understaffed.

TECHNICAL ANNEX TO THE MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Institutional Framework
1.        MJVD was established In 1982 for the economic and social
development of the Juba Valley, including management and use of the Juba
River. The Ministry has about 100 staff, including 45 graduates in
engineerlng, geology, economles and agriculture. MJVD, headed by a
Minlster and Vice Minister, has two major parts: (a) the planning,
agriculture and finance/administrative section responsible for planning the
development of the Juba Valley, and (b) the Baardhere Dam Project (BDP)
charged with planning the proposed dam. Organizational and functional
changes in MJVD, to ready It for implementation of the Baardhere project,
are being studied by IDA financed consultants under SPPF G018-SO (Price
Waterhouse Associates, Kenya). A decision on the future responsibilities,
organization and strength of MJVD will be reached before appraisal of the
Baardhere project is completed and a comprehensive institutional reform and
strengthenlng program undertaken as part of the Baardhere project. Until
then, MJVD needs (a) high level technical assistance to enable it to
complete project preparation and reach a sound economic decision regarding
implementation, and (b) training to ready its key staff for implementation.
Core Advisory Team
2.        The project would establish a core advisory team in MJVD to
assist in coordinating and evaluating the findings of various consultant
studies financed by several donors for preparing the Baardhere Project,
including:
(a) environmental and social studies (Associates in Rural
Development, U.S.A.);
(b) resettlement and compensation (Halcrow Fox, U.K.);
(c) organizational framework and training (Price Waterhouse
Associates, Kenya);
(d) power optimization (Lahmeyer International, W. Germany); and
(e) Juba Valley Master Plan (Agrar und Hydrotechnik, W.
Germany).
3.        The core advisory team would assist MJVD in (a) making a
comprehensive analysis of the Baardhere Project's viability and
implementation requirements; (b) arranging the necessary cofinancing for
the project; (c) coordinating the appraisal and processing procedures of
the several coflnanciers; (d) formulating recommendations for water and
power charges and related institutional arrangements for operation and
maintenance; (e) supervising the training of MJVD and other staff in
project preparation and implementation; and (f) reviewing cost estimates,
financing plans and annual budgets.



- 11 -
4.        The advisory team would be led by a Somali director (18 m/m) and
would include: (a) 5 other Somali professional staff (90 m/m), includlng
specialists in economics, agriculture, irrigation, electromechanical
engineering, and procurement and administration; (b) three resident
expatriate advlsors totalling 45 m/m (senior dam engineer and advisor to
team leader - 18 m/m; power and transmission specialist '- 12 m/m; and
specificatlons engineer - 15 m/m); and (c) consultant services, includlng
the panel of experts, cofinancing advisors, and other specialists - 48
Mrn/.
5.        The project would provide 6 four-wheel drIve vehicles with spare
parts; 2 PC computers with printers, software and programs; I telex
machine; 2 photocopiers; 2 electric typewriters; and miscellaneous office
furniture and small equipment. Allowances for 15 counterpart staff and
operating costs of the core advising team and its administration would be
provided, together with a 500 sq. meter transit accommodation and storage
facility in the Baardhere Project area.
Otier Consultant Services
6.        The project would include two consultant contracts which were
reviewed by IDA before award:
(a) further engineering services and document revisions
(Electroconsult, Italy); and
(b) power optimization study (Lahmeyer International, W.
Germany).
Training
7.        About 120 m/m of overseas formal training to MS level would be
provided in the fields of englneering, power, economics, planning,
agriculture, irrigation, finance, and administration. In addition, about
42 m/m of 1-3 month short term overseas training would be provided in
project analysis, dam construction and operations, irrigation construction,
operations and maintenance, resettlement administration of multipurpose
schemes, and monitoring and evaluation.  About 60 m/m of on-the-job
training and seminars for MJVD and other project related staff would be
conducted by the core advisory team.
SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
8.        Key project activities and responsible agencies are set out in
Schedule 1. The activities of the core advisory team and studies are
expected to be completed by about July 1989. Training would not be
completed until July 1990, and provision is made to draw on short term
specialists and the panel of experts until July 1, 1990, when the project
is expected to be completed.



- 12 -
Administration
9.        The core advisory team would be responsible to the Permanent
Secretary, MJVD, and would work with and be located in the MJVD offices in
Mogadishu. MJVD would provide 5 full tlme administrative and support
staff, and 15 professional counterpart staff to work directly with and be
trained by the core advisory team.
Recrtiltment
'0.       The administrative and support staff would include two
secretaries with English language capability and word processing
experience; one administrative officer; and two driver/messengers. The
professional counterpart staff (15) would be civil engineers (4), power
engineers (4), agriculture and irrigation specialists (2), economists (2),
social scientists (2) and draftsmen (1).
11.       The team leader and other Somali members of the core advisory
team would be recruited from Somalis presently engaged in project planning
and implementation outside of Somalia or other qualified Somalis not at
present employed by MJVD.
12.       The resident expatriate advisors of the core advisory team would
be recruited through a government agency which has recent experience in
planning, constructing and operating multipurpose dam projects under
conditions similar to Somalia's.  MJVD would seek to establish a twiniing
arrangement with the selected agency so as to benefit from its experience.
Such twinning would include assistance in recruiting suitable advisors,
providing other specialists and advice, and providing Somali staff with
short term on-the-job trainlng in the country concerned. There would be
considerable advantages in MJVD seeking a twinning arrangement since the
nature of the task is to support MJVD's civil service capacity to
administer and supervise the specialist consultants engaged in planning and
design. The twinning arrangement may be expanded to include long term
support during construction and operation if the Baardhere Project is
implemented and thus should achieve better continuity than if consultants
were employed. Furthermore expatriate advisors from the twinning partner
are likely to be lower cost than internationally recruited consultants. If
a satisfactory and cost effective twinning arrangement cannot be concluded,
internationally recruited specialists would be employed instead.
Training Arrangements
13.       Overseas training would be arranged by the core advisory team
through direct placement. Assurances have been obtained that the
qualifications and experience of candidates, the posts they would hold on
return, and the specific training to be undertaken would be satisfactory to
IDA.
Accounts and Audits
14.       Separate accounts of expenditures for the proposed project would
be maintained by the Financial Manager, MJVD in accordance with sound
principles and practices, and audited by an independent auditor



- 13 -
satisfactory to IDA. Audited accounts would be supplied to IDA within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. Assurances on these points were
obtained during negotiations.
Procurement and Disbursements
15.       Procurement.l/ Technical assistance ($2.78 million) would be
contracted as follows.  Somali specialists ($0.20 mi'lion) would be
selected by MJVD with qualifications, experience and terms and conditions
of service satisfactory to IDA. Expatriate advisors ($0.75 million) would
be procured through the twinning arrangement described in para. 12, and
their qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of service would
be satisfactory to IDA.  Short term consultants ($1.07 million) would be
procured by MJVD in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of
consultants. Other consultancy services ($0.76 million) would be procured
in accordance with IDA guidelines. Overseas training ($0.80 million) would
be procured by direct placement. Vehicles ($0.18 million) and furniture
and equipment ($0.24 million) would be procured through international
shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. The civil works contract ($0.25
million) would be procured through a negotiated contract with the quasi
governmental Somall Construction Agency (SCA) which is constructing the 32
km access road from Baardhere town to the dam site. Since the SCA is
mobilized already on site, and the civil works contract is small, its use
would be cost effective. Prior review by IDA would be required for
vehicle, furniture and equipment contracts estimated to cost the equivalent
of $50,000 or more and procured through international shopping procedures.
The civil works contract would also be reviewed by IDA prior to award.
16.       Disbursement for all items would be against full documentation,
except funds for short course training ($0.47 million) which would be
disbursed against statements of expenditure. To ensure timely availability
of funds, a foreign exchange special account totalling $0.2 million would
be established in a commercial bank in Mogadishu. The Closing Date would
be December 31, 1990.
1/ The costs in parenthesis include physical contingencies and expected
price increases.
