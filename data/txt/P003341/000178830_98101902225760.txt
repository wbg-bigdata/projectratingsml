REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A
FORESTRY PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma for
the equivalent of US$24.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance
a project for forestry development. The major part of the proceeds of
the credit (US$22.6 million) would be relent to the Timber Corporation
for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum.
The remaining amount would be utilized by the Government for the Forest
Department and the feasibility studies.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        The latest economic report entitled '"The Current Situation and
Prospects of the Union of Burma" (168a-BA) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 25, 1973. Country data are provided in Annex I.
2.        Burma is the largest country in the south-east Asian mainland and
the country is rich in natural resources. However, most of this wealth is
yet to be developed and the per capita income of Burma is still well below
$100. Burma came out of the Second World War and the struggle for independence
in 1948 economically devastated and politically divided. The fifties were
a period of turbulence, both political and economic. When the present Govern-
ment came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify the country and
complete the social transformation of the economy which had begun in the
forties.
3.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the
attainment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a
problem, particularly in the hill and border areas but there is probably
greater stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization
of all the major sectors with the exception of agriculture has been accom-
plished. Agrarian reform has given the peasants virtual ownership of the
land and eliminated major inequalities in the pattern of landholdings. In
the effort to attain self-sufficiency, most of what little investment there
has been has gone into the development of the industrial sector. This
transformation has been accomplished at the cost of some economic disruption
and its benefits are yet to be reaped.
4.        The Governmen'ts major success has been in the provision of
advanced social services for a population of about 30 million. Efforts
were made to raise the standard of living by reducing inequalities in the
distribution of income, keeping the prices of basic commodities stable and



- 2 -
widening the scope of education and health services. Disparities exist but
incomes are more or less equally distributed and, in the fields of health
and eeucation, Burma has achieved successes surpassing those of much richer
countries. These successes have been accomplished, however, at the expense
of dynamic economic growth. Over the past decade, the rate of growth barely
kept pace with the population, which is growing at around 3% per annum.
5.        The performance of the major sectors has been disappointing.
Agriculture directly provides about one-third of GDP, and much of secordary
and tertiary activity is also based on agricultural products.   Ovrer the
past eecade, the real rate of growth of agriculture (after allowing for
fluctuations due to weather) was less than 2% per annum. The main factors
constraining the growth of agriculture are the disproportionately low Level
of investment in agriculture and the unwilliagness of the Government (tutil
last year) to use pricing policy to stimulate increases in production.   The
low level of investment has left the rice subsector with little technical
capability for further expansion in the short run, and the emphasis on price
stability has been a factor depressing the production of several crops.
6.        Diversification of the overall st;ucture of production has tco
be achieved through an expansion of the shate of industry in GDP, and Burma's
potential for expanding the industrial sector is basically good. So far,
however, Burma has not been very successful in pursuing industrial growth.
This has been due to an important degree to the lack of capital, the slow
growth of agricultural production and the shortage of foreign exchange but
it has also been due to the neglect of the small-scale (largely private)
sector which still accounts for more than half of value-added in manufacturing;
inadeQuate pricing policies; insufficient replacement of existing capacity;
lack of incentives; lack of correspondence with market forces and inadequate
attention to putting the state entezprises on a self-sustained, economic-
ally viable basis.
7.        The foreign trade and balance of payments position provide the
most striking illustration of the continued deterioration of the economy.
Rice is the major export and the most serious consequence of the stagnation
in rice production coupled with an expanding population has been the drying
up of the export surplus. In the early sixties, Burma exported a million-
and-a-half tons of rice a year. Since then exports fell steadily to less
than 100,000 tons in 1968 and 1969, which were poor crop years.   In recent
years, there was a recovery to about 700,000 tons but this is well below
the prewar average of 3 million tons. Exports of teak and minerals which
have good market prospects have dwindled; mineral production is one-tenth
the prewar level and teak production stagnates at the prewar level.
8.        The deterioration of Burma's terms of trade has been particularly
severe since 1968. The 36% deterioration in the terms of trade between
1968 .nd 1971 was almost solely due to the 47% drop in the export price
of rice over this period. The resulting decline in export earnings imposad
a severe limitation of the country's import capacity and hence its economic



development. Over the decade 1961-1971, the purchasing power of Burma's
exports declined by 55% and it was less than 20% of its prewar value in
1971. In 1973 the terms of trade moved in Burma's favor; unfortunately,
on account of the drought and a poor harvest, rice exports were suspended
in 1973. With better crop prospects for 1974 and the expected continuation
of high world market prices for rice, export earnings are expected to
recover this year. In addition, Burma is an oil producing country and its
oil import requirements are margir.al. In 1973, oil consumption amounted
to around 9 million barrels, of whi-h nearly 90% was produced in Burma; the
balance was imported in crude or partly refined forms and represented about
2% of the import bill. An extensive oil exploration program on which great
hopes are based is currently underway with assistance from governments and
foreign oil companies on a contract basis.
9.        Burma contracted several new loans during 1972/73, mostly from
Japan and from the People's Republic of China. As of September 30, 1973,
the total external debt was $415 million, including an undisbursed balance
of $207 million. The average terms and conditions of these loans are very
favorable. The grant element on all the loans taken together is about
53 percent. Even so, repayment obligations have been rising very rapidly
and they were equal to over 60% of disbursements in 1973. The undisbursed
balance of $207 million is expected to be fuLly drawn down over the next
five years and the debt service ratio which is currently 18% is expected to
rise to about 21% by 1975.
10.       GDP in constant prices increased by 1.1% during 1972/73 compared
to 2.5% during the previous year. The main reason for the slow growth of
production was the 7% decline in agricultural output brought about by drought
conditions. Industrial output decreased by nearly 3% in 1972/73. The
expansion of total output would have been even smaller but for the increases
in the output of the mining and services sectors. Mineral output increased
by 5.1% in 1972/73, due primarily to the rise in the production of crude
oil. The value of output of the services sectors increased by nearly 9%.
11.       During 1972/73 consumption grew at a slightly lesser rate than
GNP while gross fixed investment increased by nearly 10%. The ratio of
investment to GNP remained low at around 12Z. National savings remain at
around 8% of GNP. Per capita income in constant prices was K 420 (US$85) in
1973, showing a slight decrease over the previous year. The continued worsen-
ing of the economic situation is also reflected in widening budget deficits
and a weakening of the balance of payments situation. Deficit financing
in 1972/73 amounted to around K 300 million, or about the same level as in
the preceding two years. In the face of declining revenues and increased
current expenditures, the level of capital expenditure had to be cut by 5%
compared with 1971/72 in order to contain the inflationary impact of the
budget deficit.
12.       During 1972/73, the trade balance showed a surplus of nearly $11
million, compared to a deficit of nearly $50 million in the previous year.
This, unfortunately, did not result from any real improvement in the external



- 4 -
sector. Foreign exchange earnings from agricultural products have been
decreasing from $225 million in 1961/62 to $72 million in 1972/73, on account
of rapidly diminishing rice surpluses. Other earnings from exports of forest
products and minerals have remained virtually Etatic over the last ten years
at around $40 million per annum. The near balgnce of trade surplus recorded
during 1972/73 was due to a drastic cut - by about a third - of imports.
The major cutback was in imports of industrial raw materials and producer goods.
13.       As noted in recent economic reports, the assessment of performance
cannot be limited to the criterion of economic growth but must take int:o
account all of the country's objectives. While economic performance has
been poor, Burma's major success over the past decade has been the provision
of advanced social services for a population of about 30 million with a per
capita income of well below $100. These achievements are still there and
these goals are still being pursued but, by now, the possibility of further
social progress is being endangered by the lack of job opportunities for the
growing population and the stagnation, if not decline, in living standards.
14.       The major economic problems continue to be the slow growth of
agricultural and industrial production, the acute shortage of foreign exchange
and the low level of public savings. Current levels of investment cannot
lead to dynamic growth; indeed, they will barely be enough for the task of
rehabilitating existing productive capacity. The shortage of financial resources
has been the dominant factor in determining the low level of investment, and
the problem for Burma is how to mobilize sufficient resources to carry out
an expanded investment program. -Efforts will also have to be made to curtail
the growth of expenditures and improve the management of public sector enter-
prises. The main potential source of domestic savings is the public sector
enterprises, and the task of improving the management of public sector enter-
prises is one which cannot be further postponed.
15.       Another avenue for mobilizing resources for investment is a dynamic
export policy. The world market orospects for nearly all of Burma's tradi-
tional exports are very good. Poor export performance is a direct corollary
of the slow growth of production and considerable increases in investment in
agriculture, forestry and mining are required to increase and diversify produc-
tion for export. At the same time, an increased flow of exports will require
corresponding improvements in export marketing and pricing policies.
16.       The Government is increasingly awarie of these shortcomings and has
begun to take steps to deal with its economic problems. The uniform selling
price of rice has been abolished; the structure and level of wages have been
revised and there is greater flexibility in the use of piece rates, and other
productivity incentives. Interest rates on savings deposits have been
increased. This measure together with the expansion of the banking network
should induce more private savings. The cooperatives are taking over retail
distribution from state enterprises and it is hoped that this relative liberali-
zation will bring about improvements through reduction in stocks and wastages.
In the industrial and mining sectors several schemes have been introduced,
and others are under consideration for improv:Lng efficiency. Though these
measures may not be enough to reverse present trends, most of them represent
steps in the right direction.



-5-
17.       As indicated above, all the macro-indicators point to a difficult
economic situation. This is, ho7ever, partly due to the neglect of the
economy over the past decade, anc! to the steady drop in the purchasing power
of Burma's exports. For these reasons, it would be unrealistic to expect
a major reversal of these trends in the inmediate future. Moreover, the
analysis of the recent economic report indicates that the major economic pro-
blems are deep-seated. Substantial increases in investment over time are needed
to set the economy on the path of growth. The causes for optimism are, however,
the country's resource potential and the evidence that the authorities have
only begun to make an effort to harness some of this potential. To develop
these resources,-even at the modest rate of 4% per annum increase in GDP will
require substantial inflows of foreign assistance.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
i8.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956 and of
IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961 the Bank mkade three loans totalling
$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon (Loan 140-BA) helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths
and storage facilities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment.
Two loans (Loan 139-BA and Loan 274-BA) helped finance the postwar recon-
struction and dieselization of the railways. All three projects were satis-
factorily completed and the loans fully disbursed by FY68. No lending was
requested or made between 1962 and 1973. In June 1973, IDA made two credits
totalling $33.0 million, both for transportation projects. One credit (Credit
413-BA) is helping to rehabilitate the inland waterways fleet, the other
(Credit 414-BA) is helping to finance the rehabilitation of the railways'
assets and acquisition of locomotives and rolling stock. Implementation of
both projects is proceeding satisfactorily. A $17 million credit for an
Irrigation Project was approved by the Executive Directors on June 13, 1974.
IFC has made no investments in Burma, nor is any currently planned. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of May 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of the two ongoing projects. In addition,
the Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed survey for the improvement
of navigational channels in the Rangoon River.
19.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most
immediate constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diver-
sifying production for exports in order to alleviate the critical shortage
of foreign exchange. To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary
emphasis on the development of the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors.
With increasing output from these sectors, Bank Group assistance will expand
to include modernization and expansion of industrial capacity and further
investments in the transport sector.
20.       Two projects are currently being prepared in the mining and
livestock sectors. The mining project, which is being prepared by the
government with UNDP assistance, would help rehabilitate and expand small-
scale tin and tungsten mining including collection and beneficiation



facili7ties.  The livestock project is likely to consist of establishing
livestock development centers, facilities for vaccine production and disease
control, a milk and meat processing and the provision of technical services.
llTis project is being prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Coopera-
tive l'rogram. 'Thnese projects are tentatively scheduled for presentation to
the E-:ecutive Directors in the second half of FY75. A Technical Assistance
Credit for identification and preparation of projects in a number of sectors
is currently being discussed for possible financing by either the Association
or the UNDP in FY75. A telecommunications project is also being considered
for FY75. For FY76, the Bank Group has under consideration a second irri-
gation project, a fourth railway project and a seeds multiplication and
agricultural research project. In addition, the ongoing feasibility study
of Rangoon Port may lead to financ-ng of a ports project.
21.       The Bank Group presently accounts for less than 4% of Burmla's total
external debt outstanding and about 10% of debt service. In five years the
Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to 15-20%
and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE FOREST SECTOR
22.       Burma, with 95 million acres of tropical forests, ranks second
only to Indonesia in forest area in South East Asia. The forests of Burma
cover 57% of the total land area and 52 mil-ion acres of the forest land
are classified as teak hardwood forest. Buima is known to possess about
75% of the world's teak resources. IHowever, although teak has always
been a major source of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for 25% of the
total value of exports, the share of forestry products accounts for only
3% of GDP and the country's valuable forest resource is largely under-
utilized. Over the past decade, the value of forest products increased
at 2.6% per annum. Between 1962/63 and 1966/67, the annual volume of teak
production declined, it picked up the following year, and has since been
stagnant. In 1970/71 the production of teak was 358,000 tons - still well
below the prewar level of 477,000 tons. Total hardwood production in 1970/71
was almost double the prewar level but only slightly above the 1961/62 level.
23.       The state-owned Timber Corporation (TC) has the monopoly for teak
and hardwood exploitation and is the sole exporter of timber products. The
Corporation also controls the milling of timber by operating its own sawmills
and hiring private facilities.   TC suffers from the same institutional weak-
nesses as all other public sector enterprises in Burma, namely, the lack of
financial and managerial autonomy. Fixed capital is provided by a budget
allocation with no interest or repayment obligations except when foreign
loans are involved. Working capital is also largely provided through the



-7-
budget as a non-commercial appropriation. Since both fixed and liquid assets
bear no charges, public sector enterprises are generally not very cost-conscious.
Budgeting and costing are not used as management tools; inventories are too
high; management information systems and coordination among operating depart-
ments are inadequate. Managerial autonomy is strictly limited to operational
matters and Directors have no say in personnel policy, pricing, marketing,
etc. In addition, all public sector enterprises have suffered from the acute
shortage of foreign exchange. Provisions for depreciation, replacement and
maintenance of equipment have been woefully inadequate even when, as in the
case of the Timber Corporation, the enterprise has an operating surplus.
Faced with these constraints, TC has done extremely well in keeping its equip-
ment tunning and maintaining production levels. The staff of the Corporation
is well-disciplined and technical standards of operation are good but in need
of improvement. Forest management and administration is the responsibility
of the Forest Department in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and is
generally of a high standard.
24.       The timber industry in Burma is presently facing serious problems
owing to declining capacity at each stage of production - felling, extraction.,
transportation and milling, and to continuing insurgency in some forest areas.
Since 1964, the volume of timber exports has declined largely because log
production levels could not be maintained. After felling, the initial handling
of logs is traditionally done by elephants and buffaloes, but the present
stock of elephants is about half the prewar level, and the number of buffaloes
used in forest operations has been decreasing. TC is thus facing an extreme
shortage of extraction capacity aggravated by the lack of timber trucks and
the condition of the mechanized equipment which is old and cannot be properly
maintained because of the lack of spare parts. Over the past decade, the
investment in mechanical extraction capacity has not been sufficient to
maintain existing equipment.
25.       After extraction, teak logs are floated down the forest creeks
and main rivers to the sawmills and log export depots. River floating is
the main mode of transport for teak and accounted for more than 80% of the
tonnage moved in 1970/71. As much as 20% of the tonnage delivered to the
forest creeks is estimated to be lost during raft floating, but logs cannot
be diverted to other modes because of the lack of adequate road and rail
facilities. Most of the teak for export is processed in Rangoon, and it
can take up to four years for a log to reach the city after extraction. The
lack of handling and transport facilities is thus another constraint to the
expansion of timber exports and the output of the sawmills.
26.       Burma's forests are capable of sustaining a substantially higher
annual cut than at present. In order to clear up the backlog of girdled teak
trees waiting to be extracted and to harvest the potential annual allowable
cut, 346,000 log tons, TC's extraction capacity would have to be stepped up
by more than 50% for a period of at least 10 years. The current Plan
(1971/72 to 1974/75) gives high priority to increasing the production and
export of forest products, and the long-term market prospects for increased
exports of teak and other hardwoods are good. Timber exports thus offer
possibly the best prospect of increasing the country's foreign exchange
earnings in the near future.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       In recognition of the potential and priority of the forestry
sector in Burma's economic development, the Government submitted proposa:Ls
for consideration by the Association for the development of the sector in
Septem6ber 1971. Following the visit of an economic mission in the spring
of 1972, and an identification mission in the fall of 1972, the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program (CP) visited Burma in the spring of 1973 to assist the
authorities in detailed project preparation. An appraisal mission visited
Burma in September/October 1973 to appraise the project. A report entitled
"Appraisal of a Forestry Project" (No. 374a-BA) is being circulated separate-
ly. A summary of the credit and project is attached as Annex III.
28.       At negotiations held in Washington in May 1974, the Government of
Burma was represented by a delegation led by U Chit Moung, Deputy Minister
for Planning and Finance.
Description and Implementation
29.       The main purpose of the project is the rehabilitation and
improvement of timber extraction operations in five extraction agencies of
TC in South Central Burma. The immediate objective is to increase the
country's foreign exchange earnings by removing from the project area the
backlcg of 250,000 log tons of teak, maintaining teak extraction at its
annual allowable cut of 65,000 log tons level, and trebling the extraction
of other hardwoods to 143,000 log tons per annum. The project includes: the
construction and upgrading of access and feeder roads; the procurement of
equipment for log extraction, transport and workshops; minor rehabilitation
of sawmills; technical assistance for training and the engagement of five
specialists; supervision vehicles for the Forest Department and feasibility
studies of future forestry development projects. (For details see Annex III.)
30.       Lack of good roads within the forest area and to main delivery
stations has long hampered timber operations and prevented full utilization
of logging equipment. The road construction and upgrading program is thus
a critical component of the project. The construction and upgrading of
project roads which are all earth roads would be spread over five years
and are widely scattered. It would therefore not be suitable for inter-
national competitive bidding. There are no private contractors operating
in Burma. Road work will therefore be performed on force account by TC.
Construction of roads would make it possible to reduce the log transit period
from 3-4 years to about one year, and eliminate heavy upstream losses.
31.       The procurement of timber extraction equipment and the rehabilita-
tion of existing equipment would make it possible to increase the logging
period from 110 to 250 days a year. With the high input of mechanical



-9 -
equipment for extraction and road construction, efficient workshop facilities
become vital. Provision is made in the profect for workshop and administration
equipment including vehicles and supplies in the project area.
32.       Funds have also been included in the project to ensure that
nilling facilities in the project area would be able to handle increased
production. Arrangements would be made to provide overseas training for
sawmill managers and to engage a sawmill ex3ert who would assist the Timber
Corporation in improving the efficiency and productivity of existing mills
in the project area, and provision is made _n the feasibility studies for
the selection of other sawmills for future improvements and construction.
33.       In addition to the sawmill expert working with TC, four inter-
nationally recruited specialists (road engineer, extraction engineer,
workshop engineer and management accountant) with operational and training
responsibilities would assist the Project Director in-the planning and
implementation of the project. A small amount (US$332,000) has been included
in the project for the Forest Department to provide inspection vehicles and
trucks presently lacking in the project area.
34.       The proposed project is considered as the first stage of a program
for the planned development of Burma's forestry sector. Consequently, funds
are provided in the credit for detailed and coordinated studies of Burma's
forest-based industries. These studies covering the whole country are
required to determine the steps necessary to vitalize existing forestry
operations, and to assess the future role of wood-based panel industries
and the pulp and paper industry in the country's industrial development.
Provision is made in the project for the overseas training of Burmese
counterparts in undertaking these studies.
35.       The management of TC is generally weak and considerable time and
effort will be required to put the agency on a more efficient and commercial
basis of operation. The proposed credit provides technical assistance to
undertake studies of and make recommendations for the institutional improve-
ment of TC. Project implementation would be by a special Project Unit,
within the Timber Corporation headed by a Project Director and strengthened
by experienced specialists. The Project Unit would be a seperate division
of TC vested with complete autonomy in operational matters. PU would also
have greater financial autonomy than is currently given to other public
sector enterprises. Project implementation would be carried out with the
assistance of a Project Planning Committee while a Project Review Committee,
including representatives from the Ministries of Planning and Finance and
Agriculture and Forests, would advise on business policies and investment
planning. It is intended that the operation of the Project Unit would serve
as a demonstration model for improved system and management practices that can
be extended to other extraction agencies within the TC complex. Project
implementation would take five years.

Cost and Financing
36.       The total cost of the project is US$35.8 million, of which about
US$24.0 million is the foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA credit
would finance the entire foreign exchange component and would be the first
for forestry development in Burma. The bulk of the proceeds of the credit
(US$22.6 million) would be relent to the TC for 15 years, including five
years of grace at 7-1/4% p.a.   The balance of the credit (US$1.4 million)
would be utilized by the Government for the Forest Department and the
feasibility studies. The local currency requirements could be met out of
self-generated funds.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Procurement of road construction machinery (US$4.8 14), extraction
and workshop equipment (US$10.8 m), and vehicles (US$1.1 M) would be by
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Office
equipment and research supplies (US$0.1 M) comprise items of small value
and would be obtained directly from overseas manufacturers. As spare parts
for rehabilitation of existing extraction equipment (US$0.8 M) and sawmlills
(US$0.6 NM) are specific by make and model, international competitive bidding
procedures are not appropriate. These items would be procured directly
from ,-he manufacturers of the relevant equipment or their agents . Technical
specialists and consultants for feasibility studies would be engaged
following IDA guidelines for selection of consultants.
38.       IDA would disburse against the cif cost of imported goods.    IDA
would also pay all foreign exchange costs of expatriate staff engaged for
the project, and of overseas training and travel costs for Burmese staff.
Justification
39.       The project would, over a ten-year life, produce about 780,000
log tons of teak and 855,000 log tons of hardwood. It is estimated that
the project would generate incremental foreign exchange earnings of about
US$175 million and additional budgetary revenues of US$114 million equivalent
in the form of royalties, income tax, sales tax, import duties and interest.
Tlie economic rate of return on the project is conservatively estimated at
100%, reflecting the-fact that the project would, at limited cost, remove
production bottlenecks whiclh have hitherto prevented the efficient develop-
ment of a valuable natural resource. Sensitivity tests have shown that even
if costs were to increase by 40% accompanied by a fall in timber prices of
40%., the project would still show an economic rate of return of 33%.
