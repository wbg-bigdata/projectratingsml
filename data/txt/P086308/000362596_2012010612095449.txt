                Re:      Amendments to Definition of “Incremental Operating Costs? , “Training? and
                         “Project Management Costs? in subject Legal Agreements

        Excellency:

                  We refer to the legal agreements for the projects set out in Attachment I to this amendment
        letter (individually a “Legal Agreement? and collectively, the “Legal Agreements?) between the
        Republic of Yemen (“Recipient?), on the one part, and the International Development Association
        (“the Association?), on the other part, as amended to date. We also refer to our recent discussion to
        amend the definitions of “Incremental Operating Costs?, “Training? and “Project Management
        Costs?, as applicable, in the subject Legal Agreements to explicitly include as eligible expenditures
        the reasonable costs of expenditure related to international travel and per diem.

                 Please note that in evaluating whether such costs are reasonable, the Association will,
        among other factors, take into consideration the agreement between the Recipient and the
        Association on the calculation of international travel and per diem for project implementation units
        set out in the minutes to the Country Portfolio Performance Review Committee Meeting, dated
        November 3, 2010.

              We propose to amend the Legal Agreements as set out below. For the purposes of these
        amendments, the term “Recipient? is to be read as “Borrower? if the Legal Agreement is a Credit.

                Accordingly, the Legal Agreements are hereby amended as follows:

        1.      The definition of “Incremental Operating Costs? in the Legal Agreements shown in Part A
        of Attachment I is amended as follows:

                ““Incremental Operating Costs? means the reasonable cost of expenditures incurred on
                account of Project implementation, management and monitoring, including utility
                charges, maintenance and insurance of vehicle, fuel, office supplies, office rental,
                banking charges, communication and translation services, advertising, consumables,
                mailing and shipping costs, travel costs, per diem, audit costs and salaries and labor costs
                but excluding salaries of officials of the Recipient and the purchase of vehicles.?
2.      The definition of “Incremental Operating Costs? in Section IVA.2 of Schedule 2 of the
Development Credit Agreement for the Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Project (listed in Part B
of Attachment I) is amended as follows:

        ““Incremental Operating Costs? means the reasonable cost of expenditures incurred by
        the Recipient and SFD on account of Project implementation, management and
        monitoring, including maintenance of vehicles, fuel, office supplies, banking
        charges, communication services, travel costs, per diem, salaries and labor costs but
        excluding salaries of officials of the Borrower.?

3.      The definitions of “Incremental Operating Costs incurred by the PAU? and “Incremental
Operating Costs incurred by the PMU? in the Appendix of the Financing Agreement for the
Secondary Education Development and Girls Access Project (listed in Part B of Attachment I) are
amended as follows:

        ““Incremental Operating Costs incurred by the PAU? means the reasonable cost of
        expenditures incurred by the PAU and by the Recipient on account of Project
        implementation, management and monitoring for Parts A.1(b), A.2, B, C, and D of the
        Project, including office supplies, communication and translation services, audit costs,
        travel costs (including transport, fuel and per diem), vehicle maintenance, advertising,
        mailing and shipping costs, and support staff but excluding the salaries of officials of the
        Recipient’s civil service.?; and

        “Incremental Operating Costs incurred by the PMU? means the reasonable cost of
        expenditures incurred by the PMU on account of Project implementation, management and
        monitoring for Part A.1(a) of the Project, including office supplies, communication and
        translation services, travel costs (including transport, fuel and per diem), vehicle
        maintenance advertising, mailing and shipping costs, and support staff but excluding the
        salaries of officials of the Recipient’s civil service. “?

4.    The definition of “Training? in the Legal Agreements shown in Part C of Attachment I are
amended as follows:

                ““Training? means Project related study tours, training courses, seminars,
                workshops and other training activities which are not included under goods or
                service providers’ contracts, including reasonable costs of training materials,
                space and equipment rental, travel, per diem costs of trainees and trainers’ fees,
                and interpretation and translation services.?

5.     The definition of “Project Management Costs? in the Legal Agreement in Part D of
Attachment I is amended as follows:

        ““Project Management Costs? means the reasonable cost of expenditures incurred by the
        Recipient on account of Project implementation, management and monitoring, including
        utility charges, rent for office space, maintenance of vehicles, fuel, office supplies,
        banking charges, communication services, audit costs, travel costs, per diem, salaries and
        labor costs and other consumables but excluding salaries of officials of the Recipient and
        the purchase of vehicles.?
All the terms and conditions of the Legal Agreements that have not been amended hereby shall
remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the confirmation on the
