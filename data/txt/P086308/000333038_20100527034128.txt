  A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

     1. Country and sector issues
1.      As the only low-income country in a r i c h region, the Republic o f Yemen faces major
development challenges. A country o f deep rooted tradition, it has limited natural resources -- notably
scarce water, limited arable land and declining o i l reserves. In the last two decades, it has experienced
dramatic external and internal shocks. Nearly h a l f the population o f Yemen i s below the age o f 15 and the
population i s expected to double over the next 20 years. Despite the constraints, Yemen developed a
multi-party democratic system and a relatively free press ahead o f other countries in the region.

2.      Although considerable improvements have been achieved over the last 30 years, Yemen s t i l l
faces the core development challenges o f reducing poverty and improving human development indicators.
An estimated 42 percent o f the population lives in poverty and Yemen ranked 15 1St out o f 177 countries
o n the 2005 Human Development Index. After the c i v i l war o f 1994, Yemen undertook difficult
economic reforms and saw the benefits through growth in per capita incomes and private investment. This
progress stalled between 2000 and 2005, when the momentum on economic and governance reforms was
not sustained. Recently, the situation has begun to improve following the implementation o f economic
reforms in July 2005 and renewed commitment from 2006 t o the reform o f governance systems.

3.       With continuing high population growth, and facing depletion o f i t s o i l reserves over the next
decade, Yemen needs urgently to improve its investment climate, develop non-oil sources o f growth, and
create jobs for the rapidly growing number o f young people entering the labor force. Growth o f the labor
force has averaged 4.5 to 5.0 percent annually since 2001 and youth unemployment i s estimated at 19
percent. The informal sector accounts for some two thirds o f total employment, while agriculture accounts
for more than half. Recent economic reports indicate that sectors with the greatest potential opportunities
to drive Yemen's future development include fisheries, industry and manufacturing, construction,
services, tourism, transport and communications, and handicrafts.

4.       While education and skills o f the labor force are an important factor in Yemen's capacity to
reduce unemployment, the creation o f new jobs on the required scale will also depend fundamentally on
macro-economic stability and improvement in the investment climate. The government i s aware that
coping with the medium term macro-economic situation, with the prospective decline in o i l revenues, will
require difficult policy measures to rationalize government expenditure and increase the tax effort, as well
as structural reforms to facilitate non-oil private sector development and enhance the effectiveness o f
public financial management.

5.       Serious weaknesses in the investment climate also need to be addressed to facilitate
diversification and j o b creation in the private sector. In a recent World Bank survey', Yemen ranked 90*
out o f 155 countries for which the overall ease o f doing business was assessed, and 15 1st on the ease o f
starting a business. The most serious constraints cited by enterprises relate to administrative and
governance problems and fiscal management. The government's reform program includes measures that,
when effectively implemented, would ease these constraints: civil service reform, financial sector reform,
and the 2006 National Agenda for Reform which incorporates direct actions to overcome some o f the
regulatory and administrative constraints facing enterprises in Yemen.

6.       The labor market i s characterized not only by oversupply o f labor in relation t o existing demand
but also by mismatches between supply and demand. About one in four firms, notably the larger ones, cite

doing business. A significant challenge for the education system as a whole i s t o ensure that the
knowledge and skills imparted through its programs are those that are required by the labor market.

7.      Within the education sector, the m a i n focus has been o n improving access to basic education
("compulsory" Grades 1-9), through the government's Basic Education Development Strategy which has
multi-donor support. Substantial gains have been made over the last decade and the gross enrollment rate
in basic education has reached almost 70 percent. The demand for secondary and tertiary education has
consequently expanded: between 1996 and 2004, enrollments in secondary and tertiary education
                                                                         n
increased by more than 80 percent, albeit f r o m a very low base. I i t s efforts to meet the increased
demand for post-compulsory education, the government i s confronting the challenges o f improving the             .
relevance o f curricula to changing labor market and social needs, and increasing the efficiency o f public
expenditure. W o r k o n the strategy for secondary education has focused o n the need to increase access for
girls and to develop more diverse, relevant, and cost effective curriculum options. The national strategy
for higher education i s directed to a leaner and more cost-effective higher education system.

8.        Technical education and vocational training, under the Ministry o f Technical Education and
Vocational Training (MTEVT), provides courses at post-basic and post-secondary levels. I t has also been
growing rapidly but i s still relatively small, accounting for only one in 200 students at all levels and one
in eight tertiary level graduates. Less than one percent o f TEVT students are women. The private training
sector i s extremely small, confined mainly to language and computer instruction. A Sector Profile carried
out in 2003, with support o f the W o r l d Bank and the EU, identified the following k e y issues in the Yemen
TEVT system:

9.        Access and equity. While TEVT enrolment has been progressively increasing during the last
decade, the current program framework i s responsive only t o a limited number o f citizens and for limited
employment opportunities. There i s an evident need for the TEVT system to increase public and private
training capacities and t o be more responsive t o the needs o f other target groups. The ability to be more
responsive i s currently constrained by: (i) small number o f TEVT institutions; (ii) imbalance in
                                              the                                           an
terms o f geographic distribution o f training opportunities; (iii)o w utilization levels o f existing TEVT
                                                                      l
              n
institutions. I response t o concerns o n access and equity, the government i s investing substantially in the
construction o f new training centers throughout the country. However, due to the issues noted below, the
capacity t o use these centers effectively and efficiently has yet to be established.

 10.     Quality, relevance, and linkage with employers. The predominant characteristic o f the Yemeni
TEVT sector at the present time i s i t s strongly supply-driven approach. Despite some attempts at reform,
linkages between the TEVT system, labor markets, and private sector enterprises continue t o be weak.
There i s a lack o f cooperative training and l o w use o f potential training opportunities in enterprises.
Despite initiatives t o upgrade curricula, many weaknesses persist. The training capacity and quality o f
programs i s constrained by the lack o f tools and equipment required t o develop graduates' competencies
that are mandatory for employment in the respective occupational areas. Staffing i s a major problem:
instructor qualifications are poor and wages are too l o w to attract trainers with enterprise-based work
experience.

 1 1.    Institutional capacity. Until 2001, when the Ministry o f TEVT was established, responsibility for
training activities was shared by the General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training, the
Ministry o f Education, and other public providers. Capacity in the n e w ministry i s still very weak. The
current structure o f the MTEVT shows weak linkages between the different departments. The
organizational and regulatory structure for institutes - budgets, programming, enrolments, staffing,
operational procedures - are determined by the MTEVT, allowing little means or incentive at the institute
level for innovation t o improve quality or efficiency.


                                                   2
 12.     Finance. The current TEVT system operates on the basis o f negotiated annual budgetary
allocations. While these allocations satisfy immediate operational needs, they are inadequate to address
increased staffing needs, equipment needs, training material development or system upgrading. T h i s
results in the delivery o f low-quality training, and a consequent l o w level o f efficiency.

 13.      The Skills Development Fund (SDF) was established in 1995, with support through the first
Vocational Training Project, with the aim o f enhancing the funding base for TEVT institutions. However,
it faced serious shortcomings in fulfilling i t s mission, including legal ambiguity on i t s mandate and
governance, difficulties and expense in revenue collection, and in particular ambiguity in the respective
roles o f the MTEVT and the private sector. Although revenue collection i s n o w effective (subcontracted
to the internal revenue service), the SDF does not have sound mechanisms for allocating its resources. An
in-depth organizational audit o f SDF operation in 2005 found the organization to be seriously
dysfunctional.

14.      Overall, the sector faces very difficult challenges. There i s strong social demand for expanding
VT opportunities, in addition to the recognized need for more and better training to support diversified
growth o f the private sector. However, the on-going substantial public investment in VT infrastructure
cannot be expected to translate into sustainable provision o f useful training without (i)   commensurate
recurrent funding for on-going design and delivery o f quality programs and (ii) financing and
                                                                                          a
institutional framework that promotes efficiency and responsiveness to demand.

The Government's Strategy for TEVT
 15.      TEVT Strategy: The proposed reorientation o f the TEVT system has been developed within the
overall development framework o f Yemen as expressed in the Strategic Vision 2025, the 2"d and 31d Five
Year Socio-economic Development Plans, and the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Yemen's Strategic Plan
for TEVT was prepared in 2004, drawing on the information and analysis in the Sector Profile. The
primary focus o f the strategy i s to shift from supply-driven to demand-driven orientation, and to improve
equity in access to VT opportunities. The Strategic Plan identifies a series o f strategic goals - including
diversification o f programming, development o f labor market linkages, devolution o f management
responsibilities, improvement o f training centers' capacity to respond to employer demand and meet
equipment and staffing needs, diversification o f financing and development o f a financing plan. It also
comprises a comprehensive implementation plan detailing the activities, responsibilities and timelines
associated with pursuit o f the strategic goals during the initial four-year period 2004 - 2007. The basis o f
the strategy i s sound and government commitment to the strategy remains high. However, within existing
institutional and implementing capacity, the plans proved overly ambitious and limited progress has been
made on the scheduled activities aimed at re-orientation o f the system.

16.      Policy for sector expansion. Plans for expansion o f the system, on the other hand, have
progressed rapidly. The government i s in the process o f implementing an ambitious policy o f quantitative
expansion o f the sector, w i t h substantial increase in the public investment budget. The number o f
currently active institutions i s 64, a further 59 are under construction, and the ministry plans to establish
another 128 new institutes (including 18 community colleges, 54 technical and 56 vocational) by 2012.
The Bank has urged caution concerning the scale and manner o f expansion: the program needs to be
better founded on prospective labor market demand and information on program outcomes; and it needs
to account fully for the recurrent cost implications and the "software" requirements for effective
development o f programs and instructors.

17.    Existing regulatory framework. Despite improvement through a Ministerial Decree in 2002,
which provides regulatory by-laws concerning the delivery by public training institutes o f services to the



                                                   3
market, the existing regulatory and financing framework does not provide adequate means and incentives
for the demand-orientation advocated in the Strategic Plan, nor does it encourage institutes t o use
transparent channels in responding to market opportunities. The Government o f Yemen (GOY)i s aware o f
this and i s drafting revised regulations t o simplify and clarify the procedures at the institute level for
revenue generation and for contracting o f trainers and skilled labor f r o m the market. For the longer term,
the MTEVT i s keen to work towards a system o f performance-based financing.

 18.    Policy for the Skills Development Fund. In 2005, the Cabinet announced the proposed closure o f
a number o f development funds, including the SDF, which were found not t o be fulfilling their mandates
effectively. In the context o f preparation o f this project, a Policy F o r u m was held, t o bring together the
public and private sector stakeholders to discuss the question o f reform or cancellation o f the SDF. The
outcome was a strong commitment, subsequently endorsed by the government, to reform and restructure
the SDF with support through the project, under a revised l a w which would grant operational autonomy to
the SDF under private sector management. Consensus has been reached o n a revision o f the l a w which
has been approved by Cabinet for submission t o Parliament.

      2. Rationale for Bank involvement
19.      The government i s giving high priority t o the TEVT sector and recognizes the challenges facing
the sector. The benefits o f investment in public TEVT programs - and the implementation o f Yemen's
TEVT strategy - depend critically o n developing appropriate institutional arrangements and capacity. The
respective roles o f the central ministry, training institutions, and the private sector need to be more clearly
and appropriately defined and broadly understood; and capacity building programs are needed t o match
the respective functions. MTEVT i s a young ministry with limited capacity in i t s core functions o f policy
development and strategic planning, evaluation, and information management. Public training centers are
centrally managed and financed and lack sufficient autonomy or capacity to innovate and adapt t o local
needs and opportunities. At the same time, the capacity o f private sector employers t o assess and
articulate their training needs or organize effectively i s s t i l l very weak, contributing t o mutual distrust
between the public and private sectors.

20.      Responding t o strong political pressure t o expand training opportunities, the government i s
financing the construction o f new centers through large scale borrowing from regional development
banks. However, this does not include assistance in meeting the related "software" needs o f program and
staff development. The government i s aware o f this gap, and o f the need for reforms that can promote
better responsiveness o f training programs to employment needs, and has asked the Bank for assistance
specifically t o address these institutional constraints.

21.     The overall a i m o f the project, therefore, i s to help move the sector in a demand-driven direction.
On the basis that interventions are needed on both the demand and supply sides to achieve this, the project
includes measures to create and strengthen linkages between employers and training providers f r o m both
sides: it will pilot mechanisms within the MTEVT training institutions to involve employers in the design
and delivery o f training programs; and at the same time it will strengthen the capacity o f employers,
through the Slulls Development Fund, to identify and finance their training needs. F o r the benefit o f
sector policy-making, planning and decisions o n resource allocation, the project will also strengthen
capacity in the MTEVT t o support the proposed move to performance-based monitoring and budgeting.

22.     The Bank has substantial experience in assisting governments with designing and implementing
reform programs in the education sector in Yemen. The Bank i s well-positioned to help identify best
practice in other countries with similar development challenges that can help to inform the reform process
in Yemen. Having provided continuous support t o the first Yemen Vocational Training project and
subsequent work on the strategy for TEVT, the Bank i s a major development partner in the sector. The



                                                    4
Bank i s also in a unique position to help strengthen the links between TEVT reform, economic
development and growth and reforms in other sectors, including employment, the private sector, export
development and budget reforms, as well as other education sectors.

23.       The Bank has been actively supporting other parts o f Yemen's education system through
analytical work and lending, including support to the development o f national strategies for basic,
secondary and higher education, sector work on the issues and options for secondary education, on-going
lending operations in basic and higher education, and a secondary education project under preparation.
T h e government and the Bank, together with other education donors, are now embarking on efforts to
integrate the sub-sectoral strategies, and the 2006 CAS provides for analytical work in FY08 to support
the development o f coordinated sector-wide planning and budgeting. Initial activities, financed through
the Education Program Development Fund, include a sector-wide simulation model that was developed in
the course o f the sector work o n secondary education, and a tracer study to be carried out in 2007 o f
general secondary and vocational secondary school graduates. In this context, the proposed project for
vocational training will help to produce better information, through Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
activities, for basing decisions on resource allocation within the sector as a whole.

    3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes
24.     The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Yemen o f M a y 2006 articulates the role o f vocational
training in two pillars o f the assistance strategy: (i)
                                                       diversifying growth through better governance and
better delivery o f public services, and (ii)improving human development through more efficient service
delivery and improved safety nets. In addition, the project will support financial analysis and the
development o f a financing strategy for the sector which will contribute to the third CAS pillar o f
increasing fiscal sustainability and improved public expenditure management.

25.      By helping enterprises in Yemen to identify their skills development needs, and demonstrating
how training providers can develop better programs to meet these needs, the project will support
improvements in productivity, competitiveness and j o b creation in growth sectors o f the economy. These
higher-level benefits will depend on concurrent improvements in other elements o f the investment
climate. The project will target sectors - fisheries, food processing and construction - that have been
identified as having important growth potential in Yemen. These sectors also have significant linkages to
employment in the informal sector o n which a high proportion o f the country's poor depends.

 B. PROJECT D E S C R I P T I O N

    1. Lending instrument
26.     The Bank support for this project will be financed through a Specific Investment Credit (SIL). By
using the S I L as the lending instrument, the Bank can focus its assistance on selected interventions to help
address some key institutional constraints in the system. The viability o f comprehensive and longer term,
programmatic approaches to investment in the sector will depend on improvements in the institutional
environment.

    2. Project Development Objective and K e y Indicators
27.     The objectives o f the project are to provide the public training system with improved mechanisms
for responsiveness to employment needs, and to enhance the capacity and effectiveness o f the Skills
Development Fund in articulating and financing the training needs o f enterprises.

28.    This will be achieved by: (i)developing a planning and monitoring capacity in MTEVT oriented
to employment demand; (ii) piloting mechanisms for employer participation in the design and delivery o f



                                                   5
new pre-and in-service training activities in target sectors (fisheries, food processing, construction), and in
enhancing the occupational slulls o f instructors; and (iii)    supporting reform o f the Slulls Development
Fund. The project has two sets o f beneficiaries: the public training system; and the Skills Development
Fund.

29.         The following key outcome indicators will be applied to monitor project achievements:

      0   Satisfaction o f employers in the target sectors with the availability, quality and relevance of: (i)
          pre-service training; and (ii)
                                       in-service training.
          Satisfaction o f employers with the effectiveness o f SDF intermediary services and o f SDF-financed
          training.

30.     These indicators will be tracked through a survey to be conducted in years zero (baseline), three,
and six o f project implementation. In the intervening years, progress towards achieving the project
development objective will be tracked through intermediate outcome indicators. In addition to providing
systematic data on the above outcome indicators, the survey will support other monitoring instruments in
providing feedback o n lessons learned in the pilot activities, t o inform decisions on adjustments needed in
implementation arrangements and on replication o f the new mechanisms in other institutes and/or sectors.
Arrangements for the collection and use o f data are explained in Annex 3 .

      3. Project components
3 1. .  The proposed project would finance three major components, summarized below. The detailed
description o f components i s included in Annex 4.

Component 1: Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Management (US$3.01 million total, including
contingencies)

Sub-Component 1.I : Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$1.44 million)

32.      This sub-component will help to address two existing constraints to efficient, effective and
sustainable operation and viable expansion o f VT services in Yemen: (i)       weakness o f the information
base for decision-making, including information on the costs and outcomes o f training and on
employment needs; and (ii) o f appropriate incentives to promote demand-responsiveness and cost
                               lack
effectiveness. T o do this, it will focus on building relevant capacity in the MTEVT through a Planning,
Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E) team within the Ministry, reporting to the Vice Minister. The team
will comprise a leader, two PM&E officers, and an administrative assistant, to be assigned from within
the Ministry staff, together with a long-term advisor to be financed through the project.

33.      The project will finance the provision o f goods, technical services and training for the following
activities:

          establishment and development o f a Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation system within MTEVT;
      0   capacity building on PM&E functions and processes at central, regional and institute levels;
          development o f indicators and M&E framework with systems and procedures for data collection
          and analysis;
          development o f a basic management information system;
          canying-out o f tracer studies, employer surveys, and incorporating data requirements to Household
          Budget surveys;
          assistance in the development o f a performance based monitoring and budgeting system for
          MTEVT training institutions.


                                                     6
Sub-component 1.2: Project Management (US$1.57 million)

34.      The objectives o f this sub-component are to: (i) ensure effective administration and coordination
o f the project activities under Components 1 and 2; and (ii)     consolidate reporting requirements for all
project activities including Component 3. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established, staffed,
and supported as needed by national or international short-term consultants. The sub-component will
finance goods, technical services and training for strengthening the institutional capacity o f the PMU to
ensure effective coordination and administration o f the project.

Component 2:        Design and Delivery o Training Programs (US$lO. 14 m i l l i o n total, including
                                         f
contingencies)

35.      The central purpose o f Component 2 i s t o pilot a series o f initiatives - at the pre-service, in-
service, and instructor training levels - that will demonstrate the benefits to be gained f r o m collaborating
with employers, and incorporating the expectations o f employers, in all phases o f the process o f
occupational skills development. Activities are included in each sub-component, designed t o monitor
implementation, identify constraints and opportunities as they arise, assess the outcomes, and engage the
respective MTEVT departments in a manner that will facilitate wider replication o f the innovations where
benefits have been demonstrated.

Sub-component 2. I : Technician Level Programs (US$6.13 million)

36.      This sub-component will pilot the development and delivery o f new technician-level programs o f
international standard in four existing training institutes, t o meet identified needs in the target sectors o f
construction and food processing. The project will finance (i) twinning program which will provide
                                                                     a
technical services for project management and program development, training and fellowships for
instructional staff, (ii)
                        small c i v i l works for the construction o f one workshop at the Hada Technical
Institute and minor rehabilitation o f other facilities; and (iii) procurement o f instructional equipment
                                                                  the
and supplies.

Sub-component 2.2: In-Service Training (US$2.23 million)

37.     This sub-component will pilot approaches for improving the capacity o f public sector training
providers to respond more effectively t o employer-defined in-service training needs in the target
economic sectors o f construction, food processing, fisheries and seafood processing. This will be
achieved through the establishment o f Skills and Employment Liaison Units (SELUs) in the same four
training institutes that will be delivering the relevant pre-service programs. The SELUs will undertake
outreach activities with local enterprises, help in identifying training needs, and develop and market
services t o meet these needs. The project will finance technical services through the twinning program t o
support establishment o f the SELUs; training for S E L U stafc contracting services for program
development and delivery; equipment, materials and local transport costs for outreach activities.

Sub-component 2.3: Instructor Development (US$I. 78 million)

38.      Although more than 70 percent o f MTEVT instructional staff hold relevant degrees or diplomas,
very few have employment experience in the field for which they were trained. T h i s sub-component will
pilot approaches in four existing training institutes t o strengthen the occupational s h l l s and competencies
o f a cadre o f 48 Master Instructors through collaboration with the employer community in the following
occupational fields: civil works; commerce, accounting and business administration; electrical and
electronic maintenance; and mechanical maintenance. The project will finance technical services from




                                                    7
international subject specialists, training costs for work placements, fellowships, seminars and workshops,
employer participation in program design and delivery, and equipment.

           :
Component 3 Reform o the Skills Development Fund (USrSl.85 m i l l i o n total, including contingencies)
                    f

39.     The objective o f this component o f the project i s to support the reform and restructuring o f the
Skills Development Fund (SDF) under revised legislation.

40.     F o r this purpose, the project will finance a long term advisor (to assume the post o f Managing
Director o f the SDF for three years, and to train a permanent counterpart t o take over the role), short-term
technical assistance, workshops and training, and equipment to support the following activities:

        restructuring the SDF organization and staffing;
        developing, implementing and refining the SDF's operating mechanisms and procedures;
        building the capacity o f SDF staff;
        establishing an SDF management information system.

      4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
41.      The project design reflects key lessons learned in relevant Bank-supported projects and sector
work in the region, and in the first TEVT project in Yemen. W o r l d Bank experience in the training sector
has demonstrated the importance o f developing public-private partnerships and o f allowing a degree o f
operational autonomy in sector institutions. The proposed project incorporates both o f these principles.
The project also takes account o f the lessons learned in the preceding project in Yemen, in particular: (i)
engagement o f the private sector in governance and financing requires concrete project activities,
technical services, and incentives to promote participation - it cannot be assumed to come automatically;
(ii)the government's capacity t o design and undertake complex sector reform should not be
overestimated - the agenda for systemic reform should be realistic; (iii)        project design should set
priorities, focusing o n the country's major labor market needs; and (iv) project readiness for
implementation i s critical and the capacity o f the implementing agency should be established in advance
o f project effectiveness.

42.         The experience in establishing the Skills Development Fund under the first Vocational Training
Project, together with international experience with funds o f this type, provided lessons that have been
fully incorporated in project design. In particular, the objectives, mandate and role o f the fund need to be
made clear and endorsed in appropriate legslation; the fund needs managerial and operational autonomy
if it i s to operate effectively; and the fund should focus o n intermediary services without engaging itself in
the delivery o f training. Under the first project, conflicts arose in particular through ambiguity in the
respective roles and responsibilities o f public and private sector stakeholders. The revised l a w for the
SDF, which has been approved by Cabinet, was drafted through intensive dialogue among the key
stakeholders who have reached a consensus o n clear principles for reform. A further lesson fi-om the first
project concerns the high level o f technical support that i s needed in the early years o f establishing a new
institution o f this kind in Yemen. The SDF will be charged with implementation o f i t s own component, to
match i t s newly autonomous status and t o help build i t s capacity in international procurement and
financial management procedures, and it will be supported with substantial training and technical
assistance through the project.

      5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
43.      Several alternatives were considered in the choice o f strategy and project design:




                                                    8
      0      Consideration was given to the possibility o f maintaining support to the sector through policy
             dialogue but postponing further project assistance, given the relatively weak performance o f the
             first vocational training project, the constraints to sustainability o f new operations in the sector,
             and the dangers o f the current practice o f rapid sector expansion led by investment in
             infrastructure. T h i s possibility was rejected because o f the high importance placed by the
             government on the continuing role o f the Bank in the sector, and the demonstrated level o f
             commitment to reform o n the part o f policy-makers in the government and leadership o f the
             Skills Development Fund.

             The possibility o f a comprehensive, large scale project to include most o f the goals and actions
             identified in the national sector strategy was rejected because the experience o f the first project
             (and projects in other sectors) has demonstrated the importance o f matching project ambitions to
             implementing capacity. The possibility o f a project to meet the "software" requirements in
             commissioning some o f the newly constructed training centers was rejected because it would tend
             to endorse the supply-driven approach to sector expansion and because o f concerns about
             sustainability.

      0      Project design was originally intended to focus pilot activities in geographical areas but was
             changed during preparation to target specific economic sectors and occupational fields. I t was
             considered that this approach would better promote communication between training providers
             and employers and would be more effective in ,testing and demonstrating the demand-driven
             approach.

 C. IMPLEMENTATION

      1.      Partnership arrangements
44.     Dialogue and coordination have been maintained during project preparation with donors active in
the sector in Yemen. Three donors are collaborating in the project: GTZ, who are financing a long-term
international advisory position in the SDF; the Netherlands and DfID who are financing a Trust Fund to
support implementation-readiness activities (including technical services to assist in preparation o f a
detailed monitoring plan, operational manuals, terms o f reference, bidding documents, and to help
develop implementation plans for SDF reform, as well as training, workshops, and operating costs for the
PMU). N o formal co-financing o f the project i t s e l f i s envisaged, unless further needs or opportunities
arise during the course o f implementation (such as for specific technical services to support policy
development, or for the costs o f replicating and scaling up successful project interventions).

      2.      Institutional and implementation arrangements
45.     There will be two parallel implementation arrangements, with oversight by a Steering Committee
(SC), chaired by the Minister o f MTEVT and including: (i) Chairman o f the SDF Board o f Directors;
                                                               the
(ii) Vice Minister o f MTEVT; (iii)
    the                                     four MTEVT Deputy Ministers; (iv) a representative o f the
Ministry o f Planning; and (v) a representative o f the Ministry o f Finance.

      0    Components 1 and 2 will be implemented by the MTEVT, w i t h the support o f the Project
           Management Unit (PMU), under the leadership o f the Minister, through the existing ministry
           operational structure. Relevant directorates, departments and training institutes will implement and
           monitor activities each under their respective responsibility. The P M U will be located within the
           premises o f MTEVT, to facilitate its daily interaction and coordination with MTEVT in providing
           technical and administrative support for implementation.

     0   Comuonent 3 will be implemented by SDF under the supervision o f its Board o f Directors. The
         SDF Managing Director i s accountable for the implementation o f the component under the SDF
         implementation structure. The SDF will not have a project unit as such. Procurement, financial,
         accounting and reporting functions under the Credit will be assigned to competent members o f the
         SDF staff.

Component 1: Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management
I.I Monitoring and Evaluation.

46.      The project will establish a Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E) team in the MTEVT.
The team will comprise four Ministry staff assigned by the Vice Minister - a team leader, two PM&E
officers, and an administrative assistant - and will be supported by a long term advisor and short term
consultants financed by the project. Under the general supervision o f the Deputy Minister for Planning
and Projects, the team will report to the V i c e Minister and will work in close collaboration with the
Director General o f Planning and with other departments in the ministry.

I .2 Project Management.

47.     MTEVT will be supported by a PMU t o coordinate project implementation and monitoring, t o
manage procurement and financial management aspects, process all withdrawal applications from the
Special Account for Components 1 and 2, and t o consolidate reporting o n a l l project activities, including
the SDF component, t o the SC and IDA.

Component 2: Design and Delivery o Training Programs
                                  f
48.       In order to ensure an integrated implementation approach, the technical services for a l l three sub-
components will be consolidated in a single contract for a twinning program with an international
consortium or joint venture partnership with strong project management expertise as w e l l as technical
expertise. This contract will be managed by the PMU in coordination with relevant directorates and
institutions. Terms o f reference for this assignment will be prepared by June 2007 through technical
services financed by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund.

49.      Each o f the three sub-components will be: (i) by the relevant Directorate General in the
                                                              led
MTEVT, under the supervision o f the respective Deputy Minister; (ii)          coordinated through a working
group chaired by the relevant Director General and comprising key staff at the governorate level and in
the pilot institutes; and (iii)
                              supported by a l o n g term technical advisor through the twinning program. F o r
sub-component 2.2, the outreach units (SELUs) will be accountable to the institute director w h o will be
responsible for implementation in hisher institute.

Component 3: Reform o the Skills Development Fund (SDF)
                     f
50.      The SDF i s responsible for the implementation o f Component 3 under the supervision o f its
Board o f Directors. The SDF Managing Director i s accountable for the implementation o f the component
under the SDF implementation structure. SDF will assign staff responsible for procurement and financial
management functions under the project, and these staff will receive training in IDA guidelines and
procedures prior to project effectiveness. Annual plans, budgets, procurement plans, and quarterly
progress reports will be prepared by SDF and submitted t o the SC, through the PMU who will consolidate
this information with outputs f r o m Components 1 and 2, and will offer guidance if requested by the SDF.
The SDF will be supported by a long-term advisor for the planning, implementation, and monitoring o f
Component 3.




                                                   10
5 1.   First drafts have been prepared o f Operational Manuals for the PMU and SDF respectively. These
manuals are being further refined and fine-tuned with technical assistance through the Multi-Donor Trust
Fund and will be finalized by M a y 2007.

    3. Monitoring and evaluation o f outcomeshesults
52.     The monitoring and evaluation function i s especially important for this project, due t o the focus
o f Component 1 on developing M&E capacity, and the focus o f Components 2 and 3 on piloting new
mechanisms. The P M U will have overall responsibility for coordinating M&E for Components 1 and 2,
with inputs from the PM&E team and from the twinning consortium contracted for Component 2. The
relevant department in SDF will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation o f Component 3.
Existing capacity for M&E in both the MTEVT and the SDF has been assessed as extremely weak; and
building this capacity i s an explicit objective o f the project. Technical assistance for the development o f
detailed project monitoring plans i s being financed through trust funds. Training in M&E activities will
be provided through the project to staff o f the MTEVT and the SDF. The project will thus support
development o f the Borrower's M&E system for the sector as well as providing for monitoring progress
in achieving the project development objective.

53.       Project monitoring instruments will include employer surveys and tracer studies. Detailed design
o f all the monitoring instruments will be completed by June 2007 through technical services funded by
the new Yemen Education Sector Multi-Donor Trust Fund. While project funds have been allocated to
meet essential M&E costs, it i s proposed that M&E activities will be strengthened through additional trust
fund resources during the course o f implementation.

54.      Monitoring and evaluation under the project will serve two functions: (i)  monitor the progress o f
the project on its development objectives; and (ii)    provide on-going feedback on the obstacles and
opportunities encountered during implementation, so that project activities can be adapted and
arrangements refined on the basis o f experience. The primary instrument for M&E will be a survey o f
employers and MTEVT staff, to include structured questionnaires and focus groups. This survey, which
will track progress for all three project components, will be carried out three times, counting the baseline
survey, at approximately 3-yearly intervals, and will be contracted through the P M U to independent
specialists. The survey will be supplemented by: (i)   M&E outputs o f the Ministry's PM&E team; (ii)
structured reporting required o f the consortium supporting Component 2; (iii)     M&E outputs and annual
reports by the SDF; and (iv) regular project implementation progress reports o f both the PMU and the
SDF, consolidated by the PMU.

55.     Detailed design o f the survey instrument and terms o f reference for the baseline survey will be
contracted to specialists, funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. The terms o f reference for this
assignment also include detailed planning o f the arrangements for results monitoring, to confirm and
elaborate the arrangements for results monitoring (as outlined in Annex 3) and to ensure effective
coordination o f the inputs from all sources.

    4. Sustainability
56.     The proposed project i s closely aligned with the national strategic objectives and complements
government- and other donor-financed activities. The objective, focus and project components reflect
GOY decisions arising f i o m discussions with both the Bank and other cooperating partners, indicating
clear ownership. Strong commitment to the project objectives has been demonstrated both at the senior
government level and by private sector leaders, including the Board o f the SDF. Both the MTEVT and
Ministry o f Planning and International Cooperation have expressed strong endorsement o f the project's
focus on `institutional development and the resulting priorities in project expenditures, w i t h technical
services and training accounting for a high share o f project costs. This emphasis on institutional


                                                  11
development i s seen as an essential complement to the substantial on-going investment in new
infrastructure. The project i s designed to help address underlying sustainability issues in the sector.

57.      The impact o f the Components 1 and 2 o f the project will depend on the sustainability and
replication o f successful pilot activities after project completion. The government has committed to
financing the incremental recurrent costs, including additional posts and other staff-related costs,
associated with project activities, during the course o f project implementation and after the project closes.
Close monitoring o f pilot activities under the project will feed into decisions on the part o f the ministry to
replicate the new mechanisms in other institutes andor sectors, and into policy development for the sector
as a whole.

58.    The SDF (Component 3) already has sustainable financing arrangements in place and this
component will not have recurrent cost implications. The project will finance technical services, computer
equipment and staff training to support the institutional sustainability o f the SDF.

  D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

     1. Economic and financial analyses
63.      The project's development objectives are consistent with both the GOY'Sand the Bank's
development strategies. The students who graduate from pre-service and in-service training programs that
have benefited from a quality increase resulting from the project are expected to help address currently
existing mismatches between labor demand and supply, and contribute to the strengthening o f promising
non-oil sectors that employ large shares o f the poor. I t i s estimated that between 2008 and 2023, the
project could produce 3,360 graduates from targeted pre-service programs (including replicated programs
after project implementation), and provide improved in-service training t o 18,000 employees. Although
impeded by a lack o f updated and reliable data, a cost benefit analysis has been conducted, resulting in an
estimated net present value (NPV) o f $7.1 million and an internal rate o f return (IRR) o f 17.5 percent.

64.      Despite the promising potential benefits o f the project, a number o f substantial risks exist both
within and outside o f the scope o f the project, which might jeopardize the full realization o f benefits.
With regard to the latter, although it i s recognized that the GOY i s taking actions to address existing
constraints to improving labor market outcomes, impediments to macro-economic stability, growth, and a
growth-conducive investment climate could substantially hinder the realization o f project benefits even if
the project i s implemented as planned. The main identified risks within the scope o f the project relate to
institutional and financial capacity, which could lead to implementation delays, a lower than expected
quality o f targeted programs, or a lack o f replication after project implementation. Although the
possibility that identified r i s k s materialize i s considered to be high, a sensitivity analysis carried out on
the cost-benefit estimates indicates that project benefits remain positive even if assumptions change
substantially. Details are presented in Annex 9.

    2.   Technical
65.     The project design i s grounded in sector work and strategy development in Yemen supported by
the Bank and the EU, and draws on lessons o f experience from the earlier project in Yemen and from
practice and experience in other countries. With hnding through the Japanese PHRD Grant, and
subsequently through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund by the Netherlands and DfD, the MTEVT's project
preparation team was substantially supported by international and local experts in carrying out
background work and detailed development o f components, ensuring that design i s informed by sufficient
knowledge o f country conditions and international good practice.

66.      The proposed approach to supporting institutional reform and capacity building i s through
piloting and adapting to experience in the process o f project implementation, rather than starting with a
reform blueprint. A strong focus on M&E will facilitate regular feedback to adjust the priorities for
technical services and training, so that institutional arrangements can evolve to fit country conditions and
a feasible pace o f implementation. The appraisal mission found a strong commitment o n the part o f public
and private sector stakeholders to develop effective partnerships in the VT sector, and also awareness that
overcoming existing distrust will be difficult. The nature o f the partnership arrangements will have to
evolve through trial and error to suit the Yemen context, w i t h the emphasis on developing transparent
procedures that can help overcome the distrust. This approach will require intensive monitoring and
supervision.




                                                    13
67.     The criteria for selection o f target sectors were: (i)
                                                              actual and potential growth o f output and
employment; (ii) existence o f significant training gaps at the technician level as identified by
                    the
             i ithe
employers; ( i ) extent o f SME and informal sector linkages; (iv) export revenue potential in at least
one o f the sectors,;and (v) significant female employment potential in at least one o f the sectors.
Fisheries, food processing, and construction were found to best meet these criteria. The IT and
Communications sector was found to be a strong candidate but was omitted because program
development i s already supported by other donors.

    3. Fiduciary
68.      Financial Management. The initial financial management assessment conducted during pre-
appraisal (July 2006) was concluded in the appraisal mission (November 2006). I t was conducted to
determine the soundness o f current arrangements, discuss the proposed implementation arrangements, and
accordingly agree on the financial arrangements that need to be in place. The project i s proposed to be
implemented by two different entities: the first i s the MTEVT-PMU, for Components 1 and 2 (US$13.16
million); the second i s the Skills Development Fund (SDF), for Component 3 (around US$1.84 million).
A revised law for the SDF has been agreed between stakeholders and approved by Cabinet for
presentation to Parliament.

69.     Financial management risk assessment identified for the PMU and SDF i s rated Moderate and
High respectively. The maintenance o f the existing FM arrangements, in addition to other mitigating
measures, as per the agreed upon action plans detailed in Annex 7, which will be closely monitored
during project life, i s expected to bring the residual FM risk for each entity to Low and Moderate
respectively.

70.     In line with the agreed detailed action plans, MTEVT and SDF have completed the following
preparation activities: MTEVT has launched the procurement process for accounting software, drafted the
FM manual, designed I F S formats, and i s hiring core PMU staff; SDF has appointed an accountant, and
designed I F S formats.

71.      Procurement. T h e appraisal mission carried out a detailed procurement capacity assessment o f
the MTEVT (for Components 1 and 2) and o f the SDF (for Component 3) as part o f prior and post
formation o f the proposed establishment o f a P M U in the Ministry, and o f the assignment o f SDF staff,
within the existing SDF organizational structure, to handle project-related procurement and financial
management activities. The assessment reviewed the proposed organizational structure for implementing
the project and the interaction between the staff o f the P M U responsible for procurement and the
Ministry's relevant central units for administration and finance. As the procurement activities under
Component 3 will be carried out by the SDF, the SDF has appointed a procurement officer, although IDA
will not finance any o f the SDF's staff.

72.       T o ensure smooth and timely implementation o f the different procurement activities, the PMU
and i t s procurement officer will be supported by a short-term Procurement Advisor in support of: (i)
quality control for project procurement documents and process and contract management particularly for
the large technical services contract to be financed under the proposed credit; (ii)     on-the-job capacity
building for newly recruited SDFPMU procurement officers; and (iii)       procurement planning, drafting o f
terms o f reference, preparing guidelines and procedures. The proposed procurement arrangements
(presented in Annex 8) are based on the above mentioned procurement agency procurement capacity
assessment undertaken during the appraisal mission. A procurement plan has been submitted, satisfactory
to IDA, for the first 18 months o f the implementation phase o f the proposed operation.




                                                 14
      4. Social
73.      Although the project does not include specific social development objectives, the following
indirect social benefits may be expected: the availability o f better information o n the social characteristics
o f students in different VT programs will facilitate future measures to promote equity o f access; increased
relevance o f training programs to employment demand will improve the employability and incomes o f
training recipients; and public access to better information on training needs and the effectiveness o f
training programs (including through tracer studies) will enable households and students to make better-
informed decisions. A study on gender in the sector was camed out during project preparation, to ensure
that project design incorporates opportunities to promote the inclusion o f women as project beneficiaries.
Gender i s not a major theme o f the project, but it was a criterion in the selection o f target sectors (a
growing number o f women are employed in food processing) and in the selection o f occupational fields
for instructor development (which include commerce and accounting, with a relatively high share o f
female students and instructors).

74.        Project design has benefited from extensive consultation and dialogue with central and regional
staff o f the MTEVT and the SDF, employer representatives in the target sectors, and with staff o f the pilot
training institutes, ensuring strong ownership o f project objectives and activities. A series o f regional
workshops i s on-going, financed through the Multi Donor Trust Fund, to increase understanding o f the
requirements and roles o f different actors in project implementation.

      5.   Safeguard Policies
75.     This project does not trigger any safeguard policies. The focus i s on provision o f training and
technical services for building institutional capacity. Activities are to be located in existing institutions -
n o new training centers are to be constructed and n o significant environmental implications are
anticipated. The project will not involve any relocation o f people.
76.      Some small works will be carried out in four existing training centers, to adjust existing facilities
to the needs o f the new training programs that will be introduced through the project. These comprise the
construction o f one workshop at Hadda Institute and minor interior modifications in the other three
institutes. The contracts for these works, to be managed by the PMU, will include clauses on appropriate
disposal o f construction debris.
77.     International technical services for Component 2 o f the project i s to be consolidated in a single
contract with a consortium which will combine technical and project management expertise and twinning
partners. The responsibility for ensuring high environmental standards in the new training programs will
be an integral part o f the terms o f reference for this assignment. This will apply both t o the conduct o f the
training activities and to the content o f the curricula - for technicians in the construction and food
processing sectors - including measures to assure adequate health and safety standards and good practice
in waste disposal.

      6. Policy Exceptions and Readiness
78.        N o policy exceptions are sought.

                          Annex 1: Country and Sector o r Program Background


    Country Background

The Republic o f Yemen was formed in 1990 by the re-unification o f N o r t h and South Yemen. Since re-
unification, Yemen has coped with several shocks, including repercussions o f the first Gulf war, c i v i l war
in 1994, and internal security challenges. Nevertheless, Yemen has succeeded in developing a multi-party
democratic system: two Parliamentary elections were held in the 1990s and the most recent in 2003; the
presidential system i s based o n direct elections and the current President was reelected through a direct
presidential election in 2006. There i s a relatively free press in Yemen.

Despite achievements over the last three decades, significant development challenges remain. An
estimated 42 percent o f the population o f 19.2 m i l l i o n (in 2004) live in poverty with a higher
concentration in rural areas. Yemen ranks 151st out o f 177 countries o n the 2005 Human Development
Index. There has been an increase in average l i f e expectancy (up from 41.6 years in 1970 to 63 in 2003)
with women's life expectancy mirroring the overall trends. Similarly, there has been a significant increase
in enrollment rates in basic education (up from 3 m i l l i o n in 1996 to 4.1 m i l l i o n in 2004). However, there
are many remaining areas o f concern including: high fertility rates (population growing at over 0.5
m i l l i o n people per annum); infant and child mortality; maternal mortality; malnutrition (1 8 percent o f the
population or about 3 m i l l i o n people) particularly for children under 5; and l o w female literacy rates
which stood at 28.5 percent in 2002. With continuing high population growth, and facing depletion o f its
o i l reserves over the next decade, Yemen needs urgently to improve i t s investment climate, develop non-
o i l sources o f growth, and create jobs for the rapidly growing number o f young people entering the labor
force.

Job Creation and the Labor Market Context

 m
A appropriately educated and skilled work force can be an important contributing factor to j o b creation.
Labor market outcomes - the possibility for employers t o find suitable workers and for workers t o find
good jobs - does not depend o n education and skills alone, however, but o n five inter-linked sectors
(captured in the `MILES' framework): macro-economic growth and stability; investment climate; labor
institutions; education and skills; and social protection. The importance o f each o f these sectors and their
relevance in the Yemeni context are described below.

Macro economic growth and stability2. A sound and stable macro-economic fkamework i s an essential
prerequisite for j o b creation, providing entrepreneurs with an enabling environment t o expand their
business and to create new jobs. In Yemen, despite a number o f recent positive developments, macro-
economic uncertainty poses major constraints t o businesses (see fig. 1).

Since 1999, GDP growth has steadily slipped as the GOY became distracted f r o m maintaining the
momentum o f reforms. Pressures for fiscal prudence lessened as revenues rose significantly f r o m the
increases in o i l prices since 2000, and internal conflicts increased since 2000, ending the steady decline in
violence over the preceding five years. The privatization process stalled, the introduction o f a General
Sales Tax and the reduction in petroleum subsidies were repeatedly shelved, political commitment for
legal and judicial reforms wavered, and the pace o f c i v i l service modernization and health sector reforms
slowed. Private investment slumped in 1999 and continued t o fall steadily to reach 10 percent o f GDP,

    only h a l f o f the average during the period o f reforms. From 1999-2004, GDP growth steadily averaged
    only 3.6 percent per annum and growth per capita was less than 0.4 percent o f GDP per year.

Mainly as a result o f high o i l prices, economic growth rebounded to almost 4 percent o f GDP in 2005.
Reforms that were stalled since 2001 were restarted when in July 2005 a reform package was approved
that included the modernization o f public financial management and a simplification and cut in custom
tariffs. In 2006, the National Agenda for Reform / Matrix o f Good Governance Measures was approved,
which includes actions to fight corruption and facilitate private sector development. Several other
reforms, however, such as the introduction o f a uniform general sales tax, are s t i l l delayed, and indicators
o f long-term fiscal sustainability worsened in 2005.

Although the short run macro-economic situation in Yemen looks manageable, medium-term prospects
are more worrisome. They can be managed through a set o f policy measures and reforms which will need
to include rationalization o f government expenditure, an increase in the tax effort, and structural reforms
to facilitate non-oil private sector development and to enhance the effectiveness and credibility o f public
financial management.

Investment CZimate. Firms will expand and create formal sector jobs when the costs o f doing business,

burden, discretion in implementingregulation, and taxation are among the top constraints to private sector
development. O f the six most binding constraints to firms, four relate to governance problems and the
remaining two relate to fiscal management (figure l).4        A number o f reforms that would improve the
business climate are currently in various stages o f implementation and include civil service reforms,
financial sector reforms, and a number o f projects to develop the agriculture and fisheries sectors.
Moreover, the National Agenda for Reform which was adopted in 2006 includes a number o f actions to
improve Yemen's investment climate, among others by reducing the time and costs o f business
registration, reducing the time for customs processing, and increasing the clarity and fairness o f the
system governing business inspections.

Labor Institutions. When employment regulations are flexible, and non-wage costs o f labor are low,
f i r m s have more incentives to hire new formal sector workers. Only 12 percent o f domestic f i r m s in
Yemen consider labor regulations to be a major or very severe constraint to doing business. Hiring and
firing procedures are relatively easy, and particularly firing costs are l o w compared t o other countries in
the MENA region. Regulations on working hours, however, are rigid.

Education and Skills. A well educated and well skilled labor force contributes to the overall investment
climate. Good education and appropriate skills strengthen individuals' productivity and employability,
thereby improving their opportunities for finding and retaining better jobs. The GOY'S focus o n
improving access to basic education has born h i t . In 2004/2005, gross basic enrollment rates were 76
percent. Since the beginning o f the new millennium, enrollment in basic education increased by an
average 5 percent per year, with an average annual rate o f 8 percent for girls. Nevertheless, girls' gross
enrollment rates are s t i l l much below those o f boys. Similar trends occurred in secondary and tertiary
education: total enrollment increased and the gap between females and males narrowed, but female gross
enrollment rates are still less than h a l f o f those o f males in secondary education, and less than 40 percent
o f males in tertiary education (Table 1).

Although educational attainment i s on the rise, the education system faces problems with generating the
knowledge and skills that are required on the labor market. Despite high unemployment rates and
abundant labor supply, almost a quarter o f f i r m s (particularly the larger ones), consider the difficulty in
finding workers with relevant s l u l l s and education as a major or very severe constraint to doing business.
It i s assumed that these mismatches are partly due t o the choice o f education type and subjects o f students
(e.g. university vs. TVET, or social vs. technical sciences), and partly to an incompatibility o f graduates'
competencies and skills to changing labor market demands and needs. The challenge for the GOYi s to
ensure that knowledge and skills acquired through the education system are those that are required by the
labor market.

Social Protection. A well designed social protection system contributes to j o b creation and enhanced
worker protection. I t increases the acceptance o f flexible labor regulations, and provides protection and

opportunities to vulnerable groups. Since poverty in Yemen i s widespread, the social protection system i s
important for many households. Public and private transfers provide a substantial source o f livelihood for
the poor and account for about 8 percent o f total expenditures o f the average household. However, there
are no comprehensive risk-reducing mechanisms, such as labor market policies and program^.^ Most o f
the existing public social protection mechanisms have limited coverage, are not well targeted (with the
exception o f the Social Fund for Development) and are inefficient in terms o f providing adequate
protection for those in need. With the assistance o f the World Bank, the Government i s planning to
undertake a comprehensive review o f the social protection sector and plans to formulate i t s Social
Protection Strategy outlining the main directions for sector reforms based on this review.6

Mismatches in Labor Supply and Demand

Labor supply. Yemen's labor force reached 5.7 million people in 2004, equal to 28 percent o f the total
population, or 54 percent o f the population between 15 and 64 years o f age. O f the adult population, 70
percent o f women and 23 percent o f men were neither employed nor l o o h n g for work. The 2004 official
unemployment rate was 11.6 percent, with higher rates for women (12.5 percent) and particularly for the
young (18.7 percent).' T h e GOY'SFive Year Development Plan 2006-2010 put unemployment at 15
percent in 2005. According to the 1999 labor force survey, almost h a l f o f the unemployed are between
age 15 and 24. From 2001 to 2004, the labor force grew with an average annual rate o f 4.2 percent,
adding approximately 225,000 persons to the labor force each year. Due to both demographic trends and a
continued increase o f female labor participation, labor force growth rates are expected to remain high in
the short and medium term (Table 2).

According to the 1999 labor force survey, unemployment rates are fairly similar across education levels
and types, with the exception o f unemployment among general secondary education graduates, which i s
well above the official average o f 11 percent. There are, however, large differences in participation and
employment rates. Both participation and employment rates are high for TVET and university graduates,
and much lower for those who completed general secondary education or less. The difference may be
partly due to the relatively large share o f women in secondary education or below, who do not participate
in the labor force (Table 4).

Labor demand. Yemen's labor market i s characterized by i t s large number o f small and medium
enterprises, and i t s large informal sector. According to the 2003 Labor Market Survey, almost 60 percent
o f the economically active population consists o f employers and unpaid family members. Informal jobs
are estimated to make up almost two thirds o f total employment.

O f those who are employed, more than half are active in apculture. Around 10 percent work for the
public administration and defense sectors. Another 8 percent work in education, health, and social
services, o f which around 6 percent point are assumed to be public jobs. The largest non-agricultural
private sectors are wholesale and retail (1 1 percent), construction (7 percent) and, to a lesser extent,
manufacturing (4 percent), and transport and communication (3 percent). From 1994 to 1999, the share o f
employment in public administration, and in the transport and communication sectors has gone down (by
23 percent and 40 percent, respectively). The share o f employment has risen in the education and
wholesaleh-etail sectors (by 50 percent and 22 percent) and, perhaps as it provides jobs o f last resort, in
agriculture (4 percent).




                                                  20
Female education i s particularly concentrated in agriculture. Only 12 percent o f economically active
women were employed outside the agnculture sector in 1999 (down from 15 percent in 1994), mainly in.
education (4 percent) and manufacturing (3 percent). The decrease in the public administration's labor
demand in the second half o f the 1990s has been rather unfortunate for female non-agricultural
employment rates, as 25 percent o f women in non-agricultural employment worked in the public sector in
1994 (Table 5).

Labor mismatches. The growth o f the labor force i s not matched by equally high growth rates o1 ,dbor
demand. Even in the period from 1994 to 1999, which was a peak period o f growth in post-unification
Yemen, labor force growth far exceeded net employment creation. As labor force growth i s expected to
remain strong in the short and medium term, Yemen's employment creation performance needs to be
significantly and structurally improved to provide jobs for those who enter the labor market, and for those
who are currently unemployed. While the o i l sector dominates the economy (generating 27 percent o f
GDP) it provides only just over 20,000 jobs, and projections indicate that production might decline unless
major o i l reserves are discovered. As the public sector i s generally overstaffed, n o j o b creation should be
expected in that sector. Job creation will therefore need to come from the non-oil private sector. The
World Bank's draft CAS identifies agriculture, including fisheries, and services as areas which should
carry the burden o f j o b creation.' The GOY considers agnculture, fisheries, and manufacturing, as well as
tourism, construction, trade, and re-export, to be among the most important promising sectors in the
Yemeni economy, and intends to further develop these sectors.'

Labor market mismatches occur not only when labor supply and demand do not meet in terms o f
numbers, but also when the labor force does not possess the knowledge and skills that employers demand,
According to the 2003 Labor Force Demand Survey, the lack o f relevant qualifications and experience o f
the labor force are the principle reasons that employers experience difficulties in filling positions.

    Within the framework o f this project, the GOYhas identified two essential non-oil areas with employment
    and economic growth potential, which would benefit from an increased supply o f adequately skilled
    workers and technicians, and which have strong links with the informal sector:"

'
    -    Construction. The construction sector i s one o f the largest sectors in Yemen in terms o f employment.
         While there i s no concrete data on i t s contribution to the national economy, there i s a high level o f
         membership from this sector o f Chambers o f Commerce, and general observation witnessed large
         scale construction throughout Yemen. There i s a high demand for qualified staff in the areas of,
         among others, laboratory and testing, topography, plumbers and fitters, and casting technicians. Many
         o f these positions are currently filled by expatriate workers.

    -    Fisheries and food processing. Fish and seafood are one o f the major resources in Yemen. The
         expansion o f the fishery sector and a move toward higher value-added non-seafood processing i s one
         o f Yemen's most promising avenues toward increased national food-security, non-oil related exports,
         and economic growth. It has a high employment generation potential. Both in fishery and food-
         processing, there are marked shortages o f technician level personnel having skills related among
         others to quality control, sanitation and hygiene, secondary processing, production management,
         process control, machine maintenance, power generation, and refrigeration.

    Yemen's Education System

    After the pre-primary schooling, the formal education system in Yemen i s composed o f three levels: basic
    education, post-basic education and higher education as illustrated in the following diagram.

Within the education sector, the main focus has been o n improving access to basic education
("compulsory" Grades 1-9), through the government's Basic Education Development Strategy which has
multi-donor support. Substantial gains have been made over the last decade and the gross enrollment rate
in basic education has reached almost 70 percent. The demand for secondary and tertiary education has
consequently expanded: between 1996 and 2004, enrollments in secondary and tertiary education
increased by more than 80 percent, albeit from a very l o w base. The number o f students in basic
education increased from 3 million in 1996 to 4 million in 2003/04. Secondary enrollments increased
from 324,000 to 589,000 over the same period, but only 30 percent are girls.

 n
I i t s efforts to meet the increased demand for post-compulsory education, the government i s confronting
the challenges o f improving the relevance o f curricula to changing labor market and social needs, and
increasing the efficiency o f public expenditure. The government has just completed preparation o f i t s
strategy for secondary education which addresses the need t o increase access for girls and develop more
diverse, relevant and cost effective curriculum options. The strategy for technical and vocational training
focuses on shifting from a supply to a demand orientation and increasing the participation o f employers in
program design and delivery. In the higher education sector, work i s ongoing to finalize a national
strategy that focuses attention o n a leaner and more cost-effective higher education system.

A particular characteristic o f the education system at the TEVT and university level in Yemen i s that the
pyramid o f graduates i s the inverse o f that required by the labor market. A t the base are high numbers o f
university graduates, while at the summit there are small numbers o f graduates from vocational institutes.
The international standards for developing countries indicate that for three graduates from the TEVT,
higher education will provide one graduate. Yemen has seven graduates from university for one graduate
from the TEVT system. Furthermore, the preponderance o f university graduates are those who have
received a theoretical education in subjects such as social sciences, literature, or anthropology. This
structure i s inconsistent with labor market needs, thus aggravating the qualitative gap between labor
supply and demand.

Yemen's TEVT System

The still-small TEVT sector comprises an important component o f the Yemeni education system with a
mandate linked directly to social and economic development o f the country. Recognising this mandate,
the TEVT sector has gained increased importance as an instrument o f national policy in terms o f poverty
alleviation, labor market development, and rationalisation o f the education system. There i s substantial
popular pressure for expansion o f TEVT opportunities.

In 2001, the Ministry o f Technical Education and Vocational Training (MTEVT) was established through
the consolidation o f training activities previously undertaken by the General Authority for Vocational and
Technical Training, the Ministry o f Education, and other public providers. The MTEVT comprises six
general administrative departments and four thematic sectors. The four sectors under the direct
supervision o f the Minister and the Vice Minister include the following principal functions relating to
TEVT design and delivery: (i)    standards and quality covering four General Directorates; (ii)
                                                                                              curricula and
continuous education covering three General Directorates; ( i )      i i labor market and private sector
relationships with four General Directorates; and, (iv) planning and projects covering four General
Directorates.

MTEVT regional offices, accountable both to the central Ministry and the Governorate, are responsible
for the administration o f activities undertaken by the respective training centres and institutes. Regional
offices supervise the training institutions and channel the resources and budget according to the capacity



                                                  23
and the specialties in each institution. Regional offices are able to readjust and develop curricula within
the limits o f 20 percent o f the content and according to the specific needs o f their catchments' area.

There are three levels o f vocational training available for trainees depending on the number o f years in the
program, and the institution providing the training. Vocational training centres provide training o f two
years duration, open to graduates from basic education. Vocational institutes deliver a more technical
education lasting three years. Technical education, which i s delivered by technical institutes, i s available
for secondary education graduates as an alternative to university studies. This lasts 2 or 3 years depending
o n the subject.

       In 2003 the Ministry o f TEVT supervised 54 operational institutes and centers -- 43 vocational
       centers and 11 Technical institutes - with 35 other new centers undergoing restructuring, searching
       for financing, being built, or in need o f equipping. The operating 54 centers and institutes provided
       training for 12428 trainees in 26 specialities. Among the whole number o f students, only 717 girls
       (0.57 percent o f the total number) were registered in these institutions.

       By 2006, the number o f active institutions had grown to 64, with a further 59 under construction, and
       plans to establish another 128 new institutes (1 8 community colleges, 54 technical and 56 vocational)
       by 2012.

       n
       I addition, there are more than fifty TEVT private providers, who mostly cover a limited number o f
       specialization's including computer and language training. The total training enrolment capacity was
       estimated at some 4000 trainees in 2003.

       Besides the MTEVT training institutions and private sector providers, 5 1 other training centers/
       institutes belong to other ministries and public organizations and provide specific training for these
       institutions.

              n
Enrolments. I 2003, enrolment in public technical education and vocational training institutions reached
some 12,428 students, half o f them in vocational institutes, almost 35 percent in vocational training
centers and the remaining 15 percent in technical institutes. This represented only 0.4 percent o f the total
student populations from all education levels. At the graduation stage, TEVT provides one graduate for
every seven graduates from universities. By 2005/6, the total number o f registered TEVT students had
increased to 18,500.

Curriculum development. The current MTEVT policy regarding curricula and program development for
vocational training adopts the competency-based approach. This i s implemented through modular training
units that are taught in a step-by-step process, during which the trainee receives a "general grounding
program", then "special grounding programs", ending up with "specialized programs" in the chosen
occupation. T h i s approach i s designed to ensure a level o f flexibility and adaptability o f training outputs



                                                    24
to match changing labor market requirements. T h i s competency-based approach has proven to be relevant
to the vocational training context and socio-economic conditions in Yemen. However, effective
implementation would require more continuous investment in staff development and program
maintenance.

Stafing. As with other jurisdictions, staffing presents challenges to the Yemeni vocational system on a
number o f fronts. There i s a quantitative lack o f trainers that decreases the operational potential o f many
centers. Available trainers are often poorly qualified to transfer the knowledge and slulls that are required
by employers. Many are similarly weak in their pedagogical skills. Continuing training i s provided
through four modes o f short-term courses. Despite a fivefold growth o f the number o f continuing trainees
during the 1998-2002 period, delivery o f this type o f training continues to be constrained by limited
institutional capacity and the absence o f mechanisms that encourage employers to demand training
services.

Graduate follow-up. MTEVT developed a Vocational and Technical Education Graduates' Follow-up
System, or tracer system, designed to asses the extent to which educational institutions have been
fulfilling their role in preparing graduates in accordance with the specifications o f jobs offered by the
surrounding labor market. However, this system has not been effectively operational.

Cooperation with enterprises. Since 1996, a formal regulatory framework has been in place for training to
be undertaken in a co-operative manner with educational and training institutes on the one hand, and the
business and production sector on the other hand. So far, however, such cooperation has not materialized.
Despite the commitment o f MTEVT to encourage the implementation o f cooperative training, enterprises
have so far been reluctant to participate in such programs. Employers considered TEVT provision to be
inadequate and irrelevant to the skill development needs o f their enterprises, while MTEVT officials held
the view that the business sector was not ready yet to play a greater role in training provision.

A Skills Development Fund (SDF) was established in 1995 with the objective o f securing a stable source
o f funding for vocational education and training programs, and providing private sector enterprises with
the opportunity to enrol their employees in specifically designed training and upgrading programs. The
funds are collected through monthly contributions o f employers amounting to one percent o f the total
wage bill. However, the objectives for which the fund was established have not been realised. Clear
criteria and effective mechanisms for the allocation o f training funds were not established. Instead o f
providing the desired linkages between enterprises and training providers, the SDF became a source o f
fierce controversy between public and private sector stakeholders. Following a Policy Forum in 2005 to
debate its future, the SDF i s to be reconstituted under new legislation providing clearer objectives,
operational autonomy, and private sector majority on the Board o f Directors.

 Yemen Vocational Training Project

The first Bank-funded TEVT project in Yemen closed in 2003. The project, which sought to: (i)
strengthen the management o f the VT system by providing a major role to the private sector in policy-
making, management, and financing o f the system; and (ii)     enhance the quality and relevance o f VT
programs, was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory by OED. Overall, the project succeeded in enhancing and
expanding VT facilities and equipment, in improving capacity for developing curricula and instructional
materials, and in catalyzing policy dialogue. I t was less successful in promoting the role o f the private
sector and had modest institutional development impact.

The lessons learned include: (i)   engagement o f the private sector in governance and financing requires
concrete project activities, technical services, and incentives t o promote participation - i t cannot be
                                     i)
assumed to come automatically; ( ithe government's capacity to design and undertake complex sector
reform should not be overestimated - the agenda for systemic reform should be realistic; (iii)        project
design should set priorities, focusing o n the country's major labor market needs; (iv) project readiness for
implementation i s critical and capacity o f the implementing agency should be established in advance o f
project effectiveness; (v) relevant co-financing arrangements should be ensured at project start.

Yemen Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation Project

This project was approved by the Bank's Board in December 2005. I t aims t o achieve "a wide ranging
beneficial impact in Yemen and to allow artisan fishermen t o derive increased incomes through better fish
handling, quality and marketing. The improved quality o f fish will promote local health safety and allow
Yemen to sustain i t s fresh fish exports." T w o areas have been identified where coordination will be
important and synergies can be exploited. The Fisheries project includes:

    0   Training for fisheries cooperatives, with potential linkage to the in-service training activities in
        the fisheries sector proposed in the VT project;
    0   Training in seafood quality control for EU markets, with potential linkage to the n e w programs in
        seafood processing proposed in the VT project.

IFC Programs

IFC started i t s PEP-MENA program in Yemen in 2005. The program operates o n four pillars: Business
Enabling Environment; Financial markets; S M E Development; and Pnvatization. Under the S M E
component the program targets women entrepreneurs, production Cooperatives (e.g. fishery and coffee
production cooperation), private slulls training institutes (including Taiz Chamber o f Commerce). The
program provides technical services in access t o business services, encouraging Banks to start windows
for women entrepreneurs, S M E Banlung, and marketing and TOT for the S M E Management Training
Program (Business Edge). One area o f potential cooperation i s in the w o r k with SDF. IFC approached
SDF a year ago t o assess the potential o f partnership for the implementation o f the Business Edge
program. IFC concluded at that time that SDF was n o t equipped for such partnership, either
organizationally or in terms o f capacity. If the SDF i s successfully restructured and strengthened through
the Yemen Vocational Training I1Project, collaboration with IFC could be highly beneficial.

chaired by the Minister o f Technical Education and Vocational training (TEVT). Members o f the
SC are: (i) chairman o f the S F Board o f Directors; (ii) Vice Minister o f MTEVT; ( i )
            the                   D                            the                           ii
MTEVT four deputy ministers (Planning & Projects, Labor Market & Private Sector Relations,
Curriculum & Continuous Education, and Standards & Quality); (v) one representative o f
Ministry o f Planning (MOPIC); and (vi) one representative o f Ministry o f Finance (MOF).

The SC will meet every six months, and i t s main tasks are to: (i)
                                                                  review policy issues relevant to
the achievement o f project development objectives; (ii) approve annual work-plans and budgets,
and (iii)
        review project progress and take appropriate actions in support o f implementation.

Project Implementation and Coordination

There will be two parallel implementation arrangements: one for the implementation o f
Components 1 and 2, under the responsibility o f MTEVT; and second for the implementation o f
Component 3, under the responsibility o f the Skills Development Fund. The SC will provide
guidance and oversight to both entities responsible for implementation.

Components 1 and 2 will be implemented by MTEVT, with the support o f a PMU, under the
leadership o f the minister, through the existing ministry organizational structure, and
incorporating the modifications to the operational procedures and regulatory arrangements
initiated by the project. Under the supervision o f relevant deputy ministers, the directorates,
departments and training institutes will support the implementation o f project activities relevant
to their respective areas o f responsibility. The P M U will be established within the premises o f
MTEVT in order to facilitate daily interaction and coordination with MTEVT in providing
technical and administrative support. All the technical services consultants supporting
Component 1 will be housed in the PMU. The Component 2 consortium team leader will also be
based in the PMU. Sub-component team leaders for Component 2 will similarly be provided with
an operational base in the PMU. A conference room that can seat 10-12 people will be provided
by MTEVT to facilitate project activities.

effectiveness. Annual plans, budgets, procurement plans, and quarterly progress reports will be
prepared by the SDF and submitted to the SC, through the PMU which will consolidate this
information together with outputs from Component 1 and 2, for SC final approval and overall
guidance. The SDF component will be supported by a long-term advisor who will be contracted
through the project and will assume the role o f Managing Director o f the fund, accountable to the
SDF Board o f Directors.

Project Reporting Arrangements

MTEVT, SDF and the Bank will agree on a standardized approach to progress reporting, based
on the framework o f objectives, activities, outputs, outcomes, and schedule agreed in the Project
Implementation Plan. The principal reports that MTVET and SDF will prepare for IDA are: (i)
quarterly Progress Report including information on M&E indicators and FMR, annual
Procurement Plan, and annual Audit Report.

Procurement Arrangements

As described above, the P M U will be responsible for all aspects o f the procurement o f small
works, goods and services for Components 1 and 2. The SDF will be responsible for the
procurement o f goods and services under the project for Component 3. IDA procurement policy
and procedures will be applied. Procurement plans for the first 18 months o f project activities
have been submitted acceptable to IDA. (See Annex 8 for detailed procurement arrangements).

Accounting and Financial Management Arrangements

As indicated above, the project will be implemented by two entities under'the overall guidance
and oversight o f the Steering Committee: the P M U for Components 1 and 2; and the SDF for
Component 3. Both entities will have financial managers responsible for financial management,
accounting and reporting for their respective components. Bank financial policy and procedures
will be applied. An action plan for setting up the financial management systems -- I F S reporting
design and generation, auditing arrangements - was agreed during appraisal. T o meet the Bank's
financial management requirements, separate financial systems for each entity need to be fully
implemented prior to credit effectiveness. An independent qualified private auditor acceptable to
IDA will audit MTEVT and SDF accounts according to the agreed terms o f reference. The
MTEVT and SDF will recruit their auditors independently (see Annex 7 o f this document for
detailed accounting and financial management arrangements).

Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements

The P M U will be responsible for coordinating monitoring and evaluation o f Components 1 and 2,
supported by the Ministry's PM&E team. The relevant department in SDF will be responsible for
the monitoring and evaluation o f Component 3. Both will be supported by short t e r m technical
services (through trust funds prior to project effectiveness and subsequently through the project)
to assist in the detailed M&E design and implementation. Key indicators and an indicative results
and monitoring framework were discussed and agreed at appraisal (see Annex 3). Work i s on-

1. Summary and Conclusions

The MTEVT-PMU and the SDF will be responsible for project financial management and
reporting, using systems and procedures acceptable t o the Bank. Project accounts will be kept
according to international accounting standards. They will each be audited annually, following
International Standards o n Auditing, by qualified independent external auditors acceptable to the
Bank. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank within 6 months o f the end o f each fiscal
year (Jan 1"to Dec 30").

The proposed disbursement arrangements agreed upon during the appraisal mission include
agreement that the MTEVT-PMU and SDF would each open, maintain and operate a Designated
Account (DA) at the Central Bank o f Yemen. Deposits into, and payments fkom the DAs, will be
made in accordance with the provisions stated in the financial agreement. Disbursement f r o m
both accounts will b e made according t o the traditional disbursement procedures that include
withdrawal applications for direct payment, reimbursement and requests for the issuance o f
special commitments.

A. MTEVT-PMU

The FM function at the existing MTEVT-PMU was confirmed to have experience in
implementation o f IDA-financed projects and i s currently managing and implementing one
recipient executed grant (closed on Dec 13, 2006). An unqualified audit report was received for
year 2005, and the final audit covering the remaining period, till the closing date, i s due June 30,
2007. In addition, it has implemented the First Vocational Training Project. The FM function
performed successfully for both projects.

MTEVT i s to implement the following components:

1. Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Management (US$3.01 million) to: (i)            build
   capacity at the Ministry level with the support o f a long term advisor; and (ii) establish a
                                                                                   to
   PMU to manage activities and funds f l o w under components 1 and 2; and
2. Design and Delivery of Training Programs ($10.14 million) which will be implemented
   through an international consortium with strong project management skills, and contracted
   and managed by the PMU in coordination with relevant directorates and institutions. The
   support provided by the international consortium will include long term technical assistance
   advisors to oversee and provide support for relevant subcomponents.

However, certain weaknesses were noted with regard t o the financial management arrangements
for this entity. Accordingly, a financial management action plan, t o further enhance current FM
arrangements, was discussed and agreed with the PMU. The following actions will be required t o
be implemented before and after effectiveness:

       B. SDF:

      SDF will be responsible for implementing Component Three (US$1.84 million). The SDF i s an
      extra budgetary hnd, as per i t s by-laws, and i s an autonomous revenue-generating entity which
      finances training programs in all fields for Yemeni employed nationals in accordance with i t s
      training manual, uses cash basis in recording i t s revenues against actual funds deposits in SDF
      bank accounts (HQBranches) and accrual basis for expenditure recording. Sources o f i t s
      revenues are as follows:

           1. Employers' monthly subscription fees o f 1 percent from total monthly employees
              salaries, including all fnnge benefits.
                  K
           2. YR 5 for each employment license given to n o n Yemeni nationals paid by employer.
           3. Grants and donations approved by SDF board o f directors.
           4. Penalties o n past due fees.
           5. Interest on balances o f SDF funds.




                                                            48
        The SDF has five branches in addition to headquarters (HQ) in Sana'a. Although primary
                                       D
        responsibility o f collecting S F dues has been transferred to the Tax Authority for a fee, both
        Branches and H Q are s t i l l partly involved in revenue collection as some establishments are
        sending their checks directly to SDF offices.

        Monthly reports by branches are sent to H Q and collections at branch accounts are transferred
        monthly to H Q bank accounts. Consolidated revenue recording i s maintained at H Q level by the
        collection department and then consolidated figures are forwarded to the accounting department
        for recording in SDF accounting records. The Accounting Department maintains manual and
        automated records (using Microsoft accounting software). Both records are maintained in parallel,
        and reconciled with each other and bank statements on a monthly basis.

        However, certain weaknesses were noted with regard to the financial management arrangements
        for this entity. Accordingly a financial management action plan, to further enhance current FM
        arrangements, was discussed and agreed with SDF. The following actions will be required to be
        implemented before and after effectiveness:

   2. FM Risk Assessment and Mitigation

   Country Issues

   Country Risks. As reported and outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) o f 2002, the
   quality o f governance in Yemen i s a critical issue. The Country Financial Accountability
  Assessment (CFAA) report (2003) indicated that there had been some progress recently in the
  fiscal area, particularly in terms o f budget expenditure classification and consolidation o f
  investment and current budget. There is, however, a lack o f progress o n achieving budget
  comprehensiveness as well as on implementing a broader fiscal framework beyond the annual
  budgeting cycle. Efforts to move forward in reforming budget implementation, cash management,
  -accounting and reporting have been pinned on the design and implementation o f the Bank-
  supported accounting and financial management information system (AFM1S)- i s s t i l l underway.
  On the other hand, the draft Reports on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC)
  Accounting and Auditing report (2003) stated that, at present, the accounting and auditing
  practices in Yemen suffer from institutional wealmesses in regulation, compliance, and
  enforcement o f standards and rules. Although some companies claim compliance with
  International Accounting Standards (IAS), full compliance i s not readily achieved. There i s also
  inadequate adherence to International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and professional ethics. These
  factors, as well as the poor quality o f education and training in accounting, have contributed to
  the generally observed weaknesses o f the financial reporting and auditing regime.

  In addition, the recent CPPR conducted in Yemen, identifiedreemphasized a number o f cross
  cutting issues that are currently facing IDA financed projects implemented in the country. Some
  o f the action plan proposed in the area o f financial management has already been addressed, and
  there are on-going coordination between the Bank and the GOY in implementing the remaining
  needed actions.

The MTEVT-PMUand the SDF will each issue separate monthly financial reports (FR), quarterly Interim
Financial Statements (IFS) and annual financial statements (PFS):
                                                                       ~

Monthlv unaudited FR. These reports will be prepared o n a monthly basis and will not be sent to the
Bank. However as part o f Bank supervision, they will be reviewed and reconciled with the monthly
withdrawal applications and quarterly IFS. The format o f these reports should be quite simple (listing o f
sources and uses o f funds and Bank reconciliation);
Quarterlv reviewed I F S . The format and content o f I F S were agreed upon at negotiations, and included
in the financial management manual. I F S include financial, procurement and physical progress
information. There should also be an introductory narrative summary o f project developments and
progress during each quarter. I F S preparation should be finalized within 3 weeks o f the end o f the quarter.
Once they are finished they will be reviewed by the project's external auditor. Reviewed I F S would be
submitted to the IDA not later than 45 days after the end o f each quarter; and
Annuallv audited PFS. The PFS should include: (i) statement o f sources and uses o f funds indicating
                                                    a
funds received from various sources, project expenditures, and assets and liabilities o f the project; (ii)
schedules classifying project expenditures by components, subcomponents and expenditure categories;
(iii) Special Account Reconciliation Statement; and (iv) Statement o f Withdrawals made on the basis o f
     a
Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs). Audited PFS would be submitted to the IDA not later than 6 months
after the end o f the Fiscal Year.

Audit Arrangements

The Project Components implemented by the MTEVT (including Technical Institutes coverage) and by
the SDF will be audited in two separate annual project financial statements, by independent private
auditors acceptable t o IDA under two separate contracts. Audit reports along with management letters
will be submitted to IDA n o later than six (6) months after the end o f the fiscal year. Earlier submission i s
always encouraged.

On the other hand, the external auditors will also be required to review the I F S on a quarterly basis.
Reviewed I F S would be submitted to the IDA not later than 45 days after the end o f each quarter.

The audit would be comprehensive and would cover all aspects o f the project (i.e., all sources and uses o f
funds, and expenditures incurred by each entity). The audits will be carried out in accordance with


                                                      56
  International Standards on Auditing. Terms o f Reference (TOR) for this assignment should cover an audit
  o f financial statements, transactions, SOEs, DAs, IFS, and an assessment o f the financial management
  system, including review o f internal control mechanisms. The MTEVT auditor should v i s i t technical
  institutes implementing component two, assess transactions reported by them to ensure that they are
  complete, available, fairly disclosed, properly valued and presented. Also, the auditor should assess their
  systems o f internal control. B o t h MTEVT (and Technical institutes) and SDF would provide the auditors
  with access t o project-related documents and records, and information required for the purposes o f the
  audit. The auditors would carry out quarterly reviews, including internal control environment during the
  fiscal year, to bring to management's attention any issues which need to be addressed. T h i s would
  strengthen internal controls, and would also facilitate early completion o f the annual audit.

  Disbursement Arrangements

  To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation, the MTEVT and SDF would each

Bank Supervision

Before effectiveness, the implementation of the agreed upon financial management action plan will be
monitored by the Bank accredited FMS for the Project.

After effectiveness, A Bank-accreditedFMS will assist in the regular supervision process. The IFS for the
Project will be reviewed on a regular basis by the Project FMS and the results or issues will be followed
up during the supervision missions. Financial audit reports will be reviewed and issues identified will be
followed up by the FMS. Also, during the Bank's supervision missions the Project's financial management
and disbursement arrangements (including a review of a sample o f SOEs and movements on the Special
Account) will be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Bank's minimum requirements and to develop
the financial management rating of the ImplementationStatus Report (ISR).

                                Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements

A. Background. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for Yemen was carried out in late
December o f CY2000. The report showed that the current procurement legislation (Law N o . 3 o f 1997
concerning Government Tenders, Auctions and Stores, and corresponding Regulations introduced by
Decree No. 234 o f 1997) i s a significant improvement over the previous legislation o f 1991, but i s not yet
up t o international standards, notably in the following areas: (i) in the Legislation; (ii)
                                                                  gaps                       absence o f use
o f Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) by public agencies; and (iii)           conflicts with procurement
guidelines o f donors, including IDA. Even where reasonable rules exist, they were not necessarily
followed.

A s a transition strategy, until a revised procurement l a w i s enacted, the CPAR recommended a set o f
national SBDs for goods, works and services. IDA through an IDF Grant for procurement capacity
building and the Government o f the Netherlands are supporting the development o f the National
Procurement Manual (NPM) and requisite SBDs, which also includes a separate volume o n procurement
                                           P
procedures for local authorities. The N M and SBDs were approved by the Cabinet in April 2006 and
will be piloted for one year. This will support capacity building o f the GOY'Sprocurement function at all
levels. The first pilot o f training-of-trainers was conducted in January 2006 for c i v i l servants in core
spending ministries.

Overall, in terms o f IDA financed projects in Yemen, lengthy processing times for awarding contracts i s
clearly impacting the level o f performance at appraisal o f projects in IDA'S supervision portfolio. The
Bank and GOY have recognized the need to improve the situation. The most recent CPPR was completed
in September 2005 with a focus on identifylng constrains to improved implementation and to agree with
the Borrower on key measures required to address them. The main procurement issues identified were:
lack o f qualified procurement staff in the local market; unnecessary l o w approval thresholds for both the
line ministries and implementing agencies; lengthy contract processing periods; inadequate project
management capacity, as well as using o f non compliance practice with respect to IDA guidelines in
awarding contracts above the PMU's thresholds by the HTB.

Use of Bank Guidelines. I the interim, procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in
                            n
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
M a y 2004; "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated
M a y 2004; and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time fi-ame for contract processing are specified in the Procurement Plan for the first 18
months activity.

B. Advertisement. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be issued in the United Nations
Development Business and dgMarket to advertise for major consulting assignments and t o obtain
expressions o f interest, and for any International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for goods which are
anticipated. The G P N will be issued not less than eight weeks prior to the publication o f the first Specific
Procurement Notice (SPN), and will be updated annually for all outstanding procurement. The GPN will
also be published in the national press or official gazette for purposes o f obtaining expressions o f interest
for contracts under National Competitive Bidding and to obtain expression o f interest fi-om national
consultants.

C. Procurement of Works. Small civil works financed by IDA are estimated at US$701,000. All c i v i l
works contracts procured under this project would be small. They include construction o f a workshop at
one site, as well as minor rehabilitation o f workshops in other participating institutes and, as such, are


                                                     59
unlikely to attract international contractors. NCB contracts would be open to eligble foreign bidders if
they wish to participate. The procurement will be done using NCB documents acceptable to IDA or
National S B D when they become available and determined to be satisfactory to IDA. For any works
contracts with an expected value above US$500,000, full ICB using the Bank's S B D for works will be
used.

Procurement o f Goods. Goods financed by IDA are estimated at US$4.3 million. Contracts for Goods
financed under this project relate mainly equipment for workshops and office equipment including
computers. The procurement will be done using the Bank's SBD for ICB for a l l contracts above
US$lOO,OOO equivalent. NCB documents satisfactory to IDA will be used for goods contracts estimated
t o cost above US$50,000 equivalent. National Shopping procedures would be applied for contracts
estimated to cost below US$50,000 equivalent.

Procurement o f Non-consulting Services. Under components 1, 2, and 3 o f the proposed project, non-
consulting services to be procured would include workshops, study tours, and training related expenses
for staff o f the Ministry o f MTEVT as well as SDF.

Selection o f Consultants. Consulting services financed by IDA would be for: studies, technical
assistance, civil works design and supervision, preparation o f bidding documents, preparation o f terms o f
reference, financial management support, technical audits, financial audits and training. Consultants
financed by IDA would be appointed in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and
Employment o f Consultants (January 1997 revised in September 1997, January 1999, M a y 2002 and M a y
2004). Short lists o f consultants for services estimated t o cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per
contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph
2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

D. Assessment o f the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement. Procurement activities will be
carried out by the P M U which will be set up immediately after the November 2006 appraisal mission.
Core staff o f the PMU including i t s leadership, as listed in the staff requirement table will be selected
based on open competition process according t o IDA guidelines. The PMU will be responsible for
managing procurement under both component one and two. The selected consultant for the procurement
officer position should be familiar with procurement guidelines for IDA financed projects, and in addition
such a person would also have to quickly update herselfiimself with the new Bank guidelines. An
assessment o f the capacity o f the PMU to implement procurement actions for the project under
component 1 and 2 was camed out during the appraisal mission by the Sana'a Country Office-based
Procurement Specialists.

The assessment reviewed the proposed organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction between the staff o f the PMU responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central
units for administration and finance. As the procurement activities under component 3 will be carried out
by the SDF, the Chairman o f the SDF will appoint one o f his technical staff as the procurement officer for
this component. IDA will not finance any o f the SDF staff salary. T o ensure smooth and timely
implementation o f the different procurement activities the SDF will be supported by a national short-term
procurement advisor financed under the TF for the first six months to provide critical support in: (i)
training o f S D F P M U procurement officers; ( ipreparation o f the project procurement plan; and ( i )
                                                  i)                                                      ii
drafting o f TOR'S, preparing the project guidelines and procedures.

E. Procurement Plan. A draft Detailed Procurement Plan (DPP) indicating the procurement method and
processing time for each contract covering the first 18 months o f project implementation has been
prepared by the PMU staff with the guidance o f the procurement advisor. The Procurement Plan will be
updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity at the PMU.



                                                    60
F. Frequency o f Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision o f individual
transactions to be carried out, the capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended
three supervision missions t o visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions taken by these
newly established project execution entities for the MTEVT as well as the SDF.

G. Prior Review. Table B provides the prior review thresholds. All ICB, all contracts under component
3, the first three NCB contracts and NCB contracts greater than or equal to US$200,000 for works and
U S $ 100,000 for goods would be subject to IDA prior review as per paragraph 2 Appendix Io f the
Guidelines. The other contracts would be subject to post review in accordance with paragraph 4 Appendix
I f the Guidelines. All consulting contracts costing U S $ 100,000 equivalent or more for f i r m s would be
  o
subject to IDA prior review. With respect t o each contract for employment o f individual consultants
estimated t o cost the equivalent to US$ 50,000 or more, the qualifications, experience, terms o f reference
and terms o f employment o f the consultants shall be furnished to IDA for i t s prior review. Any
amendment t o existing contracts raising their values t o levels equivalent or above the prior review
thresholds are subject to IDA review. All terms o f reference and all single -source selection o f
consultants would be subject to IDA prior review. Other procurement subject to IDA review would
include: annual training plans for local and overseas training and workshops, including terms o f reference
and estimated budgets. All out o f country training will be subject to IDA approval.

 H. Post Review. Monitoring and evaluation o f the PMU's procurement performance would be carried
 out for procurement under the prior review thresholds during IDA supervision missions and through ex-
post procurement audits as deemed necessary during project implementation. At a minimum, 3 out o f 10
contracts managed by the PMU will be subject to post review. Post reviews o f in country training will
also be conducted from time to time to review the selection o f institutions/course contents/trainees and
justifications thereof, and costs incurred. The PMU and SDF capacity in handling procurement efficiently
will be reviewed annually. All thresholds will be reviewed by the Borrower and IDA from time to time as
necessary.

                                 Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis


 1. Project coherency with country and Bank strategy and policy framework

The GOY recognizes education and training, including VET, as being a key driver o f sustainable
economic and human development. The proposed reorientation o f the TEVT system has been developed
within Yemen's overall development fi-amework as expressed in the Strategic Vision 2025, the 2ndFive
Year Socio-economic Development Plan (200 1-2005), and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (2003-2005).

Within the area o f education, the Bank's CAS identifies the need for improvement o f the relevance o f
curricula to changing labor market and social needs and for the increase o f public expenditure efficiency,
which in the case o f TVET includes a focus o n higher employer participation in program design and
delivery. By increasing the pool o f well-educated and well-skilled workers, the project aims to contribute
to achieving increased non-oil growth, which i s one o f the three focus areas o f the Bank in Yemen."

The GOY,with the assistance o f the Bank and other donors, also puts a strong focus o n addressing other
constraints to labor market outcomes, as described in the first section o f this annex, and mainly relating to
macro economic growth and stability, and improvements in the investment climate. The approval o f a
rather extensive economic reform package in July 2005, and the Matrix for Good Governance Measures
in January 2006 indicate the GOY'S regained momentum to address constraints in these areas. The
governments' endeavors are supported by the Bank's focus o n improving economic governance as
expressed in the CAS.

2. Justification for public intervention

The public provision o f education, including TVET, i s justified by i t s merit good nature and positive
externalities. The merit good nature o f education implies that in the absence o f (partly) public provision,
individuals may choose t o curtail schooling since they are not sufficiently aware o f the private benefits
that they would derive from it. Positive externalities include lower unemployment rates, and greater
international competitiveness.

The classification o f education and training as a merit good becomes somewhat less apparent in the case
o f in-sewice training, where the benefits o f receiving TVET not only directly accrue t o the employee but
also to the employer. For this reason, in-service training requires private contributions, either directly
from participants andor employers or through the SDF, while pre-service education i s provided largely
for free.

T o strengthen the private education and training sector, and avoid unfair competition with public sector
institutes, in-service training offered through the SDF can be provided both by public and by private
entities.

3. Analysis o f alternatives guiding project design

 Alternatives considered range from limiting actiaities t o a policy dialogue, to widening the project scope
to include most o f the goals identified in the national sector strategy. The rejection o f the latter i s based on
the limited implementing capacity o f relevant actors. The proposed project design, moving beyond mere
 dialogue and focusing o n institutional reform and capacity building in a limited number o f areas, i s
justified by the combination o f counterpart commitment to reforms, and the on-going substantial

investments in VT infrastructure, o f which the benefits are unlikely to materialize if not accompanied by
improvements in the quality o f education.

A selection o f geographic areas for pilot activities has been rejected in favor o f target sectors, as i t i s
assumed that the sector approach will better promote communication between training providers and
employers, and will be more effective in demonstrating the benefits o f a demand-driven approach. The
selection o f pilot sectors i s guided for all sectors by growth and growth potential in terms o f output and
employment, and by the existence o f significant training gaps at the technician level as identified by
employers. In addition, at least one sector - food processing - has significant female employment, and the
potential o f increased export revenues.

4.    Fiscal Impact analysis, including cost recovery

Project costs

Since the late nineties, public expenditures o n education have fluctuated between 5.2 percent and 6.8
percent o f GDP. As a share o f total public outlays, expenditures o n education varied between 15.0 percent
in 1997, and an estimated 21.2 percent in 2005. In 2006, public expenditures on education in 2006 are
expected to be YR184 billion (US$939 million), or 15.6 percent o f total government outlays. O f this
amount, YR11 billion (US$ 56 million) will be allocated by the MTVET, which equals 6 percent o f
public education expenditures, or 1 percent o f total government

Total project costs, excluding project management, will be US$ 15.0 million (YR 2.9 billion) over a 6-
year period. O f this amount, U S $ 13.2 million (YR 2.6 billion) will be allocated to the MTVET and
selected technical institutes for the first two project components. The average annual project amount
allocated to the MTVET represents over 5 percent o f the annual MTVET budget, and approximately 24
percent o f the MTVET budget that i s used to finance technical level institute^.'^ The remaining U S $ 1.8
million (YR 353 million) o f the project amount will be directed to the SDF through project component 3.
Based o n the SDF's 2004 committed expenditures, this implies that the average annual project amount
allocated to the SDF equals less than 5 percent o f the SDF budget.

these institutes as a share o f the total number o f students in MTVET-financed institutes). A pending financial and
economic analysis o f the TVET sector will shed more light o n the actual expenditures o n technical education, which
might prove to be lower than here assumed.

Recurrent costs
In addition to the one-off project costs, the project has expenditure implications that extend beyond the
project horizon. These involve mainly operations and maintenance costs and increased wage costs due to
staff andor salary increases. Table 6 summarizes the projected recurrent cost^'^. F o r component 1, they
include estimates o f wages and expenses for transportation, travel per-diems, outreach activities, and the
operations, maintenance and replacement costs o f equipment provided by the project. For component 2,
they include estimates o f the wages o f new program instructors and SELU staff, costs associated with the
training provided by the Master Instructors to other instructors o f the targeted programs, and costs for
operations, maintenance, and replacement o f new and upgraded equipment and facilities.

As for component 3, n o recurrent costs are assumed. The SDF i s largely financed by the private sector.
Public contributions to the SDF are limited t o the annual public contributions t o the fund, equal to
YR5000 per new or renewed issuance o f work permits o f foreign employees. Particularly when there i s
weak link between the employer's contributions and the benefits that they receive from the SDF, these
contributions can be regarded as a tax. Nevertheless, as i t i s assumed that both the employer's
contributions and public funds are allocated to the SDF regardless whether the project takes place or not,
they are not considered to be a part o f the project's recurrent costs or fiscal impact: any operational costs
are assumed to be part o f the regular operational costs o f the SDF.

Estimated fiscal impact 2008-2023

Table 7 depicts the total fiscal impact o f the project. The costs o f the project during i t s implementation
form a large share o f total estimated public expenditures on Technical Education (up to 41 percent in
201 1). After project implementation, projected recurrent costs would comprise 2.2 percent o f TE
expenditures, or 0.5 percent o f total MTVET expenditures (see also the below section on Sustainability
and Cost Recovery).

Fiscal impact including replication costs

sectors and education areas. I t i s envisaged that the increased institutional capacity gained through project

costs are more likely t o be lower than higher than the projected costs.

implementation will be used to replicate the project's approach to other programs, which would greatly
increase the total benefits generated by the project. Therefore, although the costs o f replication are not
indissolubly linked to the project, and are thus not considered t o be recurrent costs, it i s important to
obtain a sense o f their magnitude.

Replication costs are difficult to estimate as there are various uncertain factors at play which exercise both
downward and upward pressures o n the costs.16 Table 8 depicts the estimated fiscal impact including
replication costs. I t i s assumed that replication costs are similar to the project costs o f component 2. The
presumption program replication can take place at lower costs than program development during the
project i s reflected by the assumption that while the project comprised the establishment o f three
programs in a total o f four institutes, replication i s assumed t o take place in five institutes for each the
three new programs. Although these estimates are not more than indicative, they clearly illustrate that i f
replication takes place at the assumed pace, expenditures as a share o f total Technical Education outlays
remain high. Over time, a steady increase o f costs occurs due to the rise o f recurrent costs o f the growing
number o f replicated programs, while replication efforts continue.

5. Cost benefit and sensitivity analysis

A cost benefit analysis (CBA) and sensitivity analysis (SA) were carried out to estimate the net present
value (NF'V) and internal rate o f return (IRR) o f the project, and the sensitivity o f the analysis to major
risk factors. However, the reliability o f the outcomes i s hampered both by the lack o f updated and reliable
data, and by uncertainties surrounding assumptions (stretching well-beyond the project's time span) that


16   .
    First, the institutional capacity generated by the project i s expected to substantially reduce replication costs compared to
original project costs, mainly resulting from lower expenditures on international technical services, and the possibility to tap into
already existing networks with employers. Second, each replicated program i s assumed to be implemented in 5 institutes, while
the original programs were targeted at 1 or 2 institutes. This will lead to economies of scale concerning for instance curriculum
development, but also to higher equipment costs per program as more institutes need to be equipped. Third, equipment costs will
largely depend on the type of program selected for replication; those requiring more and more sophisticated equipment will be
more costly than those that are less equipment-intensive.


                                                                67
have been made to capture the institution-building nature o f the project. For these reasons, although the
analyses are believed to provide some useful guidance o n the project's potential merits and
vulnerabilities, caution i s warranted in the weight that i s attached t o the outcomes. Nevertheless, the main
elements and outcomes o f the analyses are provided below. A more detailed description o f methodology
and data used can be found in project files.

Cost benefit analysis

Methodology

Whereas the determination o f project costs i s relatively uncomplicated, the estimation o f project benefits
i s less straightforward. T h i s i s due both to the projects higher level objectives relating t o externalities that
are difficult t o measure, and to the capacity-building nature o f the project.

First, according t o the norm in analyses o f education projects, the CBA defines benefits in terms o f
increased employability and earning capacity o f students resulting from the project. Generating these
benefits is, however, not an explicit part o f the project's objective, since the PDO relates to the positive
externalities that are associated with the improved quality o f TE graduates in terms o f increased
productivity, competitiveness, and j o b creation. While the project's benefits are approximated by the
estimated increase o f income-earning potential, this i s assumed to result in an underestimation o f benefits
when viewed in the light o f the project's higher level objectives.

Second, the project's objectives are o f an institution-building nature. Hence, project benefits are not
expected to be limited to the direct benefits resulting from the increase in employability and earnings
capacity o f graduates that partake in the pilot-programs. Instead, the capacity built through project
implementation i s expected to be used to replicate the approach o f the pilot programs to enhance the
quality o f training in other institutes and in other education areas. The benefits o f the project are therefore
largely dependent on the extent and quality o f replication that takes place after project implementation.
The CBA captures this aspect by assuming a certain level o f replication o f the pilot approach. The
benefits o f replication, in terms o f increased employability and earnings capacity o f students, are assumed
to be a part o f project benefits. As the funding o f replication i s outside o f the scope o f this project,
replication costs are not assumed to be a part o f this project's costs.

Outcomes

The project i s estimated to have an NPV o f US$7.1 million, and an IRR o f 17.5 percent. As they are
highly interlinked, n o individual estimate o f the NPV and IRR i s calculated for the separate project
components. I t i s however possible to estimate the NPV and IRR for the pre-service and the in-service
elements o f the project. As i s shown in table 9, both the in-service and the pre-service project elements
are expected t o generate positive benefits, with both benefits and the IRR being higher for the in-service
activities.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis was carried out linked t o the project's main identified risk factors: implementation
delay (postponing the generation o f benefits, but not o f costs), cost increase (where both recurrent and


                                                        68
replication costs are higher than origmally foreseen), a lack o f replication, and a reduction in the increase
o f life-time earnings associated with participation in targeted TE programs. The latter could be the result
o f both endogenous and exogenous factors (e.g. lower quality o f targeted programs, or deteriorated
macroeconomic conditions). In addition, the sensitivity o f the analysis in relation to the assumptions
concerning pre-project wage rates was tested.

Table 10 depicts the switching values o f these variables, i.e. the change in the variable that will tum the
project's NPV to zero. F o r instance, an implementation delay o f 26 months will evaporate the NPV o f
US$7.1 million (as estimated in the CBA) to zero, as will an increase o f project costs by approximately
60 percent. The effect will be similar if there i s n o replication, or if the initial wage or the increase in life-
time earnings, are only about two thirds o f what was assumed for the CBA.

6. Institutional Capacity Analysis

The project aims to improve the institutional capacity o f all relevant actors involved in ensuring the
provision o f high-quality pre-service and in-service TVET. These involve institutions responsible for
supplying TVET (MTVET, public and private TVET providers), actors o n the demand side (employers
and' employees, represented by Chambers o f Commerce and Trade Unions), and the SDF, which has a
particular mandate to improve the linkages between the supply and demand side.

Currently, the capacity o f all actors to contribute to the design and provision o f appropriate and high-
quality TVET programs i s considered to be low. The provision o f TVET programs i s largely supply
driven, and neither incentives nor mechanisms are in place to improve the relevance o f offered programs
t o labor market needs. The employer community, particularly the large number o f informal small and
micro enterprises, generally lacks the capacity to identify their human resource requirements over a
longer time period, and faces financial constrains to contribute to the costs o f in-service training. Finally,
since i t s establishment in 1995, the SDF has lacked the clarity o f purpose and professional tools to make
positive contributions to either the supply or demand side o f in-service training.

One o f the project's main challenges i s to reconcile the urgent need t o substantially improve the
institutional capacity o f the relevant institutions with their limited absorption capacity, implying that both
the pace and the extent o f capacity building activities should not be overly ambitious. This i s taken into
account in the project design, particularly with regard to component 2, by targeting a limited number o f
programs in a small number o f teaching institutes. After project implementation, the institutional capacity
generated through these pilot programs can subsequently be used to improve the quality and relevance o f
TEVT in other sectors and by other training providers. (See also `sustainability and cost recovery' section
below.)

7. Poverty analysis

Poverty i s a nation-wide and persistent phenomenon, with an estimated 42 percent o f the population
living in poverty. Yemen ranks 151" out o f 177 countries o n the 2005 Human Development Index.
Although some indicators have improved, such as average l i f e expectancy and basic education enrollment
rates, there are many remaining areas o f concern, including high infant and maternal mortality rates, a
high malnutrition incidence, and high fertility rates.

The project both directly and indirectly contributes to poverty reduction. Direct benefits consist o f the
increased income-generating potential o f participants o f the improved pre-service and in-service training
programs. According to the 1999 Poverty Survey, 13 percent o f post-secondary VT students have an
income below the food poverty line." As educational attainment i s one o f the determinants o f poverty, i t
does not seem surprisingthat the share o f poor post-secondary VT students i s lower than the overall share
o f the population living below the food poverty line, which was 27 percent in 1999. Although n o
information i s available o n the share o f poor benefiting from in-service training, this share might be
higher, particularly when the project i s successful in reaching workers in the informal sector.

Indirect benefits include the positive externalities generated by the project, in terms o f improvements in
overall productivity and international competitiveness. These benefits are likely to reach the overall
Yemeni population, and disproportionately benefit the poor as sectors are targeted which (informally)
employ relatively large shares o f poor.

8. Sustainability and cost recovery

T o pilot and demonstrate institutional mechanisms than can direct training more closely t o employment
needs in Yemen through (i)  increased participation o f employers in the design, delivery and financing o f
training programs and (ii) expanded attention to M&E contributing to evidence-based decision making.

Project sustainability

Project sustainability depends on both the institutional capacity and willingness o f the relevant institutions
and actors to maintain and expand the activities that were developed during the project, and o n the
availability o f sufficient funding to finance recurrent and, particularly, replication costs. Institutional
sustainability depends largely on whether the project i s successful in developing sufficient capacity in all
institutions involved, and o n whether the project succeeds in illustrating the benefits o f increased
employer involvement and M&E. Financial sustainability i s likely to particularly become an issue in
relation to ensuring a steady pace o f replication o f the project approach to new programs, and i s likely to
require a shift in government policy to investing in the quality rather than the quantity o f TE supply.

Sustainability in terms o institutional capacity
                         f

The generation o f sufficient institutional capacity, and recognition o f the benefits o f the piloted
approaches, to enable sustainability and replication o f the project after its completion i s the main project
objective. Successful implementation o f the project therefore implies sustainability in terms o f
institutional capacity. Nevertheless, longer term capacity can be jeopardized even after successful project
implementation, for instance when there i s a high turnover o f staff that were trained by the project. This
risk can be mitigated by avoiding the simultaneous departure o f relatively large numbers o f trained staff,
and by ensuring that there i s an appropriate transfer o f knowledge and s h l l s by departing staff to
personnel that takes over their functions.

  The food poverty line implies a stricter poverty measure than the general poverty line. People living below the
food poverty line (27% o f the population) can be considered the 'poorest o f the poor'.

Financial sustainability

Recurrent costs associated with the project are estimated to be US$201,000 per year, t o be born by the
MTVET. In 2005, the M T V E T ' s budget totaled YR8.5 billion (US$ 41.1 million), o f which 68 percent
was allocated to capital investments, and 32 percent (RY 2.6 billion, US$ 13.3) to current expenditure^.'^
The recurrent costs associated with the project would therefore, in 2005, have represented 1.7 percent o f
total MTVET current expenditures.

No information i s available o n the allocation o f MTVET funds between post-secondary technical
education and post-primary VET programs. T o provide a rough estimate o f the project's recurrent costs in
relation to total and recurrent TE expenditures, it i s assumed that the allocation between TE and VET i s
proportional t o the relative number o f students, and that the allocation between capital and current
expenditures i s similar for both education categories. This leads to the assumption that the project's
recurrent costs will comprise 2.4 percent o f total TE expenditures and 7.6 percent o f TE current
expenditures. Taking into account that the project would directly benefit roughly 10 percent o f the TE
students (there were 2760 TE students in 2004), these numbers seem manageable.

The picture changes, however, if the costs o f replication are taken into account. As i s illustrated in table 8,
a steady pace o f replication will require a substantial and increasing share o f estimated available TE
funding (up to almost 70 percent in 2023 to be allocated t o the development and maintenance o f new
programs. Whether this level o f funding can realistically be expected will depend o n a number o f factors,
including the perceived success o f the improved TE programs, and the willingness o f both the GOY and
possible donors to invest in the quality rather than the quantity o f TE supply.

For the SDF component, financial sustainability will depend largely o n the perceived quality o f SDF
performance (and the ability o f the Tax Administration t o enforce the collection o f employers'
contribution). When employers recognize the added value o f in-service training provision through the
SDF, their willingness to allocate funds to the SDF (by contributing 1 percent o f their wage sum and by
purchasing training through the SDF) will increase. Similarly, the GOY'S           willingness t o allocated public
resources to the SDF i s likely to depend o n i t ' s perception o f the added value o f the SDF.

Cost recovery

In principal, fees received for the provision o f in-service training should generate profits for the
institutions that provide the training. Currently, little i s known about the extent and fee structure o f in-
service training that i s provided. I t i s expected that both subcomponent 2.2 and component 3 o f the
project will result in an increase in in-service training provided by both public and private teaching
institutes. I t i s therefore o f particular importance that the fees that they receive at least cover the variable
costs o f training provision.

As the facilities o f TVET institutes are currently generally underused (no education activities take place
in the late afternoons, evenings, or during the summer break), the increased supply o f in-service training
during these time periods, in combination with an appropriate fee structure, will ensure a more efficient
use o f facilities and equipment and could even (moderately) bring down the unit costs o f pre-service
programs.

SUMMARY

The proposed project i s justified by the need to strengthen non-oil private sectors, observed technician-
level s k d l s mismatches, and Government commitment t o the project's objectives in combination with its
ongoing investments in TVET physical infrastructure. In addition, while enrollment gaps remain,
achieved progress in increasing primary and secondary educational attainment allows for an increased
focus on technical education.

The project's development objectives are consistent with both the GOY'S         and the Bank's development
strategies. Students graduating from pre-service and in-service training programs that have benefited from
a quality-increase through the project are expected to help address currently existing mismatches between
labor demand and supply, and contribute to strengthening promising non-oil sectors that employ large
shares o f the poor. I t i s estimated that between 2007 and 2023 the project could produce 3,276 graduates
from targeted pre-service programs (including replicated programs after project implementation), and
provide improved in-service training to 18,000 employees. Although impeded by a lack o f updated and
reliable data, a cost benefit analysis has been conducted, resulting in an estimated net present value (NPV)
o f $7.1 million and an internal rate ofreturn (IRR) o f 17.5 percent.

Despite the promising potential benefits o f the project, a number o f substantial risks exist both within and
outside o f the scope o f the project, which might jeopardize the full realization o f benefits. With regard to
the latter, although i t i s recognized that the GOY i s taking actions to address existing constraints to
improving labor market outcomes, impediments to macro-economic stability, and a growth-conducive
investment climate could substantially hinder the realization o f project benefits even if the project i s
implemented as planned. The main identified risks within the scope o f the project relate t o institutional
and financial capacity, which could lead to implementation delays, a lower than expected quality o f
targeted programs, or a lack o f replication after project implementation. While the possibility that
identified risks materialize i s considered to be high, a sensitivity analysis carried out o n the cost-benefit
estimates indicates that project benefits remain positive even if assumptions change fairly substantially.

Project sustainability depends o n the institutional capacity o f relevant institutions, their acceptance o f the
benefits o f the approach that i s piloted by the project, and on the availability o f sufficient funding to
finance the recurrent and, particularly, the replication costs associated with the project. The generation o f
sufficient institutional capacity and buy-in o f the piloted approach are the main objectives o f the project.
Financial sustainability i s likely to become an issue in relation to ensuring a steady pace o f replication o f
the project approach to new programs, as the assumed pace o f replication costs will require a large share
o f TE funding t o be allocated to the development o f new, high quality, programs. This may require a shift
in government policy to investing in the quality rather than the quantity o f TE supply.

                                    Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues


         This project does not trigger any safeguard policies. The focus i s on provision o f training and
technical services for building institutional capacity. Activities are to be located in existing institutions -
n o new training centers are to be constructed and n o significant environmental implications are
anticipated. The project w i l l not involve any relocation o f people.
         Some small works will be carried out in four existing training centers, to adjust existing facilities
to the needs o f the new training programs that will be introduced through the project. These comprise the
construction o f one workshop at Hadda Institute and minor interior modifications in the other three
institutes. The contracts for these works, to be managed by the PMU, will include clauses on appropriate
disposal o f construction debris.
        International technical services for Component 2 o f the project i s to be consolidated in a single
contract with a consortium which will combine technical and project management expertise and twinning
partners. The responsibility for ensuring high environmental standards in the new training programs will
be an integral part o f the terms o f reference for this assignment. This will apply both to the conduct o f the
training activities and to the content o f the curricula - for technicians in the construction and food
processing sectors - including measures to assure adequate health and safety standards and good practice
in waste disposal.

            D e a r Mr. Mbi,

                         .The Government o f the Republic o f Yemen i s giving high priority to the development o f
            technical and vocational training. The capacity o f both the public and private training sectors is
            s t i l l very small. Improvements in the quantity, quality and diversity o f kaining opportunities are
            considered crucial to meeting economic and social development objectives. Since the completion,
            in 2004, o f Yemen's Strategic Development Plan for Technical Education and Vocational
            Training, wliich details the government's vision and strategy for the sector, the recurrent and
            investment budgets for TEVT have been increased by 14 % and 34 % respectively and forty (40)
            new training centers have been establishd.

                       Yemen's TEVT Strategy i s the product o f several years' work (with support from the
            W o r l d Bank and the EU) and included extensive national and local consultations. In addition to
            advocating rapid quantitative expansion o f student places through the construction o f new
            centers, the Strategy aims to improve quality and efficiency through fimdamental re-Orientation
            from the existing centralized, supply-driven system to a demand-driven systcm with more
            participation by employers and increased autonomy at the local and institute levels to respond to a
            more diverse range oftraining needs.

                     At t h i s early stage in implementation o f the Strategy, some significant progress has
            already been made. There i s a potential danger, however, that the rapid construction o f new
            facilities may be out-pacing the more dimcult institutional changes that are needed to ensure that
            the new facilities can be used effectively. The government proposes t o re-examine the structure o f
            investment in the sector, to ensure that major investments in infrastructure (i)   respond to clear
            labor market needs, (ii) based o n assurance o f the prospective outcomes and cost effectiveness
                                       are
            o f the proposed training programs, and (iii)    that they take full account o f the recurrent cost
            implications, and the complementary "software" requirements for the development o f programs
            and insmctors.

                   The Second Vocational Training Project will address these institutional constraints to
            implementation o f the Strategy and will support the longer term policy directions o f the
            government in several areas:

                    Revision o roles: The Strategy calls for a stronger strategic and monitoring role for the
                              f
                    Ministry, matched with increased flexibility and managerial autonomy at the level o f t h e
                    individual institute. The project will help build the capacity needed to define and
        L




                                                            75
   implement these changes, in addition to generating information that can help prioritize and
   coordinate public investment in the sector. It i s also the policy o f the government to build
   public-private partnerships and to strengthen the role o f the private sector in financing and
   managing training activities. This policy will be pursued through the project's support to
   reform o f the SDF, and to employer participation in the design and delivery o f training
   activities.
       Shift to demand-driven activities: The central focus o f the project matches the strategic
       goal of shifting from a supply-driven system to a demaud-driven one. The difficulties and
       time involved in accomplishing this are w e l l understood, requiring fundamental cbanges
        n
       i expectations and behaviors. The project will address this through piloting and
       demonstration o f mechanisms to promote collaboration between employers and public
       training providers.
       improving incentives: The government i s aware that the existing centralized framework
        for finance and management fails to provide s a c i e n t means or incentives for training
       centers to increase either their efficiency or their responsiveness to demand. The
        government has already taken some steps to allow for revenue generation by the
       institutes, and i s considering major reform over the longer term towards fmancial and
       managerial autonomy o f the training centers with performance-related financing. The
       project w i l l support this through capacity building and piloting at the institute level and
        through building the Ministry's capacity in performance monitoring.
       Reform ofthe SDF: The project supports the government's policy for reform o f t h e Skills
       Development Fund. Although experience o f the SDF t o date has not been successful, the
       potential value o f such an intermediary i s considered to be high. There i s commitment,
       therefore, in both the public and private sectors to restructure and reform the SDF o n the
       basis o f the lessons learned. These lessons include the need for (i)   operational autonomy
       o f the S F under revised legislation, and ( i i ) strong support in establishing effective and
                D,
                               -
       transparent operations which will be provided through the project.

    T h i s letter confirms the commitment o f the government to three specific policy undertakings
that are essential for effective implementation o f the project, within the overall strategic
framework

1. The Cabinet has endorsed the revised SDF law, attached to this letter, on February 6,2007 and
w i l l give priority to processing t h i s revised legislation through Parliament.

2. The training institutes selected for participation in Component 2 o f the project will need both
the means and incentives to be responsive to employer d e h d , in particular in developing in-
service training capacity. On a pilot basis, they will be granted specified levels o f fmancial and
administrative autonomy beyond those currently assigned, including the ability to open and
manage bank accounts, enter into contracts with employers, engage contractual instructors, and
undertake independent procurement o f instructional supplies required for program delivery. Thc
specific arrangements w i l l be confirmed by government decree after t h e project effectiveness
date. These arrangements will be monitored closely during the course of the project, and the
experience w i l l help to inform policy development for other public training centers.

3. Since the success of Components 1 and 2 o f the project will depeid on progressive
mainstreaming o f new practices and processes throughout the Ministry's operations, these
components are designed to be implemented through the mainstream structures o f the Ministry.
The project will finance the core TA and training requirements, and limited recurrent costs related
to start-up o f the activities. To ensure sustainability and the development o f relevant capacity in
the Ministry of TEVT, most of the on-going recurrent costs will be financed through the regular
budget o f the Ministry. The government undertakes to account for these needs through its regular
budgeting process. In line with t h i s commitment, the Ministry undertakes to ensure that
                                         in all the participating training institutes meets agreed      ,

minimum standa                          on o f the activities under Component 2. For the longer term,
                                        ot new mechanisms which, if they prove successful, will b e
                                        der scale within and beyond the l i f e o f the project.
