remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized 
in making payments for eligible expenditures.

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such

otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the 
case may be.

outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to 
the Bank such outstanding amount.
