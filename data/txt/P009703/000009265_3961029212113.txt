MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Impact Evaluation Report on Four Seeds Projects
Bangladesh: Cereal Seeds Project (Credit 410-BD)
India: National Seeds Project (Loan 1273-IN)
India: Second National Seeds Project (Credit 816-IN)
Pakistan: Seed Project (Credit 620-PAK)
Attached is the Impact Evaluation Report (IER) prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department on the Bangladesh Cereal Seeds project (Credit 410-BD, approved in FY73), the
India National Seeds project (Loan-1273-IN, approved in FY76), the India Second National
Seeds project (Credit-816-IN, approved in FY78) and the Pakistan Seeds project (Credit 620-
PAK, approved in FY76). Comments on the IER from all three borrowers have been
received and are attached.
These four projects were modeled on the Bank's successful Tarai Seeds Project in
India (Loan 614-IN) which took a comprehensive approach to improving the availability of
high yield varieties (HYVs) principally of rice and wheat. The projects did not seek to
change existing national policies in the seed industry. Thus, seed breeding, registration and
certification, bulking-up, seed processing and distribution were all assisted through public
sector seed corporations. Instead of fostering monopolistic national corporations, the projects
encouraged the development of state (India) or provincial (Pakistan) companies. The
fortuitous result was to introduce competition within the public sector, which subsequently
facilitated the entry into the sector of local and multinational private sector seed companies.
The main project investments were in large seed processing plants, plus necessary office,
laboratory, communications and transport equipment; staff housing was supplied as needed.
Technical assistance and significant training components were also included. The resulting
cadre of well trained seed professionals provided a pool of local expertise fundamental to the
emergence of private seed companies.
The projects were intended to popularize and greatly expand the supply of early HYV
seed. But, by the time they were implemented, most farmers had access to HYV seed.
Thus, the projects missed the seed boom associated with the first HYVs, and project aided
institutions had difficulty in persuading farmers that the project-promoted certified seed
performed better than HYV based seed saved by farmers from their own crops.



Due to their positive, albeit unplanned, institutional development results, the impact
evaluation finds a more positive situation in the seeds industry. This includes a cadre of well
trained staff and an active private sector. In India there are 500 private seed companies, 24
of them with links to multinational seed companies. In Pakistan there is a highly
professional Seed Certification Department and in the Punjab Seed Corporation, a well
managed company similar to US farmer-owned cooperatives. In Bangladesh the project was
described as the "rock" on which other donors had built and continue to build. With the
benefit of hindsight, it now appears that in all three countries, the Bank used its influence
realistically and successfully to support liberalization of the seed sector. Farmer interviews
during the impact evaluation and a survey in Bangladesh, showed farmers to be aware of the
importance of good seed and satisfied with their access to improved seed, but inclined to
over-value seed saved from crops in their own village.
In sum, the impact evaluation finds that the projects achieved a large measure of
success. The key elements of seed project design were: (a) technical training, of value to
both the public and private sectors, (b) creation of a basic institutional infrastructure (seed
breeding, certification, processing etc.), (c) break-up of national parastatal seed monopolies
and (d) removal of barriers to entry. The IER also notes that if seed is to be subsidized, the
subsidy should be the same regardless of whether the seed is distributed by public or private
agents. A key missing element in these projects was any direct assistance (e.g., on farm
storage, and seed cleaning) to the informal sector for farmer saved (non-hybrid) seed. This
gap is being addressed in the India Third National Seeds Project (Credit 1952-IN).

Preface
It is almost a decade since the first impact evaluation of Bank seeds projects,'
one in India and the other in Indonesia. This second impact evaluation covers four
project, two in India and one each in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In concept, these four
projects were modelled on the Indian Tarai project, which was the subject of the
previous evaluation. An important issue for this impact evaluation is the extent to
which the leading role assigned to the public sector in these projects has affected the
emergence of the private seed industry. The evaluation concludes that the
development strategy followed by the Governments and the Bank worked well. The
initial injection of training and expertise to assist the public sector provided the basis
for private sector development. Decentralization of the seed parastatals in India and
Pakistan helped defuse potential opposition to the growth of the private sector. And
the Bank's initial support of the public sector has assured it a "seat at the table" from
which to argue for a level-playing field for the private sector.
The Bangladesh project was supported by an IDA Credit of $7.5 million
equivalent, approved in June 1973; the Indian projects were supported by a Bank Loan
of $25 million approved in May 1976 and an IDA Credit of $25 million equivalent
approved in June 1978; and the Pakistan project was supported by an IDA of $23
million approved equivalent in March 1976.
The Bangladesh project was audited by OED in 1984,2 a PCR was submitted
for the Indian projects in 19863, and the Pakistan project was audited in the same
year.4 At completion the performance of these projects was felt to be disappointing in
comparison to the Tarai project on which they were modelled. Accordingly, it is of
interest to see how these seed industries have evolved after a rather troubled start.
The report is based on the above mentioned audits and PCRs, examination of
other Bank documents, and interviews with Bank staff. Missions visited the three
countries in the fall of 1994. A formal farmer survey was commissioned in

Bangladesh. In India and Pakistan, the wide geographical scope of the projects
required primary focus on the institutions created by the project, with more limited
farmer interviews.
The valuable assistance provided to the mission in the preparation of this report
by the Governments of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and all those associated with
the seed industry who gave generously of their time to be interviewed is gratefully
acknowledged.
The draft version of this impact evaluation report was sent to the Governments
of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The text and footnotes reflect comments received
from officials in the three countries and they are also attached as Annex C.

Executive Summary
1.    The four seeds projects covered by this report were approved in the period
1973 to 1978, and closed from 1982 to 1985. They were similar in concept,
concerned to ensure that a seed multiplication and marketing system was in place to
provide Green Revolution, High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds to farmers, and were
modelled on the Bank's first seeds project, the Tarai Seeds Project (Ln 0614-IN) in
Uttar Pradesh. The Bangladesh Cereal Seeds Project (Credit 0410-BAN) was
supported by an IDA credit of $7.5 million equivalent approved in June 1973. This
was followed by India National Seeds Project (Ln 1273-IN) supported by a Bank loan
of $25 million and the Pakistan Seeds Project (Credit 0620-PAK) supported by an IDA
credit of $23 million equivalent, both approved in 1976. The final project being
evaluated was India Second National Seeds Project (Credit 0816-IN) supported by an
IDA credit of $25 million equivalent, and approved in May 1978.
2.    The successful Bank-supported Tarai project was taken as a model. With hind-
sight this can be seen as a good, but second best, design. The option of maximizing
the role of a competitive private sector was never seriously considered. Rather the
projects took a "systems approach" and included resources for seed breeding,
multiplication, processing, marketing and certification. Major investments were in
large seed processing plants, plus necessary office, laboratory, communications and
transport equipment; accommodation was provided as needed. Technical assistance
and significant training components were also included. In India and Pakistan new
State (and Provincial) seed corporations were established, and in Bangladesh a new
Seed Wing was added to the existing Bangladesh Agricultural Development
Corporation (BADC). New seed certification and registration units were also
established. As was common at the time, almost all investments were in the public
sector.
3.    Despite some delays, implementation experience was satisfactory with the
exception of Pakistan, where despite Bank approved site engineers provided under
technical assistance, two of the four seed processing plants were found to be
structurally unsound, and had to be rebuilt (an expense shouldered by the Punjab
Provincial Government).
4.    At completion project outcome was judged to be at best uncertain, in the case
of Pakistan the project was canceled after a two and a half year extension to the
surprise and against the wishes of the Borrower. The projects came too late to
capitalize on the seed boom associated with the introduction of seed for the first



16
HYVs, and had difficulty in persuading farmers that Certified seed performed better
than HYV based seeds saved from the farmer's own fields, and indeed the yield gains,
from new seed releases were too small to be readily identified. Thus the projects
found themselves demand constrained. In effect the project rationale "there is no point
in breeding higher yielding seed if there is no multiplication and marketing system in
place" was stood on its head, and the projects found "there is no point in having a seed
multiplication and marketing system, if there is no recognizably better seed emerging
from seed breeders."' This is too severe a judgment, since farmer saved seed does
decline in productivity and become contaminated with weeds over time. Thus even
without any increase in yield, a valuable function is performed by feeding good quality
Certified seed into the informal seed multiplication system.
Impact: General Perspective
5.     Seven years after their PCRs, it is evident that the seeds projects in India and
Pakistan used a sophisticated strategy of "creative institutional obsolescence." No less
sophisticated for being in large measure unconscious. By promoting state or provincial
parastatal seed companies at the expense of a monopolistic national parastatal seed
company, the projects mobilized an effective constituency within the public sector in
support of decentralization. Not only did this undermine the political and bureaucratic
power of the national company, but the decentralized seed companies were less
inclined, or less able, to resist the entry of private sector companies. Just as the
national seed companies were asked to give way to state companies, so the state
companies will be increasingly asked to compete on a level playing field with the
private sector, or to give way entirely to the new competition.
6.     The original national parastatals made a major contribution by (a) an increase
in the physical supply of seed, (b) making farmers, politicians and the agricultural
sector in general "seed conscious," and (c) providing an initial cadre of seed scientists
and technologists. However, the natural evolution of a monopolistic parastal is to
become increasingly bureaucratic, inefficient, politically powerful and indispensable.
The decentralization of the seed industry from a single national monopoly to a series
of state or provincial seed companies was thus a brilliant move. It provided a public
sector dynamic, including many promotion possibilities, which the central company
could not resist. Moreover, it could not be couched in terms of public versus private
sector interests. It was an evolution entirely within the public sector.
7.    The seed industries have thus evolved from a single parastatal company, to
decentralized state or provincial parastatals, to a mixed private-public system, where
the public sector supplies predominantly self-pollinated varieties (SPVs), and the
1. Or, as Ahmad (1994, page 347) says "All efforts to produce quality seed will fail if there is no demand."



17
private sector supplies hybrids and specialized varieties. Further evolution of the seed
industries awaits a re-thinking of seed policy. The project paradigm that there should
be a 20 percent replacement rate for SPVs, and the cost should be paid for in full by
farmers, may simply be untenable. A re-examination could well lead to a lower
replacement rate or a change in the way the subsidy is paid and an enhanced role for
the private sector. The argument that the government should be willing to pay the full
cost of varietal development and of agricultural extension (because they are public
goods), but none of the costs of seed production (even though SPVs are in large
measure public goods) does not have intuitive appeal.
8.    In like vein, the continued existence of the seed companies brought into
existence by the projects, is basically irrelevant to a judgement as to the sustainability
of the projects. It is the continued supply of good quality seed to farmers at
reasonable prices which is the index of project "sustainability", not which organizations
are involved in seed supply. In those cases where parastatal companies evolve to the
point where they can compete without differential subsidy with the private sector, their
continued existence is to be welcomed. The projects have had a very positive effect
on the evolution of the seeds industries in the three countries; that the industries may
be in the process of outgrowing some of the institutions which originally fostered their
growth is an indication of sustainability, rather than unsustainability.
Country Impacts
9.    The Cereal Seeds Project in Bangladesh provided the first donor assistance to
the seeds sector, a "rock" on which many other donors have subsequently built. The
support for the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute was entirely appropriate; and the
support of the parastatal Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation's (BADC)
seed-wing, played a constructive role in the popularization of HYVs. Fortunately the
de jure monopoly position conferred on BADC was not reflected de facto due to the
self-pollinating characteristics of rice and wheat, which allow farmer multiplication of
HYV seeds. Indeed the most widely sown variety "paijam" was imported informally
and its multiplication has entirely by-passed the official system. Bangladesh has not
benefitted from the competition within the public sector, and hence the expansion of a
private sector seed industry has been slower than in India and Pakistan. In the context
of a subsequent operation, and in conjunction with other donors, the Bank has
prevailed upon the Government to publish a Seeds Policy. Whilst liberalizing the seed
industry generally, and allowing both private and public participation in the production
and distribution of seeds, this new policy still controls varietal release for five key
crops.2 Project outcome was judged saiisfactory, however less satisfactory than in
2. Varietal release committees, managed by government, also operate in India and Pakistan.



18
India and Pakistan where competition within the public sector set the stage for
competition with the private sector.
10.   In India (as in Pakistan) the projects had clearly had a more beneficial impact
at the time of the evaluation than seemed likely at project completion. In addition to
the SSCs, there were over 500 private seed companies, 24 of them with links to
multinational seed companies, and many of them with their own hybrid development
programs. This represents a critical mass of commercial interest and expertise which
is almost certainly a new and permanent feature of the agricultural sector in India. A
critical mass drawn in large part from seed breeders and other professionals who
gained their initial expertise under the auspices of the projects. One of these private
seed companies has been successful in pioneering the production and export of hybrid
cotton, thus marrying cheap Indian labor with high technology genetics.
11.   In Pakistan despite a shaky start, there are now four solid artifacts of the seed
project. An active and routine wheat and cotton breeding program, a rigorous seed
registration and certification program, a major certified wheat and cotton seed
marketing organization, and an extensive cadre of well trained seed industry
professionals. The Bank's initial sponsorship of monopoly Provincial seed companies
has not prevented the entry of multi-national seed companies and the emergence of
some modest private sector national seed companies. The Punjab Seed Corporation
having benefitted from five years of able and stable management now operates much
as a large farmer-owned cooperative in the United States; whilst breaking-even is
important, it does not operate to maximize profits, but rather to maximize benefits to
farmers.
Brief Lessons
12.   Key elements of project design, most of which these projects got right, are:
1.    Technical Training. The seed industry stretches all the
way from genetic research, through varietal development,
bulking up, certification, registration, production and
marketing. Many of these topics are highly technical, and
it follows that a cadre of well trained seed scientists and
technologists is a necessary condition for success of the
industry. Thus an active training component is an
essential element of a good project; technical assistance is
a very limited, temporary and imperfect substitute.
ii.   Institutional Infrastructure. An initial core of publicly
supported genetic research, seed breeding and seed testing
is essential for the rapid development of the industry.



19
There is no point in the training component, if trained
staff have nowhere to practice their professions. At a
later date, there is room for debate and experimentation
as to the relative roles of the public and private sectors in
research, breeding and certification. However, in
developing an industry, the public sector has to stand
ready to fulfiil any roles not yet satisfactorily performed
by the private sector.
iii.   Seed Production. Public production and marketing of
seed may well be a necessary initial step to (a)
demonstrate the existence of a market, and (b) to make
seed available pending the development of private sector
seed companies. There is every reason such parastatal
companies should be encouraged to compete, and if freed
from the more onerous of public sector bureaucratic
procedures they may be able to do so.
iv.   Break-up of Monopoly. It is essential to find some way
to avoid the emergence of a single all powerful parastatal
monopoly. One alternative may be to foster competing
parastatals, another would be to provide for seed
importation by companies, other than the seed production
parastatal. The apparent confusion due to imbalance in
seed supplies from different sources is a small price to
pay for avoidance of the policy inertia and bureaucratic
procedures which characterize dominance of an industry
by a single parastatal, or other forms of central planning.
v.    Remove Barriers to Entry. It is important to ensure that
there are no unnecessary barriers to entry of private firms
into the industry; that government not impose regulations
that prevent the private sector from functioning
efficiently; and that the private sector have equal access
to improved seeds and germ plasm produced from the
research system.  It is not necessary to have an active
pro-private policy stance; but it is essential not to have an
anti-private sector stance.
vi.   Subsidy. Under no circumstances should a subsidy be
used to give differential advantage to the public sector.
Any subsidy should be available to all. The



20
administrative problems of doing this, are a significant
additional argument against subsidy.
vii.   Independent Testing and Certification. National Uniform
Varietal Trial open to all; and a highly professional and
independent Seed Certification Authority to establish
standards for germination, purity, and genetic composition
are essential. A truly rigorous Seed Certification
Authority is perhaps the most important indicator of a
mature seed industry. In India certification is optional,
and this has worked well; but farmers need the option of
buying certified seed.
viii.   Support for Informal System. At least for the next twenty
years the bulk of non-hybrid seed planted is likely to be
farmer saved. Farmers need increased advice on roguing
for off-types, minimizing weed contamination, seed
cleaning and storage, and germination testing.3

1.   Bank Seeds Projects
1.1     Of the twelve seeds projects for which Project Completion or Project
Performance Audit Reports (PCRs or PPARs) are available all but two have been in
Asia, (Annex I). The exceptions are projects in Zaire and Ecuador. Designed, for the
most part, in the 1970s or early 1980 these projects fostered a public sector seed
production and delivery system. Often seed was under-priced so that public sector
seed production required continuing subsidies; subsidies which governments were able
and willing to pay.
1.2     The most successful aspects of these projects were usually training and the
creation of institutions for seed testing and certification. Weaknesses were,
surprisingly, a failure of research to produce improved self-pollinated varieties (SPVs)
and composites. and less surprisingly in multiplication and distribution. The latter
weaknesses were more often over-supply due to over-estimating the replacement rate
for SPVs,' than production shortfalls. Laying the foundations for a new generation of
projects, the lessons learned focussed on "letting the private sector do what it does
best." This is interpreted to mean the breeding of hybrids, and their production and
marketing. This may leave the breeding, and often the production and distribution, of
SPVs and composites to the public and informal sectors.2 Seed certification and
testing are also key functions for the public sector. The public and private sectors
described above are referred to collectively as the "formal" sector.
1.3     Farmer retained seed such as wheat, rice and cotton provides a third "informal"
sector. This informal sector which includes use of the farmers own saved seed, or seed
I.  A key distinction is between hybrid and non-hybrid seed. Non-hybrid seed whether open- on self-pollinated
can be saved by farmers with only gradual deterioration (due to off-types. weed seeds and other impurit' 2s). Self-
pollinated varieties. such as wheat and rice are easier to maintain, but even open-pollinated varieties such as maize
and sorghum can return their vigor for several generations when bred as "composites." Development of an improved
hybrid assures the developer of repeat sales year after year, since any retained seed will greatly under-perform its
parents. Release of a non-hybrid, only assures first-time sales, since farmers can keep their grain as seed, or sell it
to neighbors. The fraction of seed which is purchased commercially is called "the replacement rate," for hybrids it
is 100 percent; for non-hybrid varieties it can be as low as five percent. This replacement rate will increase as the
yield of the commercial seed exceeds the yield of farmer retained seed, and of course, the cheaper the commercial
seed. Non-hybrid commercial seed may yield more than farmer retained seed, either because of a successful
breeding program, or due to contamination of farmer retained seeds with other varieties and weeds or declining
disease resistance. In any case, it is clear that hybrid breeding can generate private profit, wvhilst the breeding of
non-hybrids has for the most part to be done as a public service. Vegetatively reproduced crops (by cuttings or
tubers, e.g. potatoes and cassava) though included in principle, have not featured widely in Bank projects. The
susceptibility of vegetatively reproduced plants to accumulate viral infections, should dictate a high replacement
rate.
2.  Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Corporation (a private company) has been very successful in pioneering the
production of hybrid cotton seed using hand sterilization. Andra Pradesh Seed Corporation (a state seed
corporation) expects to produce its first generation of hybrid rice in 1995. The Indian seed industry has thus gone
beyond technology transfer, to produce indigenous innovation.

exchanged or bought from neighbors or even traded through village merchants, is the
major source of seed for non-hybrid seed. How the informal sector operates is crucial
to the success of any seed system.3 More than 90 percent of wheat and rice seed is
provided from the informal sector in the three countries studied. Taking the extreme
case, of only one percent of seed sown being Certified (a one percent replacement
rate), and assuming no informal trade, the average generations of sown seed from
Certified seed would be 50. If all seed sown for the first three generations were sold
to other farmers through the informal system, the average generations from Certified
seed would be two. The impact of improved seed thus depends not so much on how
much Certified seed is bought, as to how actively the informal system multiples what it
buys. All projects recognized the existence of the informal sector (and assumed a
replacement rate of 20 percent), but made no attempt to influence the efficiency of its
operations.4
A. Sample Selection
1.4    The population of seeds projects for which a PCR or PPAR is available is
listed in Arnex I. It was felt that neither Zaire nor Ecuador were sufficiently
representative of their continents, to provide what otherwise might have been an
interesting "global comparison." Instead Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were selected
with (some) very similar agricultural areas and a similar origin for their public sector
institutions. India provides an example of a country with "a reasonably effective and
diversified seed industry," whilst in Bangladesh and Pakistan some problems remain.5
The PAR for Bangladesh suggested that the project had operated quite satisfactorily in
the public sector, whilst India and Pakistan had had varying degrees of difficulty. The
Indian seeds projects have already been the subject of one Impact Evaluation6
published in 1986. however the size of the industry and the Bank's continuing support
for it, suggested that another look by OED would be timely. In India with the two
projects covering nine States, it was impossible to visit them all. The three States
visited Uttar Pradesh, Andara Pradesh and Maharashtra were selected to give a good
geographic spread, and as being representative of the more successful States. This bias
is designed to maximize our understanding of successful projects, which it may be
profitable to imitate.

B. Design Features of the Impact Evaluation
1.5    Five to ten years after a project's closure, too many additional factors have
come into play for it to be very useful to try to hypothesize a "without project"
scenario.7  Rather an impact evaluation has to be concerned whether the combined
effects of the project, other investments and changed institutional and economic factors
has resulted in a satisfactory outcome. In particular, the last decade has seen a marked
shift from the "public sector lead development" paradigm to a paradigm which
emphasizes the key role of competitive private and inforrmal sectors. A significant
question is thus whether the seeds projects have facilitated or hindered a growing, and
appropriate, role for the private and informal sectors.
1.6    The Impact Evaluation (IE) used a two pronged approach to assessing the
performance of the seeds industry. The first was to question participants in the
industry, the "service providers," as to how the industry has changed, what
improvements have been made, what constraints still adversely affected the industry's
efficiency, and to what extent any of these changes can be associated with the projects
being studied. The second approach was to ask farmers, the "customers," how they
felt the industry has changed, and how well it now serves their needs. The basic
approach has thus been to infer the success of the project from the current status of the
industry, rather than to focus purely on those impacts directly traceable to the project.
As pointed out in footnote 7, five or ten years after project closure such "tracing" may
in any case be a chimera depending primarily on the perspective of the observer, rather
than the facts being observed. The key issues discussed below, provide further
insights into the approach used.
C. Key Issues
1.7    Key issues can be arranged around three themes: (a) Sustainability of the public
sector institutions created by the project, (b) any crowding out of the private sector by
public sector seed companies, and the associated issue of a level playing field, and (c)
support to the informal sector involving farmer saved seed for own use, or trade within
the village.
1.8    Breeding of SPVs such as wheat, rice and cotton is in the nature of a public
good, since the benefits to society are far greater than can be captured by the
organization developing the variety.8 Thus breeding and crop certification are
7.  The problem is not that a scenario cannot be hypothesized, but rather that a very wide range of very different.
but equally plausible, scenarios can be described. Any conclusions about project performance then depend more on
the choice of the hypothesized "without project" scenario, than on the known project performance.
8.  However, the common practice of having (public sector) breeding research organizations transfer seeds and
germ plasm at nominal cost annecessarily divorces seed breeders from a market test of the demand for their
products. They would be better to auction foundation seed, and seeds of inbred lines.



24
"natural" public sector activities, and the projects created or supported public sector
institutions to carry out these functions. Our interest is primarily in the sustainability
of the function and the quality of the product, which may or may not imply the
sustainability of the institutions created. In particular, a partial or complete take-over
of parastatal seed supply functions by the private sector need not imply that the project
benefits are unsustainable, nor indeed that the support of the public sector to "force"
the growth of the seed industry was ill-advised.
1.9   Necessary perhaps as a "quick-fix," the monopoly public sector seed companies
created by the projects could be managed so as to preclude entry by competitive
private sector companies. To what extent was this quick-fix, the enemy of a longer-
term private-sector based solution? Did the public sector emphasis of the projects lock-
out the private sector?
1.10  World-wide in developed as well as developing countries, the majority of SPV
seeds sown is seed saved by farmers from the previous crop. Often this is traded
"informally" between farmers, or through village merchants, but it is seed saved by
farmers in the vicinity in which it is grown. How adequately did the "systems
approach" used in project design meet the needs of this informal sector?
1.11   Though differing between projects, there was a common implicit bias against
the private sector due to one or more of the following: (a) public sector seed
subsidies, (b) price controls, (c) lack of access to new varieties and germ plasm, (d)
prohibition of import of some seeds, (e) restrictions on inter-regional trade, and (f) a
disappointing flow of improved varieties from the public research system. In India,
the established enabling seed law, which made varietal seed certification optional and
the large market help explain why private sector seed companies evolved more rapidly
than in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
D. The Environment, Women, Privatization, Governance and Poverty
1.12  Privatization and governance have been at the heart of the above discussion.
Not as ends in themselves, but as means to serving farmers better; and in particular,
finding the right complementary roles for the public and private sectors.
1.13   Seeds projects are unsuited to the direct pursuit of environmental, poverty or
gender objectives. However, as one component in programs designed to raise yields,
there are clear pay-offs to environmental and poverty concerns. Unless yield increases
can keep pace with population growth, additional land will have to be devoted to
agriculture; which means that it has to be taken from other uses, often environmentally
preferable uses. New disease resistant and pest tolerant varieties can reduce the need
for chemical treatments and hence reduce adverse environmental effects. For
subsistence farmers, a very important poverty group, an increase in yield due to better
seed provides and immediate increase in real income. Further, the decline in real



25
grain prices which has characterized particularly the last two decades, and can in large
part be attributed to the Green Revolution, has transferred huge sums to consumers,
many of them poor. The impact on subsistence farmers has been positive, but for
other farmers the income effects may have been negative. On balance, higher yields
clearly have to be welcomed.

2.    Project Design
A. Common Features
2.1    All four projects were strongly influenced by the successful experience of the
Tarai Seed Project (Loan 614-IN) in Uttar Pradesh. Conceived as an integral part of
the Green Revolution, this project was designed to make the semi-dwarf, irrigation-
and fertilizer-responsive, high yielding varieties (HYV) of wheat and rice developed at
CIMMYT and IRRI, widely available to farmers in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Project design
included (a) a lead role for the public sector, including the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural
University (UPAU) (b) plant breeding and variety testing, (c) proximity of plant
breeding, seed production and seed processing, (d) a compact area for seed production,
and (e) a significant training element. With hindsight, it can now be seen that the
timing, location and size of this project were key factors in its success. Timing
because the HYV seeds being supplied by the project were significantly more
productive than farmer saved seeds from established varieties,9 location because of the
dominance of large farms, many of them mechanized, and size because this
represented an incremental and local improvement of the national seed distribution
system, and not a revolution. In addition the evident benefits of the project's
improved seeds, generated whole-hearted enthusiasm in the various organizations
called on to cooperate in project implementation. The dampening effect of lower grain
prices reflecting the very success of the Green Revolution had not yet made themselves
felt. Key statistics for the four projects are given in Table 2.1.
2.2   From the perspective of the mid-1990s, it appears that these projects missed the
"first-best" design, which would have supported public sector breeding research and
seed certification; but would have left multiplication, marketing and intemational trade
to the private sector. As discussed below the project in India and Pakistan used a
"good second-best" design, which provided for a competitive public sector.
B. Bangladesh
2.3   Starting from a very unsatisfactory food grain and seed production situation,
the project was expected, by accelerating the adoption of HYV of rice and wheat by
one year, to yield an intemal economic rate of return (ERR) in excess of 70 percent.
There was no doubt as to the food crisis facing Bangladesh. During the 1960s rice
production had risen at two percent a year, whilst population had increased at three
percent. Forced to import 1.5 million tons per year of grain in the late 1960s, a
combination of adverse weather and the disorganization caused by the separation from
West Pakistan, necessitated the importation of 2.5 million tons of grain in 1972.

Seed Production (Tons)  12.000        113,700       136,400        100,000
2.4   The first HYV of rice (IR8) was released in the 1960s. The second HYV
(IR20) release. involved the importation of 1.800 tons of seed from the Philippines in
the summer of 1970. This was enough to plant 180,000 acres and was supported by a
package of inputs and trained personnel. Total area under HYV expanded from
200,000 acres in 1970 to 3 million acres in 1973 (of a total of 17.5 million acres
suitable for HYV). Improved rice seed production by the Bangladesh Agricultural
Development Corporation (BADC) accounted for only 4,400 tons per year, versus an
annual usage of 600,000 tons of seed. Rice is self-pollinating so that varietal purity
can be easily maintained for farmer saved seed. However, the change-over to new
HYVs clearly required the introduction of more than 4,400 tons (0.7 percent) of the
new seeds each year. Also there was no capacity to produce a continuing stream of
locally adapted HYVs.
2.5   The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) notes that whereas imported HYV wheat
seed could command up to a 100 percent price premium over food wheat; HYV rice
seed, after bulking up by BADC, commanded almost no premium from growers. In
part this may have reflected BADC pricing policy, or a lack of demonstration and
extension of improved yield, but the SAR attributed this equally to lack of farmer



29
demand for the poor quality seed then being produced by BADC. The Government
and Bank were clearly right in their diagnosis that a major increase in the effectiveness
of the seed industry was called for and, if achieved, would earn a high rate of return.
2.6   Project design called for a focus on rice and wheat, and the strengthening of
BADC. an input supply parastatal under the Ministry of Agriculture. Seeds
represented about 1.5 to 3 percent of BADC turn-over, fertilizer, chemicals, farm and
irrigation equipment representing the bulk of its activities. BADC was to be left with
its monopolv of seed imports and the bulking up of rice and wheat seeds for sale to
farmers. However, it was to be supplied with additional hardware (in the form of
farm equipmenL warehouse space, seed cleaning equipment), a cadre of expatriate
experts (to advise and improve management), and new institutions (a National Seed
Board and Seed Certification Agency also reporting to the Minister of Agriculture) to
support its activities. Contract seed production for BADC was to be rationalized into
fewer locations. but with larger contiguous areas (at least 10 acres) devoted to seed for
any given variety. A National Seed Board (NSB) was to advise government on the
pricing of improved seed, the resulting subsidy to BADC, the release of new seed
varieties. and the level of seed imports, if any. Support was also provided for seed
breeding principally to the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). A substantial
training program for rice breeders and BADC staff rounded out the project.
2.7   It was expected that the project would result in both increased quantity of seed
for sale (from 4.400 tons per year to 10,000 tons of paddy and 2,000 tons of wheat),
and an increase in quality (higher germination rates, increased seed purity and reduced
weed seed content). Initially this increased quality was expected to allow a premium
of 40 percent for BADC rice seed over food rice; rising to a 100 percent premium
over five vears at which stage BADC and support services would be on a full cost
recoverv and amortization basis. This vision of a self-financing parastatal based on
sales of SPV is common to all four projects. It is a vision which seems easier to
describe in the SAR, than to achieve in practice. If it were not for the Punjab Seed
Corporation. one might be tempted to believe it is a mirage.
C. India
2.8   Prior to the introduction of HYVs in 1961, India had a skewed and
undeveloped seed industry (Venkatesan, 1994). A small private sector produced
quantities of high-valued flower and vegetable seeds; whilst the public sector
disseminated improved seed from small, government-run farms located in each
Community Development Block. As successive HYVs were released in India, and as
farmers recognized the need to change varieties, private sector seed companies sprang
up to meet the demand, and there was a rapid change-over to the new varieties.
However, in the case of SPVs (notably wheat and rice) this was a temporary shift in
the demand for commercial seed, since farmers quickly reverted to replacing less than



30
ten percent of self-pollinated seed each year. In the face of collapsed demand, many
of the weaker seed companies were liquidated or otherwise left the industry.
2.9   Realizing that its small and dispersed seed farms were poorly designed to
promote these new varieties, and recognizing a public sector responsibility to certify
the quality of seed being sold, the Government established the National Seed Company
(NSC) in 1963 charged with promoting seed industry development, from production
through processing, storage and marketing; and to establish a system of quality control.
The initial efforts of the NSC to fulfill its mandate were themselves quite fragmented.
In 1969, the Bank supported Tarai Seed Project, provided the first systematic approach
to the provision of HYV seed, attuned to the needs of scientific plant breeding. This
was a cooperative effort of NSC, UPAU and farmers around the University who would
act as contract growers.
2.10  The Tarai Seed Project was generally regarded as successful. However, it was
a success which, if it was to be replicated, demanded a much reduced role for the NSC
in the physical aspects of seed production and distribution. The logic of generating
new HYVs and their basic seeds at the State Agricultural Universities was irrefutable,
but dictated a seed supply system decentralized, at least to the state level. National
Seeds Projects I and II, which are the subject of this evaluation, were a misnomer.
Their key objective was to "down-size" the NSC, and transfer seed improvement,
production and marketing to State Seed Companies (SSCs) modeled on the Tarai
project. In the case of Uttar Pradesh. the Tarai Seed Company was to be incorporated
into the Uttar Pradesh Seed Corporation. The National Seeds Project (NS1), supported
the creation of seed companies in Andhra Pradesh, Harvana, Maharashtra, and Punjab.
The Second National Seeds Project (NS2), supported the creation of seed companies in
Bihar, Karnataka. Orissa. Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
2.11   Project designs were similar. They called for (a) the creation of SSCs in the
nominated states, with NSC handing over relevant assets to these corporations in
exchange for equity, and the State Government taking equity, (b) the provision of
offices. vehicle, stores. and processing equipment, as needed by the SSCs, (c) on farm
investments in State Farm Corporation of India (SFCI) farms for seed production, and
a line of credit for similar improvements on the farms of private contract growers, (d)
assistance for seeds research and basic seed production at Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR) stations, and the Agricultural Universities (AUs), (e)
credit for storage and cleaning equipment for private traders, and (f) technical
assistance. Project conditionality involved (a) NSC withdrawing from seed production
or intra-state trade in the affected States, (b) establishment of a National Seeds
Development Councili.(NSDC) to advise government, and a Project Planning and
Monitoring Committee (PPMC) to monitor and coordinate project activities including



31
procurement. and (c) the establishment of State Seed Certification Agencies
(SSCAs).1'
2.12   The rump of NSC was thus supposed to focus on (a) national policies, (b) the
forecasting of seed demand, (c) the management of a reserve stock of seed, (d) inter-
state seed trade, (e) promotion of improved seed, and (f) seed registration. Assurances
were also obtained that (a) the private trade would not be discriminated against, and
(b) it would be consulted on all policy or regulatory decisions. Some national control
on inter-state trade in rice (and hence a continued role for NSC) was necessitated by
the existence of a two-price scheme, with rice being significantly lower priced in
surplus areas, than deficit areas. To make improved seed affordable, its price was to be
related to the regional price of paddy. Retail sales of seed would be handled by
registered distributors, who for the most part were expected to be cooperatives which
alreadv handled the bulk of sales of fertilizer and chemicals to farmers.
2.13   From the perspective of the mid-nineties, the treatment of the private sector in
these projects is interesting. On the one hand, the projects were forward looking, in
requiring that the private sector not be discriminated against, on the other hand the
absence of any clear positive and constructive role for the private sector is striking.
The actions taken under the projects discriminated in favor of the public sector.
However. the voluntary nature of seed certification allowed the private sector to
expand despite lack of direct encouragement and poor access to germ plasm. SSCs
were expected to be profitable despite paying 11 percent on equity and borrowing, in
part due to a projected decline in the price to seed growers of 20 to 30 percent over
the life of the project (SAR for NSI, para. 7.04).
Projected yield increases from the projects were about ten percent on sown area in the
respective states. This resulted in estimated ERRs of 65 percent and 158 percent for
the first and second projects respectively.
D.    Pakistan
2.14 The Pakistan Seed Project is very similar to the Indian projects. It involves
two Provinces. Sindh and Punjab. and on a pilot basis Baluchistan and Northwest
Frontier Province (NWFP). It covers not only wheat and rice, but also cotton and
maize with support for pulses, oilseeds, fodder crops, potatoes and vegetables (the
latter two on a strictly pilot basis). Full production was to involve 103,000 tons of
seed per year. It would create two new Provincial Seed Corporations (PSCs) as well
as a National Seeds Council and Federal Seed Certification Department (FSCD) and
National Seed Registration Departrnent (NSRD). Passage of supporting legislation was
a condition of effectiveness.
10. Pre-existing seed legislation. made certification of varieties optional. This provision was left in place.



32
2.15  This was the third effort to establish a modem, public sector. seed industry in
Pakistan. Earlier national efforts first under the aegis of the Department of
Agriculture. and secondly under a parastatal Agricultural Development Corporation
(ADC) had given unsatisfactory results, indeed the ADC was disbanded in 1972.
Government continued its policy of excluding the private sector from the seed
industry, and pinned its hopes on the creation of PSCs in the Punjab and Sindh, see
Box P1. In contrast to India, the expansion of the PSCs in Pakistan was not intended
to shrink the activities of an existing national organization, since this had already been
disbanded. The PSCs were to be legally, operationally and financially autonomous.
Pilot schemes involving potatoes and vegetable seeds were also to be supported under
the auspices of the Northwest Frontier Province Agricultural Development Authority,
and Baluchistan Department of Agriculture. It was recognized that the earlier seed
supply schemes had left farmers suspicious regarding seed produced by Government
institutions (SAR para. 2.03).
2.16  Provincial Govermnents were to provide loan and equity capital for company
development. The SAR identified the challenge this would present to company
management, since current public sector seed prices were only marginally above grain
prices, but to break-even the companies would need seeds prices 90 percent higher
than grain prices, and 60 percent higher for cotton, (SAR para. 5.04). In the face of a
bad track record by the public sector. and farmer indifference to public sector seed,
provision was made for achieving these margins over a 5-year period. with government
subsidies in the mean time. Subsidies were to be paid monthly "until such date as
IDA shall establish," (SAR para. 5.05). Principal project components for the PSCs
were (a) four seed processing plants tthree in Punjab and one in Sindh), (b)
development of farms for basic seed production, (c) 33 person-years of technical
assistance. (d) farm equipment for contract seed growers. and (e) offices, vehicle and
laboratories for the FSCD and Research Institutes. Whilst seed production was to
remain largely a provincial monopoiy. (often using contract growers), retail sales
would be in the hands of (private) authorized distributors and cooperatives; always
subject to retail prices fixed by the seed corporations. Competition (presumably non-
price competition) would be encouraged between distributors, (SAR para. 5.03).
2.17  Yield increases were projected as 20 percent for maize (due to variety changes)
and ten percent for wheat, rice and cotton (due to quality of seed with unchanged
varieties), on area sown to these crops. On the basis of these apparently modest
estimates a net value of US$267 million per annum was projected. leading to an ERR
estimate of 82 percent, (SAR paras 6.01 and 6.08).



33
Box P1: Contrasting Perspectives of SAR and PCR
The following two quotes suggest that the staff's reservations about the
wisdom of further public sector involvement in seed production was not fully
conveyed to the Board when the project was proposed for approval. The SAR
said:
"1.03 The project was formulated by GOP (Government of Pakistan)
with the assistance of FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission which visited
Pakistan in the Spring of 1973. Following a subsequent policy decision by GOP
to exclude private sector participation and to make agriculture a Provincial
responsibility, instead of a Federal one, the Provinces submitted to IDA, in the
fall of 1974, separate proposals ....... "(SAR, para 1.03, emphasis added).
The PCR, describing the same events said:
"3.01 .   FAO made a feasibility study in 1973 under the auspices of the
FAO/CP (Cooperative Program with the World Bank). The Bank and
Government accepted the FAO Report, with exceptions.
3.02 One of the principal FAO recommendations was to have the private
sector develop the new seed industry. FAO listed four alternatives in order of
merit: private enterprise; cooperatives; a semi-autonomous agency; and, lastly a
government agency. Government and Bank accepted the private sector
recommendation. However, discussion in favor of public ownership developed.
Eventually, the Government decided on public ownership, over the strong and
continuing objections of the Bank's project staff and FAO. It was obviousfirom
the history that public ownership of the seed industry had not worked, and
Government, FAQ and the Bank were all aware of this. Bank staff tried to
improve the prospects of success of public ownership by introducing undertakings
of a safeguard nature in the project legal documents, but to no avail ........." (PCR,
paras 3.01-3.02. emphasis added).

3. Project Performance at Completion or Audit
A. Common Features
3.1    Project implementation experience has already been reviewed in PCRs and
PPAMs, and will not be summarized again. Some general perceptions of performance
at completion are reviewed here. The most significant factor is that the projects were
too late to capitalize on the introductory demand for HYV seeds. Wheat and rice are
SPVs and by the time the projects were operational, most farmers were already using
HYV derived seed; much of it obtained as farmer saved seed. This was in marked
contrast to the Tarai project on which the projects had been modelled.
3.2    The projects took a "systems approach" and explicitly included resources to
support the generation, release and multiplication of new and improved varieties;
however, actual performance was more successful in introducing new varieties, than
improved varieties. With hindsight, some form of market mechanism should have
been used to transfer seed and germ plasm from research stations to the seed industry.
The resulting competition (or lack of it) for new germ plasm would have provided
guidance on needed breeding priorities. In practices, the breeding effort was more
effective in defending the existing genetic gains than in improving yields per se."
The lack of a stream of new and improved varieties, on which the projects had been
predicted, was quickly noticed by farmers, who for the most part had not had good
experiences with public sector seed supplies, and seed demand failed to expand.'2
The projects then found themselves demand constrained, with several adverse effects.
They were over-capitalized for the actual level of demand; and were unable to raise
seed prices to the levels needed to break-even. The SAR projections of a virtuous
circle of increased farmer recognition of the superiority of project produced seed
permitting prices to be raised progressively until in five years all production costs were
being covered, never came near being realized, prior to project closure (Box BI, for a
more optimistic view see Section IV). During project implementation the basic pattern
of monopolistic parastatal supply of seed (from domestic production or imports)
remained firmly in place; and the task of demand creation went by default. The
"magic of the market-place," whereby even for SPVs private traders might have
identified and promoted import opportunities, was not unleashed.
3.3    As against the above rather pessimistic view at project completion, the training
components of the projects had worked well, SSCAs and SSCs were established and
ample, not to say excess, seed storage and processing facilities were put in place. At
11. World-wide experience indicates genetic gains of only 0.5 to 1.5 percent per year (Byerlee (1994, Table 5).
Thus it is no surprise that further genetic gains, following the introduction of HYVs were not readily apparent to
farmers.
12. Wheat in Bangladesh being a notable exception, see Table BI.

the very least, existing genetic gains were defended; a not inconsiderable achievement
when the potential losses from rust in the absence of an active breeding program are
considered. In all three countries the technical expertise on seed production and
quality control available in the public sector at project completion was very much
better than at project inception. With this general view in mind, we now turn to
individual project experiences.
B.    Bangladesh
3.4   The Cereal Seeds Project, was subject to an audit, hence there are two views as
to the project's performance at closure. The PPAM was more positive, than the PCR,
perhaps too positive. In particular. the PPAM says:
"partly as a result of this project, the concept of a system approach to
seed production is now recognized in Bangladesh; institutions
contributing to the function of seed production recognize their
complementarities and the need to coordinate their development
programs; this observation contrasts with the PCR conclusion (para.
6.03) that support to BRRI should have been reduced to simplify project
design," (PPAM page iii).
3.5   By contrast the PCR focussed on the increases in seed production achieved by
BADC and its contract growers; and the establishment of the Seed Certification
Agency (SAC). The expansion of BADC seed production is given in Table B1.

3.6    Total BADC seed production approximated the SAR projections (11,916 tons
in 1979/80 and 10.788 tons in 1981/82 versus projection of 12,000 tons in project year
six (1978/79), SAR Annex 15, page 2). In 1979/80 total production was 98 percent of
projected. However, as Table B1 clearly shows this was as a result of greatly
overshooting wheat seed production projections (7,901 tons versus 2,000) with a more
than compensating shortfall in paddy seed production (4,014 versus 10,000). This
imbalance is not directly addressed in the PCR/PPAM, and hence it is not possible to
judge whether this represented a conscious policy decision to emphasize wheat seed at
the expense of paddy, or whether it represented what BADC could sell, or some other
reason. Wheat seed continued to be imported in large quantities. It is notable that
contract growers were willing to expand production quite rapidly, while public sector
seed multiplication farm production remained static.



38
Box B1: Cost Recovery (PPAM para 22)
The Development Credit Agreement called for BADC to set and maintain prices
for rice and wheat seeds at a level sufficient to cover full production costs. This was not
achieved under the project. Government officials in charge of project implementation
questioned both the feasibility and the desirability of full cost recovery at this stage in
the development of the seeds industry in Bangladesh for the following reasons:
i.  the national capability for developing varieties promising a high probability
of improved yields and acceptable quality has been weak. As a result, BADC could not
always supply seeds of proven varieties, even if it had the capability to do so;
ii.  the utility of quality seeds has not become obvious to the majority of
farmers, partly due to lack of evidence at the farm level of higher yields unquestionably
due to better seeds. Thus, BADC has had to slowly create a demand for its seeds and
attempt to meet it within the constraints under which it had to operate;
iii.  BADC has had no control over the selection of varieties to be multiplied.
It has been repeatedly asked to multiply seeds of varieties which its staff regarded as not
fully stabilized or which were known to be susceptible to diseases;
iv.  as a result, BADC was neither in a position to guarantee the quality of the
seeds it sold (a prerequisite for creating a steady demand) nor in a position to be
responsive to farmers' needs by supplying varieties they preferred or ones with proven
superior potential (a basis for expecting farmers to pay prices commensurate with the
cost of producing quality seeds);
v.  BADC's overhead cost have, so far, been high in relation to the quantity of
seeds it has been supplying. Although such overhead cost would likely be justified in
view of the potential market to be served, it would take a tripling of the quantity of
seeds presently produced before BADC could be expected to fully reflect all its overhead
costs in its selling price and still have a market for its seeds; and
vi.  although the seeds unit was given responsibility for managing the day-to-
day operations of seeds production, processing and marketing, it was not given the
authority needed to assume that responsibility, particularly in relation to manpower and
financial resources management. Staff recruiting, transfer, promotion and training were
handled centrally within BADC without sufficient consideration for the particular needs
of the seeds industry; budgetary allocations and accounts were also handled centrally,
with the result that the seeds unit was allocated financial resources in relation to its
relative importance within BADC (five percent of BADC operations) rather than in
relation to its needs.



39
3.7    The paddy and wheat seed prices are given in Table B.2. Wheat seed price fell
rapidly relative to feed wheat over the first four years of the project. The SAR called
for paddy seed prices to be double the price of paddy for food rice by the fifth year of
the project. This was never in sight; after achieving a 55 percent premium over paddy
for rice in 1977/78, the premium declined to 22 percent. That this was basically due
to BADC being unable to supply paddy seed of recognizably superior quality is
graphically described in the PPAM, see Box B1.'3
3.8    In summarv, at its closing the project had dramatically increased the technical
sophistication of people throughout the public seed sector, due to the projects major
emphasis on training. It had developed new institutions BRRI,'4 the SCA and NSB,
and very substantially expanded the production of wheat seed, without yet fully
satisfying domestic demand. The indications are that real value was provided by this
wheat seed since the price was one at which contract growers were willing to expand,
and consumers were also willing to increase their demand."5 As against this, -he
SCA's funding was by no means secure,'6 and the questions of price policy and the
appropriate role for the public sector had not been addressed. A price policy study
promised in the SAR, was not undertaken, so that even at completion the likely cost of
continuing BADC's monopoly was not yet evident. The PCR wistfully notes that
"today emphasis is given to greater involvement of the private sector" (PCR para.
6.05). An emphasis that derailed a proposed Seeds II project; even though seed
production was to remain the monopoly of a new parastatal, Seed Corporation of
Bangladesh, with only seed distribution to be fully privatized.
C. India
3.9    The two National Seeds Projects under review, presupposed that the
performance of the Tarai Seed Project, could be reproduced nationally, albeit on a
state by state basis. This proved to be an unjustified assumption, for a number of
reasons. In place of the orderly implementation of investments to support rational and
13.  Ironically, farmers in trading amongst themselves would swap two measures of food grain for one measure of
seed, thus paying well in excess of BADC's price for farmer saved seed. (SAR, Seeds Project II, para. 1.06).
14. BRRI feels that this assessment is too generous to the project and has commented that "the impact of the credit
was minimal or negligible to BRRI. Under the credit there was some infrastructural development but there was no
human resource development in the seed technology sector. Bangladesh still lacks human resources in the areas of
seed science and seed technology."
IS.  Indeed, there was evidence of excess demand at these prices, since the PCR notes BADC's wheat seed was
often resold at over double BADC's price. (PCR, para. 4.01).
16.  The PCR is typically upbeat saying "Despite these problems, rules for seed production have been produced
and seed certification manual prepared.... SCA has now become a major force in the industry," (PCR para. 3.19).
This contrasts with the PPAM's assessment "SCA, although established, remains weak, mostly due to limited staff,
and experience," (para. 7).

agreed allocation of tasks between public sector institutions to meet well defined
demand for seed envisaged in the SARs, the PCR reports delays, design changes,
duplication and construction of surplus capacity, due in part to very different
perceptions of institutional roles, and vastly over-estimated demand. For details the
reader is referred to the excellent joint PCR,'7 including the NSC's careful statement
of the circumstances of the noted delays and changes.
3.10   A vicious triangle of mutually reinforcing design features help explain this
relatively poor performance:'8
i.   key rationale for the projects was that the breeding of a stream
of ever higher yielding varieties would not translate into
higher crop production unless there was a delivery system
capable of multiplying the seeds and getting them into the
hands of farmers. However, the project experience, at least up
the time of the PCR stood this proposition on its head. No
matter how efficiently the multiplication and distribution
aspects of the project might have functioned its impact would
have been modest in the absence of higher yielding varieties to
distribute to farmers. There was no lack of new varieties
developed and released by the ICAR research stations and
AUs. but these new varieties were very little, if any, better
than the already released HYVs. Farmers quickly noted that
new was not necessarily better, and demand collapsed.
ii.  NSC was given a totally impossible task: it was expected to
equate inter-state supply and demand balances, by command
and control techniques, wvithout being able either to command
or control. Like any exercise in central planning it presented
no problem in theory, but was not capable of implementation.
NSC could not go into the market to assure its seed supplies;
rather it was limited to the amounts SSCs were willing to
make available to it. SSCs in turn were expected by their
political masters to supply seed to the State's own farmers
before making sales to other states via NSC. Though
contracts were entered into, there were virtually irresistible
forces militating against full contractual compliance. With

18.  Poor performance relative to the SAR projections which implied ERRs of 65 percent and 158 percent. Seed
production, or perhaps more importantly seed demand, fell well short of SAR projections; however, as the PCR
remarks, the basic institutional infrastructure for a modern seed industry was successfully put in place, and demand
for seed, albeit at a lower level, was met.



41
hindsight it would have been better to ensure unrestricted
inter-state trade."9 Faced with de facto unenforceable
contracts with its SSC suppliers, it was inevitable that NSC
should be reluctant to give up its assured source of supply
based on direct contracting with producers. SSCs, on the
other hand, faced with "over-supply" in good seasons, flat
sales in their home state and no interest from NSC to take
their unforseen surpluses off their hands, were naturally
tempted to make inter-state sales on their own account, often
at discounted prices. For this inter-state trade by SSCs, the
NSC was at best superfluous, and at worst a competitor.
iii. These projects involved a very large number of overlapping
organizations, in particular NSC, SFCI, and ICAR and PMMC
at the Federal Level, the SSCs, SSCAs, AUs and State
Departments of Agriculture at the state level and within the
states, the seed growers. Since the project involved reducing
the production responsibilities of NSC, SFCI and the State
Departments of Agriculture it is no surprise that these
organizations were not totally committed to the project
concept.
3.11   At least implicitly, the PCR makes a strong case that at project completion the
seed industry was in need of a fundamental policy review:
"Most, if not all, SSCs are in varying degrees of financial difficulty with
the continued existence of some in doubt. Likewise, a number of AUs
are in financial difficulty as regards their foundation seed programs.
Four State Seed Certification Agencies run at a substantial loss largely
as a result of state policies (on pricing of services. etc) and another two
have been forced into considerable retrenchment of activities," (PCR
para. 5).
"It seems clear that the marketing problems faced by the SSCs are due
mainly to the fact that their certified seed does not necessarily give
significantly higher yields than other seed used bv farmners (either
retained from an earlier crop or obtained from another farmer),
particularly for self-pollinated varieties," (PCR para. 4.16).
19. However, this would have forced major retrenchment on NSC, since the market would not have required the
assistance of NSC's quite extensive staff, and, would have exposed SSCs to price competition. No wonder the
bureaucrats preferred to "muddle through."



42
"The SSCs suffer from competition by NSC, SFCI and sometimes DOA
(all undermining the NSP principle of well-defined public sector roles)
and the private sector. The latter not only compete with varieties but
their public variety certified seed is frequently cited as being of better
quality and often cheaper. The quality aspect is possible with regard to
field performance as this is sometimes determined by vigor, a quality
enhanced by good production and handling techniques but not
controlled by certification. Lower prices may result from greater
flexibility in the market, greater efficiency, and less fixed investment in
large plant and machinery," (PCR para. 6.6).
3.12  This all contrasts with the Tarai model where a single state company in the
aftermath of the Green Revolution could offer better seed, where all organizations
were enthusiastic participants, and NSC could factor excess seed production into its
overall procurement and stock holding plans. The Tarai Project had brought new
players into the industry, without challenging the dominant role of the existing players.
3.13  None of the above should detract from what was achieved. The level of
expertise in the seed industry was greatly improved, SSCs and SSCAs were brought
into existence, the key role of ICAR and the AUs in generating improved varieties was
increasingly acknowledged, and substantial investments in production, processing and
storage capacity were put in place. As mentioned in para. 2.2, in a first-best world the
role of NSC and SFCI would have been drastically cut back, thus greatly reducing the
need for public subsidies. But whether this was politically feasible given the
development paradigm of the times is at best moot.
D. Pakistan
3.14  The project had severe implementation problems, which are very fully and
frankly discussed in the PCR (paras 4.01-4.29). In particular, none of the four seed
processing plants were completed at project closing, despite an 30 month extension;
and the civil works for two of the plants were so poor, that they had to be
abandoned.' These fundamental problems encountered during implementation made
it very difficult to assess impact at completion in any definitive way. Both the PCR
and PPAR are highly ambiguous in their judgements. The PSCs and FSCD were
established, and substantial volumes of seed (about 66 percent of SAR projection of
103,000 tons) were processed by the two companies. However, reservations are
expressed in the PCR (para. 5.04) as to the quality of this seed. Both PSCs were
financially viable at project completion, albeit dependent on subsidies which were
being paid in a timely manner. Perhaps most importantly, in 1984 Cargill
International was invited to establish a breeding and marketing program for oilseeds.
20. It says a great deal for the Punjab Government's commitment to the project, that this rebuilding was to be
undertaken using their own funds.



43
This suggested the possibility of a new approach to the role of multinational and other
private companies in the seed industry.
3.15  The PPAM noted "some ambivalence towards the project by those involved in
the seed industry. Many farmers, commercial interests, civil servants and others held
the opinion that the seed industry was already adequate and prosperous. As project
implementation progressed the difficulties experienced, particularly those of the seed
plants, may have reinforced these reservations, which were in many ways self-
fulfilling," (PPAM para. 11). However, on balance it concluded that the project was
sustainable. "The audit considers the seed certification and quality control
achievements of the project to be highly sustainable. Certification is the main way of
assuring the farmer that he is receiving genetically pure seed of the variety identified
on the label. Seed certification is now well established as an independent function.
Whether the provincial governments will continue their present level of support for the
two parastatal firms will depend on budget limitations and policy considerations as
well as the effectiveness of these firms in providing farmers with a reliable supply of
quality seed in a timely manner," (PPAM para. 26).

4. Project Impact
A. Common Features
4.1    There has never been any doubt that the seeds projects would have a long term
impact. Introduced in response to the availability of HYV seeds and food crises, seed
has been recognized since project inception as a key agricultural input. The parastatal
seed companies supported, or indeed established, by these projects have had mixed
success in dealing with the challenge of operating efficiently whilst subject to public
service regulations and procedures. However, in every case, the way has been opened
for an expansion of the role of the private sector in seed supply. In practice the
private sector has been more interested in hybrid and vegetable seeds, so that there
have not been major problems with respect to wheat and rice. Thus the Bank's
support for the public sector has not inadvertently crowded out the private sector, in
part due to the Bank having pointed to the positive and complementary role that the
private sector could be called upon to play.
4.2    The institutions established by these projects were all in existence and
functioning at the time of the IE.2' In particular, the generation of new varieties was
operating routinely in all three countries. All three also had the same problem that
though secondary characteristics were being improved, significant yield increases
continued to elude the breeders (see, however, footnote 11). With respect to seed
certification and marketing, project institutions continued to function, but at very
different levels of effectiveness in the three countries. Seed supply is dominated by
the informal sector, which continued to be largely invisible to those responsible for
seed policy. The little evidence gathered by the IE, suggested marked differences, in
the efficiency with which the informal sector disseminated the improved germ plasm
brought from the formal sector as certified seed.
B. Bangladesh
"The Bank's seed projects were one strand in an enormously successful
agricultural program." Comment by Bank Project Officer.
4.3    The Agricultural Program. The above is a subtle comment, since it makes no
judgement as to whether the seeds projects were indeed crucial to the success of the
agricultural program or even held it back. It is, in the IE's view, a justified comment
21.  The continued existence of these institutions, is not direct evidence of sustainability. The issue is not their
continued existence, but rather the continued satisfactory provision of the services they were designed to provide.
The demise of a parastatal and its replacement by private sector companies indicates neither that the project was
unsustainable, nor that the original investment in the parastatal was unwise. The parastatal could have had a vital
role as mid-wife to private sector investments.



46
on Bangladesh's agricultural progress; but leaves open the whole issue of the seed
projects and seed industry in the march to self-sufficiency.
4.4    Some key variables indicative of the success of the agricultural program as a
whole are given in Table B3. Self-sufficiency in rice has been achieved in Bangladesh
based primarily on an increased area under irrigation, and associated switch to the use
of HYV. If the apparent promise of several new HYVs released in 1994 from BRRI
is fulfilled, and if earlier problems of varietal stability are not encountered then
significant exportable surpluses could emerge.
4.5    Despite the rapid rise in the sales of improved seed by BADC, directly in line
with the increase in fertilizer and modem irrigation, the area sown to certified seed
was only about 296,900 ha to rice and 166,400 ha to wheat (or about 3 and 29 percent
of total area respectively). Indirect influence due to farmer saving of BADC derived
seed would of course affect a much larger area. Information on varietal yields is
sparse.
4.6    It is not possible to disentangle completely the individual contributions of seed
quality, fertilizer, modem irrigation, and other cash inputs; hence the above comment
that the total program was a success.22  What is significant is that dramatic expansion
in modem irrigation and fertilizers was associated with their removal from BADC's
monopoly control, and the springing into being of a vast network of village merchants
selling fertilizer, and entry of new irrigation supply dealers. This liberalization of
agricultural input markets was indeed the core of the successful agricultural program.
A program which was least successful with respect to seeds.
4.7    Announcement of a new "Seeds Policy of Bangladesh" in April 1993, promised
equal treatment for the private trade in all aspects of seed production and supply.
Whilst the seed policy is quite restrictive on import of the five key crops:
"8.1 Except for appropriate plant quarantine safeguards, restrictions on
importation of seeds are to be eliminated. Approved varieties of rice,
wheat, jute, potato and sugar cane may be imported for commercial sale.
However, registered seed growers will be permitted to import small
quantities of seeds of rice, wheat, jute, potato and sugar cane for
adaptability testing." (emphasis added).
Actual practice is quite permissive; import permits are routinely issued for
species not varieties. Thus allowing the importer to select the variety to be imported.
22.  Note however, that investment in irrigation (typically through tube-wells or low-lift pumps) leads to an
immediate switch to the use of HYV, or HYV derived seed. This gain is not dependent on the release of new
varieties; however as irrigated, and hence HYV using, area increases, so does the potential gain from the release of
even higher yielding HYVs.

4.8    We have already seen that BADC sales of certified rice seed were only enough
to sow about three percent of the crop; thus BADC's degree of "monopoly control"
was greatly tempered by the ability of farmers to save seed from one crop for use in
the next. The key role for commercial certified seed supplies is thus to feed in new
genetic material which is in effect multiplied further in farmer to farmer, and village
merchant, trade. Breeding of new self-pollinating varieties, seldom provides a profit
potential for the private sector.23  However, a profitable trade, with major benefits to
rice farmers, can be based on the "once-off' sale of new varieties whether produced by
local research stations, or imported. It is this rapid distribution to farmers of the best
new varieties which has been adversely affected by the retained monopoly on varietal
23. Wheat, though self-pollinating, provides a partial exception to this rule, due to the difficulty of storage in
Bangladesh's very humid climate, Srivastava (1993, p. I1).



48
releases. Currently, the selection of varieties to be multiplied by BADC is decided by
the NSB, often resulting in BADC having to market a balance of varieties, that it does
not consider optimal.24  This will be changed once the new seed policy is adopted by
Parliament.
4.9    Impact of the Seeds Project. The Cereal Seeds Project, was the first of three
Bank sponsored projects. The second, National Seeds Project was appraised, but the
Bank and the Government could not agree on appropriate policy conditionality, and it
was withdrawn from the lending program. The third "project" was financially a minor
component of the Agricultural Support Services Project25 (Credit 2233-BAN), but had
important policy conditionality, since the Government undertook to publish a Seeds
Policy, which would greatly reduce BADC's role, and ensure a level playing field for
private seed production, importation and distribution.
4.10   Two decades later, it is difficult to envisage either the public sector
development paradigm which dominated donor thinking, or apparent "problem" faced
in getting green revolution HYV's adopted by farmers. The Tarai experience fitted
well with this paradigm. The somewhat "brute-force" approach of getting BADC, the
monopsony agricultural input supply parastatal to add seeds to its offering, did at least
provide some HYV's to farmers. Support for seed breeding in Bangladesh provided
another small source of high quality seed in the form of improved varieties released
informally from the experiment station (Supervision Report, April 6, 1978, para.
6.01).26 Whether by informal importation, official purchases of BADC seed, farmer
multiplication or other means, there was a fairly rapid, though not universal, adoption
of HYVs.
24.  However, the quantity of seed multiplied appears to be under the control of BADC (though not closely
coordinated with the agricultural research stations): in 1993, BADC took only 30 percent of the available breeder
seed for rice, 17 percent for wheat and 66 percent for jute.
25.  In addition the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) Food Crop Sector Policy Loan contained strong
conditionality calling for liberalization of the seed trade, as did the Bank's Shallow-Tubewell, and Low-Lift Pump
Project (Credit 2253-BAN) and National Minor Irrigation Project (Credit 2246-BAN). None of these projects called
for direct physical assistance to BADC or the seeds sector.
26.  As pointed out in footnote 25, of the breeder seed produced by the agricultural research institutes 70 percent
of the rice, 87 percent of the wheat and 34 percent of the jute was not used by BADC; it "leaked" to the research
institutes themselves, to regional agricultural research stations, NGOs or farmers, or was wasted.

Box B2: The Seed System Through Farmer's Eyesa
Farmers consulted in focus group discussions in five districts of Bangladesh in the fall of
1994, had remarkably consistent views of the seed supply system. These views included:
1. That seed obtained from BADC had eight to ten percent higher yields than farmer saved
seeds of the same varieties.
2. That farmer saved seed was preferable to BADC seed purchased from private traders, due
to the possible contamination with uncertified seed. Farmer's (and some traders) complained of
the variability of trader supplied seed. Sometimes it was up to the best BADC seed, but on other
occasions very poor yields resulted.
3. BADC could not be relied upon to have its certified seed available when needed, a month
prior to planting.
4.  A few progressive farmers got seed by direct contact with experiment stations.
5. The best HYV releases, in terms of yield, occurred in the early 1980s. Current yields
were thought to be about five percent lower on new varieties, though grain quality is better.
6. The typical pattern was for certified seed for a new variety to be obtained from BADC,
or possibly a research station, and then to be saved by farmers for from 3 to 10 generations before
another new variety was adopted. Most villages had seen three to eight HYV's be dominant
(sometimes in parallel) since the introduction of HYV's.
7. Where applicable, HYV's were thought to yield twice as much as traditional varieties.
8. In the district bordering India, several Indian varieties were nominated as performing
better than the varieties which could be obtained from BADC.
9. Suggestions for improvements to the existing seed system, from both farmers and traders,
focussed not on the official BADC/Seed Certification/Seed Breeding system, but on the need to
help farmers improve the quality of their own saved seed. Storage methods, seed cleaning,
maintenance of varietal purity were mentioned. In addition, they mentioned lack of financial
resources to allow them to purchase good threshing, drying, and storing equipment and chemicals
for protection.
10. Seed supply and quality were not a major felt problem.

4.11    The project was successful in establishing three new public sector institutions,
BRRI, SCA and the seed wing of BADC. The first should be a significant national
asset (with over 200 scientists and economists devoted to various aspects of rice
production, see however footnote 14). However, the full potential of the BRRI
remains to be realized. In particular, BRRI has not "followed its breeder seed to the
field." The reasons for the relatively poor farmer reputation of "Government" seed
(only eight to ten percent higher yielding than farmer saved seed), including whether it
is justified or merely a perceptual problem, has not been studied. Since most seed is
from farmer's own fields, there is also a need for improved seed storage systems for
farmers, in the light of Bangladesh's very humid climate. SCA has not been able to
demonstrate any very clear value since it has been confined to testing of rice, wheat
and jute seed produced by BADC,2` and judging by farmer skepticism as to the
quality of "Government" paddy seed, has not been fully effective. The third, the seed
wing of BADC, is now seen to be severely handicapped by having to operate in the
public sector. Direct exposure to the operational problems of BADC2" reinforced
Bank disappointing experience world-wide in trying to strengthen production and
marketing parastatals. The result was a changed perspective from seeing public sector
involvement as the solution, to seeing it as the problem.29
4.12    The Economic Rate of Return.  Some of the major changes which have taken
place in Bangladesh's agriculture since 1982/83 are summarized in Table B3. Over a
hundred percent increase in irrigated area, fertilizer and BADC seed use, and over a
fifty percent increase in rice production. Any number of hypotheses can be advanced
for the direction of causation amongst these changes. As explained earlier (para. 4.06)
27.  The SCA is currently quite run-down, with inadequate transport, much of its equipment in need of repair, and
staff rotated with the regular extension staff. Dutch Aid has agreed to provide support to the SCA, which should
result in a marked increase in professionalism and effectiveness. A necessary condition for which may be full
operational and financial independence.
28.  The inherent difficulty of operating a commercial enterprise under public sector procedures cannot be over-
stated. Is it realistic to ask BADC to "respond to the market" when any extra revenue goes directly back to
Treasury? And when BADC management does not have the right to hire and fire? Worse still, where there is no
protection against politicians who seek to have names added to the payroll whether or not there is work to be done.
The original project concept was "technocratic," it being assumed that sufficient technical assistance and training
could overcome the inherent difficulties of working in the public sector; that all that was needed was "better
management." We now recognize that the better the management, the more important it is to have the right price
signals and other incentives.
29.  In discussions with BADC, the IE observed that the Bank was only one of many donors who had provided
assistance to the seed sector in general, and BADC in particular. The response was, "Oh, no! It was the Bank
which got BADC into seed distribution, it provided the rock on which others built!" And it is true, that there are
still donors whose assistance presupposes that with enough technical assistance and enough training the inherent
structural difficulties of production and marketing within the public sector can be overcome. In addition to the
Bank's ongoing Agricultural Support Services Project (Credit 2233-BD), there are five other bilaterally supported
projects providing assistance to the seed industry; with a further seven projects proposed. Should the privatization
proposals being pushed by the donors be successful, there would be no need for the mass of Technical Assistance
currently proposed which results in some aid projects being defacto expert employment projects for the donors.



51
the IE believes that the major driving force was the removal of BADC's monopoly on
irrigation equipment and fertilizer supplies; increased private investment in lift
irrigation helped explain the increased use of certified seed.
4.13   The direct impact of BADC supplied certified seed was quite small; about three
percent of the area in rice, and 29 percent of the much smaller area planted to wheat
(para. 4.05). Accepting the SAR estimate of a 10 percent yield, confirmed by the field
survey reported in Box B2, increase due to the use of certified seed would yield
incremental annual production of about 66,660 tons of rice and 1,200 tons of wheat in
1993/94. Valued at 1985 world prices this direct product has a value of about $14.6
million per year. (Reference to Table IIB in the Statistical Annex, indicates that
depending on the year chosen this sum could be any where between $30.7 and $11.9).
This compares with total (undiscounted) project costs of $17.1 million.
4.14   Indirect impacts of certified seed include (a) the benefits from farmer saved
seed for several generations until yields regress to average levels, and (b) the increased
disease resistance, which implies an unknown (but nevertheless significant) reduction
in the probability of a rust or insect epidemic. Assuming these indirect benefits more
than cover the 45 percent of BADC seeds costs not recovered in seed sales, and
recurrent expenditures on seed breeding and certification, we only need to compare
project capital costs with direct benefits.
4.15   Only a 2.2 percent direct increase in yield due to sowing certified seed
produced from the project is needed to generate a 12 percent ERR over a 20 year life
for the project. Since it is highly probable that the yield increase was in excess of this
amount, we conclude that the re-estimated ERR confirms that the project was
satisfactory. An important factor leading to this result is that the initial seven years of
production of certified seed by the project took place before the drastic decline in
world grain prices which has characterized the latter part of the project.
4.16   In summary, the Cereal Seeds Project, provided the first direct donor assistance
to the seeds sector, a "rock" on which many other donors have subsequently built.
The public sector strategy employed was characteristic of Bank projects in the 70s and
was entirely appropriate in the strong support for BRRI. Even the seed-wing of
BADC played a constructive role in the initial popularization of HYVs. Fortunately,
the de jure monopsony position conferred on BADC was not reflected de facto, due to
the self-pollinating characteristics of rice and wheat, which allow farmer multiplication
of HYV seeds, and provides the potential for a total by-pass of the official system.30
30.  The most popular rice variety in Bangladesh, and the only variety significant enough for the Bangladesh
Statistical Service to classify individually, is "paijam." This is not a product of the formal research and HYV
distribution system, but was reportedly originally imported informally. BRRI researchers are concemed that it may
be vulnerable to disease, but this fear has not materialized over 20 years. BRRI now has a breeding program
designed to improve the yield of paijam, and add needed disease resistance.



52
Subsequently, the Bank reversed itself, putting increased emphasis on the constructive
role of the private sector, particularly in seed distribution. It, together with a number
of other donors, has prevailed upon Government to publish a Seeds Policy which
promises a level playing field for the private sector in production and distribution.3'
In the words of PCR project summaries the project impact would now have to be
described a satisfactory and sustainable. Its institution building impact was
substantial. Four challenges remain, before it can be judged that "all's well that ends
well."
4.17   Remaining Challenges. Through current importation practice is more liberal
than the policy (para. 4.7), the first and most important challenge, will be to get the
announced Seed Policy approved by Parliament and implemented in a timely and
constructive fashion. "Time is money" to the private sector, but "time is power" to the
public sector. Quarantine, varietal testing, varietal release, quality assurance all
provide needed protection to the seed user, and hence are logical responsibilities for
independent public agencies. However, if carried out in a dilatory or obstructive
manner, they can be used to deny farmers and private traders access to the best seed.
The most popular HYV used by farners has not had the benefit of these services.
Having agreed a policy, Government now needs to turn to implementation, such as
international agreements to accept the certification of other countries, set maximum
elapsed time for functions to be performed, properly staff and fund the responsible
agencies, and the like. In particular, the freedom of traders to import new varieties
which have been tested and released elsewhere is vital. It is this trade which provides
the litmus test that Bangladesh institutions are indeed adding value.
4.18   Likely the most important political challenge in the policy is the need to run
the seed-wing of BADC "on a commercial basis as far as possible" (Seeds Policy,
para. 11.2.1). Already considerable progress has been made in down-sizing the seed-
wing, but this is only one aspect of operating on a commercial basis. Much more
importantly will be to allow the management of the seed wing to appoint staff simply
on merit (i.e. without reference to seniority, second guessing by public service unions
or special pleading by politicians and other powerful figures), to chose which varieties
it will multiply, to set selling prices, to be able to retain all earnings, to be paid
(subsidized) for any mandated unprofitable activities, and to be able to replace worn-
out equipment. Much is made in the Seed Policy, and Bank advice to governments
generally, of the virtues of a level playing-field for the private sector. The IE is at
least equally concerned for a level-playing field for the public sector. If the Seed
Policy's directive to manage commercially within the public sector turns out to be an
31.  It is ironic that the long sought Seeds Policy does not jibe precisely with the views of some donors. They are
now faced with a written policy, which enshrines some element of important controls on varietal release of five key
crops. The Audit was not privy to the negotiations underlying the Seeds Policy, but it is clear that the Asian
Development Bank took a strong policy position, from which Bank conditionality retreated.



53
oxymoron, then a choice will have to be made between having the seed wing operate
commercially, or in the public sector.
4.19  If the seed wing were privatized and told to "maximize profits" it would likely
move out of seed multiplication. This then raises a question of subsidizing the
production of certified seed. Currently only about 55 percent of BADC's Seed Wing's
budget is recovered from seed sales. Even at this subsidized price BADC supplies
only about three percent of the rice seed, and about a third of the wheat seed. If
BADC raised its prices, demand would decline even further. With its present cost
structure and farmer demand for its seed, it is quite conceivable that there is no price
at which BADC could fully cover its costs. If BADC requires a subsidy, then this
should be paid per kilogram of certified seed sold (not produced) to all suppliers. If
the private sector is interested, and has a lower cost structure, it will gain market share
at the expense of BADC, until BADC's seed supply functions can be shut down. It is
a fundamental policy "error" to pay a subsidy to a monopoly, when a competitive
market structure could be encouraged.
4.20  A second challenge is to provide the public sector institutions with the right
incentive structure. This involves independence, a secure budget preferably related to
performance, and public recognition for services well performed. In particular, it is
desirable that the SCA charge for its services, and retain the revenues. Similarly, the
Research Stations should be given the revenue from breeder seed sales, rather than
have this money paid into the Treasury. Finally, it should be born in upon seed
breeders, that they serve the country as well by borrowing successful seeds from
research institutes abroad, as if all breeding were done domestically. They should
scour the world for good genotypes, at the same time that they attempt to produce
even better varieties domestically.
4.21  The third challenge is to get the level playing field promised by the Seed
Policy applied to all crops. In particular both Wheat and Potatoes could proviOe a
sufficient demand and profit margin to warrant significant investment by private
traders, and even private seed production. The level playing field does not demand
that BADC stop the production of certified seed for these crops, merely that any
subsidy be paid per kilogram of certified seed sold.
4.22  The fourth challenge, is to adapt the Seed Policy to benefit from applications of
genetic engineering. This involves issues of intellectual property right, not currently
addressed, and quite possibly willingness to purchase technology.

C. India
"Despite looking like a disappointment at project completion, it is safe
to say that few World Bank projects have had as much long term impact
as the Bank assisted National Seeds Projects." Consultant's comment.32
4.23   Conditionality for the National Seeds Projects (NSPs) required that private
sector seed companies not be discriminated against. However, no clear positive role
for the private sector was defined. Relative neglect of the private sector at the
National level and in most states continued until in the mid-1980s a delegation of
senior officials from the seed sector, led by the Prime Minister, visited Turkey and
saw at first hand the rapid and effective development of the seed industry which had
followed from positive encouragement of private sector participation. A new National
Seed Policy followed in 1988 which emphasized the role of the private sector and
promised government sanctions for private operations. As one private sector seedsman
said "since the national Seeds Policy was enacted, there has been a sea change; the
seed industry is working wonders; there is great cooperation between government and
the private sector." For the most part this cooperation reflects the natural split between
SPVs supported by the public sector and hybrids varieties produced by the private
sector.
4.24   The National Seed Company. Starting with the Tarai project33 and continuing
with the two projects being evaluated, the Bank's support of the seed industry can be
seen as catalytic in the emergence and acceptance of a strong private sector.34  The
Tarai project helped persuade the Government to take the seed industry seriously. The
NSPs greatly increased the depth of seed industry expertise in India, and introduced an
active competitive element, albeit predominantly within the public sector. With no
monopoly to break, the resulting SSCs were not as threatened by the entry of private
sector seed companies, as might have been the case had the Bank's projects focussed
on building up one single monolithic monopolistic National Seed Company. Tlec
industry structure supported by the projects had no one focus of political and
bureaucratic power which could be used to inhibit an expanded role for the private
sector seed companies (PSSCs). In addition the pre-existing seed law made
32.  A knowledgeable reviewer of the "glass is half-empty" philosophical persuasion, would rather emphasize the
missed opportunity. Ideally the industry would have used a market mechanism (say auction, or other competitively
determined prices) to distribute Breeding and Foundation seed from the Research Stations to seed companies
(public and private). In place of this, the project relied on a quasi-central planning operation where the NSC was
intended to play a key role in inter-state trade, and the provision of technical assistance to the SSCs. "NSC was
both advisor and competitor. It thought in terms of seed and market 'allocations', not of competition."
33. Activities non managed by an SSC "U.P. Seeds and Tarai Development Corporation Ltd."
34.  Para. 2.2 has already remarked that the projects missed the "first-best" design option of primary reliance on
the private sector. The design adopted was, however, in the IE's view a "good second-best." (see also para. 3.14).



55
certification optional, and thus prevented the use of seed certification as a barrier to
the private sector.
4.25   This said, and despite the intentions of the SAR (para. 2.16 above), the NSC
did not consolidate into a core national seed industry support institution but has
continued to play a major, if unprofitable, role in seed production and distribution.
This tendency was evident at project completion (see para. 3.1 l(ii) above), and has
only partially been reversed in recent years.
4.26 With hindsight, it was almost certainly a mistake to leave commercial and non-
commercial responsibilities within the one organization. Had seed policy, demand
forecasting, management of a reserve stock of seed, promotion of improved seed and
seed registration been hived of into, say a National Seed Secretariat, its costs could
have been kept under control, and would have been a logical expense for the national
government. Operation of facilities not yet transferred to SSCs and inter-state trade
could have been left with a NSC which would have down-sized by attrition as
facilities, and associated staff, were transferred to the SSCs. This separation would
have quickly revealed that central management of inter-state trade in a decentralized
system was an oxymoron, impossible to implement in a satisfactory manner.
4.27   The SAR provided for the disposition of processing plants and farms to the
SSCs. We can now see that more attention should have been given to the transfer of
staff, since able staff in danger of being made redundant or idle can powerfully
obstruct the transfer of facilities or find new work for themselves. In the event, NSC
continues to have a major staff of seed specialists, 33 processing plants, 10 regional
offices, 7,000 private sector seed retailers, and 10,000 farmers who serve as seed
dealers; and a total staff of 1,468. This despite having closed 18 processing plants, 34
area offices, 7 regional offices and 3 divisional offices and used early retirement to
reduce staff size by over 500. The most recent operating loss was Rs 37 million, or
about $1.2 million at the official exchange rate. This operating loss is in part the
result of a policy of under-pricing seed, so as to "keep prices low"; perhaps not a
sensible objective if other suppliers are expected to cover costs.
4.28 State and Private Seed Companies. The NSPs supported the establishment of
SSCs, and provided much of the needed initial hardware. However, relatively little
attention was paid to the managerial structure of the SSCs, implicit faith being placed
in the magic of the market-place and the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) to
straighten out any managerial problems which might surface.35 Despite some initial
problems, all SSCs have survived, some in better condition than others. The key task
of providing an assured supply of HYV of the basic self-pollinated crops has been
performed adequately, often involving inter-state trade from better organized SSCs to
35. The Third National Seeds Project (Credit 1952) involves a number of institution building and strengthening
components designed to assist the SSCs.



56
states encountering organizational difficulties. However, the SSCs have been supported
by subsidies in the 20 to 25 percent range.36
4.29    A  key issue is the role of the IAS in providing the Chief Executive Officer,
usually designated the Managing Director (MD), of the SSCs. On the positive side,
this gives the SSCs access to a pool of top flight and experienced managers;37 but at
the expense of relatively short tenure in the MD slot, and at the cost of foreshortening
the career path for professional seed technologists. As a general principle, it does not
seem to the IE that it can be in the best interests of the seed industry to have the MD
slot in SSCs used for the career development of IAS officers.38
4.30    For the time being there is little sign of "subsidy-fatigue" and little disposition
of the PSSCs to compete seriously for a major, but unsubsidized, share of the market
for SPVs. The Bank's Third National Seeds Project is designed to reduce the need for
subsidies by improved cost control and increased managerial discretion. It remains to
36. A comment from an SSC on a draft of this report, emphasizes that these "subsidies" are often for mandated
non-commercial activities. In particular: "It is out come of crude analysis of facts to state that the State Seeds
Corporations (SSCs) have been supported for its survival by subsidies in the 20 to 25 percent range. Rather
subsidies have been passed on to SSCs for doing mandate function of undertaking production and marketing of
seeds to support ambitious Agriculture Production Program where the SSCs fate gets tied up with success or failure
of Agriculture Production Plan, putting them into risks and constraints which cannot be fully recovered by the input
of subsidies."
"The consultant who has made a study of Indian conditions seems to have been carried away by
incomplete facts in as much as he has come out with the conclusion of lack of opportunity of the "level playing" for
PSSC's, ignoring the fact that most of the PSSCs in India are, in fact, willing to get subsidies, with a pre-condition,
that they are not subjected to the same constraint to which SSCs are subjected to, about dovetailing its activities
with National Agriculture Development Programmes. Hence his concept of "level playing" is only hypothetical."
A second SSC confirms that the subsidies are not to the SSC as such but are applicable to sale of seeds by
government agencies.
37.  In practice MD of an SSC is not a logical career step for high-flyers within the IAS. Since most members of
the IAS are high-flyers, it can prove difficult to staff the MD slots. A SSC has commented that this focus on the
MD position diverts attention from managerial problems: "Similarly apparently, there seems to be lack of proper
understanding of Management of SSCs which is visible from the statement in para. 4.29 of the report that in SSCs
only IAS Officers are posted as Managing Director shortening career path of profession Seed Technologist to serve
the purpose of career promotion of IAS. I think the visit of evaluation making team to Andhra Pradesh State Seeds
Development Corporation (APSSDC) Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh State Seeds and Farm Development Corporation
(MPSSFDC), Bhopal etc. should have given better understanding of facts to the team, if efforts were made to
analyze the facts critically, instead of finding easy solution to major management problems.
38. An SSC, commenting on the draft of this report, does not agree with comments on managerial structure. It reports
that it is being managed by highly qualified agricultural scientists and professional managers and that plant capacity
utilization is full and vertical and horizontal integration is adequate.

be seen how far it will prove possible to relax the normal checks and balances of
public sector regulations (paras 4.18).39
4.31   There are now over 500 private sector seed companies,40 24 of them with
links to multi-national seed companies, and many with their own hybrid development
programs. The largest seed company has a turn-over of over Rs 100 crores (about
US$3 million at official exchange rates), many others have turn-over close to US$1
million. This is a critical mass of comnmercial interest and expertise that is almost
certainly a new and permanent feature of the agricultural sector in India. The public
and private sectors both develop new varieties, but the systems used differ markedly.
We have already noted that the private sector has done little work on SPVs due to the
option farmers have to retain their own grain for seed, and thus avoid having to
purchase seed after the first release.41 However, as mentioned in footnote 2, a PSSC
is pioneering the production of hybrid cotton, marrying cheap Indian labor with high
technology genetics.
4.32   Economic Rate of Return. The PCR for the Indian seeds projects, estimates
that impacts (i.e. benefits) from the two projects were much delayed and only about
one-third and one-fifth of the SAR estimates for NSI and NS2 respectively. This is
guestimated to translate into ERRs which are likely to be less than the opportunity cost
of capital (PCR, para. 4.17).
4.33   Annex 7 of the PCR contains the Governments comments which strongly
challenge the Bank's assumptions. The reconciliation of Bank and Borrower figures in
PCR paras 4.3 and 4.6 can be described as opaque at best. However, one major
difference stands out. The Government believes that the NSC sales (about 76,000 tons
versus 136,000 tons produced by the SSCs)42 should be included as project benefits;
whilst these were excluded by the PCR. The IE agrees with the Government; the
"with project" situation included both SSC and NSC sales albeit that the NSC sales
were unplanned (and indeed NSC production was intended to decline as SSC
production increased).43 Inclusion of NSC sales, and recognition of the Seeds Policy
announced in 1988, would yield a recalculated ERR well above the PCRs estimate,
39. An SSC arguesthat governmentsubsidyisdesirableto achievethetechnically-optimal seedreplacementrate, 8-10
percent annually for cereals and 2.5 percent for pulses, which (presumably) would not be achieved by farmers without
subsidy.
40. Companies, not traders. These companies produce, process package and distribute seed.
41. An SSC points to additional reasons for private seed companies avoiding production of self-pollinated varieties,
including the need for extensive infrastructure and high investment relative to the comparatively small flexible margins.
42. U.P.Seeds and Tarai Development Corporation points out that it produces about two-thirds of that total.
43. Despite the systems approach used for project design, the SAR does not include specific projections as to the
intended rate of decline of NSC production.



58
and thus above the opportunity cost of capital. As described elsewhere there now
seems little doubt that the projects are sustainable, even though some of the SSCs
created by the project may cease to exist in their original form. In the words of
PCRs, they are also satisfactory, and with a substantial institution building impact.
4.34 Remaining Challenges. A key assumption of the seeds projects being evaluated
was that the SSCs, or more generally public sector seed companies, would be able to
break-even on the basis of selling predominantly SPVs. This assumption needs to be
re-examined carefully both by the Bank and Borrower (see also Box BI). Of the
public sector seed companies visited, only PSCo claimed to be breaking-even, and
even in this case the time series is too short to allow a confident judgement that the
need for subsidy will not eventually re-appear.
4.35   Even the IAS has been unable to operate the SSCs on a break-even basis."
This raises a question as to realism of the assumption that SSCs can operate
unsubsidized in the public sector. Two alternative strategies would appear relevant.
The first would be to greatly reduce the volume of certified seed sold, and raise its
price. This would leave a big gap between the price of certified seed and grain; which
in turn would provide an incentive for private companies, or farmers, to multiply the
seed for one or two generations before selling it to farrners for grain production.
Alternatively, if it is thought to be in the public interest to distribute present volumes
of certified seed at present prices, then a permanent subsidy needs to be considered;
and a question arises as to how this should be paid. Paying a subsidy to both private
and public companies per kilogram of seed sold would "level the playing field" and
quite possibly tempt more efficient private companies to provide seed for SPVs.45 46
4.36   NSC has made considerable progress in cutting costs and expanding output over
the last few years, with a further doubling of output planned, nevertheless the
questions about its future role, for which one scenario was sketched in the SAR, need
to be resolved. The national seed policy functions should surely be hived off, so that
their costs do not weigh down any remaining commercial interests of NSC; and so that
the possibility of conflict of interest in the provision of policy advice can be
eliminated. A question would still remain as to whether the production and marketing
of at least some types of seed should be subsidized. If so, the efficiency arguments in
44. An SSC has commented that this is too general a comment: "To be specific Maharashtra State Seeds
Corporation Ltd. (MSSCL), Akola's working is a proof that PSCs can survive, even if subsidies were withdrawn."
45.  Note that there is no need to take a decision to 'play God" and privatize or close public sector companies.
Competition and expansion of the private sector will determine an appropriate size for public sector companies, if
the differential subsidy is withdrawn.
46. An SSC indicates its preference for the second option. Indian farmers, it argues, do not have the economic status
to afford the higher, unsubsidized seed prices. If the private sector is to share in subsidies, they should share in the
responsibilities for producing the seeds as per government directives, including SPVs.



59
favor of paying the subsidy per kilogram of qualifying seed sold, no matter by whom,
need to be given proper consideration. If NSC is able to survive once relieved of
policy related overheads, but with any subsidy paid in proportion to seed sold no
matter who the supplier then consideration could be given to its privatization, since
there is no evident need for a federal seed production company in he public sector.
D. Pakistan
"The Bank pulled the plug on this project in 1983 because it seemed to
have nothing but problems; ten years later, I think it would have to be
counted as a success." Comment by a Project Officer.
4.37 The summary (paragraph 3.15 above) of the PAR and PCR, amply supports the
first half of the above statement. After a two and a half year extension, virtually no
improved seed had been sold in Sindh; and in Punjab two of the three major seed
processing plants were having to be rebuilt because as originally constructed, under
Bank financed consultants and contractors, they were structurally unsound. Today
there are four solid artifacts of the project. An active and routine wheat and cotton
breeding program, a rigorous seed registration and certification program, a major
certified wheat and cotton seed marketing organization, and an extensive cadre of well
trained seed industry professionals. Moreover, the Bank's initial sponsorship of
monopoly parastatals to produce and market certified seed has not prevented the entry
of several multi-national seed companies and the emergence of some modest private
sector national companies.
4.38 Impact on Breeder Seed Production. Plant breeding in Pakistan is dominated
by the public sector, but it is a competitive public sector, with varieties being
developed in the Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Agricultural Universities, and
the National Agricultural Research Centre; and in principle new varieties could be
imported directly by the private sector if they so wished. The results of these wheat
and cotton breeding efforts are entered into standardized annual National Uniform
Yield Trials (NUYT),47 for which the results are published. These results are
discussed at an annual meeting of the interested plant breeders and other seed industry
stake-holders; and recommendations made as to which varieties should be put forward
for registration." Varieties are tested informally in a wide range of sites before
being entered in the NUYT, and at the Punjab Seed Corporation (PSCo) farm at
Kahnewal. Two years of NUYT results are needed before application can be made for
47.  The breadth of the wheat breeding program can be appreciated by the fact that in 1994 eight institutions
contributed a total of 36 varieties. One institution (AARI-Faisalbad) contributed 15 varieties. Only one variety was
contributed by the National Agricultural Research Centre, at Islamabad.
48.  If not accepted for national registration, but there is consensus amongst the plant breeders for a province, then
the variety can be forwarded for registration for sale within the province, but not nationally.

registration. About twelve wheats are tested in each of three classes (normal irrigated,
early irrigated and rainfed) each year, and similarly for other crops. About forty
wheat varieties have been registered and released. In contrast to Bangladesh where the
project fostered a single centre of excellence, BRRI, in Pakistan a seed breeding
system has emerged which allows "a thousand flowers to bloom."

4.39   Yields of the major grains are given in Table P1. Whilst rice has faced the
same problem of stagnant yields, faced by India and Bangladesh, considerable progress
has been made in wheat yields. This is not to decry the rice breeding program since
over time established HYV's become susceptible to attack as viruses, rusts, nematodes
and insects adapt. A substantial breeding program is thus needed, even to maintain
yield levels. For wheat the NUYT results for individual sites show test varieties
yielding 0 to 50 percent above the Local Check Variety appropriate to the site. Over
all sites the best (single) demonstrated wheat variety in 1992-93 yielded seven percent
more than the local check variety.50 After a serious set-back in the last two seasons
due to viral infections, cotton varieties, together with the appropriate husbandry
practices are achieving significant increases in yields and quality.
4.40   The PSCo fulfills several vital roles in helping identify and propagate
promising varieties. In the first instance it provides land, labor and cash expenses for
trials conducted for, and under the direction, of researchers. Secondly, it conducts a
standardized trial at its Khanewal seed farm for all varieties currently approved for
sale, and varieties in the approval and registration process. Data from these trials is
available back to 1976, at four planting dates each year. This provides a valuable
"level-playing field" for breeders to compare promising strains, and puts them in
perspective with respect to existing popular varieties and fading greats. Thirdly, at the
49.  At the PSC's farm at Khanewal seed cotton yield has been increased from 1.44 tons/hectare before the
project, to 3.63 in 1987; national yield was estimated at 1.21 tons hectare. (PAR page 12).
50.  This is a comparison of one variety, WS-10 over all sites in Pakistan when compared to the variety thought
to be most suitable to the site; a very tough comparison. The average gain for the best variety tested at each site
against that sites test variety would be nearer to 25 percent.



61
same time that the breeder starts the formal process of seed approval by submission of
samples to the NUYTs, the PSCo starts a parallel process of bulking-up, under the
supervision of the breeder and Federal Seed Certification Department (FSCD). This
means that when a small volume of pre-basic seed emerges from the
approval/registration process, a larger volume is on hand to allow the imrnediate
generation of a significant volume of breeder seed.51 Seed Registration is the
responsibility of the National Seed Registration Department (NSRD) a small sister
department to FSCD. The remarks on FSCD can be taken to apply equally to NSRD.
The overall seed registration and certification process appears to work well, and add
value.
4.41   There are official and unofficial channels for the release of new varieties, and
distribution of registered varieties. There have been unofficial releases of pre-basic
seed by breeders to the private sector; just how or whether this is certified by FSCD,
remains obscure at the present time.
4.42   The official route, at least in the Punjab, is for PSCo to produce Basic seed
from its stock of Pre-Basic seed. This Basic seed is certified by the FSCD, and may
be used by PSCo to produce Certified seed,52 or for sale to growers or the private
sector. When Basic or Pre-Basic seed is sold to PSCo's contract growers, it comes
with a very complete package of agronomic and managerial advice. This is a most
impressive service, and involves PSCo advisory staff visiting growers' fields at least
once a fortnight, and often more frequently. They advise on all aspects of production,
particularly on the discretionary spraying program needed for disease and pest control.
This free farm advisory service serves three vital functions. It promotes confidence by
the grower in PSCo, thus minimizing the possibility that contract growers will defect
under the blandishments of the private sector companies. It maximizes seed yield for
PSCo and the resulting good crop provides a visual advertisement to neighboring
farmers for the variety of PSCo seed, and it also hones the PSCo agronomy team's
knowledge of the variety specific husbandry requirements. This is a first class quality
program. Seed sales to non-contract growers, are made without the accompanying
agronomic managerial package.
4.43   The disposition of Basic seed, from which Certified seed is produced, is the
major bone of contention between the private seed companies and PSCo. Private
companies believe that they should be given a "fair" share of the Basic seed produced
by PSCo. As described to the IE, PSCo management is willing in principle to provide
51.  This accords with a recommendation in Heiser (1990), page 86.
52.  The double use of "certified" here should not confuse the reader. The FSCD, when convinced of the
parentage, germination, purity, etc, of a seed sample will issue a certificate that this seed is of the Breeder or
Certified generation. In the former case it certifies that it is Breeder seed, in that latter case it certifies that it is
Certified seed. There is probably no ambiguity in Urdu, though in English if has all the makings of an Abbott and
Costello routine.



62
Basic seed to the private sector, provided that it is ordered prior to planting, and with
a ten percent deposit as earnest money. Some tension will always remain in the
provision of Basic seed for attractive new varieties, since PSCo itself, despite the
efforts of the Nuclear Seed Cell at Khanewal (see para. 4.48), would often like to have
more of this seed than it has been able to produce.53
4.44 Impact on Production and Marketing. Though the public sector dominates the
production of certified wheat and rice seed, the public sector bias of the following
comments should not be taken to detract from the existence of a lively private seed
sector for cotton and hybrid crops such as maize and sunflower; with some initial
interest in potatoes and an unexploited market for vegetable seeds. Far from
crowding-out the private sector, the PSCs have provided most of the entrepreneurial
talent needed to found local seed companies, either from former employees or contract
growers. The PSCo has evolved to operate very much like a large farmer controlled
cooperative in the United States, such as Land-O-Lakes/Felco, or Southern States
Cooperative (Box P2).
4.45   PSCo is the only large scale producer of Certified Seed of wheat and rice. The
Sindh Seed Corporation (SSCo) reports production of between 2,400 and 3,600 tons of
Certified wheat seed per year; reported production of Basic, Nucleus and Approved
seed can best be described as erratic (Annex B). The multi-national companies have
sold small quantities of seed produced for them by contract growers. In the case of
imported seed the companies rely on their own good name to persuade farmers to pay
a premium for their attractively packaged products.
53. Ahmed (1994) page 348, also notes that sometimes PSCo is unable to meet its own requirements for basic
seed.



63
Box P2. Re-inventing the Public Sector.
The PSCo has enjoyed a period of stable management for the last five years.
Four steps have transformed the PSCo from a chronic loss making situation into a
modestly profitable public corporation. The first step was a frank recognition that the
farmers were right when they felt that PSCo seed was little better than the best of their
own retained seed. Initially only 50 percent of seed submitted to FSCD by PSCo could
be certified. Much tighter attention to all aspect of quality control has raised this to over
95 percent. Not only has this given farmers better seed, it has almost halved the cost per
kilogram of seed produced. At the same time stock control has been tightened up, thus
reducing unaccounted for losses, again contributing to profitability. With better quality
seed, the PSCo has in the last two years moved into an aggressive demonstration
program where it provides farmers with free seed for an acre of crop, provided that they
will follow recommended husbandry procedures, and have a notice describing husbandry
and cost structure. About a thousand of these plots are now distributed widely in the
Punjab. Based on the increased acceptance of its seeds, the PSCo is projecting over a 20
percent growth in seed sales, based in part on a lottery of prizes for seed purchasers (see
however para 4.44 and Table P2). The fourth step has been to distribute some of the
new found profits to employees as bonuses, thus giving them tangible proof that their
efforts have resulted in a profitable enterprise.
The atmosphere at PSCo is strongly reminiscent of big, farner-owned
cooperatives in the United States such as Land-O-Lakes/Felco or Southern States
Cooperative. These are large and efficient organizations (Land-O-Lakes is a Fortune 100
company), which are not profit maximizing, since their objective is to (a) break-even,
and (b) maximize the benefit to their farmer members. Profits are earned, but with the
objective of ploughing them back into the business to provide even better service to
farmers. Otherwise prices are held down to farmers, common property activities' are
undertaken, and employee morale is high on the basis of doing more for farmers than
simple profit driven companies.
A recent focus group study carried out by OED in connection with an impact
evaluation of irrigation projects in Pakistan confirned the difference in performance of
the PSCo and SSCo (see Box P4). It found that of those focus groups that had changed
(increased) their seed as in Punjab 83 percent had increased the use of certified seed; in
Sindh 72% had increased the use of non-certified seed.
a. I.e. activities where the benefit to farmers in general, exceeds the benefit which can be captured by PSCo
itself; such as the supply of SPVs.

4.46 With 2.5 million hectares under rice in Punjab and Sindh, about 25,000 tons of
seed will have been used, of which only 2,170 tons came from the formal sector, (of
which 1,923 tons came from the public sector). This is a replacement rate of 8.7
percent. Table P2 suggests that the distribution of seed in Punjab was demand



65
constrained.54 In 1991 and 1992 in the Sindh, it appears that rice sales were supply
constrained. However only in 1990/91 does there appear to have been a significant
shortfall. Since the price of seed is only about 25 percent above the price for grain
consumption; and since seed is less than one percent of the cost of production, it is
evident that the key requirement is to shift farmer's demand for certified seed. The
basic problem in the case of grain is to improve the farmer's image of certified seed.
This may not be easy, since the IE was not able to locate a data series which could be
used as the basis for such an image enhancement campaign.
4.47   The absolute dominance of the public sector (87 percent) and PSCo in
particular (78 percent) in wheat seed supply is illustrated in Table P3. However, the
modest (13 percent) penetration of this market by the private sector serves to illustrate
that they have not been "locked out" (See Box P3). The higher seed volumes sold,
translate also into a higher replacement rate for seed. With just over 8 million
hectares under wheat, about 0.725 million tons of seed will have been used. Total
sales of 56,045 tons, represents a replacement rate of 7.7 percent. The Seed Project
had a target replacement rate for wheat of 20 percent over 75 percent of the sown
area; actual performance is 51.3 percent of this target55 (see, however, para. 4.48).
For the time being, the SSCs created by the project play a vital and significant role in
feeding certified seed into the infornal seed re-supply system. The efficiency with
which the PSCo carries out this function has been transformed in the last five years
(See Box P2).
4.48   Cotton presents quite a different picture, with the market shared about equally
between the Private Cotton Ginners Associations (PCGAs), other private sector
companies and the public sector. As Table P3 shows the private sector has made
significant and broad fronted entry into the supply of cotton seed. As a by-product of
this active competition, the replacement rate for cotton is about 40 percent.
4.49   Impact on Farmers. The most significant implication of Table P3, is that there
is a flourishing-informal trade in farmer retained seed. Approximately 92 percent of
rice and wheat seed56 and about 60 percent of cotton seed, represents use of own
seed, farmer to farmer transactions, or purchase of farmer retained seed from a
network of small traders, of whom there are 4,000 in the Punjab alone.
4.50   The project has not had, nor was it intended to have, an impact on this
informal trade; except as the intake of Certified seed influenced the quality of farmer
54.  Wheat sales in 1993/94 were depressed due to low rainfall, resulting in almost no sales in rainfed areas.
55.  Note however, that SAR projected wheat seed volume was 60,700 tons, so actual sales are at 92 percent of
the SAR projection. The difference is the very significant expansion of wheat area which has taken place since
project inception.
56.  Slightly higher estimates based on a farm survey in the early 80's are given Heisey (1990), page 54.

retained seed in subsequent generations. This impact cannot be measured by the crude
statistic of "replacement-rate," since it is the disposition of the early generations from
Certified seed which influences its impact. Thus with a eight percent replacement rate
for rice, if no seed were traded between farmers, the average farmer would be using
seed six generations away from Certified. However, the small sample of purchasers of
PSCo Certified seed interviewed by the IE sold on average three times as much seed
to their neighbors from their first harvest, as they bought from PSC. In this case, if
eight percent of seed used is PSCo Certified seed, 32 percent of seed is at most one
generation away from Certified; and all farmers have ready access to seed at most two
generations from Certified. These farmer sales seem to take place without any
premium being charged for the better quality seed. It is not clear why the SAR set a
higher volume target for Certified seed sales. What seems to happen is that farmers
use the best seed they have seen growing in farmers' fields. If, as with the original
introduction of HYVs, the yield difference is spectacular and evident, then the informal
market serves to provide almost universal adoption within a few generations; if the
difference is marginal or negative, then it may be very many generations before a
switch is made. Note that this risk-averse behavior means that most farmers faced
with even a strikingly increased yield in demonstration plots would rather have his
neighbor use the seed this year; and buy it from him next year, when he had observed
the higher harvest in his neighbor'sfield.57
4.51   The Economic Rate of Return. The SAR (Annex 14) provided a very detailed
set of projections to underpin an estimated ERR of 80 percent, based in part on an
international price for rice of $300 per ton (1975 dollars, $455 in 1985 dollars) versus
a realized price in recent years of about $200 (in 1985 dollars). Though the initial
benefits were realized at close to the SAR projected prices, additional grain production
in the later years has been half as valuable as projected. The PCR (para. 5.06)
provides a very sketchy description of revised estimates, mainly a five-year lag in
benefits and revised price expectations, to underpin an ERR of 30 percent. Prices have
not deteriorated since the PCR, and performance has been better than expected, which
suggests that the ERR estimate should be higher for the IE than the PCR.
4.52 As shown in Table P1, yields have improved markedly since 1972, and for
wheat have continued to improve from 1982 to 1992. In the Sindh, cotton yield has
increased roughly ten percent from 1972-77 to 1990-91. Total project cost was $56.5
million (PCR, Annex 1). PSCo is currently operating on a break-even basis, so that its
recurrent costs are being met by seed sales. The SSCs provided about 49,000 tons of
certified wheat seed, 1,900 tons of certified paddy seed and 11,000 tons of certified
cotton seed in 1993-94. Using the same conversion figures as for Bangladesh for
grains and the SAR conversion for cotton, tH.s translates into 426,000 hectares of
wheat, 82,500 hectares of rice and 101,000 hectares of cotton. Using average yields
57. See also, Venkatesan (1994), footnote 26.



67
from Table P1 1992 prices (in 1985 constant dollars) gives a value at international
prices of this output as $102 million. Assuming that ten percent of this value is due to
the use of Certified seed, we get an annual benefit of $10.2 million, from the direct
effects of using Certified seed in one year. (This leaves indirect effects to pay for the
subsidized costs of the SSCo, research and certification expenditures, etc).
4.53   The disbursement profile for this project was not included in the PPAR, and is
not available from the Bank's electronic data base.58 We know that the project was
closed in June 1983 with $4.4 million of the credit undisbursed. As against this, two
of the four seed processing plants built by the project had to be rebuilt at the
Borrower's expense, and should thus be added to the budgeted project cost. Buildings
and storage were budgeted at $3.22 million in 1975 dollars. Allowing half this for the
rebuilding adds $1.61 million, with additional equipment which had to be replaced, it
seems likely that the Government will have had to spend at least $4.4 million more
(i.e. equivalent to the canceled amount of the credit) to complete the project.
Spreading the SAR projected expenditures over four additional years, gives a project
capital cost profile as shown in Table P4.
4.54 Table P5 shows project seed sales in 1985/86 and 1993/94. The PPAR used
1979 as the first year for project seed sales (PPAR, para. 20), allowing for a build up
to 45,000 tons of wheat, 2,000 tons of paddy and 20,000 tons of cotton seed in 1985,
with level sales from then on requires 1.5 percent increase in yield from certified seed
sales in their first year to give a 12 percent ERR.

4.55   Rough though this calculation is, it is sufficient to demonstrate convincingly to
the IE that the ERR for this project exceeded 12 percent by a wide margin. Excluded
from this calculation are the benefits from the other crops, and the benefits from
farmer saved seed descended from certified seed; as against this recurrent cost of
running the project have also been excluded, and the international prices have not been
corrected to domestic parity. However, it is clear that excluded benefits would greatly
exceed excluded costs, and hence only reinforce the conclusion that the ERR exceeded
12 percent.
4.56 Summarizing the above observed impacts, we can say that the project (a) has
produced a cadre of well trained and dedicated seed breeding professionals, (b) there is
an active and well organized breeding research program which is defending past gains
and indicating potential for modest yield increases, (c) the SSCs, particularly PSCo,
are currently crucial for the introduction of new germ plasm into the highly flexible
informal farmer-to-farmer market, where observed yields in farmers fields dictate the
rate of adoption, (d) the project's public sector bias has not prevented the emergence
of private sector suppliers of hybrid, and of wheat and cotton seed. In the words of
PCR project summaries the project impact would now have to be described as
satisfactory and sustainable. Its institution building impact was substantial. This said,
problems remain.
4.57 Remaining Challenges.59 In the view of this evaluation, the key challenge
facing the seed industry in Pakistan is that the yield gains being demonstrated by seed
breeders in the NUYT, are not affecting farmer demand for seed. This has two
adverse impacts. On the one hand it limits the genetic potential of the seed used by
farmers and, perhaps more importantly, it leads to increased disease risk since distinct
genotypes are not being used in their appropriate ecological niches.' A second
59.  The rather didactic tone of this section does not represent a delusion that a very brief visit by an OED general
purpose evaluator can yield truths not evident to full-time specialized operational staff (and even more evident to
the public and private sector managers who have built the industry); rather it is used as a device to highlight issues
and focus debate within the Bank. In this same spirit of focussing debate, it might be remarked that in the
evaluator's view, the sole policy prescription for the seed sector contained in the green cover "A Strategy for
Sustainable Agricultural Growth," to privatize the SSCs, is orthogonal to the problem at hand and probably counter
productive, unless implemented as a farmer owned cooperative of possibly as (a series of) joint ventures.
60.  An abstruse point perhaps; but the more genotypes in use, the less the damage if the disease resistance of one
of them breaks down; and the larger the area planted to a variety, the greater the probability of a break-down.



69
challenge is that, as discussed in Box P3, agreed rules do not yet exist for giving the
public and private sector seed companies equitable access to improved varieties
developed by the research system. A third challenge is that both the research system
and FSCD have little, if any, spare capacity. This applies to manpower and especially
recurrent resources and capital equipment vehicles, computers, faxes, laboratory
equipment, etc).6" A fourth challenge is that Pakistan's stock of highly trained seed
specialists is not being maintained. There is not the needed continual flow of young
Ph.D's into the system.62 There is no reason to expect the provision of a level
playing field to the private sector to help with the latter three problems.
4.58    Once farmer demand is recognized as the key constraint, the remedies become
self-evident. Firstly, it is absolutely essential to know that the cultivar can be
translated into more money in the farmer's pocket. The cost of fertilizer and other
inputs thus has to be taken into account, as does the farming system as a whole in the
event that days to maturity differ. This is why the PSCo's involvement with research
and its Farm Advisory Service are so vital. Once confident of higher income, it
remains to demonstrate this to farmers. One possibility would be to introduce a
NUFT (National Uniform Farm Trials) to compliment the NUYT. This would only
test released varieties; new varieties, and those established varieties with more than say
ten percent of the area locally. For the major varieties, or varieties of special interest,
certified seed purchased locally from different companies should also be compared. In
every case, the dominant local farmer varieties should be included in the trial. The
results should record not only yield, but days to maturity, lint characteristics in the
61.  It may not be possible for Pakistan to pay its professionals what they are worth; but at least they should be
given the equipment to allow them to be productive. See also "Pakistan: A Strategy for Sustainable Agricultural
Growth," Green Cover, June 24, 1994, para 5.08. The FSCD is still highly dependent on equipment bought under
the project, thus 15 to 20 years old. In every case newer models are available, and in many cases spares are simply
not available. The FSCD's vital role is thus vulnerable to the eventual demise of this project funded equipment. It
is inspiring to see an office handling 5,000 samples per year, with the entire data-base maintained by hand; but it is
no way to build morale amongst professionals. Not to belabor a point, but in 1978 the project provided for 20
vehicles, FSCD is now operating with only 16 but with a much larger work load (the private sector needs their
services for traditional crops, and forages, oil seeds, hybrids and pulses have been added without significant
additional resources being made available for seed certification and registration). Seed certification without field
inspection is an oxymoron. Similarly, Certified seed is being distributed by PSCo without the official FSCD
identifying tags, because FSCD does not have the budget to print enough. The full cost of certification is being
met, yet the evidence of this for an illiterate farmer is missing. "A ship is being lost for a ha'pennorth of tar."
(See also Ahmad (1994) pages 344 and 349).
62.  It is sometimes mistakenly believed that technical assistance provided in sufficient volume can substitute for
indigenous Ph.D's. This is not so, on at least four grounds. The technical assistance person, even if she (or he as
the case may be) gets to understand the problem, does not have to live with the solution she recommends. She is
not around to help, when the result differs from what was expected. Secondly, there is no way an expatriate can
absorb the mores of the society in which she is working. This should affect not only the solution proposed, but the
way in which it is proposed. Thirdly, an expatriate cannot have the old-girl net-work that comes with having been
to the same agricultural college, or served in the same department; or married her brother. Fourthly, the indigenous
Ph.D. is a walking and permanent political lobby for the properfunding of research and adoption of sensible
policies.

case of cotton, costs and hence return per hectare and per hour. Another possibility
would be simply publish the same information for the ongoing PSCo sponsored farmer
demonstrations, preferably compared to results for other variety(ies) grown by the
farmer. The IE is very impressed with the value of this husbandry and farm
management information, as well as variety identification being displayed on a metal
notice board in the demonstration area. (Metal so as not to contribute to local
firewood supply). To accelerate the farmer testing of new varieties, a fraction of the
seed being multiplied by the Foundation Seed Cell could be made available for key
farmer trials in parallel with the production of basic seed. Farmers would thus know
what they were buying when the first release of certified seed appeared on the market.
The correct balance between stimulating supply and demand (by allocating seed to
multiplication or demonstration) is a difficult judgement to be made in each case.
4.59 In principle the proposed NUFT could be run by the plant breeders or
extension. In the evaluations's view, consideration should be given to using the
FSCD, since it has a network of offices, and a reputation for objective testing.
Appropriate additional staff and budget would of course be needed.
4.60 The above is going to cost money, not least the NUFT, putting the FSCD and
NSRD on a self-financing basis and provision of adequate recurrent resources for seed
industry technologists and scientists. This raises the possibility that PSCs are selling
their seed too cheaply.63

71
Box P3: When is a Playing-Field Level?
The Bank's recent "Strategy for Sustainable Agricultural Growth" calls for the provision of a level-
playing field for the private sector seed companies (World Bank (1994), para 5.08). This is not a policy
prescription, rather it is an analogy and a cliche at that.
There is no difficulty in getfing public and private seed company managers to endorse the Bank's
prescription, indeed it would not be exaggerating to describe it as "passed with acclaim"; since it turns out that both
public and private companies feel that the current arrangements asked their team to "play up hill"! One looks in
vain to the Bank's strategy for guidance on the operational implementation of the analogy.
The primary plea from the private sector was to be given "fair" access to Basic seed, in order that they
could bulk it up with their contract growers into Certified seed. Knowing all about tar-baby, the IE will make no
effort to judge whether the private sector currendy has "fair" access. The demand for fair access to Basic seed,
implies agreement that there should continue to be a public sector monopoly on its production. There seems also
to be agreement by all parties that notification of seed requirements should be made prior to planting the crop, that
an earnest of ten percent should be paid, and that this should be a firm contracL
Even with this element of agreement, and a commitment from PSCo management to attempt to
accommodate the requests of the private sector, continued tension is to be expected. This is because the demand
for new introductions is likely to be high (with associated opportunities to sell the fust one or two generations of
Certified seed at much higher prices than established varieties), whilst the supply of Breeder seed, at least in the
first season is likely to be limited. Raising the price of this scarce seed in the initial one or two years of variety
release, and p50 facto the Certified seed produced from it, would help some. It appeared that provided good-will
can be maintained, the prospect for iterating towards an acceptable set of rules for distribution of Basic seed were
good. Another possibility would be to auction Basic seed, with some portion of profits retained in the Research
System.
Understandably, the private sector was concerned about the assets acquired by the public corporations at
concessional prices (many of them under the project). On this the IE retreats to the principle that a sunk cost is no
cost, and as a corollary a sunk subsidy is not subsidy. Cheap processing facilities available to the public sector
may affect the private sector's decision whether to compete, but no purpose would be served by providing the
private sector with equally cheap facilities. There seems to be some popular misunderstanding of the conditions
attached to the PSCo's farmn at Khanewal. This land, free" to PSCo, came complete with tenants and entrenched
tenant right, which raise production costs above what could be negotiated in the absence of these rights. PSCo's
competitive position would be improved if it could acquire (or substitute) land on which it did not have it to act as
a benevolent patemalistic employer. Access to more tenant-free govemment land would create PSCs to increase
the production of Basic Seed for sale to the private sector.
A current subsidy, on the other hand, is a real cost to the economy. Should this become necessary then
a "level playing-field" would seem to imply that it should be paid on a per kg basis to all suppliers.'
Since access to Basic seed is currently seen by the private sector as the key to a level playing-field, it
would seem reasonable to charge the FSCD to monitor production and distribution.b
a. Contrary to many economists the Evaluaton does not reject seed distribution subsidies out of hand. Especially
for SPVs; exactly the same arguments used to justify public support of agricultural research and seed breeding,
spill over into getting the results of this research into the hands of farmers, just as they spill over into the provision
of extension. Srivastava (1993, page 12) also notes the possible need for persistent subsidy, in some cases.
b. A further analogy, the FSCD should be "referee" on the level playing-field.



72
4.61   Finally, it is incumbent on the evaluation to relate these findings to the Bank's
current policy recommendations for the seed industry. These can be summarized as:
"5.08 There is no need for government presence in the marketing of
improved certified seed. Government seed corporations should be run
along strictly commercial lines and be privatized as soon as possible.
Private-sector seed companies should be provided with a level playing
field. 64
4.62   If the PSCs can be privatized and an equal or better service provided, then one
can only say "Amen" to the above recommendation. In the case of the SSCo, it is not
difficult to imagine an equal or better service being provided (Box P4). However, in
the case of PSCo, as Table P3 shows, a significant service to wheat producers is being
provided. It is not clear that even with a level playing field, there would be an
incentive for the private sector to sell this much seed at PSCo prices. Furthermore, the
argument which supports public sector agricultural research in general and seed
breeding in particular, equally makes a case for subsidizing, if necessary, some flow of
improved germ plasm into the pool of seed being traded informally amongst farmers.
Currently PSCo is providing a very valuable service to farmers without recurrent
subsidy. It is not clear to the IE what deficiencies the proposed privatization is
designed to remedy.65
4.63   This suggests that, like porcupines making love, privatization of the PSCs (at
least of PSCo) should be approached very carefully. What has happened in the case of
cotton can only be applauded. Expansion of sales by the PSGAs and private sector
have eroded the PSCs market share to the point that a decision to withdraw from the
supply of Certified cotton seed would not be enormously disruptive in the market.66
This has not happened for wheat; and PSCo has not had a public subsidy for the last
two years, and it has had profits which it has returned to its employees as bonuses. Its
recurrent costs have never been a major drain on the Treasury.
4.64   To level the playing field, Government could undertake to pay any needed
subsidy to the PSCs on a per ton basis; and to make this available also to the private
sector. If the PSCs become an unacceptable drain on the Treasury, or there is
sufficient dissatisfaction with the level of service, then consideration could be given to
formation of a farmer owned cooperative or joint ventures based on individual
processing plants and a complement of seed multiplication farms; where the joint
64. World Bank (1994).
65. Para 4.51 has already noted that private sector access to breeder seed remains a bone of contention, but it
appears that progress is being made towards resolution.
66. However, PSCo's role in sponsoring research and the production of Basic seed would remain vital.



73
venture would commit itself to specified levels of service. This would allow the
Government to write down its investments (without writing them to zero) without
totally disrupting the availability of seed.



74
Box P4. The Sindh Seed Corporation
Box P3 summarizes some of the key changes made by PSCo over the last five years. Sindh Seed
Corporation (SSCo) still has many of these changes to make. If it can make them, then in five years SSCo
could represent another clearly successful Bank investment.
A key difference between the two corporations is that while the PSCo has had stable
management for the last five years, the SSCo has had roughly one manager per year since its
inception, with two changes during the last year.  Judging by experience, a more stable
management team may require a clearer separation from the Public Sector.'
Fundamental problems for the SSCo are a lack of working capital for needed repairs and
replacements and supplies of second generation Certified Seed bought from contract growers,
(about four tons returned per ton of Certified seed supplied). The highest total intake of wheat
seed has been 6,721 tons in 1992/93, versus a processing capacity of 9,600 tons. Several factors
underlie this low purchase level including (a) high (up to 50 percent) rejection of crops grown from
SSCo supplied first generation Certified seed, (b) the relatively modest price premium (ten percent
above the floor price) offered to contract growers for second generation Certified Seed, which can
result in the market price for grain exceeding the SSCo price, and (c) lack of a revolving fund to
finance seed purchases.
As the supply constraint is overcome, additional processing capacity will be needed. A
number of projects to add capacity have been prepared, and funding is being actively sought. The
technical deficiencies in cotton ginning and seed cleaning equipment supplied under the original
project, will have finally been fully corrected by next season.
As these constraints are relaxed, SSCo will need to follow PSCo in (a) improving the
purity of farmers crops so that rejection drops to the five percent level achieved by PSCo, (b)
pending release of a popular cotton variety for the Sindh, consideration should be given to testing
established and new varieties from other regions, in order to be able to supply good quality seed of
a varieties in demand by farners, processors and ginners (SSCo's current practice of importing
seed from the Punjab is a sensible initial response to this problem) (c) to add a Nucleus Seed Cell
to multiply-up the seed of promising varieties in the process of registration and approval, so that
they can be released quickly and in significant volumes, and (d) a pricing structure needs to be
adopted which will reduce the transport costs to SSCo of buying from remote growers. This latter
may also require organizational change, since the political demand for pan-territorial pricing is
likely to be overwhelming whilst SSCo remains in the public sector.
SSCo expects to make a crucial break-through this year, 1994/5, by achieving break-
even operation for the first time. The groundwork is also being laid for the creation of a Nucleus
Seed Cell.
If the needed independence from public sector regulations cannot be obtained while
SSCo is publicly owned, consideration could, perhaps, be given to the formation of a Joint Venture
with an established seed company. This would allow an injection of working capital and lead to
continuity of management, whilst ensuring that improved seed was made available for the SPVs
which are the backbone of Sindh agriculture. Straight privatization could lead the new enterprise
to simply withdraw from the provision of seed for SPVs, thus increasing the firms income, but
leaving Sindh farmers without a reliable source of pure seed for their major crops.
a. It has been argued for continued public service control that it is ability, not stability, that is important.
Without knocking the importance of ability, the IE believes that SSCo needs the sort of combination of ability
and stability that PSCo has experienced recently.

5. Conclusions and Future Impact
A. Institutional Evolution.
5.1   Seven years after their PCRs, it is evident that the seeds projects in India and
Pakistan used a sophisticated strategy of "creative institutional obsolescence." No less
sophisticated for being in large measure unconscious. By promoting state or provincial
parastatal seed companies at the expense of a monopolistic national parastatal seed
company, the projects mobilized an effective constituency within the public sector in
support of decentralization. Not only did this undermine the political and bureaucratic
power of the national company, but the decentralized seed companies were less
inclined, or less able, to resist the entry of private sector companies. Just as the
national seed companies were asked to give way to state companies, so the state
companies will be increasingly asked to compete on a level playing field with the
private sector, or to give way entirely to the new competition. That decentralized
SSCs could be expected to better cater to the needs of the state's farmers than a
centralized NSC, was an additional bonus.
5.2   This has been a healthy, if not entirely painless, evolution. The HYVs (and to
a lesser extent the advances in hybrid maize and other open-pollinated varieties)
released in the late 60s and early 70s required the creation of a seed industry capable
of rapid dissemination of improved seeds, many of them for SPVs and composite
varieties. It was not within the power of governments to create viable, high capacity
private sector seed industries on a crash basis. Indeed, given the lack of repeat
business for key SPVs, it was not even obvious that private companies would find the
activity profitable. What governments could do, often with the assistance of the Bank
and other donors was to create a public sector seed industry. Initially at least on a
monopolist and national basis.
5.3   These national companies made a major contribution by (a) an increase in the
physical supply of seed, (b) making farmers, politicians and the agricultural sector in
general "seed conscious," and (c) providing an initial cadre of seed scientists and
technologists. The natural evolution of a monopolistic parastatal is to become
increasingly bureaucratic, inefficient, politically powerful and indispensable. (If it is
the sole source of seed, for example, policy makers are likely to be unwilling to take
the risk of major dislocation of the parastatal's activities). The slow adoption of a
Seed Policy in Bangladesh, where BADC continues to be the sole public sector seed
company, illustrates this tendency.
5.4    Decentralization of the seed industry from a single national monopoly to a
series of state or provincial seed companies was a brilliant move. It provided a public
sector dynamic which the central company could not resist; it opened up so many
promotion possibilities to national seed company staff. Moreover, it could not be



76
couched in terms of public versus private sector interests. It was an evolution entirely
within the public sector.
5.5    That the NSC in India continues to be a major player in the seed industry does
not vitiate this analysis. It is now a player, not the player. So long as the government
is willing to make the necessary subsidy payments, NSC will continue to operate.
However, should the government withdraw its support, there are several other
companies clearly able to take up any slack created.
5.6    The performance of the decentralized seed companies has been mixed; some
such as PSCo and Andhra Pradesh Seed Company have achieved quality and cost
levels which would make them serious competitors even if all restraints on the private
seed companies were removed. Other parastatal companies would be unable to
compete in the absence of state subsidies; however the breadth of the industry means
that their customers would be readily supplied from other sources. Having served their
purpose, they could be allowed to fold.6"
B. Sustainability.
5.7    With the passage of time, with the demonstration of a substantial market for
improved seed, and with increased indigenous expertise in the seed industry, the
industry has become of interest to the private sector; particularly where much of the
gain in productivity can be captured by the private supplier, as in the case of hybrids.
5.8    The seed industries have thus evolved from a single parastatal company, to
decentralized state or provincial parastatals, to a mixed private-public system, where
the public sector supplies predominantly SPVs, and the private sector supplies hybrids
and specialized varieties.
5.9    In large part, this current equilibrium  is due to the historic "accident" that
subsidization of seed for SPVs is paid directly to the parastatal companies involved.
Were the subsidy paid per kilogram of seed sold a significantly larger market share
might be captured by the private sector, in some cases leading to the demise or
privatization of uncompetitive parastatals; the required subsidy might well be lower.68
67. An Indian SSC generally agreed, citing decentralization as the reason it can do a better job than NSC in getting
seed to the farmers' doorstep through various means. This has opened the door for private seed companies to cater to
farmers' needs, including SPVs.
68. An SSC explains that the current equilibrium is not an accident, also that the SSCs can't run away from their moral
duty to produce SPVs, which private seed companies avoid because of their low margin and high handling cost. The
SSC reiterates that seed subsidy is not to SSCs but to the farmers as part of the Agriculture Department's effort to
enhance the seed replacement rate.



77
5.10   Further evolution of the seed industries studied thus awaits a re-thinking of
seed policy. The paradigm that the production of seeds for SPVs should be paid for in
full by farmers, may simply be untenable.69 A re-examination could well lead to a
change in the way the subsidy is paid and an enhanced role for the private sector. An
argument that the government should be willing to pay the full cost of varietal
development and of agricultural extension (because they are public goods), but none of
the costs of seed production (even though SPVs are in large measure public goods)
does not have intuitive appeal.
5.11   In like vein, the continued existence of the seed companies brought into
existence by the projects, is basically irrelevant to a judgement as to the sustainability
of the projects. It is the continued supply of good quality seed to farmers at
reasonable prices which is the index of project "sustainability," not which organizations
are involved in seed supply. In those cases where parastatal companies evolve to the
point where they can compete without subsidy with the private sector, their continued
existence is to be welcomed. Should all of the project companies succumb to
competition, this would not detract from the value of the projects, or indeed reflect
adversely on their design. The projects have clearly had a very positive effect on the
evolution of the seeds industries in their three countries; that the industries may be in
the process of outgrowing some of the institutions which originally fostered their
growth is, in the circumstances, an indication of sustainability, rather than
unsustainability.
C. Lessons.7"
5.12   Key elements of project design, most of which these projects got right, are
thus:
i.     Technical Training. The seed industry stretches all the
way from genetic research, through varietal development,
through bulking up, certification, registration, production
and marketing. Many of these topics are highly technical,
and it follows that a cadre of well trained seed scientists
and technologists is a necessary condition for success of
the industry. Thus an active training component is an
essential element of a good project. (As remarked in
69. Alternatively, it may be tenable, in a world where certified seed was sold at a sufficiently high price (and in
sufficiently low volume) as to allow one or two generations of multiplication by farmers or the private sector before
being sold for grain production. The point is that the project paradigm of 20 percent of wheat and paddy seed
being certified seed, the production of which is paid for in full by farmers, does not appear to be viable.
70.  Srivastava (1994) contains many of the same lessons, based upon a wider literature review.



78
footnote 49, technical assistance is a very limited,
temporary and imperfect substitute).
ii.   Institutional InfJastructure. An initial core of publicly
supported genetic research, seed breeding and seed testing
is essential for the rapid development of the industry.
There is no point in the training component, if trained
staff have nowhere to practice their professions. At a
later date, in a mature industry, there is room for debate
and experimentation as to the relative roles of the public
and private sectors in research, breeding and certification.
However, in developing an industry, the public sector has
to stand ready to fulfill any roles not yet satisfactorily
performed by the private sector.
iii.   Seed Production. Public production and marketing of
seed may well be a necessary initial step to (a)
demonstrate the existence of a market, and (b) to make
seed available pending the development of private sector
seed companies. There is every reason such parastatal
companies should be encouraged to compete, and if freed
from the more onerous of public sector bureaucratic
procedures they may be able to do so.
iv.    Break-up of Monopoly. It is essential to find some way
to avoid the emergence of a single all powerful parastatal
monopoly. One alternative may be to foster competing
parastatals, another would be to provide for seed
importation by companies, other than the seed production
parastatal. The apparent confusion due to imbalance in
seed supplies from different sources is a small price to
pay for avoidance of the policy inertia and bureaucratic
procedures which characterize dominance of an industry
by a single parastatal, or other forms of central planning.
v.    Remove Barriers to Entry. It is important to ensure that
there are no unnecessary barriers to entry of private firms
into the industry; that government not impose regulations
that prevent the private sector from functioning
efficiently; and that the private sector have equal access
to improved seeds and germ plasm produced from the
research system.  It is not necessary to have an active
pro-private policy stance; but it is essential not to have an
anti-private sector stance.



79
vi.   Subsidy. Under no circumstances should a subsidy be
used to give differential advantage to the public sector.
Any subsidy should be available to all. The
administrative problems of doing this, are a significant
additional argument against subsidy.
vii.  Independent Testing and Certification. National Uniform
Varietal Trial open to all; and a highly professional and
independent Seed Certification Authority to establish
standards for germination, purity, and genetic composition
are essential. A truly rigorous Seed Certification
Authority is perhaps the most important indicator of a
mature seed industry. In India certification is optional,
and this has worked well; but farmers need the option of
buying certified seed.
viii. Support for Informal System. At least for the next twenty
years the bulk of non-hybrid seed planted is likely to be
farmer saved. Farmers need increased advice on
roughing for off-types, minimizing weed contamination,
seed cleaning and storage, and germination testing.7'
D. Bangladesh and the Small Country Problem
5.13   With a population of about 100 million, Bangladesh is not a small country,
however in the context of this evaluation it differs from India and Pakistan in that
public sector seed supply has remained with a single entity, BADC. Thus the process
of undermining public sector monopoly with public sector (limited) competition, as a
precursor to competition from the private sector has not taken place. And, desirable
though it may be, this evolution is unlikely to take place in the myriad smaller
countries where a transfer of economic functions to the private sector might be sought.
It will not take place, since the diseconomies of several small parastatals with the same
function prohibit it.
5.14 However, a single parastatal monopoly is likely to mobilize more political and
bureaucratic support for the continuation of its monopoly, than parastatal oligopolists.
Rather than seek to foster alternative sources of domestic production, in such cases, it
may be more effective to facilitate trade in seeds; with its monopoly broken a
parastatal is less likely to offer resistance to the expansion of private seed production.
71. This is being addressed in the Third National Seeds Project for India (Credit 1952-IN).



80
5.15  There is no reason that seed imports should not be subject to the same type of
rigorous varietal trials used to approve the release of new domestic varieties. Where
the exporting country has no certification system, two or three years in the NUYT
might reasonably be required, but given adequate performance importation subject to
export country certification could be fully liberalized. In the more usual case where
foreign country seed certification is available, theirs should be accepted on an
equivalency basis. With hindsight, the continuation of quantitative import controls and
public sector imports (para. 2.06) was a design error, which could only help delay the
full entry of private companies into the supply of the affected seeds.
E. Wider Lessons
5.16  The above lessons are thought to be directly applicable to seeds projects, yet
they may also suggest considerations to be borne in mind for agricultural projects
generally, or even more widely. Such tentative lessons might include:
i.    User-Pays. Desirable though it is in principle that the
user should pay, collection may prove difficult or even
impossible in the case of public goods. Hence,
recommendations for cost recovery, or other applications
of the user-pays principle should include a demonstration
that the good or service in question is not a public good.
Much past experience with cost-recovery efforts in
irrigation schemes has foundered on exactly this
consideration. (Recent Bank experience in Mexico and
Turkey holds promise that appropriate social organization
can reduce collection problems).
ii.    Wither on the Vine. Faced with an inefficient
monopolistic parastatal, there are two policy options. The
first attacks the parastatal problem by privatization and
may or may not introduce competition. The second
attacks the monopoly by removing subsidies and
regulatory controls, leaving the parastatal to compete, or
wither on the vine.
iii.   The Market Test of Competition. Even in a market which
is too small for several domestic firms to compete,
competition can be ensured by permitting international
trade. It is not necessary that a lively trade be
established, merely that importers get open access to
foreign exchange, and that quarantine and other health or
environmental regulations not be used to provide non-
tariff barriers. This is the market test of competition.



81
iv.    Technical Assistance versus Training. As discussed in
footnote 56, at best technical assistance is an imperfect
substitute for training indigenous experts. It can provide
a short-term stop-gap. But if there is need for technical
assistance, provision of training to alleviate the need over
the long term should in most cases be a necessary
condition for provision of technical assistance.

Subject : Impact Evaluation Report - India
Reference: i) National Seeds Project (Loan 1273-IN)
ii) Second National Seed Project (Credit 816-IN)
Dear Mr. Roger Slade,
Thank you very much for forwarding a copy of draft Impact Evaluation
Report for NSP-1 & II for India, Pakisatan and Bangla Desh for my
comments..
I have to offer comments on contents of para No. 4.28, 4.29 and 4.35 of
the Report which are as under:
First of all, please refer to Para 4.28 , Page No.70 of the Impart   Now p. 55
Evaluation Report on India. My comments on the contents of this para
are as under:
It is out come of crude analysis of facts to state that the State Seeds
Corporations (SSCs) have been supported for its survival by subsidies in
the 20 to 25 % range. Rather subsidies have been passed on to SSCs for
doing mandate function of undertaking production and marketing of
seeds to support ambitious Agriculture Production Programme; thereby
the SSCs fate gets tied up with success or failure of Agriculture
Production Plan, putting them into risks and constraints which cannot be
fully recovered by the input of subsidies.
Mr. Gregg who has made study of lndian condition seems to have been
carried away by incomplete facts in as much as he has come out with
the conclusion of lack of opportunity of the "level playing" for PSSC's,
ignoring the fact that most of the PSSCs in India are, in fact ,willing to
get subsidies, with a pre-condition, that they are not subjected to the
same constraint to which SSCs are subjected to, about dovetailing its
activities with National Agriculture Development Programmes. Hence
his concept of "level playing "is only hypotectical.
Regd. Off.: Shastri Nagar, Post Box 119, Akola 444 001 (INDIA)Phone : Off. : 25 380, Resi. :26 882, Fax: 0724 - 28291 Gram: MAHABEEJ

Similarly, apparently, there seems to be lack of proper understanding of
Management of SSCs which is visible from the statement in Para.4.29 of
the report that in SSCs only IAS Officers are posted as Managing
Director, shortening career path of profession Seed Technologist,to serve
the purpose of career promotion of LAS. I think the visit of evaluation
making team to Andhra Pradesh State Seeds Development Corporation
(APSSDC) Hyderabad, Madhya Pradesh State Seeds & Farm
Development Corporation (MPSSFDC), Bhopal etc. should have given
better understanding of facts to the team; if efforts were made to analyse
the facts critically; instead of finding easy solution to major management
problems.
Further, the contents of Para 4.35 of the report is too general . To be
specific Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Ltd. (MSSCL),Akola's
working is a proof that PSCs can survive even if subsidies were
withdrawn.
However, I appreciate that a lot of effort has gone in preparing the
report ,which needs only looking at the facts from correct perspective, to
make valuable suggestion for progress of Seed Industry in Developing
countries. If suggested facts are over looked we may come out with mis-
leading conclusion which will lead us to setting of skewed targets for
future.
Yours sincerely,
(Bijay Kumar)

Dear Mr. Roger Slade.
Refer your  letter  No.(202)477-1234  dated  April  28,1995
regarding  Impact Evaluatlon Report  on  India:  National  Seeds
Project  (Loan  1273-IN)  India:  Second  National  Seeds  Project
(Credit 816-IN). The comments of the Corporation on thls
report may be offered as below:
1. It has been Indicated In thls Evaluatlon Report that
the NSP model was based on Indian Taral Project. As aware,
the mother TaraL Project  has  taken  shape  of  U.P.Seeds  And
Taral Development  Corporation Ltd.  and,  therefore,  the  name
of the Corporation may also be included.
2. CHAPTER - 4: PROJECT IMPACT
Para 'C' - INDIA - Page-67
Now p. 55               Para-4.28 (Page-70)
i.The U.P.Seeds & T.D.C. do not agree with the report
regarding  managerial   structure.   The   Corporation
is belng managed by the hlghly  qualified Agrlculture
Scientists and professional Managers in their respect-
ive fields.
ii.The  Corporation  is  utillzlng   the   full   capaclty
of its plant and there is adequate vertical and
horlzontal growth ln its affalrs.
iii.As regards support to S.S.C. by way of subsidy
lt ls to be clarifled that the subsldy is not provlded
to  UPS&TDC  as  such.  ThLs  subsidy   ls  appllcable
ffor sale of seeds by Govt. agencies on seeds produced
at Govt.Farms procured by them from other sources
including S.S.C.
4.30 :  Since  the replacement  rate ln  case  of  Cereal  is  8
to 10% and in case of Pulses is about 2.5%. the subsidy facllity
by the Government  in the form  of  direct  assistance  to  the
farmer  Is  desirable  to  achleve  the  targetted   replacement
rate In U.P.
4.31 : The llttle work on development  of  SPV's  by  Prlvate
Sector  is not  only due to the  retention  from own graln  for
seed by  the farmer, but  lt ls due to  the  fact  that  SPV's
require a voluminous infrastrcture.huge investment and high
handling cost of production leaving very meagre margln as



98
against the conscize infrastructure and high margin of profit
in case of  hybrids.  They  avoid  dealing  in  SPV's.  Rather,
the factor of retaining the grain as seed by farmer is equally
applicable in case of SSC's who mainly deal in SPV's. S.S.C. Is
rather, have creative platform for the Private sector by
habituating  the farmer for using  SVS's  certified  seeds  and
there is a huge gap to fill the replacement rate and private
seed growers can go to any extent.
Now para. 4.33    4.32 : The sale of N.S.C.and S.S.C.  has  been  indicated  as
76,000  tonnes V/s 1,36.000 tonnes  respectively.  Here  it  is
to be pointed-out  that out  of  1,36,000  tonnes  produced  by
S.S.C's the share of U.P.Seeds and T.D.C. by the end of 1993-
94 production  alone is about  89,000  tonnes  and  in  1994-95
it is more than 90.000 tonnes.
4.35 : Not agreed with the ISI strategy to reduce  the volume
of certified seed sold and raise its price because the economic
status of the Indian farmers are not enough to afford higher
prices.
In case of  the  2nd  strategy  to  distribute  present
volume of certified seeds at present prices the subsidy should
be continued. If private sector has to have a claim in subsidy
they  must  share  the  responsibilities  for  producing   seeds
as per directives of the Government specially for SPVS required
varieties.
J.36 : The U.P.Seds &  T.D.C.  being  SSCs.,  has  been  given
the responsibility to meet demands of various kinds of cereals/
pulses/oil seeds/forage crops and even vegetable seeds aei
per targetted seed plan either -py prbdu'cipg 'the ; seeds through
their growers in U.P.State or by making arrangements of seeds
from other sources  i.e.from  SSCs./NSC/SFCI  or  Private  Seed
Companies.  Even after meeting the demands of  the  State,  we
are supplying  the seeds to other States  In  India.  So,  the
surplus seeds being produced in Private Sector and procured
by Govt. Sector are also being distributed under subsidy
to farmers of U.P.State providing platform of healthy growth
of Private Seed Companies.
CHAPTER -5 : CONCLUSION : FUTURE IMPACT
A) 5.1: U.P.Seeds & T.D.C. have created sufficient back-
ground at field level by distributing seeds through Cooperative,
Agriculture Deptt. at door step of the farmers. The job done
by U.P.Seeds & T.D.C.  is  far  better  than  N.S.C.  Now  door
Is open for Private Companies to cater the need of the farmer
specially SPVs.
B) 5.9: The  comment  is  proper  because  the  subsidy  Is
not paid to UPS&TDC  (SSC) rather  it  is  directly  passed  on
to the farmer by Cooperative/Agriculture  Deptt.  as  part  of
credit facility or under extension programme so as to enhance
the replacement rate.
The current  equalibrium is not  an  accident,  but  is  a
result  of very difficult  task  done  by  the  Corporation  for
orienting  the  seed  producing  farmers  and  encouraging   the
farmers  to  use  SPVs  certified  seeds.Moreover   the  Private



99
Seed Companies are  least  interested  in  dealing  with  SPV8.
because of low margin and high handling cost while on the
other hand U.P.S. & T.D.C.(SSC) can't run away from its moral
duty to fullfil  Its commitment  to  produce  assigned  quality
as per State Seed Plan.
Yours sincaly.
