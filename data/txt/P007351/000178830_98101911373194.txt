STAFF PROJECT REPORT
THIRD PORT PROJECT
HONDURAS
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
A. The Transport Sector
Background
1.        The principal agricultural and industrial areas of Honduras are
the Sula Valley and the nearby Atlantic coastal strip. San Pedro Sula, which
has emerged as the country's main industrial center, and the ports of Cortes
and La Ceiba are the principal cities in the area. Further to the south lies
Tegucigalpa, the capital city and the second industrial center. The corridor
joining Tegucigalpa with San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes in the north and the
Pacific port of San Lorenzo in the south has been the main conduit of the
country's economic activity.
2.        Development of the transport sector has taken place only during
the last two decades, mainly in the highway and port subsectors. The con-
struction of the Inter-American highway in the southern region was started in
the mid fifties, and an all-weather road between Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
Sula was completed in 1971. Modernization of Puerto Cortes was begun with
Bank financing in the late sixties.   A second expansion of Puerto Cortes
was completed recently, and the construction of a deep water port at San
Lorenzo is presently under way, both with Bank financial assistance. Puerto
Castilla, to be financed under the proposed loans and credit, would serve the
increasingly important agricultural and timber areas of eastern Honduras: the
Aguan Valley and the Olancho forestry reserve. A number of highway projects
are now under construction or about to begin, which would complete most of
the country's primary highway network, and the Government is now paying
greater attention to the improvement and expansion of the feeder and access
road system. Honduras can thus look forward to having, in the medium-term
future, a transport system to serve its most important productive areas and
to meet the needs of its international trade.
Highways
3.        Because of the topography of Honduras, road construction, in
general, has been difficult and expensive; nevertheless, the road network
grew from about 3,200 km (110 km paved) in 1960 to about 6,100 km (1,240 km
paved) in 1975. In addition to the principal roads mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraph, the primary system includes a road southwest from San



- ii -
Pedro Sula to the El Salvador border and a road along the north coast to
La Ceiba. The country's secondary and tertiary road system is not yet well
developed. Major road projects now under construction or due to be started
shortly include three highways from the Tegucigalpa-San Pedro Sula corridor
to the central region: the Progreso-Yoro road in the north; the Tegucigalpa-
Juticalpa-Catacamas highway in the central area (financed under the Bank's
Sixth and Seventh Highway Loans); and the Tegucigalpa-Danli road in the south.
The road system to connect the Olancho forest reserve areas with the sites for
the planned sawmills, the proposed pulp and paper factory, and Puerto Castilla
are now in the design/engineering phase. Construction of these roads should
start in mid 1977 with financial assistance from the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB).
Ports
4.        Ports are a critical component of the transport sector since they
handle nearly 95% of the country's international trade. Because of the larger
trade with gulf and east coast ports of the United States, port capacity has
developed mainly on the Atlantic coast, where three out of the four principal
ports are located. Puerto Cortes is the principal general cargo port, while
Tela and La Ceiba are mainly banana handling facilities. San Lorenzo on the
Pacific side is presently a lighterage port, but will soon have alongside
facilities to service ocean-going vessels and will be able to handle increased
sugar and lumber exports. Puerto Cortes, which handles over 1.8 million tons,
or 79%, of the overseas traffic, is the largest port of Honduras, with an
excellent natural harbor, and provides efficient service. It is quickly
adapting to new types of traffic such as roll-on/roll-off, containers, and
lighter-aboardship. A gantry crane for handling containers is scheduled to be
installed in 1977.
5.        The ports of Honduras are administered by Empresa Nacional Portuaria
(ENP), the national port authority, established with Bank assistance in
December 1965. ENP is an autonomous Government entity with an Executive Board
of seven members consisting of three Ministers, one representative of the
National Planning Council and one delegate each from the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, the trade unions and the shipping companies. The day-to-day
administration is the responsibility of the General Manager. The management
and operations of ENP are considered highly efficient, and its financial
position is sound. The port subsector, during the decade since the creation
of ENP, has responded adequately to the needs of the growing volume and
variety of overseas traffic.
6.        Two previous Bank loans approved in 1966 and 1971 (Loans 463-HO
and 767-HO) have provided almost all the external financing for port expan-
sion in Honduras. ENP carried out the two previous port projects, for
improvement of Puerto Cortes and the construction of San Lorenzo, in a very
capable manner. There was a long delay in the start of construction of San
Lorenzo, which resulted in a large cost overrun and required a US$3.0 million
supplemental loan from the Bank (approved July 1975). This, however, was the
result of a political objection to the location of the port, raised by the



- iii -
Government which came into office after the loan had been signed, and was not
the fault of ENP. The succeeding Government approved the original site, and,
since approval of the supplemental loan, project execution has been progressing
normally. The San Lorenzo port is now expected to be completed by September
1977.
7.        ENP has the sole responsibility for port planning.  Its planning
process includes development of a rolling five-year plan that covers economic,
engineering and financial analyses, most of which are done by ENP's own staff.
The inclusion of a cash flow analysis in the five-year plan effectively
integrates the ENP planning and capital budgeting process.
Other Transport
8.        The railway system consists of three narrow-gauge lines, all located
in the north and serving mostly the banana plantations in the Sula Valley, the
northern coastal strips, and the upper Aguan Valley. Honduras has two princi-
pal airlines; between them they provide adequate douiestic and international
service. With the improvement of the road system since 1970, domestic air
traffic has declined steadily. Little intermodal transport planning is done
since air and rail transport are relatively unimportant and highway/port coor-
dination is not complex.
B. The Project
Project Objectives
9.        The primary objectives of the project are (a) to provide suitable
port facilities at Puerto Castilla and at San Lorenzo for the efficient
handling of new export traffic expected to be generated in the near future;
(b) to carry out a channel depth study for San Lorenzo; and (c) to train EIIP
staff in container operations.
Project Description
10.       To support the above objectives, the proposed project contains the
following components:
(a)  Civil Works
At Puerto Castilla: Construiction of a 450 m wharf, one transit
shed, one warehouse, two lur,I,er sheds, storage tanks for palm
oil and petroleum, an office building, and miscellaneous services.
At San Lorenzo: ExLension of the pier (presently under construc-
tion) to provide an additional berth 145 m long, and construction
of a sugar storage shed and two molasses tanks.



- iv -
(b) Equipment
At Puerto Castifla: Provision of general cargo and lumber
handling equipment, chip-loading equipment, a used tugboat
and a launch.
At San Lorenzo: Provision of (1) equipment for handling
sugar, lumber and general cargo and for pumping molasses
and (2) navigational aids.
(c) Consultant Services for
Detailed engineering and supervision of construction, and
(d) Technical Assistance for
(i) Channel depth study at San Lorenzo; and
(ii) Training of ENP staff in container operations at Puerto
Cortes.
Puerto Castilla
11.       The facilities at Puerto Castilla are needed to serve the important
export development projects now being undertaken by the Government in the
-Aguan Valley and the Olancho Forest Reserve. The first phase of the Aguan
Valley agricultural development project, which received financing from IDB,
has been completed, and IDB has recently approved a US$40.0 million loan for
a more ambitious second phase. Surpluses of corn and beans are already being
produced, and production of grapefruit and palm oil from the first phase will
become substantial within a few years. Although all of these products except
grapefruit would be primarily for domestic consumption, they would be shipped
by Puerto Castilla since land transport is very expensive. The Government is
also going ahead with the first stage of the Olancho forest industries project
with IDB and Venezuelan financial support to produce timber and chips for
export. In February 1977, IDB and the Honduran Government signed a loan for
US$59.5 million to finance the road infrastructure for this project. Three
sawmills will be constructed during the 1979-1981 period. For the second
stage, a pulp and paper factory is to be constructed in the early 1980's to
produce liner board, which will then largely replace chips in the export
program.
San Lorenzo
12.       The works proposed at San Lorenzo are related to the expansion of
the sugar industry, which is presently under way in the southern region of
Choluteca. Since the sugar companies (some of which are in part foreign-
owned) developed their export plan after the present contract for the port
works at San Lorenzo was awarded, the facilities currently under construction
are inadequate for handling the expected traffic and, therefore, need to be
expanded. The sugar companies have contracted with a large international firm
to provide technical assistance and to serve as their marketing agent. The
exports are expected to be profitable since the cost of production in Honduras
compares favorably with the price level at which the world market for sugar



is forecast to stabilize within two years at about USi12 per pound FOB in
constant 1974 prices. Because the sugar mills are close to San Lorenzo and
expect to export some production to Japan, the owners have requested that
facilities be provided at San Lorenzo. In order to justify the provision of
the storage and handling facilities, the sugar companies have offered to
guarantee ENP a minimum tonnage of exports. It has been agreed that ENP would
not sign the contract for the construction of additional facilities at San
Lorenzo until an agreement satisfactory to the Bank on minimum tonnages has
been obtained from the sugar companies.
13.       Lumber and general cargo-handling equipment for San Lorenzo was
originally included in the Second Port Project (Loan 767-110); however, because
of the cost overrun on the civil works, it was agreed, when making the supple-
mental loan of US$3.0 million, that the unordered equipment would be deleted
and might be considered for inclusion in a subsequent project. Accordingly,
since the equipment is still needed, provision for it has been made in this
project.
Technical Assistance
14.       The channel depth study will examine the feasibility of deepening
the access channel to San Lorenzo to permit the use of larger vessels than can
now enter the port for export of sugar and molasses, and the training will
prepare ENP staff for the efficient handling of the growing container traffic.
Project Costs
15.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$29.9 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$17.0 million, as summarized below:

16.       The base cost estimate for civil works and equipment has been
obtained by updating to December 1976 the consultants' estimate, which was
based on 1975 prices. Contingency provisions include: (a) physical varia-
tion in civil works at 15% for Puerto Castilla and 10% for San Lorenzo; and
(b) annual price escalation at 12% for civil works, 8% for equipment and 6%
for consultant services for the 1977-1979 period. The costs of a total of 440
man-months for consultancy services and technical assistance are estimated at
an average, for foreign and local consultants, of US$3,900 per man-month. The
proposed Bank Group financing would cover the estimated foreign costs.
17.       The local currency costs (US$12.9 million equivalent) would be met
partly by ENP's own resources and partly by a domestic bond issue with a
10-year term. It has been agreed that the Government would underwrite the ENP
bond issue or make other financial arrangements satisfactory to the Bank in
order to ensure that the local resources necessary to complete the project are
available.
Project Implementation
18.       ENP would be the Borrower and the Executing Agency.  As demonstrated
in the case of the two previous Bank-financed port projects, ENP has the capac-
ity to execute the project satisfactorily. For carrying out engineering and
supervision of construction, the channel depth study and the training of ENP
staff in container operations, ENP has contracted for consultants whose quali-
fications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to the Bank.
Construction on both ports is expected to commence in mid-1977. The work at
San Lorenzo would be completed by March 1978 and that at Puerto Castilla by
September 1979. An implementation schedule for the project has been agreed
upon.
Financial Analysis
19.       ENP's financial performance for the five years from 1971 through
1975 has been good. During this period, ENP's operations were profitable,
and the return on net assets was above 16%. Since 1971, revenues have grown
by 70%, partly because ENP has assumed responsibility for the operation of
additional ports and partly because of the growth in traffic handled. Net
income during this time, however, has increased only by 41% because increases
in expenses have not been matched by increases in tariffs. As a result, the
operating ratio increased from 44% in 1971 to 63% in 1975. The debt equity
ratio at the end of 1975, although higher than the 35/65 ratio in 1971, was
satisfactory at 44/56.
20.       Forecasts for the 1977-1983 period indicate that there are good
prospects for satisfactory financial performance by ENP. A tariff increase
was implemented in February 1977, which should enable ENP to achieve an 8%
rate of return on revalued assets in 1977. While this tariff increase was
accompanied by some restructuring of the tariffs, there is need for further
restructuring in order to relate tariffs to the present value of assets and
to the real cost of providing port services and facilities. ENP has agreed to
make such further adjustments to its tariff structure not later than July 1,



- vii -
1978, based upon a full revaluation of its assets, to be completed by October
1, 1977. ENP has also agreed to carry out further asset revaluations at least
once every three years. Information regarding the cost of port services and
facilities will be provided by a cost accounting system which ENP is now pre-
paring and has agreed to put into operation by October 1, 1977. Furthermore,
ENP has agreed to increase tariff levels as necessary to maintain an annual
rate of return of not less than 8% on revalued assets, and, in order to
maintain a satisfactory cash flow, it has also agreed to limit capital expen-
ditures during the construction period for items not included in the Second
and Third Port Projects to a maximum of US$500,000 per annum.
21.       The total planned investment of ENP during the period 1977 to 1983
is US$49.3 million. Of this total, US$29.5 million relates to project items,
and the balance of US$19.8 million of non-project items refers to the ongoing
construction of San Lorenzo under the Bank's Second Port Project and the new
Free Trade Zone at Puerto Cortes. The Free Trade Zone is not related to port
operations, and, in order to ensure that non-port operations do not become a
financial burden on the port operations, ENP has agreed to the following:
(a) ENP will retain each year an amount equivalent to 8% of net fixed assets
for investment in port services and facilities; (b) ENP will use its best
efforts to ensure that non-port operations will earn sufficient revenue to cover
their expenses; and (c) ENP will advise the Bank prior to any changes in port
tariff levels in order, among other things, to afford the Bank an opportunity
to comment on increases which might not be related to port operations.
22.       As a result of both planned investments and asset revaluation, ENP's
fixed assets are forecast to increase by 140%, or US$41.7 million, by 1979,
pushing up the debt equity ratio to a peak of 56/44. However, after 1979,
because the rate of growth is expected to decline and ENP will generate
substantial amounts of surplus funds, the debt equity ratio will decline to a
satisfactory level of 35/65 by 1983. With these projected surpluses, ENP will
be in a position, and has agreed to set aside funds each year sufficient to
retire the local bond issue (para. 16) at maturity. With the intended revision
of tariffs, debt service coverage will be at least 1.75 to 1 throughout the
period, and ENP agreed that no debt will be incurred without Bank agreement
unless net cash generation for the preceding 12 months is at least 1.75 times
the maximum total debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year.
23.       Although ENP's accounting procedures and control are generally
satisfactory, individual accounts separate from ENP's overall account should
be established and maintained for each of the major development projects.
It has been agreed that such separate accounts will be set up and maintained.
Procurement and Disbursement
24.       All contracts for civil works and equipment for Puerto Castilla and
San Lorenzo would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding,
except that the used tugboat for Puerto Castilla would be procured by inter-
national shopping. With regard to the civil works for San Lorenzo, ENP pro-
poses to negotiate with Columbus Latinoamericana (the contractor which is
presently carrying out the port works at San Lorenzo) an extension of the



- viii -
ongoing contract. Since the new work would be similar to, and about one-
third of the amount of, the work in the current contract, ENP's proposal is
practicable and would result in the facilities being ready earlier than would
be the case if new bids were invited. It is doubtful that international
contractors would be interested in the new bid, not only because of the modest
size of the contract (estimated cost US$3.1 million), but also because of the
effective competition which Columbus Latinoamericana is in a position to offer
because it is already on the site. Since the current contract with Columbus
Latinoamericana was awarded in 1975 on the basis of international competitive
bidding, and the prices applicable thereto would provide a basis for negotiat-
ing the prices of the new contract, ENP's proposal is considered acceptable on
condition that the terms of the revised contract will be subject to Bank
approval.
25.        The proposed Bank Group financing will be disbursed to cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the various project items as shown in
paragraph 15. In order to meet the tentative schedule for completing the port
works at Castilla by the end of 1979, work on the detailed engineering of
the project has already been started. Also, because of the possibility of
utilizing, at a favorable price, the services of a dredging contractor (which
would be financed by ENP) who is scheduled to complete a job in Corinto,
Nicaragua in the latter half of 1977, ENP has also begun the channel depth
study. Retroactive financing of up to US$500,000 is therefore recommended to
meet foreign expenditure incurred on consultant services for engineering and
technical assistance after November 1, 1976.
Environmental Impact
26.        Since no dirty or dusty cargoes would be handled at either of the
project ports, and since normal precautions would be taken in handling the
small quantities of petroleum at Puerto Castilla, there would be no adverse
effect upon the ecology as a result of the port development proposed under
this project. The ecological implications of the proposed sawmills and the
paper and pulp factory have been considered by the Government and IDB, and
suitable provision for controlling air and water pollution would be included
in their design.
Economic Analysis
27.        Traffic projections for Puerto Castilla are based on the Government's
program for export of forestry products (sawn timber, woodchips and eventually
liner board) from the Olancho forestry reserve, and of agricultural products
(corn, beans, citrus fruit and palm oil) from the Aguan Valley, and the esti-
mate of imports is based on the projected inputs (machinery, chemicals, ferti-
lizers, petroleum) to the forestry and agricultural development projects.
M4ajor financial commitments have already been made in both these development
schemes. The port, which will handle the traffic generated by the Aguan and
Olancho projects, is justified as part of this larger package of investments.
The fundamental economic issue is whether the agricultural and forestry



- ix -
development programs are economically viable, and the question has been
answered affirmatively by formal economic and financial analyses. Given these
investment decisions, the task was to identify a least cost solution for the
required port infrastructure, i.e., the optimal location, timing, and size of
the port facility. This exercise, together with the determination of an
appropriate port tariff structure that will generate revenues to cover the
full cost of the port, has established that the investment is justified.
28.       Starting at a level of 264,000 tons in 1980, the total traffic at
Puerto Castilla is expected to increase to 1,049,000 tons in 1983, when the
export of chips will reach the peak of 643,000 tons. With the expected
startup of the pulp and paper factory in 1984, chip export will decline
rapidly and will be replaced by a smaller tonnage of liner board (133,000
tons), bringing the total traffic to 794,000 tons in 1986. These traffic
projections are conservative since they include only the reasonably firm
traffic related to the forestry and agricultural projects and do not take
into account export traffic such as hardwood products, sugar from the Aguan
Valley and bananas from the Isleta area, which is likely but not yet certain.
29.       At San Lorenzo, the traffic is expected to rise from the 1976 level
of 172,000 tons to 240,000 tons in 1978, when the export of sugar and molasses
is to commence. Thereafter, the traffic will gradually build up to 276,000
tons in 1986. Based on firm figures of export traffic, which the sugar industry
will guarantee, and on a conservative estimate of growth of lumber and general
cargo, these projections are considered to be realistic.
30.       The overall rate of return for the project is 25% with first year
benefits of 23%. The benefits attributable to the proposed facilities at
Puerto Castilla are mainly the avoided cost of the closest alternative to the
proposed investment, i.e., (a) land transport of the export cargo to Puerto
Cortes and (b) a wharf and ancillary facilities at Puerto Cortes which would
be needed for handling the additional traffic at that port. These benefits
yield a rate of return of 27% with first year benefits of 25% for this invest-
ment, which accounts for 80% of the project costs.
31.       In the case of San Lorenzo, if the proposed extension of the pier is
not carried out, the least cost alternative would be to divert the sugar and
molasses traffic to Corinto in Nicaragua, which is the nearest suitable port
on the Pacific side. The avoided cost of land transport and port charges at
Corinto would be the benefits from the proposed investment at San Lorenzo.
In addition, there would be savings in waiting time for lumber and general
cargo vessels. Together, these benefits yield a return of 14% with first year
benefits of 14% for this investment, which accounts for 20% of the project
costs.
32.       Sensitivity analyses in which the cost and benefit streams are
varied by 25% indicate that the return would be no lower than 22% for Puerto
Castilla and 10% for San Lorenzo.

Project Risks
33.       A delay in the startup of the first of the three proposed sawmills at
Corocito is a possible uncertainty associated with the project. This delay
might result from (a) slow progress in the arrangements for financing and
management of the sawmill and (b) the necessary road infrastructure, which is
being financed by IDB, not being ready in time. In order to expedite con-
struction of the sawmill, the Government has assigned it high priority and
has appointed a ministerial committee to monitor progress and resolve any
problems that may arise. Also, IDB has provided a senior executive to assist
COHDEFOR in preparing and executing the project. Design of the sawmills is
proceeding on schedule. Financing for the sawmills will be provided by the
Government, IDB and suppliers. Preliminary discussions have begun with a
number of bilateral export finance agencies. Financial arrangements are
expected to be concluded by September 1977. In order to ensure that there
are no administrative delays in the forest roads project, the Ministry of
Communications, Public Works and Transport has expanded an existing project
execution unit for the forest roads.
34.       In view of the steps taken, and progress made so far in meeting
preparation schedules and arranging the necessary financing for the sawmill
and forest road projects, it appears that there is little risk of delay.
However, since the usefulness of having the proposed port facilities at
Castilla in operation by the end of FY1979 is dependent to a large extent upon
the completion of the supporting road system, it has been agreed with ENP
that bid documents for the port works at Castilla would be issued only after
satisfactory bids have been received for the forest road works.
Conclusion
35.       The proposed project fully merits Bank Group support.  It will
provide suitable outlets for export commodities which will help Honduras to
earn valuable foreign exchange and will yield acceptable rates of return of
27% and 14% on its two main components. The facilities proposed at Puerto
Castilla are essential for the success of two important projects of the
Honduran Government, i.e., the Aguan Valley Agricultural Development Project
and the Olancho Forest Industries Project, which have been undertaken with the
object of developing the northeastern region. Without the proposed facilities
at San Lorenzo, sugar enterprises, which have already committed considerable
investment to expansion of capacity, will face higher costs in exporting their
products.



I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Distribution of Economic Activity
1.01      Although Honduras is the second largest country in Central America,
it is estimated that only 17% of the land area is suited for intensive agri-
cultural use. The rest of this mountainous country, with thin soils and steep
slopes, is best suited for forestry and other extensLve uses. The good agri-
cultural land is concentrated in four widely separated major river valleys,
ten smaller valleys, and the northern coastal strip. The four major valleys
are the Aguan, Sula, Guayape, and Choluteca (Table 1.1). Bananas comprise
the most important commercial crop (34% of exports by value) and are produced
in the Sula Valley, the northern coastal strip and the upper Aguan Valley.
Coffee, produced in the hilly areas between 700 and 1,200 meters above sea
level, is an important export crop (15% of exports by value), and a source
of cash income for small farners. Production of sawn timber from the exten-
sive pine reserves of the central and eastern parts of the country is a major
industry, accounting for 14% of exports by value. It is likely to become
more important in the future with the planned development of the Olancho
forestry project in the northeast. Cattle breeding occupies many valley
areas where big land holdings have dominated, and the export of beef has
accounted for 7% of export earnings. Corn and beans are the staple crops
grown by the peasants in all parts of the country and are used mainly for
domestic consumption. Sugar cane is grown in the south near Choluteca for
domestic production of sugar, Plans are advanced for increasing production
for export.
1.02      The capital and largest city, Tegucigalpa, had a 1974 population
of 280,000, while the second larg-.,ct city, San Pedro Sula, had a population
of 200,000.  Additionally, tLoere -re five departments in the country with
urban populations of less  0-0-n    000 but more than 20,000 (Table 1.2).  San
Pedro Sula has emerge1 as       industrial center of the country, with an
estimated 55% of the 1970 m.anufacturing activity. Together, the two largest
cities were estimated to account for 80% of the manufacturing output of the
country in 1970.
1.03      The Siula Valley and the nearby northern coastal strip have dominated
the agricultural and industrial development of the country. Located in the
extreme northwest, the valley attained a distinct, almost self-sufficient,
regional economy centered on the city of San Pedro Sula, itself about 60 km
from the Atlantic coast and from the main port of Puerto Cortes. To the
south, facing the Pacific coast, is the Choluteca Valley, of considerable
historical importance but having less rainfall and, therefore, less potential
than the Sula Valley. The largest of the valleys, the Aguan, like the Sula,
faces the Atlantic coast in the northeast, but is isolated from the rest of
the country; it has excellent soils and good rainfall and its development
is to play an important role in the future shape of the transport system.
1.04      An understanding of the valley-centercd regionili economrns of
Honduras is essential to an understanding r-f pc.St ;1nd fuitlure transport



- 2 -
development strategies. A complicating factor is the transport network
required for exploitation and management of the largest natural resource in
the country, namely the softwood forests in the central mountainous areas,
where road building is extremely costly and intensive agriculture is not
possible or even desirable. According to forestry experts, most of these
areas should be left as reserve, and managed to provide a sustained growth
of timber for export and domestic purposes, rather than be cut to clear the
land for tilling. In the western mountains of Honduras where the timber has
been removed, the peasants farm the steep slopes and thin soils and manage to
provide a subsistence type of agriculture with no real hope of increased
living standards unless they shift the farming activity to the rich valley
lands.
B. The Transport System
(i) Highways
1.05      Honduras is essentially a unimodal country dominated by roads and
road transport; the distances are short and the terrain rugged, making rail-
ways non-competitive, except in the northern coastal strip where specialized
banana railways continue to operate. The Superior Planning Council (Consejo
Superior de Planificacion Economica, CONSUPLAN, para. 1.19) estimated that
road transport carries 86% of the freight tonnage and 96% of the passenger
traffic in the country.
1.06      The total length of the road network in Honduras in 1974 was about
6,140 km, of which 1,240 km were paved (Table 1.3). A major effort to expand
the road network was started in the mid-1950's; by 1960, there were about
3,230 km of roads, of which only 110 km were paved. The backbone of the net-
work is the north-south road, which runs between the ports of San Lorenzo and
Puerto Cortes, passing through Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula and joining the
Sula and Choluteca valleys. The Tegucigalpa-Catacamas road is the major route
to the east-central part of the country and the Guayape valley. The Sixth
Highway Project (Loan 896-HO) was to aid in financing the reconstruction and
paving of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga section of this road, while the proposed
Seventh Highway Project would extend the paving and partial relocation to
Catacamas. The El Progreso-Tela-La Ceiba road joins the Sula Valley in the
north with the northern coastal strip. When the La Ceiba-Sava road, financed
by the Central American Development Bank (CABEI), is completed, the Aguan
Valley will have, for the first time, an efficient all weather access to the
main road network. With the completion of these primary roads, the main
production and population centers will be joined with an adequate road network.
1.07      New road programs are now being undertaken or planned to join the
potentially productive areas of the eastern part of the country with the north-
south road axis; this work should be complete within a few years. Such roads,
in order to fulfill their development purposes, will have to be supplemented
by a feeder road system; the Government is aware of this, and some emphasis is
now being given to the expansion and improvement of the feeder road system.



The Bank, through the Sixth Highway Project, is assisting in such expansion by
financing technical and economic studies for about 330 km of feeder roads and
reconstruction of about 80 km of these roads. IDB and USAID are also assist-
ing in the financing of studies of feeder roads in productive areas.
1.08      Road transport expanded rapidly in the decade from 1964 to 1974;
during that period, the vehicle fleet grew from about 16,000 to 43,900
(Table 1.4), an increase of about 174%. The most notable growth occurred in
the number of trucks, which increased by 230%. The Government has enacted
a revised Land Transport Law (February 1976), which permits the regulation
of freight and passenger transport, in order to organize the transport indus-
trv within Honduras and to improve its competitiveness within the context of
the overall Central American region. In general, availability of road trans-
port has not been a serious bottleneck to growth, although shortages do occur
during seasonal peaks in demand.
(ii) Railways
1.09      There are three small, narrow gauge rail operations in the country,
all located in the north and designed originally to serve the banana planta-
tions in the Sula Valley and the northern coastal strips. They total 450 km
of main and branch line and 750 km of sidings and spurs. The Government-
owned railway, Ferrocarril Nacional de Honduras (FNH), runs from the Atlantic
port of Puerto Cortes to San Pedro Sula and along the upper Sula Valley, with
a total length of 114 km of main line. It hauls sawn timber as weil as agri-
cultural imports and exports. Until recently, FNH showed a profit. However,
investments to repair the damage of Hurricane Fifi in 1972 and the reduction
of banana shipments from damaged plantations led to a deficit operation
of about US$0.5 million per year for the last two years (Table 1.5). The
Tela Railway operates over 179 km of main line and serves the plantation
areas of the eastern side of the Sula Valley and part of the coastal strip.
It has access to both Puerto Cortes and the specialized banana pier at the
port of Tela. It was owned and operated by the United Brands Company in Tela,
but has recently been acquired by the Government. Since both these lines are
of the same gauge (1.07 m), their rolling stock is compatible. The Standard
Fruit Railroad operates over 157 km of main line and serves the banana
plantations on the coastal strip between Tela on the west and Balfate on the
east. The specialized pier at the port of La Ceiba is the outlet for banana
exports. Since the line is a 0.91 m gauge, there is no connection to the
other railroads. A branch line from the coastal strip through rugged terrain
and into the upper Aguan Valley is the only access, apart from the sea, that
it has with the rest of Honduras. Negotiations have been initiated to make
the Standard Fruit Railroad a Government operation also. FNH will then
control all the rail operations in the country. With captive banana traffic
and a simple operation, FNH should have no trouble in making a reasonable
profit, provided that tariffs are adjusted periodically to reflect current
costs for each major section of the railway system and that uneconomic
extensions of the present system are avoided.



-4-
(iii) Ports
1.10      On the Atlantic coast, from west to east, are the four ports of
Puerto Cortes, Tela, La Ceiba and Puerto Castilla. On the Pacific coast,
there is a deepwater anchorage at Amapala on the island of El Tigre with
lighter service to the shallow draft mainland port of San Lorenzo. The ports
are operated by the Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP), a semiautonomous Govern-
ment organization that was highly successful in developing the port of Puerto
Cortes and was subsequently directed to take over the operation of all the
ports in the country.  (See Chapter II for a full description of the port
subsector.)
(iv) Air Service
1.11      Honduras has two principal airlines offering both domestic and inter-
national service.  The larger is SAHSA, a private airline with headquarters
in Tegucigalpa. It has a fleet of 14 planes (DC-3, DC-6 and Convairs) for
domestic services, and a Boeing 737, its major revenue earner, for inter-
national service to New Orleans, Managua, San Jose and Panama. The 737 calls
at both Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, offering service between these two
points. The second airline, TAN, operates a 737 out of San Pedro Sula and
offers service to Miami and Mexico City, calling at Tegucigalpa and La Ceiba
en route. TAN also operates three smaller aircraft for domestic service.
It is privately owned and recently acquired a majority share in SAHSA, effect-
ing a merger of sorts; so far, the operations of the two have not been con-
solidated. In addition to the two above-mentioned main airlines, there is
a local airline (Aerovias Nacionales de Honduras) operating DC-3 aircraft,
which provides regular domestic service to 20 cities, including the bay
islands in the Caribbean Sea. There are also a number of "bush pilot" services
that provide access to a large number of airstrips in isolated sections of the
country.
1.12      The Villeda Morales airport at San Pedro Sula has a good runway
of 2,800 meters. Construction of a new terminal building for improving the
service to tourists is presently under consideration. The Toncontin airport
at Tegucigalpa is less satisfactory, with only 1,980 meters of runway, barely
adequate for modern jets, and is considered a hazardous facility. The proposal
for a new airport at Tegucigalpa has been under consideration for many years,
but has not been implemented due to the high costs and relatively low level of
traffic.
1.13      With the completion of the Western Highway and the road between
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, domestic air traffic has declined steadily
since the peak year of 1969 (Table 1.6).  Private automobiles and a good
intercity bus and truck service have diverted a large portion of air traffic,
especially on the Tegucigalpa-San Pedro Sula segment.



C. Transport Planning and Coordination
1.14      Responsibility for highway planning lies with the Ministry of
Communications, Public Works and Transport (MCOPT). The main bases for
highway investment planning are: (a) a long-term highway network master plan,
which was prepared almost ten years ago; and (b) a long list of proposed
projects which reflect a variety of local interests as well as national
development priorities. Present road planning is unrealistic because it is
not related to the constraints of financial resources and available execu-
tive capacity. There is need for a change in the planning approach, which
should focus on a core of a small number of projects of high priority which
can reasonably be implemented with available resources.
1.15      Port planning is the responsibility of the National Port Authority
(ENP), a semiautonomous organization that operates and plans all ports in
the country. It generates many of its financial requirements through a system
of port charges. Because of the limited number of ports in the country, it
also avoids the problem of attempting to implement too many projects. Its
management has been good and is not subject to frequent change, allowing the
development of a rolling five-year plan that includes economic, engineering,
and financial analysis, most of which is done by the port staffs themselves.
The inclusion of a cash flow analysis in the five-year plan avoids the worst
deficiency of the highway plan and effectively integrates the annual budget
exercise for the ports into a longer term plan.
1.16      FNH is also a semiautonomous organization that will eventually be
in charge of operating all three narrow gauge railways. It is a stable
operation with little traffic growth, specializing in moving bananas to the
Atlantic ports. As such, its planning operation is essentially financial
and involves projection of revenues and operating expenses. The capital
budget is small and has not required sophisticated engineering or economic
analyses. The current planning staff is small but has been adequate to
date.
1.17      Airport planning is the responsibility of MCOPT.  With distances so
short and incomes so low, road transport cut deeply into domestic air traffic
as the road network expanded in the 1970's, obviating the need for planning
new investments in domestic airports.
1.18      The two modes that receive most of the transport investment in
Honduras are roads and ports, and they are the subjects of continuous planning
activity. Highways, which control by far the largest budget, accounted for
72% of the 1975 budget expenditure for transport. In the same year, ports
accounted for 20%, rail 6% and airports 2% (Table 1.7). To speak of a trans-
port plan for Honduras is to speak, therefore, of an independently produced
port plan and a highway investment plan.
1.19      The formal transport coordination mechanism involves both MCOPT and
CONSUPLAN. CONSUPLAN, which is a quasi-ministry, deals with intersectoral
considerations as well as intrasectoral ones, such as those within the trans-



-6-
port sector. It has published both a national development plan and an annual
operation plan for the transport sector. In the last year, the division
within CONSUPLAN that dealt with transport matters has become weak due to
the departure of key personnel and advisors, some of whom went to the MCOPT
planning unit, and the basic coordination effort now takes place between
MCOPT and the Ministry of Finance.
1.20      Since intermodal considerations are not generally of major concern
and highways dominate the transport picture, the budget decision for highways
is the major transport investment decision. The coordination required among
roads, airports, and the semiautonomous railroads and ports is handled through
ad hoc meetings and the personal relationships of the heads of agencies.
1.21      With an adequate, independently produced port plan and no serious
problem of intermodal coordination, the major task remaining is to formulate
a highway investment program that reflects both national priorities and
constraints. Technical assistance under the ongoing Sixth Highway Project
(Loan 896-HO) has been aimed at developing a suitable data base and technical
skill that would allow such an exercise to be carried out. The proposed
Seventh Highway Project includes a component for financing the preparation of
a Highway Master Plan and is the logical extension of the current technical
assistance effort.

II. THE PORT SUBSECTOR
A. General
2.01      Ports, which handle over 96% of exports and 93% of imports, play a
dominant role in the foreign trade of Honduras. Only a small amount of over-
land trade to adjoining Central American countries moves by road transport.
The Government attaches high priority to the development of adequate port
cilities. At the four ports handling overseas traffic, the tonnages (includ-
-g petroleum products) in 1975 were as follows:
Traffic ('000 Tons)
Port                      Exports        Imports        Total        %
Puerto Cortes              851             977          1,828       79
Tela                        73              58            131        5.5
La Ceiba                   196              39            235       10
San Lorenzo-Amapala        113              15            128        5.5
1,233           1,089          2,322      100
Bananas, lumber, sugar and coffee constitute the main exports, while machinery,
manufactured goods, foodstuffs, fertilizers and grain account for the imports.
Because of the larger trade with the gulf and east coast ports of USA, the
port capacity has developed mainly on the Atlantic coast, where three out of
the four principal ports are located. Puerto Cortes is the principal general
cargo port while Tela and La Ceiba are mainly banana-handling facilities.
San Lorenzo-Amapala on the Pacific side is a lighterage port, catering mostly
to lumber traffic.
B. Bank Assistance in the Port Subsector
2.02      In 1966, the Bank made the first loan (463-HO) of US$4.8 million to
Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP) for building two deepwater berths and support-
ing facilities at Puerto Cortes. Soon after the completion of this project
in 1970, need was felt not only for addition to that port's capacity but also
for providing a deepwater port on the Pacific side. Accordingly, the second
port loan (767-HO) of US$6.0 million was made in 1971 for a project which
provided for the construction of a new wharf and railway yard at Puerto Cortes
and a pier for seagoing vessels at San Lorenzo. The works at Puerto Cortes
were completed satisfactorily in 1975 and those at San Lorenzo are in progress.



- 15 -
Because the bids received in 1975 for the latter works were much higher than
appraisal estimate of 1971, a supplemental loan of US$3.0 million was made
in 1975, bringing the total of the Bank's lending in the port subsector to
US$13.8 million. The present proposal will be the third port project to
be executed with the Bank's assiistance. Apart from an Eximbank loan for
the purchase of container-handling equipment for Puerto Cortes, all port
development in Honduras so far has been financed by the Bank.
C. Organization
2.03      The ports of Honduras are administered by ENP, the National Port
Authority, which was established on December 1, 1965. Initially ENP was given
charge only of Puerto Cortes, the principal port on the Atlantic Coast, and,
while the other public ports were left under the jurisdiction of the
Directorate General of Customs and Indirect Taxes, two private ports (Tela and
La Ceiba) continued under the management of United Fruit and Standard Fruit
Companies. On January 1, 1974, the administration of all ports (including the
private ones) was transferred to ENP.
2.04      Being an entity created as a precondition for the appraisal of the
first port project (Loan 463-HO of 1966), ENP has been constituted on lines
acceptable to the Bank, which assisted the Government in its formulation. ENP
is an autonomous undertaking with an Executive Board of seven members: three
Ministers (Economy and Finance, Communications and Public Works, Natural
Resources) or senior officials designated by them; a representative of the
Economic Planning Council; and three delegates, one each from (a) Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, (b) Trade Unions and (c) shipping companies. The
latter three members are nominated by the President of Honduras from the
lists submitted by the respective groups. The Minister of Economy and Finance
is the Chairman of the Board. The day-to-day administration of ENP as a whole
is the responsibility of the General Manager who is assisted by a submanager
and by heads of the operations, engineering, accounts and other departments.
A Port Superintendent with suitable supporting staff is responsible for the
working of each port. A chart showing the organization of ENP is given on
page 20 (Table 2.1). ENP has a total staff of about 566 distributed as follows:
General Management 10, Planning and Development 14, Data Processing 12, Design
and Construction 7, Promotion and Marketing 4, Accounts and Personnel 48, Cargo
Operations 296 (including 60 temporary workers), Maintenance and Services 109,
Hydrography and Navigational Aids 11, and Security 59. Relations between
staff and management are good. Under the terms of Loan 463-HO, ENP has under-
taken to consult the Bank when appointing the General Manager. The present
incumbent is a capable, dynamic person with good leadership qualities, and the
affairs of ENP are carried out in an efficient manner.
2.05      ENP has adopted operations procedures and accounting systems on
Ehe advice of management consultants, Booz, Allen and Hamilton International
Inc., who were employed by it, with the agreement of the Bank, in accordance
with the provision in the agreement for Loan 463-HO. Since taking over all



- 16 -
of the ports in 1975, ENP has been maintaining separate accounts for each of
them, in addition to the accounts for Puerto Cortes. A separate account for
ENP itself, however, has not yet been started, and items not clearly attri-
butable to any individual port are being booked into the accounts for Puerto
Cortes. The need for opening a new account for ENP has been accepted by the
General Manager, and action is expected to be taken shortly (para. 5.03).
ENP's accounts are audited at the end of each fiscal year by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Under Loan 767-HO, ENP has undertaken to
establish charges for the provision of services and facilities which will be
reasonably related to the costs thereof and which will produce revenues
sufficient to earn an annual rate of return not less than 8% on the historic
value of its net fixed assets. For this purpose, its accounts department is
presently preparing to install a costing system acceptable to the Bank, which
will provide the necessary information to design a cost-based tariff structure
(para. 5.06). The financial position of ENP is satisfactory.
D. Facilities
2.06      Puerto Cortes is the largest port of Honduras, handling over 1.8 mil-
lion tons of cargo annually. It has an excellent natural harbor formed by
a large, well protected bay with a depth of 12 to 16 m, an easy access and a
tidal range of 0.3 m. The berthing facilities at the port comprise:
(a) Texaco oil pier (1959) serving Texaco refinery
(b) Finger pier for sugar and molasses
(c) Banana wharf (1919) - 292 m long
(d) General cargo wharf No. 1 (1955) - 187 m long
(e) General cargo wharf No. 2 (1970) - 336 m long
(f) General cargo wharf No. 3 (1975) - 353 m long
Ancillary facilities available at Puerto Cortes include storage tanks for
oil and molasses, one shed for sugar, four transit sheds, two warehouses for
general cargo, one warehouse for wheat, open storage areas and a railway yard.
Construction of wharf No. 2, one transit shed and one warehouse was financed
by the Bank under Loan 463-HO, and construction of Wharf No. 3 and the rail-
way yard was financed under Loan 767-HO.
2.07      The port of Tela, developed mainly as a banana export facility by
the United Brands Company in 1914, has one pier constructed normal to the
shore in an open roadstead about 60 km east of Puerto Cortes. The pier
can receive two vessels of 9.0 m and 7.0 m drafts, one on each side. Its
timber construction is in a good state of repair. Ancillary facilities
include petroleum storage tanks, a customs warehouse, storage sheds and yards
belonging to the United Fruit Company, and a railway yard.



- 17 -
2.08      The port of La Ceiba, situated about 63 km further east of Tela,
was built primarily for the export of banana production of the Standard Fruit
Company; this port also has one finger pier in an open roadstead. The timber
construction of the pier, which can berth two vessels of 7.0 m draft, is in
poor condition and will need substantial repairs and restoration if the
facilitv is to be kept in operation beyond the next few years. Access to the
pier is mainly by rail. Shore facilities include a customs warehouse and some
private storage sheds, mostly belonging to the Standard Fruit Company.
2.09      On the south side of the Caribbean island of Roatan, a small pier
has been constructed to serve the meager passenger and goods traffic handled
by ferries operating from La Ceiba.
2.10      A small concrete pier located on the south side of the bay of
Trujillo, near the old city of Trujillo, serves only the coastal vessels since
the available water depth is less than three m. On the north side of the bay,
which is very well sheltered and has deep waters, stands Puerto Castilla,
where the only facility presently in operation is a small T-head pier, con-
structed by the fish processing plant for the use of the fishing vessels.
About 1,000 m to the east are the ruins of a timber pier which served as a
banana export facility of Puerto Castilla until 1938. The pier was built in
1923 by the Trujillo Railroad Company, a subsidiary of the United Fruit
Company, and was one of the most active banana export centers of Central
America for 15 years. It fell into complete disuse, however, beginning in
1938, when the banana cultivation in the valley of the Aguan and Paulaya
Rivers was abandoned as a result of the destruction of the plantations by the
sigatoca disease. Since then, the Bay of Trujillo has seen little commercial
activity. Its large expanse of sheltered waters, with depths of 22 m at less
than 300 m from the shoreline, makes it an excellent natural harbor with great
unexploited potential. A study carried out by Tippetts-Abbott-McCarthy-
Stratton (TAMS), Consultants to ENP, has identified potential for the develop-
ment in the bay of an oil transshipment terminal for the use of very large
crude carriers (VLCC) and of a bulk terminal for importing bauxite for an
aluminum smelting plant. Because of the high priority being given to the
economic development of the northeastern region of Honduras, which is the
service area of Puerto Castilla, a need is now perceived for new facilities at
this port.
2.11      All overseas traffic on the Pacific coast of Honduras is handled
by lighterage. Two anchorages, one opposite to Amapala on the Island of
Tigre and the other at El Muerto, near the town of San Lorenzo, are accessible
to seagoing ships, drawing up to 8.5 m and 7 m respectively. Masonry wharves
for lighters have been provided at both Amapala and San Lorenzo, but, because
they are constructed at low water line, barges can use them only during part
of the tide. Since there is no land connection between Tigre Island and the
mainland, cargo lightered to Amapala must be transported to San Lorenzo in
barges. There are four storage sheds at Amapala and nine at San Lorenzo.
With a view toward replacing a major part of the inefficient lighterage opera-
tions, ENP is presently building, with the Bank's assistance (Loan 767-HO),
alongside facilities for seagoing ships at Henecan, near San Lorenzo; these



- 18 -
consist of an L-shaped pier 145 m long with a 15 m wide access bridge. The
pier would be suitable for berthing, on its outer face, ships drawing up to
7 m, which is the maximum draft of ships that can reach the new facilities
without deepening of the channel. The inside face of the pier would be useful
for vessels drawing up to 6 m and for lighters. A transit shed for general
cargo, and covered and open storage areas for lumber are being provided.
E. Operations
2.12      Shipping and cargo-handling operations at Puerto Cortes are well
organized and managed. Over 1,400 vessels per year belonging to some 54 ship-
ping companies use the port. While banana ships, lumber ships and general
cargo ships account for nearly 95% of the users, Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) and
container vessels are on the increase. Delta Lines started a lighter-aboard-
ship (LASH) service in 1975, with two calls per month and an average of
900 tons of cargo per call. Caribbean Overseas Lines (CAROL), a consortium
of four European Shipping Lines - Hapag-Lloyd (German), KNSM (Dutch), T &
G Harrison (British) and CGT (French) - plans to start a container service
to Puerto Cortes as a part of its program to replace the existing break-bulk
service between the Caribbean, Central America and Europe. Pilotage is
compulsory and is provided by ENP. A used tugboat was acquired in 1975 to
assist vessels in berthing and unberthing, and the damage caused frequently
to fender piles by bulbous bow vessels has been reduced. The port operates
24 hours a day, 362 days a year.
2.13      Cargo handling on shore is carried out by ENP staff, except in the
case of export cargo transferred directly to ships from railroad cars or
trucks, which is handled by labor supplied by ship's agents. All stevedoring
is carried out by private contractors. Because of free competition, the
stevedoring charges are reasonable without requiring any regulation by ENP.
2.14      Generai cargo is handled with ships' gear.  Dock pallets and fork-
lifts are used extensively, averaging a productivity of 33 metric tons per
ship-hour - a significant increase over the 15.5 metric tons per ship-hour
obtained in 1968. Loading at the banana wharf, used mainly by United Brands
Company, is carried out with four gantry-type conveyor loaders with a loading
rate ranging between 150 and 175 metric tons per ship-hour. The United Brands
Company is increasingly exporting its bananas in containers, which are loaded
and unloaded directly from railcars by ship-mounted cranes. About 15 to 20
movements of 20-foot equivalents (TFE's) are made per hour. The Standard Fruit
Company uses four portable conveyors between the railcars and the ship to
obtain a loading rate of 125 to 150 metric tons per ship-hour. Lumber is
loaded directly from rail cars, with a loading rate of 25 to 30 metric tons
per hour; this low rate is due largely to the lack of an adequate number of
flat bed rail cars and partly to the low efficiency of the ships' gear. ENP
is considering the provision of preshipment storage for lumber to improve the
loading rate. Imported bulk grain is discharged by pneumatic unloaders
directly into rail cars or trucks at a rate of 45 metric tons per ship hour.



- 19 -
Mineral concentrates in dump buckets are transported by trucks and loaded by
ships' gear. The loading rate ranges between 60 and 70 metric tons per
ship-hour. With an average ship turnaround time of less than 28 hours and
dry cargo throughput of over 900 tons per meter of quay, the port operations
at Puerto Cortes are efficient.
2.15      Regarding the container service planned by CAROL and the increase
in the containerization of bananas, ENP has decided, on the basis of a study
made by its consultants, to invest in a 40-ton capacity container gantry crane
to be installed on the new wharf No. 3. A Paceco crane, financed by Eximbank,
has been ordered and is scheduled for delivery in 1977. A free zone, in which
warehouses and a container consolidation shed would be provided, is also
planned.
2.16      At Tela and La Ceiba, bananas, which constitute the bulk of the
traffic, are loaded directly from railroad cars. With portable conveyors,
the loading rate averages 125 metric tons per ship-hour. General cargo,
also handled directly from rail cars with ship's gear, averages 30 metric
tons per ship hour.
2.17      Lighterage operations at San Lorenzo and Amapala are carried out
with a fleet of 25 barges and 7 tugs and with ship's gear at shipside, and
largely by manual labor at the warehouses. Because customs clearance for
all imports on the Pacific coast must be obtained at Amapala, all cargo
other than readily discernible items must be barged to the customs warehouse
at Amapala and, after being cleared by customs, must be reloaded into barges
to be towed to San Lorenzo. Some cargo is handled as much as six or seven
times before reaching San Lorenzo. This situation will change when the new
port facilities at San Lorenzo come into operation since the Government has
agreed to modify the present regulation and to permit importation or exporta-
tion through the new port.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Need for Additional Port Capacity
3.01       The Government of Honduras is vigorously pursuing its program for
the development of the northeastern region of the country. It has already
embarked on an extensive scheme for agricultural development in the Aguan
Valley with financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB).  The first stage of this scheme has recently been completed, and
the more ambitious second stage is now being launched.  The initial problems
of land tenure have been resolved, and over three thousand families have
been settled in cooperatives organized in the region.  Based on the satis-
factory progress of the scheme and the acreage planted and planned, it is
expected that an exportable surplus of corn, beans, grapefruit and palm
oil would develop within a few years.
3.02       The Government's plans for developing the forest industry in the
Olancho region have also moved forward. The feasibility study for a paper
and pulp factory project (which has been under consideration for many years
and with which the Bank has been actively associated through the International
Finance Corporation) has been completed by consultants (Simons of Canada),
and the Government has decided to proceed with the project, estimated to cost
US$431 million and to implement it in two stages. Estimated to cost US$191
million, the first stage (1978-1979) aims at the production of timber and
chips for export by installing sawmills at Corocito, Pueblo Viejo and La Union
and includes 211 km of road infrastructture (Map IBRD-12462). This would be
followed by the second stage, which involves the construction of a paper and
pulp factory at Corocito in 1984. when liner board will largely replace chips
in the export program (Tables 3.I and 3.2).
3.03       Since the eYistffi-;,3 i J   capacity is not adequate or suitable for
handling the overseas traffc which would be generated by these agriculture
and forestry development schemes (paras. 4.02-4.05), ENP proposes to construct
new port facilities at Puerto Castilla, which is well located with respect
to Corocito and has an excellent natural harbor.
3.04      Another export-oriented development in the agriculture sector is
the expansion of sugar manufacturing capacity in the Choluteca region in
the south. Two new sugar factories are under construction, and one is being
expanded to produce cane sugar and molasses for the overseas market. This
traffic (para. 4.17) will need port facilities on the Pacific coast. Since
the sugar companies developed their export plans after the contract was
awarded for the port works at San Lorenzo, the facilities presently being
constructed under Loan 767-HO are not sufficient to cope with the increased
demand expected after 1978. ENP therefore proposes to make suitable additions
to them. Pursuant to enquiries from the sugar industry, ENP also wishes to
examine the feasibility of deepening the access channel to San Lorenzo to
permit the use of larger vessels for the export of sugar and molasses.



- 22 -
B. Project Objectives, Scope and Timing
3.05      The objectives of the project are:
(a) To provide facilities at Puerto Castilla and at San Lorenzo
for handling efficiently and economically the overseas
traffic related to the agricultural and forestry development
schemes in the Olancho region and the expansion of the sugar
industry in the southern region;
(b) To carry out a study to determine the optimal size of
vessel for handling the projected traffic at San Lorenzo,
considering the cost of initial and maintenance dredging
versus the economies associated with the use of larger
vessels; and
(c) To improve the capability of ENP staff through training in
container operations.
3.06      The scope of the project works is based on the feasibility studies
carried out by ENP with the help of consultants. The study for Puerto Castilla
was made by Tippetts-Abbott-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS) and that for San Lorenzo
by Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) - firms which were already
working for ENP, respectively, on the Puerto Cortes and San Lorenzo projects.
The studies have been modified to incorporate the Bank staff's comments.
3.07      The facilities would be designed initially to handle traffic levels
expected up to 1984-1985, but would be capable of being expanded thereafter,
if required. Lumber and general cargo-handling equipment for San Lorenzo
was originally included in the ongoing project (Loan 767-HO); however, because
of the cost overrun on the civil works, it was agreed, when making the supple-
mental loan of US$3.0 million, that the unordered equipment would be deleted
and might be considered for inclusion in a subsequent loan. Accordingly,
since the equipment is still needed, provision for it has been made in this
project.
3.08      Ideally, the proposed facilities should be ready for operation just
before the principal overseas traffic is offered for shipment. According to
schedules indicated for the sawmill at Corocito and for the sugar factories
in the southern region, the facilities at Castilla should be available for
use by end 1979 and those at San Lorenzo by March 1978. The implementation
schedule (Table 3.3), prepared in consultation with ENP and its consultants,
indicates that these target dates can reasonably be met.

C. Project Description
3.09      The project will consist of:
I.   Civil Works
At Puerto Castilla (Map IBRD 12463): Construction of a
wharf, 450 m long with alongside depth of 10.5 m below mean low
water spring tide; one transit shed, 100 m x 30 m; one warehouse,
3,000     two open-sided lumber sheds, 6,000 m2; office
building, 800 m   maintenance building, 560 m2; one
palm oil storage tank, 2,500-ton capacity; one petroleum
storage tank, 2,000-ton capacity; and miscellaneous struc-
tures such as guardhouses, shelters, pumphouses, gates and
fences; also site development, including grading, drainage,
roadway and utility services.
At San Lorenzo (Map IBRD 12464): Extension of the pier
(presently under construction) to provide an additional berth
145 m long with alongside depth of 7.5 m below mean low water
spring tide, construction of one sugar storage shed 76 m x 31 m,
and two molasses tanks 3,800-ton capacity each.
II.   Equipment
At Puerto Castilla
(a) 14 forklifts (nine of 2 ton and five of 5 ton) and 500
wooden pallets for handling general cargo;
(b) four forklifts (two of 10 ton and two of 5 ton), three
tractors and six flat bed trailers for handling lumber;
(c)  three front-end loaders 2.5 m3, five dump trucks 40 m3
and one portable loader of 250-ton-per-hour capacity
for handling woodchips; and
(d) One used tugboat 1,200 HP for berthing operations and
one launch 12 m for general harbor duties.
At San Lorenzo
(a) One mobile crane - 15 ton, five forklifts - 5 ton,
four tractors and 10 flat bed trailers, and 500 pallets
for handling lumber and general cargo;
3
(b)  Two mobile cranes - 15 ton, two front end loaders 2.5 m
two tractors and five flat bed trailers, and 20 steel buckets
for handling sugar;



- 24 -
(c) Pumping equipment 150 T per hour capacity with piping,
valves, etc., for handling molasses; and
(d) Six light buoys for aiding navigation.
III.   Consultant Services for
Detailed engineering and supervision of the construction for
Puerto Castilla and San Lorenzo.
IV.   Technical Assistance for
(a)  A study to determine the optimal depth of the access
channel for San Lorenzo; and
(b)  A manual detailing the procedures and documentation for
container operations, and training ENP's staff in the
management and operation of the container berth and
consolidation depot at Puerto Cortes (the container facili-
ties are not a part of this project).
D. Engineering Evaluation
3.10      The main considerations taken into account in the engineering evalua-
tion of the project were:
At Puerto Castilla
(a) Suitability of the site from the point of shelter, littoral
drift, siltation, natural sea bed levels and access from the
sea, all of which are excellent on the north side of the Bay
of Trujillo;
(b) Feasibility of providing transport infrastructure to the service
areas;
(c) Suitability of subsoil conditions (as indicated by five test
borings carried out by ENP) for the pile construction proposed
for the wharf and for future deepening, if required;
(d) Conformity of the wharf location with the Master Plan for
future developments;
(e) Location of the wharf to balance the quantity of material
required to be dredged with that required as fill for the
land to be reclaimed;
(f) Adequacy of the wharf length for serving the expected number
and size of ships without undue queuing;



- 25 -
(g) Provision for future rail service to the wharf;
(h) Adequacy of open and covered storage areas;
(i) Availability of land for future expansion; and
(j) Suitability of the methods and equipment proposed
for cargn handling, which are as follows:
General Cargo: Ships' gear to be used for loading and
unloading and forklifts and pallets for movements between
wharf and storage.
Lumber: To be transferred from open-sided shed to shipside
using forklifts, flat bed trailers and tractors, and to be
loaded with ships' gear.
Chips: At the stockpile in an open storage space, front-
end loaders will load chips into dump trucks for conveyance
to the wharf, where the chips will be dumped into the bin
attached to a custom-made portable loader. The bin will be
raised and tilted into a chute discharging into the ship's
hold. The portable loading system will not only allow
any one of the three berths to be used for chip loading
operations, but also will be readily adaptable for handling
other bulk materials. Since the export of chips is expected
to phase out when the paper and pulp factory goes into produc-
tion in a few years, the latter feature of the system is
useful. One loader with a capacity of 250 tons per hour has
been proposed; however, when preparing the detailed design
for the loader, the  visability of providing two units of
125 tons per hour capacity each will be considered in order
to avoid complete stoppage of loading operations due to a
possible breakdown of the loader.
Grain: An existing silo (which was built by a private company
a few years ago, but which is presently out of use) will be
taken over and relocated in the port for use as a preshipment
storage facility for grain. Conveyance from silo and loading
into the ship will be carried out with the help of the chip
loading equipment.
Citrus: Initially, the cartons will be handled with pallets
and forklifts, but, when the traffic grows, portable conveyors
similar to those in use for bananas will be employed.
(k) Proposal for acquiring a used tugboat based on the satisfactory
experience at Puerto Cortes.



- 26 -
At San Lorenzo
(a)  Possibility that the alternative of constructing a dolphin
berth to serve molasses vessels only would lead to unacceptable
queuing of dry cargo vessels, and that the extension of the wharf
(presently under construction) to provide an additional berth
which could handle molasses as well as dry cargo would be preferable
and economically justified.
(b)  Wharf extension to be similar in design to the ongoing
construction.
(c)  Molasses storage tanks to be located as close as possible
to the new berth to minimize pumping distance.
(d)  Height of molasses tanks to be kept low to enable founda-
tion to be designed without recourse to costly piling.
(e)  Suitability of the semimechanized system proposed for
handling sugar (using front end loaders, buckets and
trailer trucks) in preference to a fully mechanized
conveyor system which would not be justified for the
level of expected traffic.
E. Cost Estimates
3.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at L 59.8 million
(US$29.9 million) with a foreign exchange component of L 34.0 million (US$17.0
million), as detailed on page 27 following.
3.12      The base estimate cost of civil works and equipment has been obtained
by updating to December 1976 the consultants' estimates, which were based on
December 1975 prices. The consultants' estimates have been prepared on the
basis of recent bids and prices quoted for comparable work in the region and
are considered realistic; contingency provision includes (a) physical varia-
tion in civil works at 15% for Puerto Castilla and at 10% for San Lorenzo, and
(b) price escalation at 12% for civil works, 8% for equipment and 6% for
consultant services each year from 1977 to 1979.
3.13      The cost estimates provide for 170 man-months of expatriate engineers
at US$6,000 per man-month and 270 man-months of local engineers at US$2,500 per
month for consulting services and technical assistance for an average man-month
cost of US$3,900.
F. Borrower and Executing Agency
3.14      ENP would be the Borrower and the Executing Agency.  For the detailed

Castilla, ENP would retain services of consultants whose qualifications and
experience, terms of reference and terms of appointment would be satisfactory
to the Bank. NEDECO would provide these services for the San Lorenzo component
of the project. From its performance on previous Bank-financed projects,
it can be expected that ENP, with the assistance of the consultants, would
be able to execute the project satisfactorily.
G. Financing
3.15      The proposed Bank financing for the project would cover the estimated
foreign exchange cost (US$17.0 million). The estimated cost in local currency
(US$12.9 million equivalent) would be met partly by ENP's own reserves and
partly by a bond issue of approximately US$13.0 million with a 10-year term.
H. Procurement
3.16      All contracts for civil works and equipment for Puerto Castilla and
San Lorenzo would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding,
except that the used tugboat for Puerto Castilla would be procured by inter-
national shopping. Of the equipment to be procured under the project, only
flat bed trailers are manufactured locally and may qualify for domestic pref-
erence. With regard to the civil works for San Lorenzo, ENP proposes to
instruct Columbus Latinoamericana (the contractor which is presently carrying
out the port works at San Lorenzo) to execute them as an extension to the
ongoing contract. Since the new work would be similar to, and about 33%
of, the work in the current contract, ENP's proposal is practicable and would
result in the facilities being ready earlier than would be the case if new
bids were invited. It is doubtful if international contractors would be
interested in the new bid, not only because of the modest size of the contract
(estimated cost US$3.1 million), but also because of the effective competition
which Columbus Latinoamericana is in a position to offer due to its being
already on the site. Since the current contract with Columbus Latinoamericana
was awarded in 1975 on the basis of international competitive bidding, and the
prices applicable thereto would provide the basis for the prices for the new
contract, the Bank has accepted ENP's proposal, on condition that the terms
of the revised contract would be satisfactory to the Bank. Agreement in this
regard was reached during negotiations. It was also agreed during negotia-
tions that ENP would not sign the contract for the construction of additional
facilities at San Lorenzo unless an agreement satisfactory to the Bank has
been obtained from the sugar companies (para 4.20) guaranteeing a minimum
tonnage of sugar and molasses traffic and payment therefor of tariffs as
would be established by ENP from time to time to achieve the financial
objective of earning a minimum return of 8% on revalued assets (para 5.13).

I. Disbursements
3.17      A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 3.4.  This
is based on a provisional project implementation program (see bar chart
presented as Table 3.3) drawn up to coincide with the schedule startup of the
Corocito sawmill by end 1979 and the export of sugar and molasses by March
1978. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the implementation
schedule. Disbursements would extend over a period of four years and would be
made against 49% of total expenditures for civil works at Puerto Castilla and
at San Lorenzo, 60% of total expenditures for consultancy services and tech-
nical assistance and 100% of foreign expenditures for all equipment and craft.
Upon completion of the project, any savings in the loan might be used with the
approval of the Bank for procurement of equipment items or services similar to
those included in the project. Failing such approval, they would be cancelled.
J. Technical Assistance
3.18      During negotiations, agreement was reached with ENP that, in the
case of the consultants for the San Lorenzo channel depth study and for
training in container operations, the qualifications and experience, the
terms of reference and the terms of appointment would be satisfactory to
the Bank.
K. Uncertainties in the Project
3.19      Possible factors that could delay the startup of the proposed
sawmill at Corocito constitute the main uncertainties associated with the
project, e.g. (a) slow pr,:e-ss in the arrangements for management, finan-
cing, engineering, supply and erection of the sawmill and (b) the necessary
road infrastructure not being ready in time. With regard to (a), preparatory
work has already been started. The Government of Honduras has clearly assigned
a high priority to the forest industries project, and a high level committee
has been appointed under the chairmanship of COHDEFOR to coordinate and take
followup action with the various agencies involved in the project. An expat-
riate senior executive from IDB has been seconded to help COHDEFOR in expedit-
ing the project. Design of the sawmills is now proceeding on schedule. A
critical path network covering all the important elements of the project has
been prepared and is being followed closely. Financing for the sawmills will
be provided principally with suppliers' credits and additional contributions
by IDB, VIF, IFC, the Government, and private sources. Preliminary discussions
have begun with a number of bilateral export finance agencies. Financial
arrangements are expected to be concluded by September 1977.



- 30 -
3.20      With regard to the road infrastructure, item (b), the two aspects
causing some concern are related to constraints of executive capacity and
availability of suitable contractors. The road infrastructure required to
connect the port at Castilla, the sawmills at Corocito, Pueblo Viejo and
La Union and the pine woods around El Carbon (Map IBRD 12462) forms part of a
highway project which was appraised by IDB in September 1976. Involving an
investment of over US$60.0 million in the next five years, this project would
nearly double the country's annual road construction program during the period.
Such an increase would severely strain the executive capacity of MCOPT, espe-
cially since it would have to implement the forestry road works (being fi-
nanced by IDB) at about the same time as the Talanga-Catacamas highway, which
has recently been appraised by the Bank (Seventh Highway Project). To meet
the execution needs of both these projects, MCOPT has expanded an existing
"executing unit" and established a new one, each comprising three engineers
and two administrators. In order to attract available qualified personnel for
the units, salaries higher than those paid to civil service personnel are
being offered by MCOPT, which receives a special budgetary allocation for the
purpose. With these arrangements, the execution of both the highway projects
can be expected to proceed satisfactorily. As for the availability of suit-
able contractors, it is understood that COHDEFOR has received letters from 15
foreign firms expressing interest in bidding for the forestry roadworks. This
would indicate a reasonable prospect of timely completion of the necessary
road infrastructure.
3.21      Since the usefulness of the proposed port facilities at Castilla is
dependent to a very large extent upon the supporting road system, agreement
was reached with ENP during negotiations that the bids for the port works at
Castilla would be invited only after satisfactory bids have been received
for the road works.
L. Retroactive Financing
3.22      In order to meet the tentative schedule for completing the port works
at Castilla by end 1979, work on the detailed engineering of the project has
already been started. Because of the possibility of utilizing with advantage
the services of a dredging contractor (which would be financed by ENP), who is
scheduled to complete a job in Corinto in the latter half of 1977, ENP has
also begun the channel depth study at San Lorenzo. ENP wishes the foreign
costs incurred on engineering services to be financed retroactively, and such
retroactive financing is recommended for an estimated foreign expenditure up
to US$500,000 to be incurred on consultant services for engineering and
technical assistance after November 1,1976.

M. Ecological Considerations
3.23      Since no dirtv or dusty cargoes would be handled at either of the
project ports and since the usual precautions would be taken in handling the
small quantities of petroleum at Puerto Castilla, there would be no adverse
effect upon the ecologv due to the port development proposed under this project.
The ecoloe,cal implications of the sawmills and the paper and pulp factory have
been considered by the Government and IDB, and suitable features and processes
for controlling air and water pollution would be included in the design.

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Puerto Castilla
(i) The Economy of the Hinterland
4.01.     The basic hinterland of Puerto Castilla is the northeastern quadrant
of the country, which is dominated by the Aguan River Valley and the northern
portion of the Olancho forestry reserve. These areas will generate the bulk
of the traffic for the proposed new port. The forestry development strategy
of the country is keyed to the proposed pulp and paper mill at Corocito in the
lower Aguan Valley, and the port is only one of numerous infrastructure
elements for the forestry development scheme. The Aguan Valley is considered
by agriculturalists to be the richest agricultural resource in the country
(comparable to the Sula Valley), and the crop production in the valley is
being organized along cooperative lines for export as well as domestic use.
(ii) Traffic Projections
4.02      At present, there is no port facility and no traffic at Puerto
Castilla. Future traffic for the proposed port is made up of forestry exports
(sawn timber, wood chips, and eventually paper), Aguan Valley exports (palm
oil, citrus fruits, maize, and beans), and imported inputs to the agricultural
and forestry development projects (chemicals, fertilizer, machinery and petro-
leum). Table 4.1 gives a detailed breakdown of the traffic projection.
4.03      The current COHDEFOR program indicates that forestry exports are to
commence in 1980 with 124,000 tons of wood chips and 43,000 tons of sawn tim-
ber produced by the mill at Corocito. With the mills at Pueblo Viejo and La
Union expected to go into production in 1981 and 1982, the forestry exports
expand to 643,000 tons of chips and 221,000 tons of sawn timber in 1983. In
1984, the pulp and paper mill is to begin operation, and, by 1985, chip exports
will have ceased and been replaced by exports of liner board. Allowing for
approximately one-third of the liner board production for domestic use as
banana packing material, 1985 exports of forestry products are projected at
235,000 tons of sawn timber and 133,000 tons of liner board, a level that is
expected to be sustained indefinitely.
4.04      The Institute for National Agrarian Reform (INA) bases its projec-
tions for the Aguan Valley on plantation crops already planted and acreage
planned under its second stage development program, for which financing has
been obtained. In addition to the citrus fruits and African palm oil, INA
has projected an exportable surplus of 51,500 tons of corn and beans annually,
beginning in 1980. Palm oil exports are to begin in 1981 with 7,000 tons, in-
creasing to 31,100 tons in 1986. The main agricultural export crop of citrus
fruits is to commence in 1982 with 14,500 tons, expanding rapidly to 222,200
tons in 1986. Of a total export tonnage of 672,800 tons in 1986, almost 45%
would be Aguan Valley agricultural exports with 55% forestry and paper exports.



- 37 -
4.05      Import flows were estimated by the consultants based on the input
requirements for the agricultural and forestry projects. Chemicals and fer-
tilizer imports increase from 10,000 tons in 1980 to 46,000 tons in 1986;
machinery and equipment increase from 22,000 tons to 39,000 tons for the
same period. Petroleum imports are projected to increase from 6,000 tons in
1980 to 24,000 tons in 1986. Total import flows are projected to reach a
level of 122,000 tons by 1986.  Thus, of a total tonnage flow of 79::,000 tons
in 1986, 122,000 tons, or 15% of the total, will be import tonnage, leading
to a large directional imbalance of flows.
4.06      Traffic projections are usually the highest risk element in a project
analysis, and, when no traffic currently exists as is the case here, the un-
certainty is even greater. For this reason, the traffic includes only those
items that were based on firm development programs supported by adequate
finance. Other types of traffic are almost certain to be generated by the
existence of a port facility at Puerto Castilla. In particular, exports based
on the substantial hardwood reserves in the area, such as rail sleepers, ply-
wood, and furniture parts, are likely candidates, but firm plans are not yet
available. Sugar exports from the Aguan Valley and banana exports from the
Isleta area are other cases of likely but not yet certain traffic and were not
considered. The port requirements consider only reasonably firm traffic
through 1986. However, the economic analysis is extended beyond that period,
holding 1986 traffic levels constant for purposes of computation.
(iii) Capacity Requirements
4.07      The capacity requirements for Puerto Castilla were based on the
traffic projections in TabLe 4.1 and on reasonable assumptions concerning the
average cargo size, loading and discharge rates, and ship size. These assump-
tions are given in Table 4.2. A queuing analysis was then conducted to esti-
mate annual ship waiting times for various numbers of berths, and the value of
this waiting time was compared with the annual cost of providing a new berth.
A US$5.0 million berth with a 25-year useful life has an annualized cost of
US$637,500, using a 12% discount rate. The cost of a waiting ship is currently
estimated at US$6,000 per day. When waiting time costs exceed the cost of a
new berth and other aspects of the port operation are adequate, an extra berth
is justified. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 4.3. In
order to provide economic levels of service with tolerable congestion, a 450 m
wharf is required in the third year of operation (1982) and would be adequate
until the seventh year of operation (1986), at which time a second stage
addition would be required. A 300 m wharf would suffice for the first two
years, but the addition of a third berth, 150 m long, during the initial
construction period, precludes having to let a contract for the third berth
almost as soon as the first two are completed and avoids the interference in
port operations due to construction. It also provides buffer capacity to
allow for lower than forecast loading and discharge rates during the initial
organization. Finally, it provides adequate wharf for six years of operation
for a relatively small increment of investment. The 450 m facility and its
cost is the basic development considered in the economic analysis.



- 38 -
(iv) Rate of Return Analysis
4.08      Large investments have already been made in the Aguan Valley in
agricultural development and more are planned. Over US$100 million are
committed to the first stage of the forestry project. Implicit to these
commitments is the assumption that the exports of agricultural and forest
products are economically viable. In this sense, the port (and the road
infrastructure) is justified as part of a larger package of investments. In
this case, there are two large and independent investment schemes, together
generating almost a million tons of traffic annually--traffic that will make
use of the port facility. The fundamental economic issue is whether the
agricultural and forestry development programs are economically viable, and
the question has been settled already both by formal economic and financial
analyses and by basic social and political decisions. IDB and IFC have each
reviewed the basic scheme for the forestry development project and are
supporting it. The task for the economic analysis herein is to provide a
least cost solution for the required port infrastructure, i.e., the optimal
location, timing, and size of the port facility. This exercise, together with
the determination of an appropriate port tariff structure that will generate
revenues to cover the full cost of the port, will indicate that the investment
is justified.
4.09      The nearby banana piers at La Ceiba and Tela are not realistic al-
ternatives for traffic of the magnitude and characteristics considered. The
narrow wooden piers served by narrow gauge rail preclude truck turning opera-
tions, and the exposed location leads to interrupted service during stormy
weather. Depth and dredging are also serious constraints. The closest pier
at La Ceiba is structurally inadequate and could not be depended on to serve
without major investments in a new facility. The only realistic alternative
to Puerto Castilla is an expansion of Puerto Cortes, approximately 450 km
to the west. This would mean trucking the exports over relatively long
distances. Offsetting this cost would be a less costly investment at Puerto
Cortes, which is already a well developed port with room for expansion, and
additional highway investments. The "do nothing" alternative, therefore, is
to use Puerto Cortes as the outlet for export flows. In doing so, it is
necessary to consider if this is a realistic alternative, i.e., would the
exports be profitable with the extra domestic transport cost. For wood
chips--a bulky, low value commodity which sells for approximately US$50 per
ton FOB on the world market--the extra cost of trucking to Puerto Cortes is
estimated at US$11.0 per ton, or 22% of the FOB price. Ocean freight charges
to Europe and Japan raise the price to about US$100 CIF, and the extra over-
land transport cost becomes 11% of the CIF price. This could be a significant
factor in the export decision and would be equally important for commodities
such as beans and maize, but does not exclude the possibility of such exports.
For high value commodities such as sawn timber, paper, and citrus fruits,
trucking to Puerto Cortes would be a viable alternative.
4.10      The center of the Aguan Valley production is Tocoa, 61 km by road
from Puerto Castilla and 389 km from Puerto Cortes, a difference of 328 km.
The mill at Corocito is 41 km from Puerto Castilla and 409 km from. Puerto
Cortes, a difference of 368 km.  The produietion of the La Union and Pueblo



- 39 -
Viejo sawmills travels an extra 260 km to get to Puerto Cortes instead of
Puerto Castilla. The average economic cost net of taxes for trucking over the
roads in question is estimated at L 0.066/ton-km, assuming trucks of nine-ton
capacity and 50% two-way load factors. The savings attributable to the con-
struction of Puerto Castilla are estimated by the reduced cost of overland
domestic transport, as indicated in Table 4.4.
4.11      Puerto Cortes currently has 876 meters of reinforced concrete wharf
in good condition, providing space for seven to eight ships at one time. Con-
sidering the proposed installation of a container crane in the near future,
and the rising trend of Ro-Ro and LASH operations, the port has adequate
capacity for its projected traffic until 1990 if high productivity rates are
achieved. If the new traffic from the Aguan Valley and the sawmills were to
be diverted to Puerto Cortes, the port could handle it with no more than a
150 m berth extension, equipment and warehousing by 1982 at a cost of L 14.0
million. Puerto Castilla, in order to provide equivalent service at acceptable
levels of congestion, would require 450 m of wharf with equipment and buildings
costing L 37.2 million. The cost of operating and maintaining the incremental
investment at Puerto Cortes would be less than that for the Puerto Castilla
facility since there would be some scale economies with having one large port
rather than two smaller facilities, and these costs are considered in the
analysis. The use of Puerto Cortes would also avoid some investments in urban
infrastructure that will eventually have to be made at Puerto Castilla. This,
however, will be gradual because adequate urban infrastructure now exists at
the town of Trujillo, 20 km from Puerto Castilla, which is situated on the
same bay and will initially serve as the headquarters for constructing and
operating the new port. Investments in relocating the village and school at
Puerto Castilla from the proposed port area have already been made, and the
area is clear for future development.
4.12      The road infrastructure investment for the Puerto Castilla alter-
native is more costly than the Puerto Cortes alternative since a 41-km paved
road must be constructed from Corocito to Puerto Castilla at a cost of L 23.2
million (IBRD Map 12462). This cost can be avoided if the traffic moves out
through Puerto Cortes. However, the Saba-La Ceiba road would require an
investment of L 12.2 million to upgrade it from gravel to paved in order to
handle the high traffic volumes (on the order of 400 trucks per day) that would
be moving to Puerto Cortes. The net road infrastructure investment required
with the use of Puerto Castilla is, therefore, L 11.0 million.
4.13      The cost streams considered in the rate of return analysis are
the investment required to make Puerto Castilla operational, and the required
maintenance and operating costs. This information is given in Table 4.5. The
benefit streams are the avoided road transport costs as given in Table 4.4 and
the avoided investment, maintenance, and operating costs associated with the
use of Puerto Cortes.
4.14      The cost and benefit streams in Table 4.5 yield a rate of return of
27%, with first year benefits of 25%, indicating that the project is well
justified and appropriately timed. A sensitivity analysis in which the
cost and benefit streams are varied by 25% yields a rate of return no lower



- 40 -
than 22%. In addition, consideration was given to the possibility that the
pulp and paper mill of the second stage of the forestry project might not
come into production in 1984 as planned. Under these circumstances, chip
exports would continue at the high 1983 level instead of being replaced by a
smaller tonnage of paper exports. The benefits of avoiding road transport
for chips are higher than those associated with paper, and the effect of
continuing chip exports would be to increase the rate of return for the port
project. The proximity of Puerto Castilla to the source of the export
traffic is so advantageous that no reasonable combination of circumstances
raises any doubt regarding its justification.
B. San Lorenzo
(i) The Economy of the Hinterland
4.15      Historically, the hinterland of San Lorenzo port has been the area
south of Tegucigalpa, where the major agricultural areas are the Choluteca and
Danli valleys. The water resources in this area are so limited that nothing
equivalent to the Sula Valley production and the port capacity of Puerto Cortes
on the Caribbean coast is likely to develop. The construction of the Tegucigalpa-
Talanga-Juticalpa road to the northeast timber areas allowed the development of
export traffic of sawn timber through the port, and this has constituted the
major traffic flow in recent years. With a good road now joining Puerto Cortes
on the Caribbean with San Lorenzo on the Pacific, traffic feeding onto this
north-south road can choose either port, depending on trucking costs, the ulti-
mate destination of the goods, the depth of water desired, and specialized re-
quirements such as warehousing, handling equipment, and commercial services.
(ii) Traffic Projections
4.16      At present, the old port of San Lorenzo is essentially a lumber ex-
port outlet. In 1976, over 130,000 tons of sawn timber are expected to be
exported with a slow and costly shallow draft lighter operation. Eleven thou-
sand tons of minor exports will raise the total export figure to 141,000 tons.
In the same year, general cargo imports (fertilizer, chemicals, machinery) are
expected to amount to 41,400 tons, bringing the total cargo flow to 172,400
tons (Table 4.6). Cargo flows at San Lorenzo have not grown as was expected
at the time of the appraisal of the Second Port Project (Loan No. 767-HO) in
1971. Lumber traffic is about 55,000 tons per year less than original expec-
tations (Table 4.7), and the disruption of the cotton growing industry after
the war with El Salvador has adversely affected the export of cotton.
4.17      Expectation for future traffic levels at San Lorenzo am* based on
past traffic levels, the future timber harvest patterns in Honduras, and ad-
vanced plans for a sugar and molasses export industry in the region south of
Tegucigalpa. Lumber exports are expected to decrease gradually from the
current level of 130,000 tons to 100,000 tons in 1983 and to stabilize at
that level (Table 4.6). This reflects the recent analysis of timber harvest



- 41 -
patterns and traffic flows in Honduras carried out in connection with the
Central American Transport Study (ECAT). General cargo traffic, which has
been nearly constant at 40,000 tons in recent years (Table 4.7) is expected
to grow at 4% annually, reflecting the sensitivity of this commodity flow to
avoidance of the current lighter operation. The total general cargo flow in
1968 would then be about 62,000 tons (Table 4.6). Two items of additional
traffic which are possible but yet uncertain have not been taken into account:
these are lumber from the northwestern region of Nicaragua, for which San
Lorenzo would be a nearer outlet than Corinto, and profitable cotton exports,
the revival of which is being actively considered by Government.
4.18      The sugar traffic is based upon recently revised regional estimates
of sugar production, domestic consumption, and resulting export surpluses,
for 1980. The current industry estimates are shown below in short tons.
Region              Production        Local Consumption       Export Surplus
North (3 mills)           138,000              37,500                100,500
Central (2 mills)          47,500              47,500                   -
South (2 mills)            82,500                -                    82,500
Total                     268,000              85,000                183,000
With 1975 production levels at 87,790 short tons and domestic consumption at
76,790 tons, the exportable surplus for the country was only 11,000 tons.  The
Hondurans plan to triple production in five years, yielding an export surplus
in 1980 of 183,000 tons. This would involve constructing four new mills and
expanding the capacity of the existing three mills. All of the mills are
under construction and near completion. It is, however, the cane production
to feed these mills that involves considerable planning and cooperation since
approximately half the cane is to come from Government cooperatives and
independent farmers. With all of the mills due for full production in 1979,
plans for cane production are well advanced but are being implemented in
stages in order not to overproduce before crushing capacity is available.
Efforts so far have led to an estimated 30,000 tons of sugar exports for 1977
(three times the level of 1975 exports), with only the expansion of one of the
northern mills in the Sula Valley. To avoid the use of expensive overland
transport, export surpluses of the north will use Puerto Cortes, while those
of the south will use San Lorenzo. The two centrally located mills will serve
the domestic market exclusively, but will receive export earnings relative to
their share of total national production.
4.19      The two mills in the south that will generate traffic for San
Lorenzo are located in the highest yielding cane area of the country. The
small (20,000 short tons per year) mill at Choluteca has been in production for
10 years and has organized its cane production. It is to be expanded to a
25,000-ton capacity. The biggest investment in the south involves the 70,000
tons of Azucarera Central S.A. (ACENSA). The mill is under construction and
scheduled for completion by the end of 1977. To produce at capacity, this mill
requires about 7,200 hectares of new cane production. The ACENSA mill has
already planted 2,800 hectares of the required area under its own control.



- 42 -
Independent large farmers are planting an additional 560 hectares. ACENSA is
also negotiating an additional 1,050 hectares with the independent farmers.
The Institute for National Agrarian Reform (INA) has agreed to provide 2,800
hectares for the 1980 crop. So far, 420 hectares have been prepared for the
1978 crop. This means that slightly more than half the required cane acreage
for the ACENSA mill has been prepared and planted, a considerable achievement.
For this analysis, it has been assumed that the cane production targets will
not be fully achieved, and that the ACENSA mill will utilize only 60,000
short tons of its capacity by 1980. Similarly, the Choluteca mill is assumed
to expand its production from the current 20,000 tons to 22,500 tons by 1980,
hence, the forecast of 82,500 short tons of production and exports from the
southern mills. It has been further assumed that 6,000 short tons of this
production will be required for domestic consumption in the immediate Choluteca
area, leaving an export surplus of 76,500 short tons, or 68,800 metric tons,
to be moved through the port of San Lorenzo. In addition, 44,500 metric tons
of molasses from the southern mills and one of the central mills is expected
to use San Lorenzo, and these are the basic figures used in the forecast.
4.20      It is clear that the Hondurans are making a major effort to increase
sugar exports, and the first results of that effort are already apparent in
1977. By 1980, a relatively large amount of raw sugar for export will be
available and the profitability of the exports in view of the current world
surplus and low prices is an important consideration for the future. The
current view of commodity experts is that the next two years will be a period
of excess supplies and low prices which will force the high cost producers
(mainly the U.S. and European countries) to use their farm land for other more
profitable crops. Low cost producers can then capture a permanently larger
share of the world market if they have the capacity to do so. The Honduran
expansion of exports is well timed in this sense, and commodity experts feel
that any country that can produce raw sugar at costs of USJ 12 per pound in
constant 1974 prices should be able to compete in the world market. Honduran
producers estimate that their exports will be profitable at USJ 10.5 per pound
FOB and thus are well within the cost range of countries with an absolute
advantage in the medium and long term. The southern sugar producers have
formed an association for purposes of exporting their surpluses and have
contracted with a large international firm (Mitsubishi of New York) to provide
technical advice and to serve as their marketing agent.  Because the southern
production is close to San Lorenzo and some is expected to go to Japan, the
producers have requested that facilities be provided at San Lorenzo. The
sugar producers have offered to guarantee ENP a minimum tonnage of exports, at
yet to be negotiated tariffs, in order to justify the provision of storage and
handling facilities. The first exports are scheduled to take place in 1978
with 26,700 tons of molasses and 41,000 tons of sugar, reaching levels of
44,500 tons and 68,850 tons respectively in 1980 and continuing at this level
(Table 4.6). A complication of the sugar and molasses traffic lies in its
seasonal nature, i.e., all of the exports are to take place during a six-month
period between March and September. The projections in Table 4.6 are broken
down into peak and off-peak traffic in order to consider this factor in the
capacity analysis.



- 43 -
(iii) Capacity Requirements
4.21      The facility currently under construction at San Lorenzo can handle
three types of vessel; it can service ships drawing up to 7 m at the front
face of the L shaped berth; it can also service ships drawing up to 6 m at the
inside face of the L, and it can handle shallow draft lighters at the insidK-
face. The most recent statistics available indicate that 65% of the ships
calling at Amapala-San Lorenzo have actual drafts less than 7 m; 35% have
drafts greater than 7 m and must offload onto lighters even after the current
construction is completed.  The net effect on actual cargoes would be that 20%
of the general cargo and lumber traffic would have to be handled at Amapala
and be lightered to and from the new facility at San Lorenzo and could use the
inside berth of the pier. In addition, another 20% of lumber and general
cargo carried in coasters could use the inner face of the pier together with
the barges. Thus, 40% of the lumber and general cargo could load or offload
at the inner berth, leaving the outer berth to handle 60% of the lumber and
general cargo and all of the sugar and molasses. This is the basic pattern
assumed in the capacity analys.s, although a check was made to explore the
implication of having only 20% of lumber and general cargo at the inside face
should vessel drafts be adj1:sted to take advantage of the alongside berthing
which would be available at the outer face of the new facility.
4.22      A queuing analysis was performed on the outer berth of the new L
shaped pier, assuming it would handle 60% of the lumber and dry cargo flows
and all of the molasses and sugar traffic. The analysis was done for both the
peak and off-peak periods, using the ship and cargo characteristics set forth
in Table 4.8. The basic tradeoff in the queuing analysis involves a comparison
of the annual cost of ship waiting time at US$5,000 per day and the annualized
cost of a US$3.0 million berth, which is US$382,500 per year (at 12% for 25
years). The summary of the analysis is provided in Table 4.9. This analysis
indicates that, during the first year (1978),sugar and molasses exports would
require an ad itional berth since the berth occupancy in the peak period would
be 51%, yielding an average waiting time per ship of 1.6 days, costing a total
of US$405,000 per year, more than the annual cost if an additional berth. With
one more berth in 1978, the occupancy rate drops to 25% in peak periods with
average ship waiting times of 0.1 days costing only US$27,000 per year in
waiting costs. In 1980, when the sugar and molasses traffic reaches its
long-term level, the occupancy rate without an additional berth would be as
high as 62%, producing average ship waiting times of 2.7 days and costing
US$822,000 per year, when the annual cost of an additional berth would be less
than half the congestion costs. The addition of a berth reduces the average
ship waiting time in 1980 to 0.2 days, an adequate level of service. If 80%
rather than 60% of lumber and general cargo should make use of the deeper side
of the pier, the two outer berths would still be adequate for the traffic.
Thus, the second outer berth is required in the first year of sugar and
molasses exports in 1978 and would be adequate for the forseeable future.

(iv) Rate of Return Analysis
4.23      If a second berth, together with storage and handling facilities,
is not provided at San Locenzo, the sugar and molasses traffic would have to
divert to the nearest port with adequate facilities. Export through Corinto in
Nicaragua is the lowest cost technically acceptable alternative.  The extra
cost of using Coriqto wourl involve an additional road haul of 107 km and
storage and -,,-,fage charges.  These costs could be avoided by investing in
the additional facilities at San Lorenzo and by incurring the cost of oper-
ating and maintaining the new facility. The cost streams associated with the
economic analysis are therefore the investment costs and operating and mainte-
nance costs for a new berth at San Lorenzo (Table 4.10). The benefit streams
are the value of avoided road transport costs of sugar and molasses to Corinto,
together with ship waiting time saving for general cargo ships having access
to two berths rather than one berth at San Lorenzo. The avoided charges for
the use of the Corinto facilities constitute the third major benefit stream
(Table 4.10).
4.24      Trucking costs for sugar are based on a 9 ton vehicle with economic
operating costs of L .27 per vehicle-kilometer. With a 60% two way load
factor, the cost per ton-km is L .05. The additional distance required to use
Corinto is 107 km, so that the extra cost per ton to truck sugar to Corinto is
L 5.35 per ton, approximately 1% of the expected FOB price of sugar. For
molasses, which must use tank trucks with 50% two-way load factors, the extra
cost is L 6.42 per ton.
4.25      A second berth at San Lorenzo greatly improves the service times of
lumber and general cargo ships in both the peak and off-peak periods since two
berth facilities have inherently superior queuing characteristics to single
berth facilities with half the traffic.  The reduction in ship waiting time
for general cargo and lumber ships is therefore a major potential benefit for
the second berth.
4.26      If it is assumed that ship waiting time benefits are fully captured
by Honduras, then the cost and benefit streams in Table 4.10 yield an internal
rate of return of 14% with first year benefits of 14%. Even if only half the
ship time savings accrue to Hondurans, the rate of return would be 12%. A
25% variation in the cost and benefit streams in Table 4.10 yields a rate of
return no lower than 10%, even without any allowance being made for the
potential traffic of cotton and Nicaraguan lumber (para. 4.17). The invest-
ment is thus justified and well timed.
4.27      Although Corinto in Nicaragua is a possible alternative for export
of sugar and molasses produced in southern Honduras, the political and insti-
tutional feasibility of using that port is by no means clear. If the "do
nothing" alternative is to haul the sugar 400 km by truck to Puerto Cortes (as
the Guatemalans do to Santo Tomas) on the Atlantic then the rate of return
rises to approximately 17% based on avoided trucking costs alone.

V.   FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      ENP is a financially autonomous legal entity.  Under its charter,
which was drawn up in consultation with the Bank and became effective on
December 1, 1965, it has authority to enter into contracts and borrow money;
to sue and be sued; to control its revenues, expenses, and budgets; to retain
its net income and to maintain funded reserves, as required. It is not subject
to income or other taxes and pays no regular or fixed dividends to the Govern-
ment, but its Board may authorize transfers to the Government at any time.
This has been done on several occasions in the form of cash, materials, equip-
ment and services other than port services. Central to ENP's relationships
with the Government are the composition of ENP's Board and the position of the
Minister of Economy and Finance as its chairman (para. 2.04). ENP's financial
policies and procedures are generally acceptable to the Bank.
5.02      A summary of the principal tariff items is shown in Table 5.1.  Most
of the present tariffs have been in effect slnce 1970, with the following
exceptions: (a) pilotage and tugboat rates were increased in 1975 and 1976,
and (b) port dues and dockage charges were substantially increased in February
1977. This latter adjustment provided ENP with its first increase in real
terms since 1970, and, in addition, it was a major step in rationalizing the
structure of shlp-related tariffs. No further increase in overall tariffs is
expected at this time (para. 5.13); however, ENP should take action to adjust
the structure of tariffs so that they relate more closely to costs, as soon as
the necessary data are available (para. 5.06).
5.03      The accounting procedures employed by ENP are generally sound, but
improvements have been needed for some time, particularly since the addition
of the ports of Tela, La Ceiba and Amapala/Henecan to the jurisdiction of ENP
on January 1, 1974. The need for improvements has been increased by the
actual commencement of port construction at San Lorenzo, the development of a
free trade zone at Cortes, and the prospective construction of the project
port at Castilla. Therefore, during negotiations, it was agreed that ENP
will:
(a)  establish separate accounts for ENP headquarters;
(b)  establish separate accounts for major development projects;
and
(c)  segregate within all accounts, as appropriate, port and non-
port expenses and investments.
5.04      The accounts are audited annually by Price Waterhouse and Company;
the annual audited accounts and the auditor's report are forwarded to the
Bank within four months of the end of the year.

5.05      Section 5.04 (a) of the Loan Agreement of June 25, 1971 (Second
Port Project) states that the purpose of establishing cost-related rates is
to ensure that port revenues are sufficient to enable ENP to earn a return
of not less than 8% on the current value of net fixed assets in operation.
The last revaluation, for Puerto Cortes only, was carried out at the end of
1968. All ENP's assets, including land, are now being revalued. During
negotiations, it was agreed that this revaluation would be completed not later
than October 1, 1977 and that, at least once every three years thereafter, ENP
would further revalue its assets in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
5.06      The establishment of cost finding procedures, separate from account-
ing, was begun in May 1976 with the assistance of an expert from UNCTAD. A
costing section was established on June 1, 1976 and initially staffed with
three qualified accountants. Documentation is under preparation for the
systematic collation of accounting and operating data needed for costing, but
is not presently available. ENP has recently hired a consultant cost account-
ing specialist to assist in refining the costing procedures. It was agreed
during negotiations that, not later than October 1, 1977 a complete costing
system, acceptable to the Bank, would be implemented.
B.   Past Financial Performance
5.07      Detailed, audited financial statements for ENP as a whole, for the
years between 1971 and 1975, are summarized below, with an estimate for 1976.
It can be seen that net income was substantial during this period, increasing
by 41%; operating revenues increased by 70%, or L 4.4 million. The slower
growth in net income reflects a 150% increase in expenses in three years. As
a result, the operating ratio, while still satisfactory at 63%, exhibited a
steady increase from 44% in 1970. Interest coverage was never less than four
times (in 1973) and was 6.0 times in 1975. The financial rate of return on
net fixed assets was above 20% in all years up to 1975, when it declined to
17%. While these figures are satisfactory as stated, they are somewhat
inflated because no provision was made for revaluation of assets (para. 5.05).

5.08      ENP's financial position through the 1971-1975 period was sound.
By the end of 1975, it had L 3.6 million in working capital and another
L 3.6 million in liquid investments. In spite of a 90% increase in total
assets between 1971 and 1975, which required cumulative borrowing of over
L 11 million, debt increased only from 35% to 44% of total capitalization.
During that time, L 8.3 million of the total L 11 million earned by ENP was
retained for investment.
C.   Methodology of Financial Analysis
5.09      ENP prepares separate annual statements and financial projections
for each of its ports as well as consolidated statements for the combined
ports of ENP as a whole. The latter, which determine ENP's financing plan,
will be the focus of the present analysis. In addition, the financial fore-
casts for the two ports included in the present project will be discussed in
this section.
5.10      The forecasts are in current Lempiras and cover the period from
1977 to 1983. For the new port at Castilla, this provides four full years of
operation, and, for San Lorenzo, it provides five full years.
5.11      Some of the more important factors used in the financial analysis
were obtained as follows (more detail is included in the project file):
(a)  Revenues:  Projected revenues were developed using the Bank's
port traffic forecasts. The current tariff rates shown in
Table 5.1 were used to develop projected revenues generated
by the traffic from 1977 onward. While tariffs will be
restructured (para. 5.02), this is not expected to signifi-
cantly affect ENP's total revenues covering all ports.
However, in the case of the two project ports, which will
essentially handle export traffic, restructuring of tariffs
is assumed to further increase revenues by 20%, since, under
the present tariffs, export traffic is not fully charged.
(b)  Operating Costs:  The major expenditure in this item covers
personnel costs, wages, salaries and benefits. These fore-
casts are based on a detailed estimate of manpower require-
ments at each port, developed on the basis of forecast
traffic levels. The wage levels are calculated on the basis
of the term of the agreement recently signed by ENP with the
Employee's Union for a three-year period ending mid-1979 and
an average rate of increase of 10% per year thereafter.
Material, services and maintenance are assumed to increase
in line with projected traffic levels and the Bank's forecast
rate of world inflation. Insurance costs are consistent
with the increasing value of facilities, and depreciation is
calculated on a straight line basis using revalued assets.



- 58 -
Interest costs are based on the rates applying to current
loans and on allowance of 8.5% interest cost on the proposed
Bank group financing.
(c)  The financial forecasts include the effect of revaluations
of fixed assets from 1977 onward. As noted in paragraph
5.05, no recent revision of asset values has been carried
out. Therefore, for the purposes of this forecast, book
asset values were increased by 30% in 1977 based on
information provided by ENP. From 1978 onward, the fixed
asset values were increased by 7% per annum, reflecting
projected increases in Honduran construction costs.
(d) Other Items
(i) Increases in working capital are assumed to follow
income and expenditure levels.
(ii) Issued capital is forecast to remain at the current
level, and all future earnings up to 1980 are assumed
to be retained by ENP.
(iii) An Eximbank loan of L 4.1 million, obtained by ENP in
1976 for container-handling equipment, will be retired
over eight years.
(iv) Additional financing will be provided by 7% tax-free
bonds, which are assumed to be repaid on maturity after
10 years. It was agreed during negotiations that the
terms of the bond issue will be satisfactory to the
Bank and that the Government will underwrite it.
(v)   It is assumed that the IDA credit and the Third
Window loan will be relent to ENP by the Government
on terms identical to those of the Bank loan to ENP
(8.5% interest and 20 years repayment including
four and one-half years of grace).
D.   Forecast Financial Performance
5.12      The financial forecasts, originally developed by ENP, have been
revised by Bank staff with this agreement. The income forecast is as follows:

(Figures in thousands of Lempiras)
Operating  Operating    Net       Interest    Net    Operating  Return    Debt
Year  Revenues   Expenses   Revenues    Cost    Income   Ratio (%)    %          Coverage
1977   18,582       9,402       9,180     3,274    5,883        51         21       2.5

1979   24,709      12,812      11,897     5,960    6,314        52         11       2.1
1980   29,177      15,720      13,457     6,875    7,241        54         10       2.3
1981   30,774      16,767      14,007     6,763    8,134        55         10       2.4
1982   32,276      17,779      14,497     6,469    9,136        55         10       2.1
1983   33,100      19,093      14,008     6,184    9,215        58         10       2.2
Operating revenues increase by over 150% in the period between 1976 and 1983,
while operating expenses increase by 240%. The substantial increase in
revenues reflects both traffic volume increases and the tariff adjustment
previously mentioned. In 1977, the first year in which the new tariffs apply,
the operating ratio drops to 57% from the high figure of 63% in 1976. The
most dramatic increase occurs in interest expense, which is 280% higher in
1980 than in 1976, a reflection of the increased use of borrowed funds to
finance the investment program of ENP in this period. Return on fixed assets
during the forecast period is expected to drop to 11.4% in 1978 as a result of
asset revaluation (para. 5.11(c)).
5.13      The financial projections in Table 5.2 show that the return on
revalued fixed assets in operations is forecast to stay above 8%, and, there-
fore, no further increases in tariffs are envisaged at this time. However, it
was agreed during negotiations that ENP will review and, if necessary, adjust,
the tariff structure not later than July 1, 1978, and from time to time there-
after, to reflect reasonably the cost of services and facilities and to yield
an annual rate of return of not less than 8% on the current value of net
operating fixed port assets.
E.   Balance Sheet
5.14      A summary of the projected consolidated balance sheet is shown in
Table 5.2. The figures indicate that ENP's financial position will weaken
during the period 1976-1979, while the major investments are occurring, and
will strengthen considerably by 1983. The most notable feature of the balance
sheet is the large increase in fixed assets made during the period to 1980.
By this time, net fixed assets increase by over 150%, or L 90 million, which
includes not only the cost of the expansion envisaged under this project, but
also that for the ongoing construction of the new port facilities at San
Lorenzo, the proposed container-handling facilities and the free zone at
Cortes as well as the effect of asset revaluation in 1977 and the compounded
effect thereafter.



- 60 -
5.15      The balance sheet projections indicate a substantial buildup of
current assets in the period after 1980 when ENP investments are assumed to
decline. By 1983, the amount of these surplus funds is over L 20 million.
Some of these funds will be required to repay the bond issue and it was
agreed during negotiations that ENP will set aside from its revenue surplus
each year an amount satisfactory to the Bank for the purpose of accumulating a
fund for the repayment of the bonds on maturity (para. 5.11(d)). The
remainder may be used to repay debt prematurely, to pay a dividend to the
Government or to make investments in facilities which are not foreseen at this
time.
5.16      As of December 31, 1975, outstanding long-term debts totalled L 22.3
million. By the future peak year 1978, the present debt is forecast to rise
by 270% to L 82.6 million and then to decline progressively to L 69 million in
1983. Debt service will rise by 300% to a peak of L 9.0 million in 1981. The
total cash generation in 1975, as adjusted after adding the effect of rate and
tariff adjustments in 1977, would be 76% of the maximum forecast (1981) debt
service, and the estimated 1976 total cash generation, similarly adjusted,
would be 94% of maximum future debt service. Under the terms of section
5.06 (a) of the Loan Agreement for Loan 767-HO, ENP is restricted from incur-
ring additional debt unless the cash generation, adjusted for tariff increases,
in the most recent 12-month period prior to increase of the debt, is at least
1.75 times the maximum debt service in any future year. It can be seen that
ENP will not be in compliance with this covenant and thus needs the Bank's
approval for the debts that are to be incurred for the proposed project.
ENP's inability to satisfy this covenant reflects the rapid growth that it
will experience over the next four years, and it is only when debt service is
compared with the respective forecast earnings in the year of the debt service
that the coverage ratio can be met. For instance, debt service is forecast to
be covered 2.4 times in 1981, the least favorable future year, and to improve
progressively thereafter. In addition, the least favorable debt/equity ratio
of 56/44 would occur in 1979 and progressively improve to 35/65 in 1983.
While, in 1979, the debt/equity ratio is high, it is acceptable in view of
the rapid and substantial improvement thereafter. The debt coverage ratio
also remains at a satisfactory level during the period, as can be seen in
the following tabulations:
Forecast Debt/Equity and Debt Coverage Ratios
1976    1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983
Debt/Equity  52/48   56/44   56/44   56/44   51/49   45/55   40/60   35/65
Debt Coverage  3.4      2.5      2.3     2.1      2.3     2.4      2.1     2.2
It is therefore recommended that the Bank make the debt related to the pro-
posed project an exception to the restriction under Section 5.06 (a) of the
Agreement for Loan 767-HO and allow the assumed borrowings to take place.



- 61 -
However, in order for the Bank to monitor any further borrowings, agreement
was reached during negotiations, to include, in the new loan conditions, the
same covenant as that in Section 5.06 of the agreement for Loan 767-HO.
F.   Financing Plan
5.17      The financing plan for the forecast period (1977-1983) is shown
belo,T.  Since the financing need arises mainly from the investments to be made
during the 1977-1979 period, a separate summary of the plan for these years
is shown.

Total                             53.5             70           57.3             58
It can be seen that cumulative investments in the period to 1983 are just over
L 98 million. Of this total, some 42% will be provided by internally generated
funds and the remaining 58% provided by borrowings. Of the total borrowings,
L 38.5 million, or 67%, will be provided by the Bank. Of this, L 4.5 million
represent funds that are yet to be disbursed under Loan 767-Ho, L 14.0 million
under the proposed Bank loan, L 10.0 million under another proposed Bank loan
on Third Window terms and L 10.0 million under a proposed IDA credit. Both
the IDA credit and the Third Window loan will be made to the Government, to be
relent to ENP. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government will
relend these funds to ENP on terms and conditions matching those of the pro-
posed Bank loan to ENP. The remaining ENP borrowings will be provided by a
bond issue commencing in 1977 (para. 5.11(d)).



- 62 -
5.18      As can be seen from ENP's Financing Plan (para. 5.17), L 39.5
million will be invested in non-project items. The major portion of these
funds will be spent on the ongoing construction at San Lorenzo under the
Bank's Second Port Project and the new Free Trade Zone at Puerto Cortes.
Because this latter investment, which is expected to amount to L 10.9 million,
is viewed by the Bank as being separate from port operations and in order to
ensure that the non-port operations do not become a financial burden on the
port operations, it was agreed during negotiations that (a) ENP will retain
each year an amount equivalent to 8% of net fixed assets for investment in
port services and facilities, (b) ENP will use 4ts best efforts to ensure
that non-port operations will be financially self-sufficient, and (c) ENP
will advise the Bank prior to any changes in port tariffs in order to afford
the Bank an opportunity to comment on increases which might not be related to
port operations. Further, in order to ensure a satisfactory cash flow, ENP
agreed that, during the execution of the project, capital expenditures for
items not included in the Second and Third Port Projects will not exceed
US$500,000 equivalent per annum without prior agreement with the Bank.
G.   Forecast of Project Ports
(i) Puerto Castilla
5.19      The income statement for this port is summarized below.  It can be
seen that the port should be profitable by 1980, the second year of operation,
and the return on net fixed assets should reach 8% by 1983.
