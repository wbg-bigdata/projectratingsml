TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO TIIE EMPRESA NACIONAL PORTUARIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
A PROPOSED LOAN AND AN IDA CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR
A THIRD PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on proposed loans
equivalent to US$12.0 million and a proposed development credit equivalent to
US$5.0 million to Honduras to help finance a Third Port Project. A loan of
US$7.0 million to the Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP) with the guarantee of
the Republic of Honduras would have a term of 20 years including 4 1/2 years
of grace with interest at 8.5 percent per annum. A loan of US$5.0 million to
the Republic of Honduras would be on standard Third Window terms with the
first payment due January 15, 1983 and the final payment on January 15, 2001.
The development credit would be on standard IDA terms. The Third Window loan
and the development credit would be relent to the Empresa Nacional Portuaria
on the same terms and conditions as the loan to the ENP.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Honduras"
(1165-HO) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 23, 1976. The
findings of the Report are summarized below, and a country data sheet is
attached as Annex I.
Development Prospects
3.        The long-run growth rate of the Honduran economy has been modest:
real GDP per capita grew at less than 1 percent per year between 1950 and
1975. With a per capita GNP of US$350 in 1975 (World Bank estimate), Honduras
is the poorest country in Central America and the majority of the population
lives on a subsistence income. A major reason for the poor growth performance
is the continued dependence of the economy on the production and export of a
few agricultural commodities, especially bananas, and thus on fluctuating
world market and weather conditions. This was illustrated dramatically when
substantial hurricane damage to the banana plantations in September 1974
reduced banana export volumes in 1975 to about half the level of previous
years. At the same time the recession in the developed world affected beef

November 11, 1976, for the Honduras Seventh Highway Project.

and lumber exports, and rising oil prices led to a severe deterioration in
Honduras' terms of trade. In early 1975, an emergency basic grains program
designed to offset the consequences of the hurricane destruction failed,
largely because of a drought. The result was two years of recession, with
real GDP stagnant in 1974 and 1975.
4.        There are many reasons for the continued dominance of bananas in the
Honduran economy. The resource base is small. Known mineral deposits are not
extensive. Land suitable for agriculture is available and the country has
sizeable forest resources, but because of a serious lack of basic infrastruc-
ture, and of deficient development policies in the past, these resources have
remained underutilized. Some progress has been made during the last two
decades, especially in the area of transport development, but the mountainous
topography of the country has made the expansion of the road network slow and
costly. This limits the size of the domestic market and hampers industrial
development. Honduras' participation in the Central American Common Market
(CACM) in the early 1960's was an attempt to gain access to a larger market
for its industry, but the process was halted by the conflict with El Salvador
in 1969. However, even while the expanded protected market of the CACM
lasted, Honduras did not receive the expected benefits, as it was unable to
compete with its neighbors in attracting new investments or developing new
industries. A further obstacle to economic development in Honduras is the
severe scarcity of entrepreneurial talent and the low productivity of the
labor force. About 50 percent of the adult population is illiterate and
nutrition and health standards are very deficient.
5.        The agricultural sector has accounted for about one-third of GDP
in the 1970's. While there is considerable potential for improving utiliza-
tion of resources and the productivity of the agricultural sector, uneven land
distribution and frequent underutilization of larger holdings have retarded
increases in productivity and resulted in considerable peasant unrest. The
Government recognizes that a correction of this situation is vital for the
future stable development of the country and, although hampered by a shortage
of competent personnel, it is making serious efforts to address the problem.
It began substantial land redistribution in 1973 under Decree Law 8. This was
followed by Decree Law 170 in 1975, which established the operating regulations
for the comprehensive agrarian reform program necessary for long-run improve-
ments in agricultural productivity. A great deal has already been accomplished.
Since 1973, the Government has distributed land to over 30,000 families. The
program, however calls for land distribution to an additional 70,000 families,
and peasant organization demands for a rapid as well as an effective agrarian
reform process can be expected to continue.    Failure to   accommodate their
needs on the part of the Government could cause renewed rural unrest and
seriously undermine private sector confidence. Thus far, however, this has
not happened and the private sector is financing a major expansion of sugar
production. Four new sugar mills are scheduled to come on stream in 1977 and
1978.



- 3 -
6.        The state forest corporation (COHDEFOR) has made significant pro-
gress towards the further development of the country's substantial forest
resources. COHDEFOR is now preparing a project in the Olancho, the area with
the country's largest forest reserve, for timber milling and industrializa-
tion and for a pulp and paper plant. Decisions have now been taken regarding
the implementation schedule and the financing package for the first stage of
the project (timber milling). In addition, several projects are being pre-
pared for processing installations for rough-sawn lumber; it is expected that
these will stimulate the development of intermediate and end-product indust-
ries such as furniture and molding. Forest management work is being under-
taken through eight district offices and negotiations are underway with
Canada for assistance with this and other forestry activities.
Balance of Payments
7.        The balance of payments deteriorated sharply during 1974 and
1975, mainly as a result of the combined effects of weakening terms of
trade, the world recession, the September 1974 hurricane, and the drought
in 1975. Inflows from foreign grants, the IMF Oil Facility, the Venezuelan
Investment Fund, along with borrowings from bilateral and international
lending agencies financed the bulk of the def'cit during these years.    Balance
of payments management is expected to continue to be difficult during the next
several years. Net international reserves were equivalent to about six weeks'
imports in December 1975. The recent sharp increases in coffee prices have
led to improved terms of trade in 1976 and a temporary strengthening of the
balance of payments but, given present expectations, sizeable resource gaps in
the balance of payments are projected for the period 1977-81 owing to large
import requirements and only moderate export growth. During 1977-81, the
growth of banana exports will largely reflect'recovery from the 1974 hurricane,
and increases in the volume of the other major exports, coffee, beef, and
wood, are expected to be modest. Anticipated increases in the prices of wood
and beef, added to increased coffee prices, are expected to keep Honduras'
terms of trade at their 1976 level through the end of the decade. Other ex-
ports are also expected to grow, and sugar may become a significant export item
by 1980 if the planned production increases are realized on schedule. The pro-
jected recovery of banana-exports and the anticipated increase in sugar, beef,
and wood exports will depend, however, on improvements in managerial capaci-
ties and efficiency as well as on orderly progress in the agrarian reform
program.
Public Investment and External Debt
8.        The Government plans to accelerate economic growth over the medium
term through an ambitious public investment program, which would at the
same time alleviate major bottlenecks to long-term development. Large invest-
tments are planned in roads, power and communications, and in the area of
export production: lumber mills, a pulp and paper plant, a tourism project,
and agricultural projects and a sugar mill.    Because consumer goods already
account for only a small share of imports and cannot be reduced without hard-
ship, imports will be growing fairly rapidly as the public investment program



- 4 -
is realized. The financing of the projected resource gaps will require
substantial capital inflows and the bulk of the foreign capital requirements
will have to be met through public borrowing. In the past, Honduras has
managed to keep its external debt service ratio fairly low, because foreign
loans were almost all on concessional terms. It is important that the country
continue to borrow on reasonably soft terms lest the planned public' investment
program result in an excessive debt service burden in the future.    Even if
Honduras is successful in obtaining most of the financing it needs for its
investment program on terms similar to those offered by the international
lending agencies, the debt service ratio is still likely to rise from about 5
percent in 1975 to about 15 percent by the early 1980's. Because Honduras
will continue to depend on exports of a few commodities with volatile price
prospects, and because, historically, natural disasters have sharply reduced
the volume of exports every few years, prudent debt management will require
maintenance of a rather lower debt service ratio than might be considered safe
for more diversified economies.
Public Finance
9.        During the last three years the public finance situation has
remained sound because of improvements in tax collection, and because the
growth of capital and current expenditures has been limited. Nonetheless,
greater demands on the public sector for reconstruction (after the 1974
hurricane) and development expenditures have resulted in an increase of the
overall public deficit from about 2 percent of GDP in 1973 to nearly 5 percent
in 1975. The Government has taken steps to improve the fiscal outlook and
adopted new tax measures in December 1975 estimated to have raised the tax
ratio from 12 percent of GDP in 1975 to about 13.5 percent in 1976. Despite
the greater tax effort, however, public savings cannot be expected to finance
all of the local costs of the public investment program without unduly res-
tricting current expenditures, nor can the shortfall be financed out of
domestic borrowing without generating unacceptable levels of inflation.
Therefore, some local cost financing on the part of official lending insti-
tutions will be required to implement the stepped-up public investment pro-
gram.
External Assistance
10.       The Bank is Honduras' largest creditor, holding 25.3 percent of the
US$445.5 million external public debt outstanding--including undisbursed--
repayable in foreign currency, as of December 31, 1975. IDA holds an addi-
tional 8.0 percent of the total. Although IDB has made loans totalling the
equivalent of US$124.5 million, most of this amount is repayable in local
currency, so that IDB's share of the public debt repayable in foreign currency
is only 7.5 percent. CABEI accounts for 21.6 percent of the total, the U.S.
Government for 20.3 percent, Venezuela 7.2 percent and privately held debt
for 10.1 percent.
11.       In terms of the sectoral thrust of the lending by the principal
external agencies, apart from the Bank, AID has concentrated on agriculture



- 5 -
and education, the IDB on transport, agriculture, education and housing,
and CABEI on transport. It is expected that AID and CABEI will continue
lending primarily in these sectors in the future, while IDB is expected to
concentrate mainly on agriculture, industry and power.     The lending of these
agencies from 1950-1975 is as follows:
IBRD   IDA    AID    IDB   CABEI    TOTAL
Total Gross Lending 1950-1975         130.4  34.2   94.4  124.5    88.3   471.8

Eligibility for Third Window Lending
12.        Honduras is considered eligible for Third Window financing on the
basis of the following considerations:
(a)  Poverty:   Its per capita income was US$350 in 1975 and
US$300 in 1972. 1/
(b)  Performance:   Honduras has made impressive accomplishments
in the last three years in promoting social and economic
development. It has undertaken a major agrarian reform
program, and has arranged for the financing and begun the
last stage of preparation of a major project for the ex-
ploitation of its substantial forest resources. Public
investment has been substantially increased, from an average
level of 4.5 percent of GDP in the 1971-73 period to 8.1
percent in 1975, and should remain at a high level for the
next several years in view of the number of projects now in
preparation.

- 6 -
(c) Creditworthiness: Honduras' external debt and debt service
have been relatively low in the past but can be expected to
increase quite rapidly by the early 1980's in line with the
increase in public investment necessary to carry out its
development plans. At the same time the country's exports
are of a quite volatile nature, with bananas and coffee
accounting for about one half of total merchandise exports.
In these circumstances, Honduras' creditworthiness for
conventional and commercial type loans is limited, and
external assistance on concessional terms is highly desirable.
(d) Alternative Sources of Finance: The projected increase
in public investment in Honduras will require substantial
borrowing from the major multilateral and bilateral lending
agencies (including the Venezuelan Investment Fund); the
increase required from agencies other than the Bank, before
taking into account the financing requirements of the Third
Port Project, is already about the maximum that could be
expected given the resource constraints of these agencies.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN HONDURAS
13.       Beginning with a loan of US$4.2 million for roads in 1955, Honduras
has to date received sixteen Bank loans totalling US$165.2 million and eight
IDA credits totalling US$47.6 million, both net of cancellations. The pro-
posed loans would raise the total of Bank Group assistance from US$212.8
million to US$229.8 million. Execution of projects financed by the Bank Group
has, on the whole, been satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
14.       In the past, Bank Group lending was heavily concentrated on trans-
port and power, where inadequate facilities hampered the development of
the country. The First Livestock Development Credit approved in 1970, how-
ever, marked a first step towards the diversification of our lending.     Since
then, there have been operations for a Second Livestock project; a First
Education project, which included as major components primary teacher training
schools, support for the national agricultural secondary school and vocational
training centers; and a First Agricultural Credit project to finance livestock
and crop development with emphasis on assisting agrarian reform settlements
through investment credits and a substantial technical assistance program.
15.       In future lending to Honduras, we plan to support the priorities of
the Government's investment program by giving increased emphasis to investment
in the productive sectors and in education, while continuing to lend for phy-
sical infrastructure, where there are still deficiencies to be overcome. In
addition to the Agricultural Credit project approved last May, preparation



- 7 -
efforts are now beginning on a rural development project for the Guayape
Valley to help support the agrarian reform program in that area, and a follow
on to the First Agricultural Credit project, as well as additional rural
development projects which are now being identified, are being planned. Bank
Group support is also being considered for COHDEFOR's pulp and paper project.
Honduras also has potentially excellent tourism sites which are now being
studied to determine whether a project is feasible. As part of its agrarian
reform program, the Government wishes to improve its agricultural training
program for technicians, and has proposed the creation of rural development
centers which would provide comprehensive educational services to rural
communities. Bank assistance in this effort will be considered as a possible
major component of a second education loan. In transport, after the Seventh
Highway Project (approved in November 1976), we will place emphasis on assist-
ance in the construction of a network of feeder and access roads to support
the Government's agricultural program. The Bank made a US$35.0 million loan
for a Sixth Power Project in 1975 and contemplates continuing its assistance
to the power sector in the future.
17.       It is expected that the Bank Group share of total external public
debt disbursed and outstanding will drop to about 21 percent by 1980 because
of increasing lending by other external agencies and commercial borrowing.
The Bank Group share of debt service in 1975 was 41 percent and this is pro-
jected to decline to about 13 percent by 1980.
18.       IFC's activities in Honduras have so far included a 1964 loan and
a share subscription, of US$295,000 and US$66,750 respectively, in a tannery,
Empresa de Curtidos Centroamericana, S.A. (ECCASA); and a US$75,000 share
subscription in a pilot promotional company, Compania Pino Celulosa de Centro
America (COPINO) in 1969. COPINO was established to develop an industrial
project based on timber from the Olancho Forest Reserve, but a series of
obstacles to project development arose and efforts to go forward with it were
virtually halted in 1971. While current plans for the Olancho forest indus-
tries project do not include a role for COPINO, the IFC is assisting the
Government in creating an organizational structure for the project and
selecting a technical partner.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
19.       The principal agricultural and industrial areas of Honduras are
the Sula Valley and the nearby Atlantic coastal strip. San Pedro Sula, which
has emerged as the country's main industrial center, and the ports of Cortes
and La Ceiba are the principal cities in the area. Further to the south lies
Tegucigalpa, the capital city and the second industrial center. The corridor
joining Tegucigalpa with San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes in the north and
the Pacific port of San Lorenzo in the south has been the main conduit of
the country's economic activity.



- 8 -
20.       Development of the transport sector has taken place only during
the last two decades, mainly in the highway and port subsectors. The con-
struction of the Inter-American highway in the southern region was started
in the mid fifties, and an all-weather road between Tegucigalpa and San
Pedro Sula was completed in 1971. Modernization of Puerto Cortes was begun
with Bank financing in the late sixties. A second expansion of Puerto Cortes
was completed recently, and the construction of a deep water port at San
Lorenzo is presently under way, both with Bank financial assistance. Puerto
Castilla, to be financed under the proposed loans and credit, would serve the
increasingly important agricultural and timber areas of eastern Honduras: the
Aguan Valley and the Olancho forest reserve. A number of highway projects are
now under construction, or about to begin which would complete most of the
country's primary highway network, and the Government is paying greater
attention to the improvement and expansion of the feeder and access road
system. Honduras can thus look forward to having, in the medium term, a
transport system to serve its most important productive areas and to meet the
needs of its international trade.
Highways
21.       Because of the topography of Honduras, road construction, in
general, has been difficult and expensive; nevertheless, the road network
grew from about 3,200 km (110 km paved) in 1960 to about 6,100 km (1,240 km
paved) in 1975. In addition to the principal roads mentioned in the preced-
ing paragraph, the primary system includes a road southwest from San Pedro
Sula to the El Salvador border and a road along the north coast to La Ceiba.
The country's secondary and tertiary road system is not yet well developed.
Major road projects now under construction or due to be commenced shortly
include three highways from the Tegucigalpa-San Pedro Sula corridor to the
central region: the Progreso-Yoro road in the north; the Tegucigalpa-
Juticalpa-Catacamas highway in the central area (financed under the Bank's
Sixth and Seventh Highway Loans); and the Tegucigalpa-Danli road in the south.
The road system to connect the Olancho forest reserve areas with the sites
for the planned sawmills, the proposed pulp and paper factory project, and
Puerto Castilla are now in the design/engineering phase. Construction of
these roads should start in mid-1977 with financial assistance from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
Ports
22.       Ports are a critical component of the transport sector since they
handle nearly 95 percent of the country's international trade. Because of the
larger trade with gulf and east coast ports of the United States, port capac-
ity has developed mainly on the Atlantic coast, where three out of the four
principal ports are located. Puerto Cortes is the principal general cargo
port, while Tela and La Ceiba are mainly banana handling facilities. San
Lorenzo on the Pacific side is presently a lighterage port, but will soon have
alongside facilities to service ocean-going vessels and will be able to handle
increased sugar and lumber exports. Puerto Cortes, which handles over 1.8
million tons, or 79 percent, of the overseas traffic, is the largest port of



- 9 -
Honduras, with an excellent natural harbor, and provides efficient service.
It is quickly adapting to new types of traffic such as roll-on/roll-off,
containers, and lighter-aboardship. A gantry crane for handling containers is
scheduled to be installed in 1977.
23.       The ports of Honduras are administered by Empresa Nacional Portuaria
(ENP), the national port authority, established with Bank assistance in
December 1965. ENP is an autonomous government entity with an Executive Board
of seven members consisting of three Ministers, one representative of the
National Planning Council and one delegate each from the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, the trade unions and the shipping companies. The dav-to-day
administration is the responsibility of the General Manager. The manage-
ment and operations of ENP are considered highly efficient, and its finan-
cial position is sound. The port subsector, during the decade since the
creation of ENP, has responded adequately to the needs of the growing volume
and variety of overseas traffic.
24.       Two previous Bank loans approved in 1966 and 1971 (Loans 463 and
767-HO) have provided almost all the external financing for port expansion in
Honduras. The ENP has carried out these two previous port projects for
improvement of Puerto Cortes and the construction of San Lorenzo, in a very
capable manner. There was a long delay in the start of construction of San
Lorenzo which resulted in a large cost overrrun and required a US$3.0 million
supplemental loan from the Bank (approved July 1975). This, however, was the
result of a political objection to the location of the port raised by the
government which came into office after the loan had been signed, and was not
the fault of the ENP. The succeeding government approved the original site,
and since approval of the supplemental loan, project execution has been pro-
ceeding normally. The San Lorenzo port is now expected to be completed by
September 1977.
25.       ENP has the sole responsibility for port planning.    Its planning
process includes development of a rolling five-year plan that covers econo-
mic, engineering and financial analyses, most of which are done by ENP's own
staff. The inclusion of a cash flow analysis in the five-year plan effec-
tively integrates the ENP's planning and capital budgeting process.
Other Transport
26.       The railway system consists of three narrow-gauge lines, all
located in the north and serving mostly the banana plantations in the Sula
Valley, the northern coastal strips, and the upper Aguan Valley. Honduras
has two principal airlines; between them they provide adequate domestic
and international service. With the improvement of the road system since
1970, domestic air traffic has declined steadily. Little intermodal trans-
port planning is done since air and rail transport are relatively unimportant
and highway/port coordination is not complex.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
27.       The primary objectives of the project are (a) to ptovide suitable
port facilities at Puerto Castilla and at San Lorenzo for the efficient hand-
ling of new export traffic expected to be generated in the near future;
(b) to carry out a channel depth study for San Lorenzo; and (c) to train ENP
staff in container operations.
Project Description
28.       To support the above objectives, the proposed project contains
the following components:
(a) Civil Works
At Puerto Castilla: Construction of a 450 m wharf, one transit
shed, one warehouse, two lumber sheds, storage tanks for palm
oil and petroleum, office building, and miscellaneous services.
At San Lorenzo: Extension of the pier (presently under construc-
tion) to provide an additional berth 145 m long, and construction
of a sugar storage shed and two molasses tanks.
(b) Equipment
At Puerto Castilla: Provision of general cargo and lumber han-
dling equipment, chip-loading equipment, a used tugboat and a
launch.
At San Lorenzo: Provision of (1) equipment for handling sugar,
lumber and general cargo and for pumping molasses; and
(2) navigational aids.
(c)  Consultant Services for
Detailed engineering and supervision of construction, and
(d) Technical Assistance for
(i) Channel depth study at San Lorenzo; and
(ii) Training of ENP staff in container operations at Puerto

Puerto Castilla
29.       The facilities at Puerto Castilla are needed to serve important
export development projects now being undertaken by the Government in the
Aguan Valley and Olancho Forest Reserve. The first phase of the Aguan Valley
agricultural development project, which received financing from IDB, has
been completed, and the IDB has recently approved a US$40.0 million loan for
a more ambitious second phase. Surpluses of corn and beans are already being
produced in the Valley, and production of grapefruit and palm oil from the
first phase will become substantial within a few years. Although all of these
products except grapefruit would be primarily for the domestic market, those
to be consumed internally will all be shipped via Puerto Castilla to Puerto
Cortes since land transport is very expensive. The Government is also going
ahead with the first stage of the Olancho forest industries project with IDB
and Venezuelan financial support to produce timber and chips, for export.
In February 1977 the IDB signed a loan for US$59.5 million with the Honduran
Government to finance the road infrastructure for this project.    Three sawmills
will be constructed during the 1979-1981 period. For the second stage a pulp
and paper factory is to be constructed in the early 1980's to produce liner
board which will then largely replace chips in the export program.
San Lorenzo
30.       The works proposed at San Lorenzo are related to the expansion of
the sugar industry, which is presently under way in the southern region of
Choluteca. Since the sugar companies developed their export plan after the
present contract for the port works at San Lorenzo was awarded, the facilities
currently under construction are inadequate for handling the expected traffic
and, therefore, need to be expanded. The sugar companies have contracted with
a large international firm to provide technical assistance and to serve as
their marketing agent. The exports are expected to be profitable since the
cost of production in Honduras compares favorably with the price level at
which the world market for sugar is forecast to be within two years (at
about USi12 per pound FOB in constant 1974 prices). Because the sugar
mills are close to San Lorenzo and expect to export some production to Japan,
the owners have requested that facilities be provided at San Lorenzo. In
order to justify the provision of the storage and handling facilities, the
sugar companies have offered to guarantee ENP a minimum tonnage of exports.
It has been agreed that ENP would not sign the contract for the construction
of additional facilities at San Lorenzo until an agreement satisfactory to the
Bank on minimum tonnages has been obtained from the sugar companies (Section
3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
31.       Lumber and general cargo-handling equipment for San Lorenzo was
originally included in the Second Port Project (Loan 767-HO); however, because
of the cost overrun on the civil works, it was agreed, when making the supple-
mental loan of US$3.0 million, that the unordered equipment would be deleted
and might be considered for inclusion in a subsequent project. Accordingly,
since the equipment is still needed, provision for it has been made in this
project.

Technical Assistance
32.       The channel depth study will examine the feasibility of deepening
the access channel to San Lorenzo to permit the use of larger vessels than can
now enter the port for export of sugar and molasses, and the training will
prepare ENP staff for the efficient handling of the growing container traffic.
Project Costs
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$29.9 million, with
a foreign exchange component of US$17.0 million, as summarized below:

34.       The base cost estimate for civil works and equipment has been
obtained by updating to December 1976 the consultant's estimate, which was
based on 1975 prices. Contingency provisions include: (a) physical varia-
tion in civil works at 15 percent for Puerto Castilla and 10 percent for San
Lorenzo; and (b) annual price escalation at 12 percent for civil works, 8



- 13 -
percent for equipment and 6 percent for consultant services for the 1977-1979
period. The cost of a total of 440 man-months of consultancy services and
technical assistance are estimated at an average, for foreign and local con-
sultants, of US$3,900 per man-month.
35.       The proposed Bank Group financing would cover the estimated foreign
costs. The local currency costs (US$12.9 million equivalent) would be met
partly by ENP's own resources and partly by domestic bond issues with a
10-year term. It has been agreed that the Government would underwrite the ENP
bond issues, or make other financial arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, in
order to ensure that the local resources necessary to complete the project are
available (Section 2.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Project Implementation
36.       ENP would be the Borrower and the Executing Agency.    As demon-
strated in the case of the two previous Bank financed port projects, ENP has a
capacity to execute the project satisfactorily. For carrying out engineering
and supervision of construction, the channel depth study and the training of
ENP staff in container operations, ENP would contract for consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference would be acceptable to the
Bank. Construction on both ports is expected to commence in mid-1977. The
work at San Lorenzo would be completed by March 1978 and that at Puerto
Castilla by September 1979.
Financial Analysis
37.       The ENP's financial performance for the five years from 1971 through
1975 has been good. During this period, ENP's operations were profitable,
and the return on unrevalued net assets was above 16 percent. Since 1971,
revenues have grown by 70 percent, partly because ENP has assumed responsi-
buility for the operation of additional ports and partly because of the growth
in traffic handled. Net income during this time, however, has increased only
by 41 percent because increases in expenses have not been matched by increases
in tariffs. As a result, the operating ratio increased from 44 percent in 1971
to 63 percent in 1975. The debt equity ratio at the end of 1975, although
higher than the 35/65 ratio in 1971, was a satisfactory 44/56.
38.       Forecasts for the 1977-1983 period indicate that there are good
prospects for satisfactory financial performance by ENP. A tariff increase
was implemented in February 1977 which should enable ENP to achieve an
8 percent rate of return on revalued assets in 1977. While this tariff
increase was accompanied by some restructuring of tariffs, there is need for
further restructuring so as to relate tariffs to the present value of assets
and to the real cost of providing port services and facilities. ENP has
agreed to make such further adjustments to its tariff structure not later
than July 1, 1978 (Section 5.09 of the draft Loan Agreemenet), based upon a
full revaluation of its assets to be completed by October 1, 1977. ENP also
agreed to carry out further asset revaluations at least once every three years



- 14 -
(Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement). Information regarding the cost of
port services and facilities will be provided by a cost accounting system
which ENP is now preparing and has agreed to put into operation by October 1,
1977 (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). Furthermore, ENP has agreed
to increase tariff levels as necessary to maintain an annual rate of return of
not less than 8 percent on revalued assets (Section 5.06(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement), and in order to maintain a satisfactory cash flow, it has agreed
that it will limit capital expenditures during the construction period for
items not included in the Second and Third Projects to a maximum of US$500,000
per annum (Section 5.08 of the draft Loan Agreement).
39.       The total planned investment of ENP during the period 1977 to 1983
is US$49.3 million. Of this total US$29.5 million relates to project items,
and the balance of US$19.8 million is for the ongoing construction of San
Lorenzo/Amapala under the Bank's Second Port Project and the new free trade
zone at Puerto Cortes. Free trade zone investment is not related to port
operations, and in order to insure that non-port operations do not become a
financial burden on port operations ENP has agreed to the following:
(i) ENP will retain each year an amount equivalent to 8 percent of net fixed
port assets for investment in port services and facilities (Section 5.06(b) of
the draft Loan Agreement); (ii) ENP will use its best efforts to ensure that
non-port operations earn sufficient revenue to cover their expenses
(Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement); (iii) ENP will advise the Bank
prior to any changes in port tariff levels in order, among other things, to
afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on increases which might not be
related to port operations (Section 5.09(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
40.       As a result of the present project and other investments being made,
ENP assets are forecast to increase by 140 percent, or US$41.7 million, by
1979, pushing up the debt/equity ratio to a peak of 56/44.    However, after
1979, because the rate of growth is expected to decline and ENP will generate
substantial amounts of surplus funds, the debt/equity ratio will decline to a
satisfactory level of 35/65 by 1983.   With these projected surpluses, ENP will
be in a position, and has agreed, to set aside funds each year sufficient to
retire the local bond issue (para. 35) at maturity (Section 5.11 of the draft
Loan Agreement) . With the intended revision of tariffs, debt service coverage
will be at least 1.75 to 1 throughout the 1977-83 period, and ENP has agreed
that, as has been provided in prior Loan Agreements, no debt will be incurred
without Bank agreement unless net cash generation for the preceding 12 months
is at least 1.75 times the maximum total debt service requirements for any
succeeding fiscal year.
41.       Although ENP accounting procedures and control are generally satis-
factory, individual accounts separate from ENP's over-all accounts should be
established and maintained for each of the major development projects.     It
has been agreed that such separate accounts would be set up and maintained
(Section 5.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).

Procurement and Disbursement
42.       All contracts for civil works and equipment for Puerto Castilla and
San Lorenzo would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding, except that the used tugboat for Puerto Castilla, for which sources of
supply are expected to be limited, would be procured by international shop-
ping. With regard to the civil works for San Lorenzo, ENP proposes to
negotiate with Colombus Latinoamericana (the contractor which is carrying
out ongoing port works at San Lorenzo) an extension of the existing contract.
ENP's proposal is practicable and would result in the facilities being ready
earlier than would be the case if new bids were invited. It is doubtful that
international contractors would be interested in the new bid, not only because
of the modest size of the contract (estimated cost US$3.1 million), but also
because of the effective competition which Columbus Latinoamericana is in a
position to offer because it is already on the site. Since the current
contract with Columbus Latinoamericana was awarded in 1975 on the basis of
international competitive bidding, and the prices applicable thereto would
provide a basis for negotiating the price of the new contract, ENP's proposal
is considered acceptable and the terms of the revised contract will be subject
to Bank approval.
43.       The proposed Bank Group financing will be disbursed to cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the various project items as shown in
paragraph 33. In order to meet the tentative schedule for completing the
port works at Castilla by the end of 1979, work on the detailed engineering of
the project has already been started. Also, because of the possibility of
utilizing, at a favorable price, the services of a dredging contractor (which
would be financed by ENP) who is scheduled to complete a job in Corinto,
Nicaragua in the latter half of 1977, ENP has also begun the channel depth
study. Retroactive financing of up to US$500,000 is therefore recommended to
meet foreign expenditures incurred on consultant services for engineering and
technical assistance after November 1, 1976.
Environmehtal Impact
44.       Since no dirty or dusty cargoes would be handled at either of the
project ports, and since normal precautions would be taken in handling the
small quantities of petroleum at Puerto Castilla, there should be no adverse
effect upon the ecology as a result of the port development proposed under
this project. The ecological implications of the proposed sawmills and the
paper and pulp factory have been considered by the Government and IDB, and
suitable provision for controlling air and water pollution would be included
in their design.
Economic Analysis
45.       Traffic projections for Puerto Castilla are based on the Government's
program for export of forestry products (sawn timber, woodchips and eventually
liner board) from the Olancho forestry reserve, and of agricultural products



- 16 -
(corn, beans, citrus fruit and palm oil) from the Aguan Valley, and the esti-
mate of imports is based on the projected inputs (machinery, chemicals, ferti-
lizers, petroleum) to the forestry and agricultural development projects.
Major financial commitments have already been made in both these development
schemes. The port, which will handle the traffic generated by the Aguan and
Olancho projects, is justified as part of this larger package of investments.
The fundamental economic issue is whether the agricultural and forestry
development programs are economically viable, and the question has been
answered affirmatively by formal economic and financial analyses. Thus, the
analytical task for the port project was to identify the least cost solution
for the required infrastructure, i.e., the optimal location, timing, and size
of the port facility. This exercise, together with the determination of an
appropriate port tariff structure that will generate revenues to cover the
full cost of the port, has established that the investment is justified.
46.       Starting at a level of 264,000 tons in 1980, the total traffic is
expected to increase to 1,049,000 tons in 1983, when the export of chips will
reach a peak of 643,000 tons. With the expected startup of the pulp and
paper factory in 1984, chip exports will decline rapidly and will be replaced
by a smaller tonnage of liner board (133,000 tons), bringing the total traffic
to 794,000 tons in 1986. These traffic projections are conservative since
they include only the reasonably firm traffic related to the forestry and
agricultural projects, and do not take into account export traffic such as
hardwood products, sugar from the Aguan Valley and bananas from the Isleta
area, which is likely but not yet certain.
47.       At San Lorenzo, the traffic is expected to rise from the 1976 level
of 172,000 tons to 240,000 tons in 1978, when the export of sugar and molasses
is to commence. Thereafter, the traffic will gradually build up to 276,000
tons in 1986. Based on firm figures of export traffic which the sugar industry
will guarantee and on a conservative estimate of growth of lumber and general
cargo, these projections are considered to be realistic.
48.       The overall rate of return for the project is 25 percent, with first
year benefits of 23 percent. The benefits attributable to the proposed facili-
ties at Puerto Castilla are mainly the avoided cost of the closest alternative
to the proposed investment, i.e., (a) land transport of the export cargo to
Puerto Cortes and (b) a wharf and ancillary facilities at Puerto Cortes which
would be needed for handling the additional traffic at that port. These
benefits yield an internal rate of return of 27 percent with first year
benefits of 25 percent for this investment which accounts for 80 percent of
project costs.
49.       In the case of San Lorenzo, if the proposed extension of the pier is
not carried out, the least cost alternative would be to divert the sugar and
molasses traffic to Corinto in Nicaragua, which is the nearest suitable port
on the Pacific side. The avoided cost of land transport and port charges at
Corinto would be the benefits from the proposed investment at San Lorenzo.
In addition, there would be savings in waiting time for lumber and general



- 17 -
cargo vessels. Together, these benefits yield a return of 14 percent, with
first year benefits of 14 percent for this investment which accounts for 20
percent of project costs.
50.       Sensitivity analysis in which the cost and benefit streams are
varied by 25 percent indicate that the return would be no lower than 22
percent for Puerto Castilla and 10 percent for San Lorenzo.
Project Risks
51.       A delay in the startup of the first of the three proposed sawmills
at Corocito is a possible uncertainty associated with the project. This
delay might result from (a) slow progress in preparation of the sawmill phase
and (b) the necessary road infrastructure, which is being financed by IDB, not
being ready in time. In order to expedite construction of the sawmill, the
Government has assigned it high priority and has appointed a ministerial
committee to monitor progress and resolve any problems that may arise. Also,
IDB has provided a senior executive to assist COHDEFOR in preparing and
executing the project. Design of the sawmills is now proceeding on schedule.
Financing for the sawmills will be provided by the Government, IDB, and
suppliers. Preliminary discussions have begun with a number of bilateral
export finance agencies, and final arrangements are expected to be concluded
by September, 1977. In order to ensure that there are no administrative
delays in the forest roads project, the Minister of Public Works has expanded
an existing project execution unit for the forest roads.
52.       In view of the steps taken, and progress made so far on meeting pre-
paration schedules and arranging the necessary financing for the sawmill and
forest road projects, it appears that there is little risk of significant
delay. However, since the usefulness of having the proposed port facilities
at Castilla in operation by the end of FY1979 is dependent to a large extent
upon the completion of the supporting road system, it has been agreed with the
ENP that bid documents for the port works at Castilla would be issued only
after satisfactory bids have been received for the forest road works
(Schedule 4, Part A.3 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Conclusion
53.       The proposed project fully merits Bank Group support.    It will pro-
vide suitable 6utlets for export commodities which will help Honduras to
earn valuable foreign exchange and will yield acceptable rates of return of
27 percent and 14 percent on its two main components. The facilities proposed
at Puerto Castilla are essential for the success of two important projects of
the Honduran Government, i.e., the Aguan Valley Agricultural Development
Project and the Olancho Forest Industries Project, which have been undertaken
with the object of developing the northeastern region. Without the proposed
facilities at San Lorenzo, sugar enterprises, which have already committed
considerable investment to expansion of capacity, will face higher costs in
exporting their products.

C.   PROJECT IN EXECUTION I/
Loan/Credit No.
Ln. 767     Second Port Project:   US$6.0 million Loan of June 25, 1971;
and US$3.0 million Supplemental Loan of July 30, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: February 22, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project consists of the expansion of Puerto Cortes on the
North Coast of Honduras, and the construction of the new port
of San Lorenzo, in the South. The San Lorenzo port was delayed
about 18 months as a result of Government reconsideration of
its location. The Puerto Cortes expansion was completed in
March 1975. The Bank provided additional financing of US$3.0
million, which was necessary to cover the increased cost of the
San Lorenzo port resulting from the high level of inflation
during the period of the delay. Construction of this port is
now proceeding satisfactorily and should be completed in
September 1977.
Ln. 841     Fifth Power Project:   US$12.3 million Loan of June 28, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: December 12 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The Honduras-Nicaragua interconnection line, a principal
element of this project, is now complete and in operation.
Other elements of the fifth project (extensions to new areas,
the 26 MW La Ceiba Diesel plant, consulting services and
training) have either been completed or are proceeding oft
schedule.
Ln. 896.     Sixth Highway Project:  US$18.8 million Loan of May 30, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This project, for construction of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga
highway, was delayed by about six months while the Government
redesigned sections of the road in an attempt to lower costs.
Construction has proceeded satisfactorily and was completed
in December 1976. Engineering studies of feeder roads to
complement the highway have been completed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Loan/Credit No.
Cr. 434     Second Livestock Project:   US$6.6 million Credit of
October 29, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: January 18, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Commitments under this project slowed during 1975 because of
uncertainty resulting from the implementation of the Agrarian
Reform Law. With an increased level of commitment in 1976 as
procedures under the Law became clarified and the allocation
of up to US$1.0 million in uncommitted funds for the rehab-
ilitation of the Isleta Agrarian Reform settlement, this credit
is expected to be fully disbursed by mid 1977.
Ln. 954     First Education Project:   US$3.0 million Loan and US$3.0 million
Cr. 452     Credit, both of January 9, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: April 8, 1974;
Closing Date:   June 30, 1978.
The project is proceeding normally with the construction of
training and teaching facilities.
Ln. 1081     Sixth Power Project:  US$35.0 million Loan of January 27, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: May 5, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Construction is proceeding on schedule, and is expected to be
completed by December 1978.
Cr. 628     First Agricultural Credit Project:    US$14.0 million Credit of
