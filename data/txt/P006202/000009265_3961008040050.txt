MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BOLIMA
FOR A RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to Bolivia for SDR9.6 million, the
equivalent of US$15 million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance a Rural Communities Development Project.
2.          Background. Bolivia's rural population is predominantly poor. Annual
per capita income is only US$760 (1994). The concentration of rural families in the
resource-poor areas of the Andes and Valleys has led to wide-spread poverty and over-
exploitation of natural resources. Subsistence agriculture is still the primary economic
activity of over 80 percent of the rural households in these areas. The past rural
development policies benefited mostly the local elite, neglecting the rural poor and
indigenous people. The Government has now reversed these policies, and investments
aimed at developing the rural sector lie at the core of the country's poverty alleviation
policy and strategy.
3.          Rural Development Policy. Government is addressing rural poverty by
empowering the hitherto marginalized rural communities to plan and implement their own
economic development. This is a radical change from the centralized and top-down rural
development policies of the past. The new policy has three guiding principles: (i) popular
participation; (ii) respect for ethnic identities; and (iii) protection of the environment. The
policy is based on the premise that rural development can only succeed when it is built
upon the rural communities and respect their cultural identities and values.
4.          Rural Development Strategy. To improve rural living conditions and
rectify past neglect, Government intends to increase rural productivity through rural
investments, particularly in basic infrastructure, irrigation, and natural resource
management. In recent years, grassroots projects, supported by local public and non-
governmental organizations, have become the major thrust of Bolivia's rural development
strategy. Government is now heavily promoting community participation in the
identification, design, implementation and maintenance of rural investments. It also
intends to strengthen the capacity of local institutions and communities to participate in
decision-making at the municipal level. Moreover, it provides co-participation funds and
grants from Investment Funds to increase rural investments.
5.          A major step in promoting community participation in local investment
planning has been the approval of the Popular Participation Law (LPP) in 1994. The Law



- 2 -
calls for decentralization of political authority to municipalities and for a more equitable
distribution of public revenues. Responsibilities for health, education, irrigation and rural
roads infrastructure and maintenance are to be transferred from the central to the
municipal governments. Fund allocations from the national treasury to municipalities are
to be based exclusively on the number of inhabitants. To receive funds, municipalities
must draw up municipal development and annual operative plans.
6.          The municipal development plans are to be drawn up through a
participatory planning process. The process helps communities to recognize their needs
and express their demands in rural investment proposals. With the help of NGOs and
Regional Development Corporations (CORDES), the communities and the municipality
design a simple Municipal Development Plan. The plan is to be financed by the municipal
co-participation funds, the beneficiaries, and the Investment Funds such as the Small-
Farmer Development Fund (FDC) and the Social Investment Fund (FIS). NGOs and
CORDES will help communities to carry out the plans, including design of sub-projects,
submission of proposals to funding agencies, and implementation of sub-projects.
7.          To implement the above strategy, the Secretariat for Rural Development
(SNDR) has designed and tested a participatory investment planning methodology (PPP)
in a pilot operation, financed by an IDA-PPF and Japanese Grant funds. During 1994,
SNDR verified the validity and appropriateness of the PPP methodology in nine provinces.
The pilot project has generated significant enthusiasm in the rural areas and SNDR has
been able to present 94 draft municipal development plans by the end of 1994. SNDR is
now revising the PPP methodology by simplifying its initial bureaucratic approach and
adjusting it to the particular social, economic and cultural conditions of the communities.
8.          Participatory planning requires additional capacity building. While the rural
sector has historically been composed of effective community organizations, few have had
experience in identifying, formulating and prioritizing their development needs and
presenting them in formats acceptable for financing. Many rural organizations do not fully
understand their new responsibilities. Others lack technical and administrative skills to
assume these responsibilities. As part of its strategy, Government aims to further increase
the implementation capacity of institutions involved in participatory planning and sub-
project implementation.
9.          Project Objectives. The overall project objectives are to: (a) alleviate
rural poverty by carrying out rural investments identified and formulated following a
participatory planning process; (b) enhance the institutional capacity of the Secretariat for
Rural Development (SNDR), the Small-Farmer Development Fund (FDC), and the
Secretariat for Popular Participation (SNPP); (c) improve the capacity of municipalities
and rural communities to implement Municipal Development Plans (PMD); and
(d) strengthen non-government organizations (NGOs) assisting municipalities and rural
communities in identifying, formulating and implementing rural investments and managing
municipal development plans.



- 3 -
10.         Project Description. The project would provide, over a period of three
and a half years, financing for: (i) small rural investments; (ii) goods and works, training,
consulting and management services and incremental operating costs for institutional
strengthening and to implement the participatory planning process. The project
components are: (i) rural investment identification and formulation (12 percent of project
costs); (ii) training (7 percent of project costs); (iii) institutional strengthening (27 percent
of project costs); and (iv) rural investments (48 percent of project costs). A PPF of US$2
million (6 percent of project costs) has been used to prepare the project. Technical
assistance and training to municipalities and communities would be provided in 98 (of
301) municipalities selected on the basis of poverty, development potential and
institutional capacity. These municipalities include the Chapare region (Bolivia's main
coca growing area--para. 23). The rural investments would be financed in the whole
country.
11.         Rural Investment Identification and Formulation would cover the financing
of services by Executing Agencies (EEs) such as NGOs to assist communities and
municipalities with the design and implementation of rural investment sub-projects through
a participatory planning process (PPP). Estimated cost: US$3.6 million. Training would
include training of EEs, grassroots organizations, municipalities and public institutions in
participatory planning, preparation and management of sub-projects. Estimated cost:
US$2.2 million. The institutional strengthening component would include strengthening
of SNDR, FDC and SNPP to assist communities and EEs in sub-project planning and
implementation, and enhancing the financial administration of municipalities. Estimated
cost: US$8.2 million. The rural investment component would make funds available to
FDC to finance sub-projects included in the municipal development plans. In particular,
the funds would finance, inter alia, pre-investment studies, public productive priority
investments in basic infrastructure, small-scale irrigation, agricultural extension, natural
resources management, markets, etc. Depending on the type of projects, municipalities
and beneficiaries would contribute at least 10 percent (up to 30 percent) of the sub-project
costs. Estimated costs: US$15 million. A PPF of US$2 million has been approved to
finance project preparation.
12.         Project Costs and Financing. Total project costs are estimated at
US$31 million, with a foreign exchange component of U$1.9 million equivalent
(six percent) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$3.2 million equivalent. IDA
would finance US$15 million (84 percent of the foreign exchange and 46 percent of local
costs). The Swiss Government (COTESU) would participate with US$1.7 million. The
Government intends to request IFAD financing for US$4.9 million. The Government and
rural communities would contribute US$6 million. The project needs additional co-
financing of US$3.4 million for rural investments. Reimbursement of up to US$1.4
million equivalent would be permitted for eligible expenditures made in accordance with
procurement procedures agreed under the project from January 1, 1995, provided that the
Credit is signed not later than December 31, 1995. Two special accounts would be
established at the Central Bank each in the amount of US$600,000 equivalent and would
be managed by SNDR and FDC. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are

shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operation in Bolivia are presented in
Schedule C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No 14182-BO, dated July 5,
1995 is distributed separately.
13.         Project Implementation. Overall project co-ordination would be assured
by SNDR's General Coordination Unit. SNDR's field offices would manage the bulk of
the participatory planning and training components by contracting and supervising EE
activities. FDC would receive IDA funds from the Government on a grant basis through a
subsidiary project agreement and finance the rural investments including design and
feasibility studies on a matching grant basis. A project operational manual agreed upon
with IDA would guide recruitment of EEs, procurement for sub-projects, eligibility criteria
for sub-projects and beneficiaries, beneficiary contributions, sub-grant agreements, use of
the special accounts, disbursements for FDC, and would specify auditing requirements, the
accounting system and consultants terms of reference.
14.         Project Sustainability. One project objective is to strengthen the
grassroots organizations enabling them to become more efficient and sustainable. Returns
on investments in infrastructure and training are expected to increase the community's
income and provide them with a more sustainable future. Training would improve the
efficiency of NGOs and other intermediary agencies and upgrade their skills so that they
can take over more public sector tasks.
15.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is fully consistent with three
of the broad objectives of the country assistance strategy presented to the Board on
February 8, 1994: strengthening of essential public institutions, alleviation of poverty, and
better management of the country's natural resources. IDA is providing assistance in the
rural areas in the health, education, water supply and sanitation sectors. The proposed
project intends to strengthen the community structures which have to participate in the
design, implement and maintain these local projects. Institutional strengthening of
communities and NGOs would increase the communities' absorption capacity and the
NGO's intermediation capacity. It would also considerably increase the effectiveness of
all donor-funded projects in the rural areas. This way, IDA would act as a catalyst to
accelerate disbursements and/or commitments of external funds in support of the rural
sector. IDA's experience with FIS and elsewhere in Latin America means that it is
uniquely placed to play this role.
16.         Lessons Learned. The project design takes into considerations the lessons
learned in similar projects in the region and in Bolivia. Lessons of particular relevance to
the project include: (i) successful development efforts in Bolivia tend to be those
designed, formulated and executed with considerable beneficiary participation and
administered at the local level by NGOs or other groups close to the beneficiary
communities; (ii) efficiency of sub-project financing can be increased through full
transparency, accountability, and well-defined project and beneficiary eligibility criteria;



- 5 -
and (iii) the demand-driven approach arnong the poorer communities requires promotional
activities and technical assistance.
17.         Issues and Actions. During negotiations the Government and IDA have
agreed on: (a) the content and the methodology of the training programs to be included in
the annual implementation plans to be reviewed with IDA; (b) the use of IDA standard
bidding documents for ICB and bidding documents acceptable to IDA for national
competitive bidding; (c) auditing and accounting arrangements; (d) the overall project
implementation plan and a detailed first year implementation plan; (e) the preparation of
annual implementation plans by SNDR and FDC; (f) project monitoring and supervision
arrangements; and (g) mid-terrn review arrangements. Before Credit effectiveness SNDR
would establish a roster of executing agencies to provide technical assistance and training
to rural communities, based on agreed criteria; FDC and the Government would sign the
project subsidiary agreement; and SNDR, FDC and SNPP would adopt the Project
Operational Manual. Conditions of disbursement of the FDC strengthening and rural
investment component would be: (a) FDC's adoption of revised procurement
arrangements; (b) FDC's adoption of a decentralization plan; and (c) the signing of an
agreement between FDC and MDSMA, allowing FDC to carry out environmental impact
assessments under MDSMA guidelines.
18.         Poverty Category. The project is included in the program of targeted
poverty interventions. It addresses poverty reduction by including rural poverty in the
selection criteria for municipalities to be supported under the project. It benefits also the
rural population which has a significantly larger proportion of poor people than the
country's population as a whole.
19.         Environmental Aspects. Environmental screening by the funding
agencies of the sub-projects proposed under the investment component as well as
adherence to strict environmental mitigation rules would reduce minor negative side-
effects of small-scale irrigation and road rehabilitation. Environmental Category: B.
20.         Program Objective Categories. The program objective categories of the
project are: poverty alleviation and capacity building.
21.         Participatory Approach. Potential project beneficiaries and stakeholders
have been involved in project design by: (i) participation in the pilot project on which the
participatory planning methodology is based; (ii) participation in several workshops of
communities providing comments on the participatory planning process; (iii) a social
assessment in July 1994; and (iv) a project preparation seminar with donors, beneficiaries,
government institutions and EEs held in November 1994.
22.         Project Benefits and Risks. Expected benefits of the project would be:
(i) a reduction in rural poverty and an increase in the incomes of the rural poor; (ii) an
increase in the level and sustainability of small-scale rural investments; (iii) capacity
enhancement of development institutions at the national, municipal and community levels;



-6-
and (iv) an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of funding agencies operating
in the rural sector. By responding more efficiently to the demand for rural investments
and preparing a considerable number of sub-projects, the project would lift one of the
major bottlenecks for the financing of rural investments and significantly increase the
investment pipeline of the funding agencies. Increased community ownership of the sub-
projects would enhance their commitment to maintain the investments.
23.         As noted, the Chapare, the major coca growing area in the country, is
included in the target area of project intervention. As such, the project would enhance the
ability of the Chapare communities to plan future developments and prepare sub-projects
for financing by the Credit and by co-participation funds. The project would assist the
Chapare communities to improve their social and economic conditions and diversify their
economies. Coupled with strong interdiction efforts, this should therefore contribute to
the country's fight against the production of coca as an input to cocaine.
24.         The project faces three risks. First, the project involves numerous central
and local government and private agencies, most of which have weak management and
poor coordination amongst them. Sub-project approval may therefore be delayed and/or
be based upon criteria unrelated to the sub-project's technical merits. This risk would be
mitigated through institution building and training which would increase the managerial
abilities of SNDR and the Executing Agencies. The experience of the pilot project has
facilitated coordination among government agencies. Strict adherence to the criteria for
sub-project eligibility would provide transparency in sub-project selection. Second, sub-
project formulation and implementation through participatory planning process is
ambitious and difficult. The preparatory phases, financed under the pilot project, were
relatively easy to implement compared with the painstaking process of municipal plan
implementation. Therefore, SNDR would continuously modify the planning methodology
to minimize implementation difficulties. Third, there is a possibility that project
implementation requirements might outstrip FDC's disbursement capacities, creating
unsatisfied expectations among rural communities and reducing project impact. The
project would help FDC to decentralize its sub-project approval process and strengthen
FDC's regional offices to assure high technical standards and more rapid disbursements.
25.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed project would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
