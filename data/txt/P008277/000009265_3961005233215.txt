ARMENIA
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summarv
Borrower:        Republic of Armenia
Executing Agencv: Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)
Beneficiaries:   Private farmers and consumers through lowered food prices
Amount:          US $43.0 mnillion
Ternis:          Standard IDA terms, with 35 years' maturity and 10 years' grace period
Project Obiectives: Assist Armenia in maintaining the level of irrigated agricultural production and
improve the country's water resource management.
Description:     The project is comprised of four main investment components:
(a) Rehabilitation of 12 irrigation schemes and the Ararat Valley groundwater
network. These cover an area of about 164,700 ha (about 60% of the Armenian
irrigated land). There are four types of rehabilitation works under the project:
(i) Rehabilitation of the conveyance systems, including canals, aqueducts,
siphons, and hydraulic structures in eight major irrigation schemes. The
area covered under this category is about 151,400 ha (92% of the project
area).
(ii) Replacement of pumps and pressure pipelines. This category includes four
pumping schemes.
(iii) Rehabilitation or replacement of about 650 tubewell pumps.
(iv) Rehabilitation of four dam storage schemes (reservoirs).
(b) Establishment of pilot projects for improved water distribution and establishment
of water users' associations.
(c) Financing incremental O&M costs of the irrigation infrastructure until effective
water users' associations are in place, and in the meantime to prevent further
deterioration of the irrigation infrastructure.
(d) Technical assistance, including establishment of a project implementation unit;
assistance to update the Water Master Plan; training; preparation of the next
irrigation project; and assistance to improve irrigated crop production.



ii
Benefits:         The proposed irrigation rehabilitation investment project would avert a collapse of
the irrigation infrastructure in Armenia. A secure water supply would promote
agricultural production, increase the food supply, and create employment in the rural
areas. Without the project, Armenia would need to substantially increase its food
imports, or decrease its food consumption. Under the project, construction work will
generate employment opportunities for unemployed skilled and unskilled labor. The
project would also establish the foundation for improved and rationalized water
management by instituting water users' associations and water charges.
Risks:            The principal project risk is political. If there is a resumption of hostilities between
Armenia and any of its neighbors, a reimposition of a blockade would have an
adverse impact on the project implementation because of expected difficulties in
importing fuel, spare parts, construction machinery, steel pipes and reinforced steel,
without which large diameter pipes cannot be laid and precast concrete sections
cannot be manufactured. In addition, resources needed for operation and maintenance
of the irrigation infrastructure would be drained and the physical structures would
be put in jeopardy as well. The Bank approval of the proposed project is therefore
based on the assumption that the current framework for negotiating the international
conflict in which Armenia is involved will lead to a peaceful resolution of the
conflict, and that the threat of increased hostilities is no longer imminent. A second
risk is that Government would not be strong enough to resist pressures to resume
policies of water subsidization and/or fail to impose and collect water charges.
Without sufficient funds to operate and maintain the new irrigation infrastructure,
the system will deteriorate again. To safeguard against such risk the project is
contributing to improvements in water management by establishing pilot projects
with water users' associations and technical assistance to aid in the establishment and
management of the pilot projects. A third risk is that the quality of construction
would not meet accepted standards. A properly staffed and trained project
implementation unit is planned to reduce that risk. A fourth risk relates to utilization
of energy for irrigation. Power is at present generated mainly from hydro-electric
sources and is completely subsidized for irrigation purposes. The risk is that
utilization of energy for irrigation is associated with deterioration of the
environment. Presently most of the generated energy comes from water originated
from Lake Sevan. Over-pumping of water from the lake has caused the water level
to fall which has had an adverse impact on the micro-climatic environment around
the lake. Imposition of water charges that cover the full cost of operations and
maintenance and energy costs is imperative to mitigate this risk.

I. BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Armenia, with a population of about 3.7 million, has the smallest territory among the
former Soviet republics. About one third of Armenia's population lives in the capital Yerevan, one third
in other urban centers, and about one third in the rural sector.
1.2          Before 1988, Armenia experienced relatively robust economic development, unparalleled
among other former Soviet republics, which created a diversified industrial infrastructure, a flourishing
agriculture, and a modem transport network. The breakup of the Soviet Union, however, has left the
country with an economic structure dependent on outside sources for energy, raw materials for industry,
and food for its people and livestock. The hostilities with neighboring Azerbaijan have greatly aggravated
the situation. However, recently there have been several positive developments in Armenia's relations
with its neighbors. Of greatest importance is the progress towards peace in the six year old Karabakh
conflict. In July 1994, Azerbaijan, Karabakh, and Armenia signed an agreement formalizing the ceasefire
and providing for the immediate commencement of negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement.
This development offers a real prospect of a lifting of the blockade in the near future. In addition,
rapidly growing trade with Iran, and increasing stability in Georgia have significantly eased Armenia's
isolation.
B. THE ECONOMY
1.3          Under the former centralized economic system of the Soviet Union, Armenia was a trade-
dependent economy and a producer of industrial intermediate and finished goods. Before the country's
independence in 1992, it had a negative trade balance, but this has grown up sharply after 1992: in 1991
the deficit was R 2.4 billion, and in the first half of 1993, it grew to R 116.0 billion (Table 1.1).
1.4          Gross domestic product (GDP) has been declining in the last several years, and in 1992,
GDP in constant 1990 prices declined by about 52% and further 15% in 1993. A somewhat more
moderate declining trend also occurred with the net material product (NMP). The NMP, in constant 1983
prices, has been declining since 1987, with only one year (1989) showing positive growth. In 1992 the
decline was almost 46%, and further 14% in 1993.
1.5          The economy is going through a difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-
based system; from a situation in which energy and water were practically free goods, to one in which
these resources have become increasingly expensive; from a system where decision-making was in the
hands of only a few top-level officials in Moscow and Yerevan, to an economic environment in which
central and local decisions have to be made daily on all levels of economic activity, and in which
economic efficiency and cost-effectiveness have become crucial elements. In addition to these difficulties,
which are common to all Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, the Armenian economy still has not
recovered from the effects of closed borders since 1991. The traumatic effects of the blockade on its
industry and employment, and years of rapid inflation that was first "imported" because the monetary
system was linked to the ruble zone until the end of 1993, also contributed to the economic difficulties.
When new domestic currency was later introduced, it was associated first with rapid inflation-fueled by



2                                                                                        Chapter 1
uncontrolled monetary policy', but in the second half of 1994, inflation has tempered down significantly
and the currency and the exchange rate have been quite stable.
1.6            Despite this difficult economic environment, significant economic reforms have been
implemented in Armenia. Apart from bread, which is rationed, prices for virtually all goods have been
liberalized. All agricultural land and a part of the retail sector have been privatized. State enterprises have
been given more autonomy and responsibility for self accounting. There is strong commitment on the part
of the Government to support the private sector and to continue privatization among most large
enterprises, but a general lack of resources, as well as other practical problems, are causing delays.
1.7           Before the start of hostilities with Azerbaijan, agriculture accounted for only 18% of the
NMP and for a similar percentage of the employment. With the land reform of 1991, the breakup of the
large agricultural production units, distribution of land to individual farmers, and the shortage of food
supplies, many people have begun to engage in farming either on a full-time or part-time basis. Increasing
unemployment (about 30% in 1992) has accelerated this development. The percentage of the labor force
in agriculture, which was only about 18% in 1990, grew to 23% in 1991 and to 30% in 1992. At the
same time, the agriculture sector's contribution to NMP, which was 17% in 1990, grew to 32% in 1991
and to about 45% in 1992.
1.8           Agricultural exports accounted for roughly 12 % of total export earnings in 1990 and 23 %
in 1992. This included mainly fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, brandies, champagnes, and
wines. By contrast, Armenia produced only 20% of its cereal requirements, 30% of its dairy
requirements, and 35% of its required meat products. Sugar and vegetable oils are all being imported.
Because the blockade limits Armenia's trade with the outside world, both agricultural production and
trade configurations have been changing drastically. In 1993 the land area under grain production
increased by about 200,000 ha over that of 1990, while vegetable, orchard, and vineyard areas have
decreased significantly. All agricultural imports and exports have been falling substantially due to the
loss of foreign markets and difficulties in sustaining production caused by material and energy shortages.
Because of growing food shortages, a large proportion of the new smallholders have turned to subsistence
farmring with emphasis on grain and vegetables. This trend is likely to continue.
I      Armenia's currency until recently was the Russian ruble, and the country was in fact in the ruble zone. As
inflation in Russia accelerted in 1992 and 1993, so was the inflation in Armenia. In the fall of 1993 Russia replaced the old
ruble with a new ruble and Armenia issued its own currency, the drum. However, the drum depreciated rapidly, and if the
exchange rate is a proxy to domestic inflation, then domestically inflation grew faster than 2,000% between November 1993
and April 1994. However, since May the drum have been relatively stable.

II. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
A. BACKGROUND
2.1          Topography greatly influences agriculture in Armenia. (For details regarding the
agriculture sector, see Annex 2) Although mountain peaks soar to 4,090 m above sea level (asl), land
is cultivated between the altitudes of 600 m and 2,500 m. Only about 2% of the land, however, is
located below 1,500 m elevation. Generally, the landform in the center and north comprises rocky, high
mountain ranges separating narrow, fertile valleys. Towards the south, the broad, flat, and fertile Ararat
Valley opens out along the left bank of the Araks River to form the border with Turkey. West and north
of the centrally located Aragat Mountain, and to the east around Sevan Lake, the landform is generally
rolling, but with many rocky outcrops. In the southeast, a few small, irregularly-shaped valleys are
fringed by high mountain ranges on both the borders with Azerbaijan.
2.2          Climatic conditions also greatly affect agriculture in Armenia, depending on the altitude.
Monthly precipitation is highest from April to June and lowest from July to September. The crop water
deficit between May and August ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm. Soil moisture alone is not enough to
compensate for this deficit; hence, irrigation is necessary for crop growth.
Agriculture in the Economy
2.3          Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, the agriculture sector in Armenia accounted for
about 18% of the NMP and a similar proportion of employment. The economy, by and large, was
intertwined with the Soviet economy, which made Armenia highly dependent on outside sources for
energy and raw materials for its industries, and on grain for its people and livestock. After Armenia's
independence in 1992, agriculture's share in NMP increased gradually to about 46% in 1993, and the
sector employed about 30% of the labor force also in 1993 because of the adverse effects of the blockade
on Armenian industries and services. Two reasons account for the growth of the agriculture sector: (a)
it provided critical food supplies for the population at a time when imports had been curtailed because
of the blockade; and (b) the country implemented a land reform program in 1991, under which large
agricultural production units were quickly broken up, and land distributed to small individual farmers.
As a result, there was fresh incentive to engage in agricultural production, despite the difficulties
transforming the economy into a market system.
Labor Force
2.4          Total employment in agriculture was estimated at 285,000 in 1990. With privatization in
1991, the number of people employed in agriculture rose sharply. Nearly 232,000 people were recorded
as living on newly established family farms, while those remaining on the other types of farms apparently
fell by only 173,000. Thus, the official statistics suggest an increase in total agricultural employment of
nearly 60,000 or 21 %.

B. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
2.5          Of Armenia's overall territory,
about 47%, or 1.4 million ha, are cultivable or    CULTIVATED   LAND
are used as pasture for livestock. The rest is               000  HA
rocky  wasteland,  mountains,  forest,  and
heathlands, suitable only for rough grazing
during the few summer months. Figure 2.1
shows the distribution of cultivable land at the    PerniAul CoPs
end of 1992.                                     Home

2.6          Historically,  agriculture  in
Armenia has had strong dependence on irrigation;
nearly  80%  of total crop  production  is                                     H Grzn
produced  with  irrigation.   Approximately                                      137
286,000 ha are at present irrigable throughout the
growing season.                               Permanent Pastures
666
2.7           The irrigated land is 80% surface
irrigated and 20%  pipe irrigated. Irrigation  F%ure 2.1
intensities range around 100%, but under-
irrigation is practiced in most irrigation schemes
because the rainfall is concentrated over a short period and because the irrigation system shows serious
signs of deterioration (for example, cracks in storage tanks and dams, and collapsed canals) and because
of inadequate management (pars. 3.13, 3.17, 3.21, 3.28, and 3.30), which has led to increased salinity
in sizable areas. Water resources are plentiful-distribution is the problem-and would allow further
expansion of irrigated agriculture.
2.8          Production efficiency and output levels are below those reached in developed countries.
Agricultural output in Armenia began to decline in the second half of the 1980s when econonmc
difficulties in the Soviet Union were increasing. But compounding the economic difficulties of the Soviet
Union due to eruption of the conflict with Azerbaijan agricultural production fell by 28% between 1988
and 1990, more than anywhere else in the FSU. Production started to recover, however, in 1991 with
implementation of the Land Reform, and continued to rise through 1993, when production was 13%
below that of the 1988 level. In fact, the 1993 crop output surpassed the 1988 levels.
2.9           Crops in Armenia accounted for 45% of total agricultural production in the 1980s. Crop
yields are generally low and, even accounting for harsh environmental conditions, the actual yields of
most crops are believed to be barely 50 - 60% of their potential. The country's cropping structure has
undergone a dramatic shift over the last three years (1991-93). The proportion of annual food crops
increased substantially at the expense of forage crops, perennial crops, and industrial crops. Insufficient
irrigation water is one of the main reasons for this situation.
2.10         Livestock accounted for 55 % of total agricultural production in the 1980s. This proportion
has decreased substantially in recent years due to the significant contraction of the livestock sector caused
by the need to import feed for pigs and poultry. In 1993, 73.59% of gross agricultural production
originated from the crop sector (Table 2.1). It is likely that this proportion will decrease somewhat

2.11            Livestock performance in the
late 1980s was only about 35%  to 40%  of
Western standards for milk and meat production. At that time, average fertility rates were 67% of those
in the West. The rates have deteriorated further in the past two years. Particularly alarming are
decreasing slaughter weights, unacceptably high mortality rates, long fattening periods, and feed
conversion ratios two to three times lower than in the West for broiler and pig production.
C. CONSUMPTION AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

far from  self-sufficient in             TABLE 2.2: Self-Sufficiency and Per Capita Food Consumption

share of its food consumption through domestic resources because demand for livestock products has
dropped by 60% to 70%. Dependence on imported flour has not been substantially reduced.
2.13         Through 1993, cereal production amounted to about 300,000 ton per year, and imports
amounted to about 450,000 to 500,000 tons per year. Before the decline in livestock production in the
last two years, Armenia required an additional 400,000 to 500,000 tons per year of cereals for animal
feed purposes. Because of the blockade over the last two years this requirement has not been met, and
is, among other factors, the most important reason for the decline of livestock production. The net
shortage of cereals for human consumption in the coming years might decrease slightly. If the price of
bread, which presently is the only commodity that is subsidized, is liberalized, then cereals consumption
would fall. An increase of 50% in bread prices would cause a reduction of about 10% in the estimated
consumption of cereals. Potatoes are another important staple of the Armenian population. Demand and
supply are approximately balanced at 250,000 tons per year or 60 kg per person. Until the 1988
earthquake approximately 20,000 tons of sugar per year were being produced domestically, and the
balance of about 100,000 tons was imported. After the 1988 earthquake the sole sugar factory was
dismantled and sold to Georgia. With the difficulty of import because of the blockade, sugar consumption
has fallen by two-thirds.
2.14         Until 1991 local production of milk and dairy products usually met less than half of the
country's needs. For meat, domestic production met almost two-thirds of consumption. The reduction of
commercial imports since the start of the blockade in 1991 and the large reduction in consumer incomes
have pushed up consumer prices and reduced effective demand for livestock products to much lower
levels compared to the end of the 1980s. Both meat and egg production have dropped by over 60% and
with low imports (or none in the case of eggs), consumption has fallen by more than 50%. Imports of
dry milk powder have continued, but at such a low level that consumption of milk products has fallen
by over 70%. For all these products, the combination of high income elasticity and halving of real income
over the past three years has accounted for over half of the fall in demand.
2.15         In adjusting to higher prices and reduced incomes, the population has shifted its
consumption to more potatoes and has maintained bread and fruit consumption close to the levels of the
mid-1980s. This has been facilitated by stable or increasing outputs of potatoes and fruits, as well as
increased grain production and Government priority given to negotiating and organizing the delivery of
food aid, including grain shipments. Thus, the population has been able to maintain a minimum level of
nutrition and caloric intake.



m. WATER RESOURCES AND THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR
A. WATER RESOURCES
The Main Sources
3.1           Armenia has limited rainfall, surface water, and groundwater. Average rainfall is about
620 mm per year, but varies considerably with altitude. The total estimated volume of annual precipitation
is about 18.4 billion m3.'
Surface Water
3.2           Surface water is available in 18 principal river basins. Most of the runoff, close to 60%,
flows to the four largest rivers (Araks, Debed, Kasakh/Sevdjur, and Akhurian), and an additional 25%
to the other three major rivers (Razdan, Arpa, and Vorotan). Water from the Araks River is shared with
Turkey.
3.3            The total runoff is about 8.7 billion in3 per year. Of this amount, 1.3 billion m3 per year
is useable by neighboring countries. Of the remaining 7.4 billion m3 per year, about 13 percent, or
980 million m3, is stored in 74 irrigation dams (about 1.1 billion m3 live storage). This stored water,
together with 1.4 billion m3 diverted by run-of-river and pump schemes, comprises the present 2.4 billion
m3 total average volume available for irrigation from surface water resources.
Groundwater
3.4           Annual replenishment of groundwater is estimated at about 4.2 billion m3, of which about
1.4 billion m3 reappear in springs within the country. The rest, 2.8 billion m3, comprise three main
categories:
(a)    Groundwater resources pumped by 2,105 irrigation and drainage wells, most of which
are in the Ararat Valley.
(b)    Numerous industrial and municipal wells in various parts of the country.
(c)    Springs and aquifers reappearing outside Armenia's borders. At least 500 million m3 (18
percent) of the 2.8 billion m3 are still available, and could be used almost without causing
reduction of spring or river flows.
Annual water resources include the following: rainfall, 18.4 billion m3; runoff through rivers, 7.4 billion m3;
groundwater, 0.5 billion m3. Water resources are not entirely mutually exclusive. Both rivers and groundwater resources
originate from precipitation and, in years when precipitations are low, the stock of groundwater falls as well.



10                                                                                       Chapter 3
Water Use
3.5            Annual use of water amounts to about 4.0 billion m3. Irrigation is the largest user with
2.5 billion in3, followed by public water supply (including irrigation of gardens) with about 750 million
m3 and industrial water supply with 310 million m3. Substantial amounts of the utilized water is lost along
the conveyance and distribution systems; therefore, the total annual consumption is far below 50% of the
available water resources. Potentially, with large conservation efforts along the existing systems and the
development of new, unutilized water resources, at least 100,000 more land could be irrigated than at
present.
Dminage
3.6            Serious drainage problems exist in the low lying, light, and medium textured soils of the
Ararat Valley. The high groundwater table in these areas, some of it under artesian pressure, is causing
varying degrees of soil salinity. The area affected is about 100,000 ha. Approximately half of that area
has already been drained by tile and plastic pipes. Open drains have been excavated, natural drainage
ways deepened, and vertical pump drainage systems installed.2 However, the operation of some drainage
wells is essential to avoid resalinization of some of the reclaimed land. Of the remaining 43,000 ha
requiring treatment of some sort, 23,000 ha are classified as slightly saline, 11,000 ha moderately to
strongly saline, and some 9,000 ha are considered severely alkaline.
Water Quality
3.7            There is a range of water quality in the country. From unpolluted springs and snow melt
in the high elevations, to untreated or partially treated sewage in the Razdan River, to saline groundwater
in the Ararat Valley. The quality is deteriorating; power shortages and lack of funds make it difficult to
operate and maintain existing water and sewage treatment plants near cities, and to operate pumped
drainage systems in agricultural areas.
3.8            Water in storage reservoirs is often polluted by untreated sewage and return flows from
septic tanks from villages in the watershed. Groundwater quality, except for some parts of the Ararat
Valley, is generally good. The Razdan River carries flows from Lake Sevan and serves as recipient for
treated and untreated sewage from Yerevan and other cities along its course. Although the river water
is used for irrigation in the Ararat Valley, there have been no reports of outbreak of waterborne diseases
due to water pollution, and there have been no reports of any ill effects on the quality of crops in the
Ararat Valley.
3.9            Two Government ministries test the quality of water in Armenia.3  The Ministry of
Environment operates five laboratories that test the quality of drinking water and nine laboratories test
the quality of treated sewage. The Ministry also supervises the operation of industrial quality laboratories,
2      Some of the pumped drainage is returned to the canal systems and reused for irrigadon.
3      Water quality is tested according to four categories: (a) taste, color, etc.; (b) chemical content; (c) microbiological
constituents; and (d) degree of radioactivity.

which test plant effluent. The Ministry of Agriculture operates several laboratories for testing the quality
of irrigation water.
B. IRRIGATION
The Conveyance System
3.10          Water is supplied to most of the irrigation schemes in Armenia by eight major conveyance
irrigation systems. All main canals and most of the secondary canals were originally lined using different
types of lining.4 Most of the canal network is in unsatisfactory condition. Due to landslides, erosion, and
encroaching vegetation, unlined canals have lost their cross-sections. The condition of lined canals is not
much better; in many cases long stretches of lining have deteriorated and, in some places, have
completely disappeared.
3.11          In a number of locations, the reinforced concrete in large aqueducts (20-30 m3 per sec)
has deteriorated, and water is leaking through the walls and floors of the structures and through cracks
and joints. In some locations, the collapse of the aqueduct appears imminent, putting the entire canal
system in jeopardy.
3.12          The deterioration of the conveyance system may be attributed to a combination of causes:
inadequate design, lack of quality control during construction, bad and insufficient construction material,
lack of maintenance, normal aging, adverse climatic conditions, and possibly corrosive water. It is
estimated that more than half the water is lost between source and farm gates.
Pumping Stations and Pressure Pipes
3.13          About half of the irrigated area (130,000 ha) requires some kind of pump lifts. In
sprinkler-irrigated areas, the pumps draw water from gravity conduits and provide the required pressure.
Other areas require pump lifts from the water source to the head of a gravity distribution network from
where the water is conveyed to the command areas, or to second pumping stations to lift it to another
distribution network higher up.
3.14          Altogether some 360 pumping stations, with approximately 900 pumps, provide the
energy input for irrigation. The installed capacity of the electric motors is approximately 440 megawatts.
Capacities of the pumping stations range from 100 liters per second to 16 m3/sec. The annual power
consumption of the irrigation sector is reaching about 500-600 million kwh, a drastic cut from the more
than 1.1 billion kwh that was consumed before 1992.
3.15          The condition of most of the major pumping stations is unsatisfactory. Neglect is evident
everywhere. Rehabilitation and replacement of pumping equipment is required to save energy and increase
the reliability of the equipment. However, despite the dilapidated condition of the stations, they seem to
be operating as well as can be expected, and the rehabilitation of the pumping equipment could be
4      Cast-in-site reinforced concrete, precast sections, concrete, and paving with concrete slabs and stones.



12                                                                               Chapter 3
postponed to a later stage.
3.16         Some of the pressure pipelines that convey water from the pumping stations to the
distribution systems are at the end of their useful life. Others are in critical condition because of
corrosion. Approximately 54,000 ha would be affected if the pipelines fail. Design standards used for
laying and maintaining steel pipes are unsatisfactory. Black steel pipes are laid on concrete supports above
ground without any internal or external protection against corrosion.
3.17         A large portion of the pumping schemes, however, lift the water far above 100-150 m,
which is an economic threshold limit that justifies production of typical crops grown in Armenia. Each
lift of 1 m3 to 100 m consumes about 0.5 kwh. With an average gross water requirement of 12,000 in3
per ha, a 100 m lift causes power consumption to reach between about 5,000 and 6,000 kwh per ha.
Lifting water beyond the threshold of about 100 m is considered an insurmountable economic burden on
the farm budget. Consequently, many pumping schemes are uneconomical, and if they cannot be replaced
by the gravity system, they should gradually be phased out of the irrigated commnands.
Tubewells
3.18         About 1,900 wells supply 700-800 million m3 of groundwater annually for drinking,
industrial use, and irrigation in the Ararat Plain.5 About half the wells are irrigation wells. All water from
these wells is lifted by submersible pumps.
3.19         An inventory compiled by the Department of Water Supply and Irrigation (DWSI) in 1992
found the condition of the mechanical and electrical equipment in many of the wells unsatisfactory.
Approximately, two-thirds of the pump sets were not operating. New statistics for 1993 confirm that their
condition has further deteriorated.
3.20         The submersible pumps used in these wells are Russian made. Their life expectancy,
under normal working and maintenance conditions, is said to be four years. This is about half the average
Western standard. The actual situation observed in the field seems to be even worse. Pump sets are
installed without any protective devices against power surges. As a result, motors burn out, sometimes
after only a few months' service. Even with a normal supply of electricity, pumps seldom last four years;
two to three years seems to be the norm. Electrical installations at the well head are also substandard.
Cables from transformers to the electric motors are unprotected, which causes frequent short circuits and
damages the motors.
3.21         The accelerated deterioration of pump sets is also caused by cavitation on the impellers
and corrosion of metal parts. The space between the casing of the well and the well bore is left open,
exposing the gravel pack around the "screen" to the intrusion of dirt and mud. Design specifications for
installing wells, drawn up by the Water Planning Institute6, are sound. The problem seems to be in the
construction of the well, the equipment and materials used, the shoddy workmanship, and lack of
adequate maintenance. Screens are made locally of steel pipe. Holes are drilled into the pipe instead of
5     Approximately 860 wells are artesian; the balance requires pumping.

using slotted stainless steel or fiberglass screens. The screens are not made of corrosion-resistant material,
and they are installed without protective devices as is normally required in other countries.
3.22          Because of a lack of control and metering equipment at the well head, the operating
efficiency of the tubewells cannot be measured, and monitoring the performance of equipment is
impossible.
Storage Reservoirs and Dams
3.23          Water for irrigation comes from rivers and lakes and in the Ararat Plain, as well as from
groundwater. Surface runoff is stored in 24 major reservoirs, which supply water to approximately
92,000 ha. These reservoirs have a storage capacity of 932 million mn3 and a live storage of 840 mnillion
ni3. There are five more reservoirs storing 145 million n3 water for municipal and industrial use. An
additional 54 smaller reservoirs have a total storage capacity of approximately 300 million mn3. Of the
total 83 reservoirs, 74 are under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and have a total storage
capacity of 977 million m3. The largest existing reservoir has 525 million m3 capacity (Akhurian). It
provides water for about 30,000 ha in Armenia, and is shared with Turkey.
3.24          Fifteen of the irrigation dams are considered in need of major repairs, and some even
require urgent attention to avoid dam failures if operated at full capacity. The causes of their precarious
condition include design errors, construction faults, and lack of maintenance.
On-Farm Irrigation Systems and Efficiencies
3.25          The division of collective and state farms under the 1991 land reform (para. 2.3), into
some 300,000 small holdings, each with a number of farm plots, has created a serious water distribution
problem. Part of the land served by the closed (pressure) systems is farmed communally, in a similar way
as before the land reform. However, many of the pressure systems were abandoned because they were
not able to serve the thousands of new small plots due to the lack of an effective distribution system. In
many of the gravity systems, water distribution is chaotic as well. Up to now, no formal network of
authority to implement on-farm infrastructure has been developed, which has resulted in the inefficient,
randomly-placed installation of earthen delivery ditches.
3.26          The main difficulty is that the irrigation delivery systems were designed to service large
farms which may have irrigated 50 to 400 ha from a single headgate or canal outlet. Presently, the same
outlet may service 400 or more farmers, which in many cases, makes it difficult to deliver necessary
irrigation water to farmers who are not in close proximity to the canal outlet. In some instances, earth
ditches must be installed across one or more adjacent farm plots. Some adjacent farmers will not allow
ditch easements through their plots because of seepage and/or the loss of land. The result of these kinds
of conflicts is that many farms receive insufficient irrigation water during the irrigation season. Further
consequences are that some farmers located even a minimal distance from the existing outlets have no
way of directly receiving water; no dependable scheduling technique is used to benefit all farms. In some
areas, water distribution is erratic, and many irrigators have broken concrete canals and pipes at points
closer than the originally installed outlets in order to have better access to irrigation water. When they
are not irrigating, they close the holes in the canal or pipe with soil or sod, which leaks. As the number



14                                                                               Chapter 3
of these of-takes in a canal system increases, the delivery efficiency decreases.
3.27         The most problematic areas of the irrigation systems are those that depend on electric
pumps to lift water to gravity systems which irrigate 42% of the total fanned land in Armenia.
Unpredictable blackouts and low voltage from the shortage of electricity have paralyzed much of the
pumping capacity, leaving farmers in limbo or entirely without water. This past irrigation season, the
Ministry of Energy, due to lack of resources, was able to supply only 46% of the electricity needed to
meet the pumping requirements for crop production. This predicament left many farmers with minimal
water, and farmers at the end of most pump systems had no water at all.
3.28         Despite the nominal establishment of water users' associations (WUAs), there is little
evidence in the field that such organizations actually function. In reality, water users are organized by
villages, with outlet boundaries corresponding to village boundaries. Last year, during the first irrigation
season after privatization, the Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (OME) of the Ministry of
Agriculture made agreements with each individual farm unit specifying the amount of water the unit
would receive and the water fees for the season. The OME was overwhelmed by approximately 260,000
agreements, and the Government was disappointed by a collection rate of a mere 27% of the water
charges in 1992. Therefore, the Government instructed OME to make agreements this year with village
councils for delivery and charges. Although the Government expected the village councils to execute
agreements with individual farmers and collect the water charges, this has only partially been realized.
C. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY OF BANK ASSISTANCE
3.29         Agriculture has been recognized by the Government as one of the critical sectors in need
of assistance for two reasons: (a) the sector employs about a third of the labor force (para 2.3), and (b)
the sector provides food which, in the context of the country's trade configuration, is difficult to obtain
tirough imports in the short to medium term. Because the agriculture sector is heavily dependent on
irrigation, and because the dilapidated condition of the irrigation infrastructure constrains both
development of the sector and profitability of existing production, the Bank and the Government have
agreed that rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure is the first priority in assistance to the sector.
Bank assistance would be confined to areas that would have the greatest impact on efficiency in
agricultural production. Areas that have been identified are those that are irrigated by gravity or that
require minimal pumping, and that under certain cropping patterns can provide for profitable production
at the given border prices.
D. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT
3.30         Investments in water resources have played a major role in the Bank's efforts to help
countries to reduce poverty and to upgrade living conditions7. Irrigation systems have expanded food
production, improved nutrition and increased rural incomes. Bank assistance has evolved from simple
project lending toward country focused support for elaborating and implementing subsectoral strategies.
These strategies are developed through sector work and subsectoral reviews in which priorities are

14/1, may 3, 1993.

articulated and performance is analyzed. The proposed Irrigation Rehabilitation Project incorporates the
Bank experience in irrigation projects. Hence, special attention was paid in the project design and concept
to restructuring of the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system; quality of construction; cost
recovery; adequacy of the water management; the need to complete the country's water master plan that
will incorporate intersectoral impact of water development investments; and environmental issues.
3.31         Two projects have been approved so far for Armenia: an institution-building project
(Loan 3585-AM), approved in March 1993, and an earthquake reconstruction project (Loan 2562-AM),
approved in January 1994. The institution-building project has been slow to take off mainly because the
Armenians lack experience in implementing Bank-financed projects. However, recently the pace of
implementation has improved due to more intensive supervision and guidance on the part of the Bank.
The earthquake reconstruction project just recently became effective, and small amounts have already
been disbursed. An implementation unit was established for that loan about six months before Board
approval. The experience gained in establishing the implementation unit is important for future Bank
projects, especially in regard to administration, accounting, and procedures. The significant success of
the implementation unit was demonstrated in the adjustment of local staff to the procedures of IDA
financed project requirements and in the confidence they gained in implementing a Bank-financed project.
The implementation unit was initially administered and guided by an expatriate, but local staff are now
managing all functions of the unit successfully, including procurement and disbursements. Of particular
interest is the experience gained by the unit in preparing bids and the enormous interest shown by local
state enterprises in bidding for works and supply of goods under the earthquake reconstruction project.






IV. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.1          The main objectives of this project are to assist Armenia in maintaining its level of
irrigated agriculture production and to improve the country's water resource management.
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMIENT
4.2           The Government considers the proposed project to be a priority investment in agriculture
(para 3.29). It supports the development objectives of agriculture in Armenia identified in the Bank's
Agriculture Sector Report (June 1994). The key elements in this regard are to: (a) expedite completion
of the transition to a market-based system, including privatization of food production, processing, and
marketing; (b) change the role of Government towards the provision of research, education, extension,
and market information; (c) improve the efficiency of production, processing, and distribution of food
and agrieulture products; and (d) improve the competitiveness of Armenian agricultural products in
international markets. Following the priorities identified in the Bank's Agriculture Sector Report (June
1994), the sector review proposed an assistance strategy that includes (a) provision of critical inputs for
agriculture production; (b) support to the Ministry of Agriculture to implement a consistent transition
program in food and agriculture; (c) development of institutions and support facilities needed for a
market-based privatized agriculture; and (d) capital investments for the development of competitive
production, processing and marketing, and related infrastructure (especially the irrigation system). Hence,
investments proposed under the project are intended to enable agriculture to maintain and increase
production capacity which has been eroded because of severe deterioration of the irrigation infrastructure.
The project would also support increasing the role of irrigation beneficiaries in determining their water
needs and their financing of the operation and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure. Under the
proposed project, the beneficiaries would gradually take over water distribution and maintenance of the
conveyance networks. The Bank strategy also emphasizes the rehabilitation and protection of the
environment, which has been severely damaged by the deterioration of the water conveyance systems.
The environment is now threatened by a possible collapse of several irrigation dams (psra. 3.28).
C. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
4.3           The project consists of four main components: (a) rehabilitation of 12 irrigation schemes
and the Ararat Valley groundwater network; (b) establishment of pilot projects for water distribution and
new WUAs; (c) financing incremental operations & maintenance (O&M) costs of the irrigation
infrastructure; and (d) technical assistance, including the establishment of a project implementation unit,
assistance to update the Water Master Plan, training, and assistance to improve irrigated crop production.
The investments related to the rehabilitation program make up about 78% of the project's estimated base
costs; contribution to O&M about 11 %; the water management, including pilot projects, about 5 %; and
technical assistance, including the PIU, about 5%.'
I     Other and rounding amount to 1%.

D. THE RATIONALE FOR PROJECT DESIGN
General
4.4          The project covers an area of about 164,700 ha (about 60% of the Armenian irrigated
land), located mainly in the Ararat Valley, in the western part of the country. About 15% of the project
areas are also in the northwest part of the country (Map 25388). With the exception of some of the
northeast areas, where some of the irrigated lands are at elevation of +1800 m as], the rest of the
irrigated land is at elevation ranging from 800 to 1000 m asl.
4.5          The selection of the project areas in the Ararat Valley was an obvious choice. It is the
breadbasket of Armenia and the most fertile and productive agricultural area in the country. However,
the arid Ararat Valley cannot produce crops without irrigation, and the irrigation system is now in decay.
The Ararat Valley is also in close proximity to the capital Yerevan, where about one third of the
country's population lives, dependent on the Valley for most of their food supply. Most of the other
irrigated agriculture areas of the country are at higher elevations, and do not fit into the selection criteria
for the project (para. 4.6).
Criteria Used in Selection of Project Components
4.6          The selection of the project's components is based on the following criteria:
(a)    Energy Savings. Schemes have been chosen on the basis of acceptable cost-benefit
utilization of energy for pumping water. Investments that would replace pumping
economically by gravity irrigation were given highest priority.
(b)    Water Savings. Those schemes where rehabilitation would reduce water losses are given
high priority, provided the value of the lost water is larger than the investments to repair
them. Based on this criterion, substantial cost savings could be realized by rehabilitating
leaking canal sections and replacing large diameter pressure pipes that have reached the
end of their useful life. At present, water losses in conveyance from the source of water
to the farmer's field reduce the areas which can be irrigated. Leaking canal sections can
damage fields, houses, and infrastructures adjacent to the structures. The rehabilitation
works are located on reaches of canals where the banks and the lining are destroyed, or
where there is imminent danger that old and rusted pressure pipes will burst.
(c)    Irrigation at the Critical Growing Period. Rehabilitation of schemes which provide
supplementary irrigation is a priority because water late in the growing season is critical
for plants and production. Rehabilitation of schemes that provide supplementary water
is economical provided the investment cost is less than the value of reduced yields caused
by insufficient irrigated water. Such cases include the supply of supplementary water to
three of the Ararat conveyance schemes (Lower Razdan, Octemberian, and Artashat)
through pumping from the Sevdjur River (Arevshat and Mkchian), and using return flows
through pumping from the drainage collectors, as well as restoring supplementary
irrigation from local boreholes. The use of water stored in reservoirs that fully dominate
the nearby command areas is also essential for supplementary irrigation.

(d)    Assistance to the Earthguake Reconstruction Zone. Rehabilitation works of the irrigation
infrastructure in the earthquake zone around Spitak (Getik scheme) is a priority, given
the vast destruction of the irrigation facilities in 1988.
(e)    Danger to Life and Property Downstream of Storage Dams. Rehabilitation of storage
dams is a priority if they are in a significant stage of deterioration and constitute
substantial danger to life and property; and if they are being used for economic purposes.
Following the above-mentioned criteria, the proposed project would finance rehabilitation
of four of the most seriously affected storage dams. Studies would be carried out under
the proposed project to identify and appraise additional dams that constitute significant
risk to life and property for inclusion in future Bank-financed projects. The recent
breakup of the Artic dam illustrate the urgent need to carry out studies and rehabilitate
Armenian dams. In May 1994 the embankment of the Artic dam broke across a width of
50 m, flooding two villages, killing several people and sweeping away many animals.
Many other dams are in critical condition similar to the Artic dam.
Considerations in the Choice of Certain Components
4.7          The following rationale was used to determine the technology and institutional
organization for the project:
(a)   Introduction of Modern Tubewell Technology. Investment in modern tubewell technology
is deemed justified if the incremental benefits are greater than the investment costs.
Existing wells are badly constructed and do not follow standards established for their
construction by the DWSI (for details, see Annex 3) (Annex 4, paras. 18 to 21). Motors
have been installed without protection from power surges, and pump impellers wear out
because they were installed without adequate filter screens in the wells. A number of
these wells cannot be rehabilitated, and new wells will have to be drilled. If new
electrical equipment with protective devices against voltage fluctuations is installed, the
life of the pumps can be extended by four to five years.
(b)   Investment in Prefabricated Concrete Lining of Canals and Pump Maintenance. Given
that plants and workshops that manufacture concrete lining or maintain pumps already
exist in Armenia, some investments in their restructuring are justified if they do not
compromise competitive procurement of the manufactured products, or if the
manufactured products are cheaper than similar imported concrete linings, or if there is
less need to import new pumps.
(c)    O&M  Costs. After the breakup of the collective farming system, under which the
Government was responsible for O&M of the irrigation infrastructure and its financing,
it is necessary to reorganize both the O&M system and its financing. Presently the
Government still manages the O&M system but it provide only a fraction of the O&M
needs due to insufficient budgetary allocation. The budgetary allocation is partially
dependent on revenues from collection of O&M charges from water users, but such
collection is in its infancy and covers only a fraction of the budgetary needs. If financial
resources for O&M provisions continue to be unsatisfactory, there is a strong possibility



20                                                                             Chapter 4
that the country would need another irrigation rehabilitation project in a short time.
Hence, if the project will include a financing component to cover incremental O&M costs
until water charges collection is established and able to cover the needed funds, there
would likely to be substantial savings in terms of preventing long-lasting damage to the
irrigation infrastructure of the country. It has been assessed that with undertaking other
measures proposed under the project, there are good prospects that collection of water
charges will improve and that in about five years' time, the necessary O&M costs can
be recovered.
(d)    Project Implementation Unit. Presently, the ability of the Government to carry out
imnplementation of the IDA-financed project without outside assistance is extremely
limited. Assistance under the project for managing competitive bidding, construction
work, procurement of equipment, contracting, supervision, and cost accounting is
essential for the success of the project. It is believed that this will be more efficient if it
is carried out under an autonomous project implementation unit (PIU) contracted under
a single contract to an internationally renowned firm.
E. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Irrigation Rehabilitation Program
4.8          The project consists of 12 irrigation schemes, including groundwater development (see
Annex 4 for details) (US $28 million).
4.9          There are four types of rehabilitation works under the project:
(a)    Rehabilitation of eight major conveyance systems (US $18.5 million), including canals,
aqueducts, siphons and hydraulic structures in eight major irrigation schemes: Shirak,
Talin, Abovian (Kotaik), Arzni Shamiram, Lower Razdan, Octemberian, Artashat, and
Getik. The area covered under this category is about 151,400 ha (92% of the project
area, Map 25389 and Map 25390).
(b)    Replacement of gumps and pressure pipelines (US $9.5 million). This category includes
four pumping schemes, of which one, the Vorotan, is an independent scheme that covers
about 1,600 ha (1% of the project area). The other three-Azizbekov, Mkchian, and
Arevshat-are within two of the eight major conveyance schemes to be rehabilitated
(Map 25390).
(c)    Rehabilitation or reolacement of about 650 tubewell and pumps (US $6.9 million). These
are located in the Ararat Valley, within the command areas of Octemberian, Lower
Razdan, and Artashat conveyance schemes.
(d)    The rehabilitation of four storage schemes (reservoirs) (US $1.3 million). Three of these
storage schemes-in Aparan, Mantash, and Sarnakhpiur-have their own command areas
totaling about 11,700 ha (7% of the project area). One storage scheme (Karnout) is part

of the larger Shirak conveyance scheme (Map 25391).
4.10         The Eight Major Conveyance Schemes (for details, see Annex 1, Table 1). The condition
of much of the conveyance network is unsatisfactory (paras. 3.12 to 3.14). In the reinforced concrete
aqueducts, the concrete has disintegrated and water is leaking through the walls and floor of the
aqueducts. In some places enterprising farmers have made use of a free water supply, and in others the
collapse of the aqueduct appears imminent. The rehabilitation works under the project include some 141.5
km of main canals, 523.2 kn of secondary canals, 1,411.0 km of tertiary canals and 548.5 km of
nonpressure pipes, of which 412.9 km are made of concrete; the balance of 135.6 km is made of steel.
4.11         The Pumoing Schemes (for details, see Annex 1, Table 2). In all the four schemes
proposed for rehabilitation, pressure pipelines conveying water from the pumping stations to the distribu-
tion systems and some of the pumps are in critical condition. The replacement of pressure pipes and some
of the pumps are included in the project. However, radical anti-corrosion steps are required to be
introduced promptly, to avoid the same situations in the future, in these and other schemes. Protecting
new, as well as existing pipelines that still can be recovered through lining, coating, and other anti-
corrosive measures will be financed under the project.
4.12         The works required in the four pumping schemes are as follows:
(a)    The Vorotan Pumping Scheme. The rehabilitation works within the pumping systems and
the pressure pipelines of the scheme include: (i) replacement of 2,015 m of 720 mm steel
pressure pipeline, of eight mm wall thickness; and (ii) replacement or rehabilitation of
three pumps.
(b)    The Azizbekov I and II Pumping Stations. The rehabilitation works include replacement
of 2,800 m of 630 mm steel pressure pipeline, of 8 mm wall thickness.
(c)    The Mkchian I & II Pumping Stations. The rehabilitation works within the pumping
systems and the pressure pipelines of the scheme include: (i) replacement of 18,000 m
of 1,850 mm steel pressure pipeline, of 14 mm wall thickness, and 1,784 m of 1,800 mm
steel pressure pipeline, of 14 mm wall thickness; and (ii) replacement or rehabilitation
of 15 pumps.
(d)    The Arevshat I & II Pumping Complex. The rehabilitation works within the Arevshat I
& II pumping systems and the pressure pipelines of the scheme include: (i) replacement
of 15,800 m of 1,420 mm steel pressure pipeline, of 12 mm wall thickness; and (ii)
replacement or rehabilitation of seven pumps.
4.13         The Tubewells Rehabilitation Program (for details, see Annex 1, Table 3). The proposed
reconstruction and rehabilitation program would be carried out in three years and would include: (a)
drilling of 150 new boreholes, in strict compliance with existing design specifications; (b) rehabilitation
of 300 existing boreholes; (c) supply and installation of 250 new pump sets, including the required
metering and control equipment; (d) supply of spare parts for the existing Russian pumps, to enable repair
and overhaul of approximately 400 pump sets; and, (e) installation of 650 new and rehabilitated pump
sets.

4.14         Rehabilitation of Storage Dam Schemes (for details, see Annex 1, Table 4). The project
would provide financing for the rehabilitation of four storage dams that are in extremely precarious
condition. The rehabilitation program under the project would include repairs as follows:
(a)    The Aparan Storage Dam: The concrete lining of the spillway tunnel and the chute is
completely destroyed in many sections. Also, in various sections along the outlet tunnel
the steel lining has disintegrated and water is leaking into the tunnel; the regulation gates
and their lifting gear need to be replaced and the cone valve repaired.
(b)    The Mantash Storage Dam: There are numerous cracks and serious deterioration of the
outlet conduit, with muddy water leaking into the conduit. The accumulation of mud at
the bottom of the conduit is an indication that an internal process of erosion and piping
is taking place. The concrete in the intake tower, the spillway and the spillway channel
also require rehabilitation. The irrigation outlet pipe is corroded, and the regulation
valves should be repaired.
(c)    The Sharnakhpiur Storage Dam: Presently the condition of the dam requires that the
spillway be reconstructed, and a stilling basin at the end of the chute provided. Strong
vibrations endanger the outlet works. The intake should be redesigned and the gates and
valves rehabilitated.
(d)    The Karnout Storafe Dam: The dam embankment is in the process of settling. The
elevation of the dam crest is some 80 cm below the original construction level and only
90 cm above the maximum water level. The original wave wall has also settled. The
concrete of the outlet conduit is cracked in several places and there is leakage of muddy
water into the gallery. This indicates serious internal erosion (piping) in the dam
structure, which is unsafe according to international standards, and which poses risk of
failure.
Pilot Projects to Improve Water Management
4.15         The cost of assistance to improve the water management is estimated at about US $2.47
million (Annex 1, Table 5). Presently there is no effective institution to manage the water distribution
to about 300,000 farmers (paras. 3.25 to 3.28, and Annex 5). Over time, WUAs should be formed and
given responsibility for O&M and water charge collection. A two-tiered structure should be developed,
with outlet-level water user groups of 10-15 farmers, organized into a village-level umbrella association.
Present conditions are unsuitable for investment in forming WUAs, as the physical structure does not
support user groups, and the village councils are not suitable for the aggregating role. Nonetheless, under
the pilot project, programs would be developed in about 400 villages that introduce low-cost methods of
dividing command areas into manageable units, and would try different techniques and methods to
determine which approach is most appropriate for Armenian farmers. Second, reorienting the Operational
Maintenance Enterprise (OME) of the DWSI and village councils will create a better institutional climate
for WUAs to develop. Third, as the OME gains institutional experience as a service organization, it will
learn which O&M tasks can be delegated to local offices and eventually to WUAs, thus increasing the
underlying rationale for such groups. Technical assistance will be structured to facilitate these processes
and direct resources and attention appropriately.



The Project                                                                          23
Incremental O&M
4.16         The allocation for the incremental O&M component under the project is US $5 million
(Annex 1, Table 6). The condition of conveyance structures, pumping equipment, and tubewells is very
poor because of long-term neglect compounded by poor construction (paras. 4.10 to 4.13). In recent
months, staff has not been paid, and maintenance materials, such as paint to protect steel pipes, could
not be procured. Clearly, it is only a matter of time before large parts of the system completely fail and
irrigation in many parts of the country cease. The most serious consequences of such failures would be
in the Ararat valley where no crops can be grown without irrigation.
4.17         Investments in the rehabilitation of the most adversely-affected dams and canals and the
procurement and installation of pipes and equipment will not be worthwhile if the rest of the system
breaks down because of lack of routine maintenance. The present expenditures on staff, temporary labor,
and materials for routine maintenance and small repairs, for the entire irrigation system in the country,
is estimated at some US $3 million per year and additional US $2 million to US $3 million would be
necessary to cover the actual needs. During project implementation, collection of water charges is
expected to be better than at present through assistance to improve water management and distribution
systems. Accordingly water charges to be collected would cover 40% of the O&M costs by December
31, 1995 of project implementation2, 60% by December 31, 1996, 70% by December 31, 1997, and
100% by the project's closing date. With this schedule there would be a shortfall in maintenance funds
of approximately US $5 million over the four-year project period. This shortfall would be covered from
project funds. At negotiations it was agreed that collection of water charges would cover the O&M costs
according to the schedule mentioned above (para. 7.1 (a)).
Technical Assistance for Training and for Irrigated Crop Production
4.18         A sum of about US $630,000 has been allocated for this purpose (Annex 1, Table 7).
Technical assistance would be focused on subjects with which local professionals are unfamiliar and are
relevant to the project success and management. All experts will be on relatively short-term assignments
to enable the transfer of technology to local staff. In addition some technical assistance is required in
areas of irrigated crop production, such as virology, bacteriology, and immunology, to prepare a national
program of sanitation of the high-value crop areas.
Assistance to Update the Country's Water Master Plan and Preparation of the Next Project
4.19         The cost of updating and modifying the master plan, including preparation of the next
followup irrigation project, is about US $500,000 (Annex 1, Table 7). In June 1993 DWSI issued a
preliminary draft of the water master plan for the country. The plan deals with overall water resource
development in Armenia in the next 40 years. The plan assesses the water balance of both runoff and
groundwater resources and compares this with the estimated increasing demand for water from all sectors
of the economy. The detailed assessment under the master plan covers all administrative and hydrological
levels. However, the present draft master plan is not yet based on sound economic considerations. The
plan therefore needs to be scrutinized on the basis of the economic and financial realities in Armenia;
2     Including incremental costs.



24                                                                             Chapter 4
substantial modifications are likely to emerge. On the basis of the updated master plan, a followup project
would be prepared under the financing of the proposed project. This would include rehabilitation of
additional dams that were already identified but not yet appraised, and investments in irrigation
components yielding high economic and social benefits, considered of high priority for the country.
Project Implementation Unit
4.20         The cost of setting up and operating the PIU during the project implementation period
is estimated at about US $1.5 million (Annex 1, Table 8). The Ministry of Agriculture would have
overall responsibility for the project. It would delegate responsibilities for project implementation to an
independent PIU. The PIU would coordinate planning and design work, the day-to-day supervision on
the construction sites, and be directly responsible for procurement and contracting. It would be
responsible for the financial management of the project, including the preparation and submission of
disbursement claims, and liaison with the Bank, including reporting to the Bank. The unit would also
carry out monitoring and evaluation of the project and manage the technical assistance component (see
paras. 5.1 to 5.11).
F. PROJECT COSTS
4.21         The proposed project is estimated to cost, based on 1993 prices, about US $57 million,
including physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US $46
million or about 78% of the total project cost. The cost of imported equipment and materials reflect
current market prices of suppliers in the FSU republics. These prices are lower than international market
prices, and the suppliers of the FSU are known sources to the Armenian planning authorities. Costs of
civil works have been estimated from experiences of the DWSI. Physical contingencies were calculated
at 20% of the investment costs because of significant uncertainty regarding the civil works costs and
procurement of goods from FSU countries. Price contingencies are based on the Bank's guidelines,
starting at virtual no inflation in 1994; 2% for 1995; 2.5% for 1996; 2.7% for 1997; and, 2.5% for
1998. The project cost is denominated solely in U.S. dollar terms because the instability of the ruble
during appraisal made it inadvisable to quote prices in that currency. In addition, in November 1993,
Armenia decided to issue its own currency, the drum. The underlying assumption is that in the medium
term, the rate of inflation would be offset by the rate of devaluation, and the cost of the local component
in real terms can be denominated in U.S. dollar terms without significant bias. Physical and price
contingencies combined make up about 23% of the project's base cost. Import duties, taxes, and other
levies are not included in project costs, since it is assumed that investments under the proposed project
are exempt from import duties and taxes. Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1, and details are
presented in Annex 1, Tables 10-13.

G. FINANCING
4.22            The Borrower for all components of the proposed project is the Government of Arnenia.
The IDA credit in the amount of US $43.0 Million equivalent would be lent to the Government of the
Republic of Armenia at standard IDA terms, with 35 years' maturity and a 10-year grace period. The
share of the IDA's loan is equivalent to 75.25 % of total project cost. The Borrower would contribute US
$4.15 equivalent, or about 7.25% of total project costs. End users, including farmers in the irrigated
areas, would contribute US $2 million equivalent (about 3.5 % of total project costs) in the form of labor
and local materials3.
3       Although it is assumed that investment costs are exempt from taxes and duties, nevertheless, they will not be
financed under any circumstances by the IDA credit.

4.23         The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has agreed to consider
co-financing the project in the amount of US $8 million to cover the cost of tertiary canals and pipes in
the eight conveyance schemes, pilot projects to improve water management, and monitoring and
evaluation.
4.24         The financing plan for the project is presented in Table 4.2.

4.25         In March 1994 the Bank approved a PPF for this project to finance the establishment of
the PIU (para. 4.20).
4.26         At negotiations, the Government confirmed to the International Development Association
(IDA) of its intentions to provide appropriate contributions that are necessary to fulfill its share in the
project financing of the local component and ensure adequate and timely project implementation. It is
estimated that in fiscal year 1995 the Government share in the project financing would be about US $1.0
million, and the same amount would be required for fiscal year 1995.
H. PROCUREMENT
4.27         Procurement of Goods and Civil Works would follow the "Guidelines: Procurement under
the IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, May 1992." Domestic preferences shall be applicable to ICB contracts
for goods and civil works in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. All consulting services, including the
technical assistance and training would be governed under the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981." The borrower will use
IDA's recently issued standard bidding documents for Goods and Works. In the case of consulting
assignments of time-based and complex nature the borrower shall use Bank/IDA's standard contract for
consultants.
4.28         The project is being co-financed by IFAD (US $8 million). The procurement of goods
and services for the co-financed amount will be governed under IDA's Procurement Guidelines.



The Project                                                                             27
4.29         There are several state-owned construction firms or organizations experienced in building
large dams, excavating complex tunnels, and constructing large water conveyance systems and
hydropower plants. Six of them are active in construction of irrigation systems under the Ministry of
Agriculture. All these state-owned firms are technically qualified to undertake the proposed rehabilitation
works on the eight irrigation conveyance schemes and the four pumping schemes, the tubewell drilling,
the associated repair program, as well as the repair of the dams under the four storage schemes. These
firms have financial and managerial autonomy and do not receive subsidies from the Government. They
meet the eligibility criteria of OD 11.00 (Paras. 88 to 90). They are intended to be privatized in 1994
or 1995. At present there is only limited contracting capability in the Armenian private sector for the
type of volume of the civil works required for the project.
4.30          Manufacturing of prefabricated concrete structures, gravity flow pipes, and canal lining
panels for irrigation is done in four plants owned by the Ministry of Agriculture and one plant jointly
owned by the private sector and the Ministry of Housing Construction. The latter, called the
"Huntsman-Armenia Concrete Corporation," is a modem, efficient facility that manufactures
prefabricated prestressed concrete panels for the Ministry of Construction. It is equivalent to any
comparable factory in the West. There are also several concrete factories under the Ministries of
Construction, Transport and Energy, most of which would qualify to participate in local bidding to supply
concrete construction material for the rehabilitation works. These state-owned enterprises also meet the
eligibility criteria of OD 11.00 (Parms. 88 to 90).
4.31         Repair and overhaul of submersible and other pumps is at present carried out by a few
factories and workshops in Yerevan and in the Ararat Plain. Most of these workshops and factories are
also financially and managerially autonomous state enterprises belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.32         Under the present circumstances in Armenia, the use of competitive bidding relying on
the participation of Government-owned companies and the participation of some private sector contracting
firms should be considered to provide competition as is the practice in many other FSU republics.
4.33         Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. Details of the proposed
procurement arrangements are as follows:
(a)    GOODS: The equipment and construction materials, i.e. steel pipes, valves for
Pumping and Conveyance Schemes; concrete pipes; submersible pumps; and syphons, valves, etc., for
pilot projects would be procured as follows:
(i)    ICB will be used for contracts of US$100,000 and above up to an
aggregate of US$19.8 million. Bank's standard bidding documents for Goods
will be used.
(ii)   LCB procedures will be used for contracts of smaller value below US
$100,000 each. The local competitive bidding will be conducted in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines. The total aggregate for LCB contracts is estimated to
be US $8.5 million.
(iii)   Local Shopping procedures will be used for snall items or items that can
be obtained off-the shelf, estimated to cost less than US $50,000 per contract, up



28                                                                              hapter 4
to an aggregate amount of US $1.7 million, on the basis of at least three
quotations from qualified suppliers.
(iv)   Direct Contracting: Parts for repair of existing pumps will be procured
through direct negotiations with the pump manufacturers up to an aggregate
amount of US $200,000.
(b) CIVIL WORKS: Contracts for civil works would include rehabilitation of dams and
canals, installation of pump sets and drilling of existing and construction of new wells, etc., and
would be procured in the following manner:
(i) ICB will be used for contracts estimated to cost US $300,000 and above and
would cover rehabilitation of dams, up to an aggregate amount of US $680,000.
The borrower will use Bank/IDA's Standard Bidding Documents for Works
through ICB (Smaller Contracts), June 1994.  The contractors shall be
prequalified.
(ii) LCB procedures will be used for most of the smaller contracts which are
spread over a large area and may not interest foreign bidders. LCB contracts
will typically be those which are estimated to cost less than US $300,000 each
and their procurement will be conducted through a locally advertised comnpetitive
bidding process which will however, be open to foreign bidders if they wish to
participate in bidding. The bidders for the works under Irrigation Rehabilitation
program and Pilot projects to improve water management will be prequalified as
provided in para. 2.10 of the IDA Procurement Guidelines (May 1992) and
IDA's standard Prequalification document will be used for this purpose. The
total aggregate for LCB contracts is estimated at US $9.7 million.  For
procurement of these contracts, the borrower shall use IDA's Standard Bidding
Documents - Smaller Works through LCB, June 1994.
(iii) Local Shopping: Smaller work contracts, estimated cost less than US
$25,000 each may be awarded on the basis of comparison of at least three price
quotations obtained from qualified contractors. The aggregate amount for such
smaller contract is estimated at about US $100,000.
(c) CONSULTANTS (US $1.3 million): The borrower will employ through competitive
process an international consulting firm under a single contract to establish the PIU, financed
under the PPF (Para. 4.25). The estimated cost for the PIU establishment is about US $1.3
million, including cost of required equipment. The borrower will nominate the Project Manager
after obtaining IDA clearance. The Project Manager will be assisted by an expatriate Deputy
Manager, experienced in IDA related procurement policies and other financial matters, and four
qualified foreign consultants, experienced in PIU operations, to provide necessary training to
local staff. The selection of the consulting firm will be on the basis of a select list which will
require IDA prior review and approval.
(d) TA and PILOT PROJECTS ( US$ 2.3 million): The consulting services for this
component will be procured under a single contract on competitive basis to operate the Pilot



The Project                                                                           29
Projects to Improve Water Management (Para. 4.15); and for TA services (paras. 4.18 and
4.19) that would be administered under the PIU. Technical assistance would be contracted on
individual basis for assignments ranging from two weeks to about three months. The selection
of these individual consultants would be based on a review of CVs for each selection and the total
aggregate for these contracts is not likely to exceed US $200,000 in value. The training,
including overseas training, would be provided under TA contracts with local or foreign training
institutions and universities in accordance with IDA Guidelines and after prior approval by IDA
of short lists, TORs, Letters of Invitation, and final draft contract.
The average contract value for consulting firms is likely to exceed US $100,000 each while for
individual consultants it may be below US $50,000 each.
(e) INCREMENTAL MAINTENANCE COSTS - 0 & M - (US$ 5 million): IDA will
finance costs associated with maintenance of existing heavy works and other infrastructure and/or
any future remedial activities and repairs, etc., which may be warranted to avoid further damage
to these works. These costs will represent reimbursements for supply of materials and installation
or repairs (Paras. 4.16 and 4.17). The PIU with Bank approval will establish the procedures
for coordinating and supervising the O&M administered by the OME for the purpose of funding
under the project. The PIU shall submit to the IDA every year an annual budget, likely unit
costs for various categories of repairs, and the procedures for carrying out such repairs and
disbursement of funds. Administrative overheads for involved departmental forces of public
entities would not be reimbursed under the IDA credit.
4.34         IDA REVIEW: All ICB contracts for goods and works will be subject to IDA's prior
review. Prior review would also be required for the first three LCB contracts for works regardless of
their value and, subsequently, for all LCB contracts for goods and works, estimated to cost US $200,000
and above each for civil works and US $300,000 for goods. IDA would also pre-review terms of
reference and consultant contracts for all consulting assignments costing more than US$100,000 for fums,
and US$50,000 for individuals. All other contracts will be subject to ex-post review by IDA.
4.35         Country Procurement Assessment Report: A CPAR has not yet been completed.
However, procurement proposed under the project would follow IDA's Procurement Guidelines.
4.36         Procurement Information: Information regarding procurement administration would be
collected and recorded and would comprise report of contract, status, and award information by the
Borrower, and quarterly reports to IDA by the Borrower. These reports would indicate: (a) revised cost
estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical
and price contingency'; (b) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified
methods of procurement.
4.37         Agreement was reached during credit negotiations that all procurement processes and
actions under the project would follow the procedures outlined in Paras. 4.27 to 4.36 (para 7.1(b)).

I. DISBURSEMENT
4.38         The proposed IDA credit of US $43.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a
period of four years, and the expected project closing. date would be June 30, 1999. There is no
experience yet to form a disbursement profile for Armenia, but it is estimated that the country's ability
to implement the project over a four-year period is reasonable, especially given that a PIU will be set up
in advance of the actual implementation of the project works. A mid-term evaluation would be undertaken
by the IDA and the Borrower by April 30, 1997, or when disbursements reach 50% of the total loan
amount, whichever is earlier, to examine all aspects of implementation (para. 5.28). Commitments for
major contracts would be approved through October 31, 1999. The estimated disbursement during each
year of project implementation is as follows:
FY 96        US $ 4.0 million
FY 97        US $11.0 million
FY 98        US $16.0 million
FY 99        US $12.0 million
4.39         The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed in U.S. dollars as shown in Table 4.4
below:
Table 4.4: Disbursement Categories

(US $ mil.)
(1) Goods: Equipment and         23.5      100% of foreign expenditures,
Material                                  100% of local expenditures (ex
factory cost) and 85% of local
expenditures for other items
procured locally
(2) Civil Works                   9.5      100% of foreign expenditures,
85% of local expenditures

4.40         Direct payment procedures from IDA to suppliers will be used. Disbursements against
the categories described in Table 4.4 would be made upon receipt by IDA of fully documented
applisations, except for contracts valued at less than US $50,000, which would be made against certified
statements of expenditures (SOE). Supporting documentation for SOE would be retained by the Borrower
and made available to the IDA during supervision. Direct payment applications and applications for

special commitments would be accepted for minimum amounts of US $20,000. To facilitate project
implementation, the borrower would establish a Special Account in one of the major foreign commercial
banks to cover IDA's share of expenditures. An initial deposit of US $1.5 million would be made, with
the amount in the Special Account increased to the ceiling of US $2 million when total disbursements
reached US $3 million. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted
monthly or when one-third of the amnount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation
requirements for replenishment would follow the same procedure as described above. In addition monthly
bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the borrower would accompany
all replenishment requests. At negotiations, agreement would be sought that disbursement arrangements
willfollow the procedures described in paras. 4.38 to 4.40 andfor establishing and operating the Special
Account as described above (para. 7.1 (c) and (d)).
4.41         Disbursements against withdrawal applications to cover incremental O&M expenditures
would be subject to prior agreement with IDA on annual budget requirement by the Government for
O&M operations as described in para. 4.33(v). Such agreement will have to be reached prior to every
fiscal year and will stipulate the extent of the annual IDA disbursement for that category. Agreement for
such arrangement was reached during Credit negotiations (para. 7.1 (e)).



V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.1          The management, administration, and coordination of the project will be the responsibility
of the PIU (para. 4.20 and Chart 1), which the Government has decided to establish through PPF
financing by the Bank (para. 4.25). The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), would have overall
responsibility for the project. The MOA has already nominated a Project Board of Management, chaired
by a Deputy Minister. Other members of the board are the Director of DWSI, Director of the OME,
Director of the Economic Department in the MOA, a second Deputy Minister, and a representative from
the Ministry of Economy. The Board of Management makes policy decisions and provides general
guidance to the project implementation staff. Micro-management of the project has been delegated to the
PIU which will report directly to the project's Board of Management.
5.2          The objectives of the PIU are as follows:
(a)   coordination of project implementation, including planning and design works, direct
responsibility for procurement and contracting, and supervision on the construction sites;
(b)   financial management of the project, including the preparation and submission of
withdrawal applications, and liaison with the Bank, including reporting to the Bank; and
(c)   coordinating preparation of a follow-up project.
5.3         In accordance with project objectives, the PIU would have four sections: Engineering,
Services, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Technical Assistance.
5.4          The EnRineering Section would:
(a)   complete the detailed planning and preparation for the project;
(b)   approve the designs, specifications and bills of quantities, and prepare contract
documents. It would manage tendering procedures and award contracts in accordance
with the Loan Agreement and with the Guidelines for Procurement of IDA in order for
the contracts to be eligible for financing from the project;
(c)   schedule and conduct the purchasing process; and
(d)   provide on-site supervision, approve contractor and supplier payments, and preparation
withdrawal applications.
5.5          The Services Section would be responsible for translations, recruitment of personnel,
transportation, communication, disbursement (including payments to contractors and suppliers),
accounting and auditing. The section would also be responsible for preparing bi-annual reports to the
Bank and the Government on the PIU operations and progress in project implementation.

5.6          The Technical Assistance Section would principally be responsible for three tasks: (a) to
design activities that would enhance the development of the WUAs and repayment of water charges; (b)
to provide consultation to the Water Planning Institute in improving and updating the Water Master Plan;
and (c) organizing training activities connected with implementation of the project and for specific
management systems and irrigated crop production. The training seminars would be conducted by Bank
Staff and consultants, with emphasis placed on-the-job training provided by expatriate consultants.
5.7          The Monitoring and Evaluation Section would report directly to the Project Board
Management (paras. 5.21-5.25). It would be responsible for collecting and analyzing information on
project implementation, and its impact on agricultural production. The monitoring system would alert
management to emerging problems and draw up periodic progress reports.
5.8          In view of the Government's lack of familiarity with the establishment and operation of
a PIU, the Government has agreed with the Bank to contract with an international consulting firm to
establish and manage the PIU. Such a contract was signed with a foreign company in October 1994.
Under this arrangement the Armenian Government retained the right to nominate the Project Manager
to head the PIU, and this nomination was approved by the Bank. The PIU will initially be staffed by 4
qualified expatriate consultants, in addition to the Project Manager. One of them, the Deputy Manager
of the PIU, will train and assist the Project Manager to assume full responsibility for the PIU operations.
The other expatriate consultants will have responsibility for establishing the PIU procedures, policies, and
accounting, and in collaboration with the Project Manager, for recruiting local counterpart staff who they
will train to assume their functions in the project implementation management. The length of stay for the
expatriate staff is dependent on the transfer of appropriate technology to the recruited local staff and to
the Project Manager.
5.9          In addition to coordinating and administering project implementation, the PIU would also
be responsible for coordinating the preparation of a follow-up project.
5.10         The responsibilities of the PIU in terms of procurement are as follows:
(a)    coordinate detailed plans for procurement, including the packaging of goods into specific
contracts; scheduling of purchases and deliveries; designation of responsibilities for
conducting the procurement process, and determination of signature authority for each
contract;
(b)    ensure that appropriate arrangements are made for advertising contracting opportunities;
preparation and issuance of bidding documents; conducting public bid openings where
required; and evaluation and comparisons of offers to select the lowest evaluated bidders;
(c)    obtain the required approvals from Government and IDA for bidding documents; make
recommendations for bidder selection and contract award; and prepare the final contract
document;
(d)    verify that contract conditions for the supply and delivery of goods and services have
been met and that contracts are eligible for payments from the Credit; and
(e)    monitor the progress of procurement and its compliance with the terms of the Credit.

5.11          At negotiations an agreement was reached that the PIU will be organized and operate
along the lines of the program described in peas. 5.1-5.10 (para. 7.1 (f)). A condition for effectiveness
of the proposed Credit will be the establishment of a PIU with an adequate number of suitably qualified
staff as indicated in para. 7.2.
B. PROJECT PHASING
5.12          Project implementation is anticipated to take about three and a half years from loan
effectiveness, and another six months to loan closing (Chart 2, for details on the project implementation
plan see Annex 9). The relatively long project schedule is attributed to the fact that most of the
construction infrastructure has been idle for a number of years, and has to be geared up to carry out
construction activities over a wide geographical area.'
5.13          Completion of the design and the tender documents is crucial to the prompt initiation of
project implementation. Many engineers of the Planning Institute have been temporarily suspended, but
the Institute is now gearing up to re-employ them.
5.14          The construction which could be started in the first season is cast-in-situ concrete work
such as the construction of parts of the Getik Main Canal, and rehabilitation works on canals where
precast sections cannot be used. All these works, however, have first to be designed.
5.15          Procurement of imported items is the most urgent project activity. Specifications would
be prepared immediately after the PIU has been set up, and the necessary expertise is available to discuss
design and procurement issues with the Planning Institute of the DWSI. Tender documents would be
prepared simultaneously with work on specifications.
5.16          Imported goods could be available in Yerevan eight to ten months after tendering. The
constraining factor in this timetable is the establishment of the PIU and the recruitment of expatriate
experts. Actual implementation of the project can start about six to eight months from establishment of
the PIU.
5.17          Replacement of steel pressure pipes requires the importation of pipe sections. These
could be available for field work eighteen months after tendering.
5.18          A shorter period would be required for implementation of main, secondary, and tertiary
canals which require concrete sections. Most of the concrete manufacturing plants can start operations
inmmediately, following LCB procedures to select the lowest evaluated bidder, though provision of some
concrete products are contingent on modernization in a plant that is anticipated to be complete before the
end of the second year of operations.
5.19          Well drilling will be delayed until the necessary equipment is imported (well screens and
other equipment), and the hydrogeological studies are completed. The earliest date well drilling can start
will be the second construction season.
Each reach of canal which has to be repaired and each pipe section which has to be replaced is a separate building

5.20         The planning and design of dam rehabilitation works, starting from establishment of the
PIU, will last at least a year. Construction activity on the four sites will therefore start only towards the
middle of the second construction season.
C. PROJECT MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING
5.21         A monitoring and evaluation section (M&ES), would report directly to the Project
Management Board, though administratively it would be serviced and supervised by the PIU (para. 5.7).
The M&ES would establish the types of information to be prepared under the project and its evaluation.
Broadly this will be divided into three categories:
(a)   information pertaining to physical implementation and services provided by the project,
together with relevant financial records. Key indicators would include progress in
implementation of the various irrigation schemes, procurement, establishment of pilot
projects for improved water management, and technical assistance;
(b)   information pertaining to the use of the structures and the services by the targeted
population and the initial consequences of that use. Key indicators would include
information on the beneficiaries of the various project components, to the extent possible
the impact of the project on the beneficiaries income; and
(c)   information on the social, economic, or environmental reasons for any unexpected
reaction by the target population that is revealed by the information about the use of the
structures and services.
5.22         The M&ES would provide annual progress reports to the Project Management Board and
to IDA in an agreed format.
5.23         The M&ES would collect and analyze data on costs, benefits, and financial viability of
main investments on the basis of suitable sampling. The evaluation objectives would be to:
(a)    critically review, in light of subsequent developments, the project design and rationale
stated in the appraisal documents;
(b)    assess the ongoing economic efficiency of the project. This would require the following:
(i)    analysis of the project design and determination of its adequacy to overcome the
identified constraints in agriculture and thus to promote the desired changes;
(ii)   comparison of actual attainments with the targets set and identifying the reasons
for shortfalls or better than anticipated achievements; and
(iii)  assessment of the efficiency of project implementation procedures and quality of
managerial performance.
(c)    determine the effects and impact of the project; and



Project Implementation                                                              39
(d)   present the lessons learned and the recommendations that follow from them.
5.24         The M&ES would also be responsible for preparing information regarding procurement
to be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)    prompt reporting of contract awards information by the Borrower; and
(b)   comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank by the Borrower (assisted by consultants)
indicating:
(i)   revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best
estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies;
(ii)   revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and
(iii)  compliance with aggregate limits on specified method of procurement.
5.25         Annual evaluation reports will be submitted by the M&ES to the Project Board
Management and to IDA. The M&ES would also prepare a project completion report not later than six
months after closing date. During negotiations agreement was reached that M&ES will:
(a)   follow the monitoring and evaluation procedures as outlined in paras. 5.22-5.25 above;
(b)   submit to IDA the periodic reports;
(c)   prepare a project completion report (para. 7.1 (h)).
D. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
5.26         The project accounts will be managed by the PIU during project implementation. The
project accounts would identify all sources and uses of funds in carrying out the project, including
detailed accounting of the use of the proceeds of the Loan and the operation of the Special Account. The
project account would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA, and the audit reports
would be submitted to the Project Board Management and to the Bank within four months of the end of
the fiscal year. The audit reports would contain a separate opinion on the operation of the Special
Account and the statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure, when utilized. Since the auditing profession
is not yet well developed in Armenia, it is anticipated that an international auditing firm will carry out
the audits. During negotiations agreement was reached regarding the accounting and auditing
requirements as outlined above (para. 7.1 (i)).
E. BANK SUPERVISION
5.27         The project would require an intensive supervision, with visits by IDA staff at least twice
a year (for details concerning proposed supervision plan see Annex 10). With the intention of following

up this project with wider investment in irrigation, supervision would be combined with project
preparation in the last year of the project. It is estimated that project supervision in the first and second
year would require about 22 staff weeks each year. In the third year because of the mid-term review,
the project would require 25 staff weeks. In the fourth year the project would require about 12 staff
weeks, and in the last year together with preparation of a completion report, the project would require
about 18 staff weeks.
5.28         At negotiations agreement was reached for a mid-term review of the project by a joint
team from IDA and the MOA (para. 4.38). The expectation of the mid-term review is that there would
already be significant progress in the implementation of all the project components, and that the master
plan of irrigation and water supplyfor the country would already be substantially updated (para. 7.1 (j).



VI. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS,
AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
A. PROJECT BENEFITS
Project Impact
6.1          The proposed investment of about US $57 million over a four year implementation period
would finance the rehabilitation of irrigation systems in the major agricultural production areas and would
have profound impact on productivity of the agriculture sector; on the well being of the beneficiaries; and
on the country's economy. A secure water supply would promote agricultural production, increase the
food supply, and create employment and raise incomes in the rural areas. Without the project, Armenia
would need to increase its food imports, or decrease its food consumption substantially. Under the
project, construction work will generate employment opportunities for about 2,000 unemployed skilled
and unskilled workers. The project would also establish the foundation of improved and rationalized water
management by creating WUAs and a national system of water charges designed to recover the costs of
O&M at a minimum.
Basic Assumptions
6.2          The project implementation is predicated on the assumption that there is no economic
blockade and the transport constraint has been removed. However, based on the Country Economic
Memorandum for Armenia from March 1993, there are two possible scenarios after lifting the blockade.
Under the less optimistic one, the country would continue to be hampered by further economic
deterioration in the FSU Countries, with a continuing depreciation of its currency. Under this scenario
Armenia is anticipated to gradually reorient its trade towards Westem customers. As the economic
situation becomes more settled, foreign investments will resume, and a large proportion of idle production
capacity will be reactivated. The economic situation should stabilize in about two years after lifting the
blockade. In the last years of the decade real growth would reach about 5% per year.
6.3          Under the optimistic scenario, immediately after the blockade is lifted trade and the
payments system would stabilize, and the local currency slide halted. This would lead to a rapid growth
in production as existing capacity is brought back into use. Following the immediate impact of lifting the
blockade, there would be some slowing down in growth while investment capital would continue to flow
in. There would be substantial changes in the composition of output and some degree of macroeconomic
stabilization should occur. Toward the end of the century growth is anticipated to be 7 % to 8 % per year,
leading to a restoration of the 1989 output level by the year 2000.
6.4          Under either scenario, importation of fuel, chemicals, and fertilizers are to be
unrestricted, which implies that the project implementation can restore the production capacity of the
pre-project level in irrigated areas, and can yield additional benefits from increased demand due to growth
in income.



42                                                                              Chapter 6
Production and Pricing
6.5          Without project. Rehabilitation of the conveyance systems and the tubewells would most
affect the low-lying areas, where rainfall is inadequate for crop production. The assumption was that
without the project the system would not completely fail, but only that water losses would gradually
increase. As less water reaches the fields, yields would diminish, followed by changes in the cropping
patterns. For economic analysis it was assumed that water supply will decrease by about 5 % per annum
and reach about 20% of the pre-project supply in the seventeenth year if no rehabilitation measures are
taken.
6.6          Farmers' first response to a growing water shortage would be to under-irrigate. First the
cereals and forage would get less water, followed by orchards and, finally, potatoes and vegetables.
Wheat crops, now irrigated three or four times, would receive two and eventually only one irrigation.
This would reduce yields to about 2.5 t/ha with two irrigations, and 1.5 t/ha with one irrigation. Lucerne
could no longer be grown: farmers would revert to a single cut of cereal hay, irrigated once, yielding
about 2.0 t/ha.
6.7          In the storage dam rehabilitation component, the assumption has been that without
rehabilitation the dams would cease to function. Apart from the physical and environmental damage, their
command areas would be left without water, or at best with much reduced supplies from run-of-the-river
flows. These limited quantities would only be used for the home plots. Since most of the command areas
are at medium and high elevations, crops grown would be rainfed cereals for grain and fodder. The
cereals grown for grain would yield about 1.5 t/ha, and fodder yields would be about 2.0 t/ha.
6.8          With Project. The repair of the dams and conveyance structures would ensure that
agriculture production will not fall. Present yields, now affected by a shortage of water, would increase
somewhat, and farmers would be more willing to invest in purchased inputs and land cultivation. This
would eventually raise average yields to levels now achieved by the more successful farmers. It is
unlikely, however, that the irrigated areas would expand significantly. Water distribution arrangements
between new land owners, resulting from the land reform, are not going to be completely resolved during
project implementation, though the project would contribute to its improvement.
6.9          Increased agricultural production would be associated with increased demand for food due
to expected increase of income and reopening of the trade routes, mainly to Russia and other FSU
republics. In recent years trade was severely restricted due the blockade on Armenia. Before the
imposition of the blockade, Armenia exported significant quantities of canned fruits and vegetables.
However, the blockade caused the agroindustry subsector to be almost completely paralyzed. Lifting of
the blockade on Armenia would cause gradual restoration of production of processed fruits and vegetables
for export and also import of needed inputs. The increased production resulting from the project is,
therefore, not likely to be difficult to be disposed either domestically or through exports.
6.10         Prices. Prices of agriculture products and food in Armenia are liberalized, with the
exception of bread. Prices of wheat paid to farmers are lower than the world market price; but despite
a price of only 70 to 80% of world prices, wheat is still one of the most profitable crops. However, with
normalizing trade after lifting of the blockade, wheat production is likely to fall because fruits and
vegetables which were unable to be exported due the restricted trade will stop overhanging the market
and would become more profitable to produce. Producer prices that were used to estimate the "with" and



Project Benefits, Risks, and Environmental Impacts                                   43
"withoutw project scenarios were on the conservative side; they were either those paid by Government
or the free market prices, where Government prices were not established or not available. All prices of
inputs, which have to be imported, are based on, or close to, world market prices. Fertilizer was costed
at US $120 per ton, with an average nutrient rate of 30 %; pesticide prices were estimated at US $10 per
kg or liter; one hour of tractor work at about US $8.30; and a combine hour at US $10.80. Cost of water
was calculated on the basis of US $0.015/kwh, and a consumption of 0.5 kwh/m3 of 100 m lift.
6.11         The returns to forage (Lucerne and Esparcet), of about US $19 per ha in the lowlands
and US $4 in the midlands, are calculated up to the point of hay production. Translated into animal
production, one ha of forage produces, in the lowlands, yields about 195 kg of dressed weight of beef
(at US $0.83 per kg-a return of US $162.5 per ha), or about 3,210 liter of milk (at US $0.165 per I-a
return of US $535 per ha). In the midlands 1 ha of forage generates about 2,570 liter of milk (US $429
per ha), or 156 kg of beef (US $130/ha).
6.12         Transport cost estimates are based on ARMPLODORODIE' charges which are: US $1.25
for a tractor or trailer up to 5 km distance, and US $2.5 for the same up to 10 km. Diesel operated truck
(Kamaz 8, 10, 12 t) transport is charged at 16 to 21 cents per km .
B. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Benefits and Justification
6.13         As indicated above, economic benefits from the project realized by the country and
beneficiary farmers would be:
(a)   avoiding a decrease in production and thus a decrease in farmers' incomes resulting from
deterioration of the irrigation infrastructure system;
(b)   improvement in yields and changes in the cropping pattern that result in optimizing
return;
(c)   reducing the foreign exchange expenditures on imported food as necessitated by decreased
production if the project is not implemented;
(d)   increased employment on construction during project implementation;
(e)   improvement in the water management and distribution system which would contribute
to an increase in production; and,
(f)   energy savings through more gravity irrigation and less energy dependent pumping
resources.
The main indirect project benefits would include an increase in employment opportunities for auxiliary
The state enterprise in charge of input distribution.

services, such as development of cement lining of steel pipe, and increase in production of concrete pipes
(instead of steel pipes).
6.14            From a national point of view, the project would support the rural poor, who comprise
a significant portion of the country's population.2 It would contribute to the stabilization of their income
by guaranteeing that the water resource infrastructure is maintained and rehabilitated.
6.15            A separate financial analysis is not warranted since as mentioned previously (para. 6.10),
prices of agriculture products and food are liberalized in Armenia. By and large there is no difference
between economic and financial costs. The price of grains paid to farmers, however, is lower than world
market prices (para. 6.10), which makes the net value of production lower by about 4.5 % than if farmers
were paid the world market price. The impact of paying the financial price of grains on the economics
of the project is treated in the sensitivity analysis (para. 6.17). The cost of pumping water is subsidized.
However, about 82% of the project area is irrigated by gravity. Since the cost of water in areas irrigated
by power generated sources constitutes about 22.6 % of the operating cost, the impact of water generated
by electricity on the total project operating cost is about 4%, which is relatively insignificant (Annex 8).3
Economic Rate of Return
6.16            The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 53%  (Annex 1, Table 14).
The economic rate of return calculations are based on the following assumptions:
(a)     agricultural production based on the development of the irrigated area in four years and
a production period of 20 years;
(b)     without the project, agricultural production in the project area would decline by about 5 %
per year up to year 17 and then would remain at 20% of the pre-project level;
(c)     increases in agricultural production would begin in project year 4.4 In that year about
60% of the fall in the production is restored due to rehabilitation of the irrigation
infrastructure under the project. From the fifth year it is assumed that agriculture
production would reach the pre-project level;
(d)     production costs were priced at local October 1993 constant market prices (Annex 8,
Table A.3);
2       It is estimated that at least 30% of the farmers do not receive sufficient water, due to failing and mismanaged
irrigation infrastructure. As a result the income of these farmers is adversely affected.
3       According to Annex 8, Tables A.8 and A.9 operating costs per hectare in lowlands are Rubles 4,583,980; and
operating costs per hectare in the midlands are Rubles 4,432,390. Given that there are 134,600 ha in the lowland and
30,100 ha in the mid lands, total operating costs in million of Rubles are: (134,600 x 4583.98/1000) + (30,100 x
4432.3911000) = 750,418.65. The share of the operating cost of water in the midland is 22.6%, hence:
.226 x (30,100 x 4432.39/1000) / 750,418.65 = 0.04
It is likely that the impact can materialize sooner than the fourth year. However, it was preferred to use a
conservative assumption.



Project Benefits, Risks, and Envronmental Impacts                                                    45
(e)    economic prices for wheat were based on Bank projections, but adjusted to the farm gate,
prevailing farm gate prices were used for other products (nontradeable, Annex 8, Table
A.3);
(f)    with the project, production would start in command areas of pressure pipeline and
tubewell replacement in year three and in year four in areas which will benefit from
conveyance system rehabilitation;
(g)     as a result of rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure and increased availability of
water there would be a gradual improvement of yields and changes in the cropping
pattern. In the Low Lands areas such changes would continue until the twelfth year, and
in the Mid Lands areas until the tenth year (Annex 8);
(h)    depreciation of project elements were based on the following assumptions: for pump sets
and mechanical equipment eight years, wells 15 years, and canals and pipelines 25 years.
Since some budget allocation has been appropriated for O&M for the existing
infrastructure, only 2 % of the investment cost was considered as incremental O&M costs
and included in the calculation of the rate of return analysis; and
(i)    all project works, equipment, technical services, and physical contingencies were included
in investment costs.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.17           The results of a sensitivity analysis to test the effects of cost overruns and delays or
shortfalls in benefits on the rate of return are presented in Annex 1, Table 14 and summarized in Table
6.1. As can be seen, substantial impact on reduction in the rates of return are attributed to delays in
Table 6.1: Summary of Sensitivity Analysis Cases
CASE                                          RATE OF RETURN
1. Benefit down by 20%                                                    47%
2. Benefit down by 20% and cost up by 20%                                 43%
3. Benefit down by 50% and cost up by 20%                                 33%
4. Improved water efficiency from 35 to 50%                               61%
5. Paying farrners less than the world price for cereals                  52%
(current practice, a proxy for FRR)
6. Delay project implementation by one year                               48%
7. Delay project implementation by two years                              41%
8. Delay project implementation by three years                            35%
implementation. The reason for such a significant decrease in the rate of return is twofold. First, the
opportunity cost of delay equals the net value of production that is lost in the year(s) that the project



46                                                                                         Chapter 6
originally yielded benefits'; second, the infrastructure is progressively deteriorating and it is assumed
that investment requirements rise by about 10% for every year of delay in the rehabilitation works.
C. RISKS
6.18           The principal project risk is political. If there is a resumption of hostilities between
Armenia and any of its neighbors, a reimposition of a blockade would impact the project adversely
because of expected difficulties to import fuel, spare parts, construction machinery, steel pipes and
reinforced steel, without which large diameter pipes cannot be laid and precast concrete sections cannot
be manufactured. In addition, resources needed for operation and maintenance of the irrigation
infrastructure would be drained and the physical structures would be put in jeopardy.
6.19           Some of the benefits associated with the project relate to implementation of reforms
leading to a market economy. Such benefits are the imposition and collection of water charges that would
recover the full cost of energy. It is also critical for the project that water subsidies would be gradually
reduced and that beneficiaries will eventually assume full responsibility for operation and maintenance.
The risk is that if the Government will not be strong enough to resist pressure to resume past policies of
water subsidies and lax collection of water charges, the irrigation infrastructure in the country would
again deteriorate. To safeguard against such risk, any additional assistance by the Bank in the agriculture
sector, as well as in other sectors, should consider Government's progress in reducing subsidies for water
in agriculture as planned under this project.
6.20           Based on existing modes the quality of construction will not meet internationally accepted
standards and the project lifetime would be less than estimated. This has been the case with most of the
existing irrigation infrastructure. A properly staffed and trained project implementation unit would
mitigate this risk.
6.21           Power is at present generated mainly from  hydroelectric sources and is completely
subsidized for irrigation purposes. The risk is that utilization of energy for irrigation is associated with
deterioration of the environment. Presently most of the generated energy comes from water originated
from Lake Sevan. Over-pumping of water from the lake have caused the water level to fall which resulted
in adverse impact on the micro climate environment around the lake. Imposition of water charges that
cover the full cost of operations and maintenance and energy costs is imperative to mitigate this risk.
6.22           Armenia is in a seismically active zone. Conservative designs for the rehabilitation of
dams were adopted to mitigate this risk.
For example: without debay project benefits start when there is avoidance of a decline in the net value of
production at the completion of the investment works, say, in year 4. If the project is delayed by I year, a decrease in net
value of production in year 4 is not avoided.



Project Benefits, Risks, and Environmental Impacts                                  47
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
6.23         The project has been placed in category "B" in accordance with Operational Directives.
6.24         The proposed rehabilitation works on the conveyance structures, the tubewells in the
Ararat Plain and on storage darns, would have positive environmental consequences. They would reduce
waterlogging and erosion near the conveyance structures and protect reclaimed areas in the Ararat Plain,
and would eliminate the threat to life and property downstream of the dams. To sustain these
improvements in the long term requires adequate maintenance of the rehabilitated structures and careful
monitoring of the environmental effects. Within the first six month of the project effectiveness the
M&M&ES will define environmental indicators to determine the cost of neglect in infrastructure
maintenance.
6.25         Leaking canals and hydraulic structures, if not repaired, would cause environmental
damage in the immediate neighborhood of the leaks. Bursting pumping stations and/or their pertinent
pressure pipes can destroy infrastructure in the vicinity of the pipeline, and can cause serious soil
erosion.
6.26         A delay in the rehabilitation of tubewells in the Ararat Plain will cause an adverse impact
on the environment as well. High groundwater levels have been controlled by pumped drainage in the
low lying areas of the plain. When drainage wells cease to pump, groundwater will gradually rise and
destroy land reclaimed over the last decades.
6.27         The most serious threat to the environment, which the project would protect against,
however, is posed by storage dam classified as high risk. According to data collected by the DWSI, a
breach in any one of the high risk dams will pose a serious threat to life and property along the probable
flood path.
6.28         The approximate number of people living in villages, in the approximate area of the
probable flood path of the four storage dams slated for rehabilitation under the project are:
Aparan                  163,000
Karnout                   4,000
Mantash                   9,000
Sarnakhipur               8,000
These people are living at significant risk though there are no quantitative estimates as to the likelihood
of floods or the loss of life, but such numbers could be astounding. Project would reduce such risk to a
reasonable level.
6.29         The DWSI has prepared estimates of material damage which will be caused by dam
failures in downstream areas of Armenia. The damage estimates in dollar terms (based on 1991 Ruble)
range from about US $3 million for the Aparan Dam to less than US $100,000 for the Karnout Dam.
6.30         Another serious impact of a possible breaching of the Mantash Dam would be the loss
of drinking water for a population of about 25,000. The dams also control flooding in the downstream
areas.



48                                                                                 Chapter 6
6.31          The investment program  under the proposed project would affect rivers that are
international waterways in accordance with OD 7.5, para. 2(a)(i) and (ii), i.e., rivers and tributaries that
ultimately flow to and/or are shared with other riparian countries. However, the project is exempt from
notification requirements, pursuant to OD 7.5, para. 8, because it finances strictly rehabilitation works.
The nature of the planned investments-replacing corrosive pipes, repairing lined canals, replacement of
tubewells and repairing leaking dams-should not have negative impacts on either the quantity or the
quality of present and future flows. More specifically:
(a)    all investments under the proposed project satisfy the criteria which require: first, that
they will have no adverse effect on the quantity of water flows to any other riparian
countries, since they will involve no increase in water extraction. In fact there might even
be a slight decrease in the amount of water being extracted due to improved water
management and distribution. Second, water quality will not be adversely affected
because the replacement of tubewell pumps under the project, may assist in reducing the
water table and averting water salinity, which otherwise finds its way to international
waterways;
(b)    for any study to be undertaken in regard to future investments under a separate project
that may involve international waterways, the terms of reference for such studies will
include examnination of potential riparian issues, in accordance with OD 7.5, para. 8 (b).
6.32          Finally, a review of known international agreements or arrangements that exist between
Armenia and other riparians on the sharing of international waters that might be affected by this project
has shown that none of these agreements would require notification for the activities contemplated by this
project.

audited project accounts for the project be submitted to IDA for review within four
month of the end of each fiscal year; and
(i)    a mid-term review of the project will be carried out by April 30, 1997 by a joint IDA
and MOA review team. The review will be timed toward the end of the second year of
the project implementation, as mentioned in para. 5.28;
7.2          A condition for effectiveness of the proposed Credit will be the establishment of a PIU
with an adequate number of suitably qualified staff as mentioned in para. 5.11.
7.3          Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the project will be suitable for an IDA
credit of US $43.0 million made to the Government of the Republic of Armenia, at the IDA standard
terms, including 35 years' maturity and 10 years' grace period for repayments.

ANNEX 2: THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR REVIEW
A. BACKGROUND
1.           Armenia is a landlocked country, located to the extreme south of the Caucasus Mountains
between 390 and 410 north and 440 and 46 east. The country borders Azerbaijan to the east and south
(Map 1, IBRD 25388). To the north lies Georgia, and to the west and south, across the Araks River
from Turkey and Iran. Turkey is connected to Azerbaijan through a 25 km long corridor between
Armenia and Iran.
2.           Agriculture in Armenia is greatly influenced by topography. Cultivated land lies within
an altitude range of 600 to 2,500 m with mountain peaks to 4,090 m above sea level (asl). Only about
2% of the land is located below 1,500 m elevation. Generally, the landform in the center and north
comprises rocky high mountain ranges separating narrow fertile valleys. Towards the south the broad,
flat, and fertile Ararat Valley opens out along the left bank of the Araks River to form the border with
Turkey. West and north of the centrally located Mount Aragat, and to the east around Sevan Lake, the
landform is generally rolling, but with many rocky outcrops. In the south-east a few small irregularly-
shaped valleys are fringed by high mountain ranges on both borders with Azerbaijan.
3.           Irrigation is necessary to ensure food security; however, about 49% of the arable land
is equipped with irrigation facilities. The diverse landscape offers particular challenges to the collection,
transfer, conveyance, and delivery of irrigation water. The high elevation of Sevan Lake (1,925 m asl,
about 1,200 kin2) makes it a strategic source of energy and irrigation water.
B. AGRARIAN STRUCTURE
4.           Since the land reform of February 1991, most agricultural land has been under private
control. The exceptions are pastures allocated for communal grazing, and about 100 state farms which
have been retained for seed production, animal breeding, research, or other purposes of national
importance. About 20% of the land has been reserved for future village expansion, but is generally
available for rent. There are about 300,000 smallholder with holdings averaging about 1 ha to 2 ha;
many farmers have less than 1 ha. Most holdings are fragmented; irrigated and rainfed arable land,
orchards, and mown grassland within each village were all distributed between the families resident in
the village. Families not previously engaged in agriculture have also now become smallholder. About
6,000 groups of farmers (about 20 percent to 25% of the farmer population) have elected to operate
collectively, either for cattle or crop production.
5.           Sale of land has been officially sanctioned since the beginning of 1994, provided payment
to the state has been completed (typically R2,000/ha - R1O,000/ha). However, with the uncertainties of
prices, food supplies, and the future of the economy, most families probably regard their smallholding
as an indispensable asset, rapid aggregation of holdings is unlikely to occur immediately. Although most
land has now been distributed under the two-year program originally planned and initiated in early 1991,
the Government has decided to extend the land privatization program for a further 2 years to correct
anomalies which have arisen and to privatize parts of the state farms which still remain.
6.           As a result of the break-up of the agricultural collective and state farms, village councils



76                                                                            Annex 2
have now assumed great importance and authority in rural life.  Their responsibilities include:
(a) overseeing the land privatization program; (b) administering reserve land area allocated for future
village expansion (constituting about 20% of the agricultural land of the country); (c) control of the "self-
supporting enterprises" (which include some pooled machinery and equipment); (d) organization of input
supply distribution; liaison between farmers and the local branch of the Department of Water Supply and
Irrigation (DWSI, Annex 3); and assistance in the collection of water charges. The final form of local
government awaits formulation based on new legislation. However, it is understood that 40% of local
taxes (principally the land tax) are to be allocated to the village councils, which are also responsible for
dealing with economic, social, and cultural matters.
C. CLIMATE
7.           Armenia enjoys a variety of climatic conditions depending upon altitude. The Ararat
Valley is characterized by dry hot summers and cold dry winters, with annual precipitation not exceeding
300 mm. Precipitation increases toward the mountains to 1,000 mm (Mount Aragats). Temperatures
decrease with altitude from an annual average of 10C in Yerevan to 4C at Sevan Lake. Corresponding
growing periods vary between 250 days in the lowest valleys and 170 days around Sevan Lake.
8.           Monthly precipitation is highest during the period from April to June and lowest from
July to September. Crop water deficit from May to August ranges between 200 to 700 mm, which cannot
be supplied from soil moisture alone. Irrigation is thus necessary for crop growth.
D. LAND USE
9.           About 47%, or 1.4 million ha of Armenia's overall territory are cultivable or are used
as pasture for livestock. The rest is rocky wasteland, mountains, forest and heathlands, suitable only for
rough grazing during the few summer months. The cultivated land is in:
annual crops              465,300 ha
perennial plantations      62,700 ha
home plots and orchards    57,000 ha
permanent pastures        666,000 ha
hill grazing and rangelands   137.000 ha
Total cultivated land  1,388,000 ha
10.         Approximately 286,000 ha are at present irrigable throughout the growing season. In
1992, the distribution of cropping patterns in the main irrigated areas was:
kitchen gardens and home orchards   15%
vineyards                        8%
orchards                         11%
permanent pasture                4%
forests                          4%
arable crops                    58%, of which



The Agricultural Sector                                                                    77
(19% cereals, 29% fodder, 7% vegetables, 2% potatoes 1% others)
11.           This crop mix is changing rapidly. The trend, which is expected to continue as long as
the present emergency situation is as follows:
(a)    irrigated cereals, mostly wheat, is increasing: farmers want to be self-sufficient and have
spare grain to barter for other commodities;
(b)    for the same reason, farmers would have liked to expand the potato area, but since
Armenia is largely dependent on import of potato seeds, the present area is likely to be
maintained;
(c)    vegetables grown for sale to processing industries is decreasing;
(d)    the area of orchards and vineyards is decreasing, to accommodate the additional cereals;
and
(e)    the area of forage crops is being maintained, to support livestock, primarily milk
producers. At higher elevations, where rainfall is adequate for grazing, increasing
amounts of forage are being gathered from un-irrigated lands. There will be increasing
pressure on cultivated and natural pasture lands. At low elevations, where there are no
pastures and rangelands, people have started supplementing stock feed by collecting
weeds, or cutting young reeds. This is a common practice in countries that have no
grazing areas.
E. CROP PRODUCTION
12.           The principal irrigated crops are:
-      cereals mostly winter wheat and some winter barley;
-      vegetables tomatoes, cabbages, beans, onions, carrots etc.;
-      potatoes;
-      forage mostly luceme (alfalfa) and some sanfoin; spring barley, rye, oats and oats/vetch
mixture;
-      orchards apricots, apples, cherries, peaches and plums;
-      and, vineyards.
13.           Wheat varieties are Mexican high-yielding strains crossed with Russian frost-resistant
varieties. At higher altitudes more straw is preferred for additional winter stockfeed. On the whole, high
yield potential and good cultural practices are evident. Several fields with estimated yields of 6.0 t/ha
were seen at lower altitudes; at higher altitudes, fields with an estimated yield of roughly 5.0 t/ha were
common. These impressions were corroborated by farmers, village councilors, and research workers.
14.           Winter barley is grown primarily for stockfeed, but also as a grain supplement. It is the
high-yielding six-rowed species, much favored in Eastem Europe. Yields are comparable to that of
wheat.



78                                                                                  Annex 2
15.          Except at high altitudes, spring wheat and two-rowed spring barley are irrigated when
winter crops fail due to frost combined with an inadequate snow cover. Even with irrigation however,
the yields of spring wheat rarely exceed 2.5 t/ha.
16.          The dominant vegetable at low altitudes is the tomato; at middle elevations tomatoes and
cabbages; at high elevations, cabbages. Beans, onions, brinjals, carrots, garlic and others, are grown at
all altitudes. Average yields are tomatoes 38.0 t/ha, cabbages 40.0 t/ha, beans for seed 2.5 t/ha, 20.0
t/ha if harvested green.
17.          At low elevations potatoes are mostly earlier varieties, and main-crop varieties at high
elevations. Yield potentials are 22.0 t/ha for earlier varieties and 35.0 t/ha for the main crop.
18.          The principal forage crop is lucerne (alfalfa). It produces five cuts at low altitudes and
four elsewhere. Yields are about 2.0 t of hay per hectare/cut. Sanfoin is grown mostly at high altitudes
in places not suitable for lucerne, or where honey production is an important local industry. It gives just
two cuts per year, yielding about 3.8 t/ha of hay.
19.          Other fodder crops listed are rarely irrigated. Some fodder is also obtained from specially
set-aside meadows, which are occasionally irrigated from snow-melt.
20.           Orchards are mostly apricots at low altitudes and apples in higher areas. Traditionally,
they are well maintained. Shortages of plant protection chemicals caused much damage in 1993, which
was further aggravated by severe winter and early spring frosts. The frost killed many trees, and
destroyed the flowers on others. Other common orchard crops are peaches, plums and cherries. Normal
yields are about 15.0 t/ha.
21.           Until recently grapes have been the mainstay of Armenian agriculture exports. With
exports of wine and brandy impeded by the blockade, the present outlook is uncertain. Normal yields are
13.0 t/ha.
F. LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
22.           Livestock production accounted for about one-third of the output value of agricultural
primary production in 1992, down from 46% in 1991 and 53% in the late 1980s. It used about 80% of
agricultural land, employed an estimated two-thirds of the agricultural labor force, and represented a
major source of nutrition and cash income for about 250,000 private livestock producers. Because of the
importance Government had attached to increasing per capita consumption of livestock products, the sub-
sector was given high development priority in the 1970s and 1980s, receiving between 60% and over
70% of total agricultural investments and operational subsidies, and profiting from large imports of
livestock production related inputs. In the late 1980s, for example, yearly imports amounted to about
400,000 tons of energy feed grains, 100,000 tons of protein meals, and substantial quantities of feed
additives and veterinary supplies. Altogether these constituted over 50% of the total value of agricultural
imports. As a result, the country's livestock populations grew substantially in the past two decades,
particularly pig and poultry populations. Despite this growth, Armenia depended heavily on importation
of livestock products, namely dairy products (up to one million tons of milk equivalent per year) and
meat, accounting for respectively over 40% and 15% of total agricultural imports in the late 1980s.



Tfhe Agricultural Sector                                                              79
23.          In 1987-88, when livestock numbers peaked, Armenia's livestock population was
estimated at 850,000 cattle (including about 310,000 cows), 340,000 pigs (including 35,000 sows), 1.75
million sheep (including 1.14 million ewes), 30,000 goats, 7,500 horses, and 12 million poultry. In
1989, overall livestock numbers began to tumble. It is estimated that between 1987-88 and the beginning
of 1993, overall livestock inventories in terms of Animal Units fell by 50%. The worst affected livestock
were pigs and poultry, down by about 75% each; followed by cattle, down by over 60%; and sheep,
down by over 50%.
24.          Due to heavy livestock inventory culling, overall meat production decreased somewhat
slower than livestock numbers. From 1987-88 to 1992, total meat production fell by about 38%. Poultry
meat production was by far the worst hit, down threefold. During the same period, production of milk
fell by 31 %, eggs by 60%, and wool by almost 40 %.
G. AGROPROCESSING
25.          Armenia's 632 agro-processing enterprises are organized under two ministries. The
Ministry of Food has control of the milk, meat, canning, baking, feed milling, flour milling, winery,
distillation, food retailing, fertilizer enterprises, and pesticide procurement activities. The Ministry of
Food also functions as purchaser and supplier of ingredients used by the enterprises under its jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Agriculture controls fewer enterprises, mainly wineries. Some duplication exists with
the types of enterprises controlled by the two Ministries. The food processing and distribution industries
actually constitute regional and national monopolies controlled by Government because the private sector
has not yet actually entered into these areas.
26.          All sectors of the agro-processing complexes are operating below engineered capacity.
This results in their operating at high unit costs, because the fixed costs are allocated to a smaller than
optimum volume of output. There are several practical reasons for the low capacity utilization of
facilities:
(a)    The break-up of the Soviet Union disrupted normal trade flows which were formerly
directed from Moscow. Although a centralized administration was not efficient, a pattern
and configuration for the distribution and flow of products did exist. The dismantling
of the Soviet Union has left many unresolved issues and uncertainties, particularly issues
of trade and trade patterns which have been left with uncertainty.
(b)    Compounding the impact of the Soviet break-up was the rail and road blockade imposed
by Azerbaijan on energy fuels, foodstuffs such as wheat and feed grains, manufacturing
supplies and ingredients, and other inputs required by Armenia's agro-industrial
enterprises.  Without these inputs, operations of the food factories have become
increasingly inefficient.
H. ENVIRONMENT
27.          Of the many environmental issues facing Armenia today, several appear to urgently need
resolution including:



80                                                                               Annex 2
(a)    development of programs to control soil erosion, which is proceeding at an alarming
pace, especially since the blockade, trees are currently being cut and used as fuel wood
to substitute for loss of energy resources;
(b)   installation and operation of adequate pollution control technologies in Armenian
industrial facilities;
(c)   treatment and disposal of municipal wastes and industrially-derived hazardous wastes;
(d)   reduction of automotive emissions in urban areas; and
(e)    protection and restoration of the ecological integrity and the quality of water supply from
Lake Sevan.
28.          To overcome the pervasiveness of environmental degradation in Armenia there must be
a move to market-based costs for energy, fuel, water, and other resources in order to induce
conservation. Much of Armenia's infrastructure was developed without regard for these input costs, and
even some of the government's current planning documents utilize the argument of inexpensive energy
to justify future development plans. Unbridled use of such resources imposes too severe a stress on
resource-production sectors and the environmental components upon which they have an impact.
Attaining control of these issues will also require some reorientation of Government organization. In
certain cases, roles, responsibilities, and authorities must be clarified, some apparent conflicts of interest
should be addressed, and in some cases authority must be horizontally interwoven across the existing
vertically oriented governmental structures.
I. PRODUCTION SERVICES
The Input Supply System
29.          With few exceptions, Armenia does not have its own pesticide production or formulation
ability, and is thus almost entirely dependent on imports. In the past, sources of supply were Russia and
Ukraine; further suppliers were Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. However, the
Ukrainian production currently covers not more than 20% of its own needs because of difficulties in
obtaining energy and raw materials. The situation in Russia and the other republics is not much better,
thus forcing Armenia to look for alternative suppliers.
30.           Until 1992 two crop protection agents were manufactured in Armenia. One was the
herbicide Fenagan, developed in Armenia and produced by the Chimreaktiv factory in Yerevan, and the
other was the fungicide copper sulphate produced in a factory in Alaverdi from domestically manufactured
copper, and imported sulphur from Turkmenistan. Production of both has been discontinued due to the
economic difficulties caused by the blockade.
31.          Armenia used to manufacture urea in a fertilizer factory near Spitak (the earthquake
zone). However, the factory was badly damaged during the 1988 earthquake and has not resumed



The Agricultural Sector                                                                  81
production since. All other fertilizers required in the country came from other former republics of the
Soviet Union.
32.          The supply and procurement of agricultural inputs is almost fully managed by state-owned
organizations. The private sector has not begun to operate in these areas, even though there are no legal
barriers. The Ministry of Nutrition and Food Reserve is responsible for provision of feed principally
grain and forage to the livestock industry, though the Ministry of Agriculture has some feed mills under
its control. Armplodorodie is the parastatal organization responsible for supply of agro-chemicals, down
to the farm level, including fertilizers and pesticides. It has one main supply depot, five regional supply
bases, and one distribution facility (consisting of an Agro-chemical Station, and a Crop Protection Station)
in each of the 37 districts of the country.
Machinery and Input Supply Services
33.           Armenian agriculture presently works with about 12,500 tractors, 1,400 grain combine
harvesters, 950 forage harvesters, 2,300 drilling machines, 2,300 grass mowers, 1,700 fertilizer
spreaders, 2,200 spraying machines, 9,700 trucks, and a number of smaller agricultural equipment.
However, machinery and equipment are not manufactured in Armenia, but have to be imported from
other FSU republics. With the collapse of the Soviet Union it has become increasingly difficult to
procure new machines and spare parts in all the FSU republics, but in Armenia these problems are much
more serious because the country is land-locked and under a blockade.
34.           Despite the relatively large fleet of machinery and equipment in the Armenian farms, a
number of important machines for land preparation, harvesting, post harvest handling, and animal
husbandry are in short supply. However, under the current land privatization and farm restructuring,
with an estimated 300,000 private farms, the most limiting factor to mechanization of agriculture is
clearly the near total absence of farm machinery suited to the small average farm size of about 1.3 ha,
and to the even smaller average land plot of about 0.4 ha. Although the farmers apparently try to
compensate for this disadvantage through blocking of cropping patterns and field operations, this will
likely prove to be a transitional and unsatisfactory solution.
Livestock Support Services
35.          The Institute for Livestock Breeding and Fodder Production, which has about 100
professional and support staff, is responsible for livestock research. Since the dismantling of the Soviet
Union, work at the Institute has come to a stand-still due to shortages of funds. The current level of
funding is hardly sufficient to meet meager payrolls of Institute staff and does not permit financing of
other operating expenses, such as electricity, gasoline for transporting staff from and to work, essential
chemicals, reagents, and subscriptions to scientific journals. Some limited livestock research is also being
done by the Yerevan Zoo-Veterinary College.
36.          Veterinary Services are provided by the public sector through the Veterinary Department
of the Ministry of Agriculture. This include 41 Rayon-level stations and 321 veterinary posts. There
is also a central veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Yerevan, diagnostic laboratories in each Rayon, as
well as 12 quarantine stations. Currently, public veterinary services employ about 1,250 veterinarians
and 78 veterinary technicians. As of June 1, 1993, former state and collective farms employed an



82                                                                                  Annex 2
additional 817 veterinarians and 362 veterinary assistants. An estimated 850 veterinarians, mostly former
state and collective farm employees, have lost their jobs as a result of the dismantling of state and
collective farms through land reform.
37.           Livestock Breeding and Artificial Insemination. The Department for Livestock Breeding
and Artificial Insemination (Al) under the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for operation of the
national breeding program for all livestock animals, except for poultry, which comes under the Ministry
of Agriculture's Poultry Production Division. In the past, the Department has had 41 cattle breeding
farms and five pig breeding farms as well as six Al Centers and one Al post in each of the 39 Rayons.
The national breeding program includes milk and meat recording, testing, data processing, selection and
mating, and Al. Private breeding associations do not exist.
38.           Since 1991 breed selection and AI have practically stopped. Only four breeding farms
are left. All testing for milk and meat has ceased as the majority of test bull daughters were slaughtered
or are no longer traceable. Semen collection has ceased, as the number of breeding bulls dropped from
120 to 16 by mid-1993. Al for cattle fell to almost zero in the first six months of 1993 (compared to
almost 200,000 or an AI coverage of over 95% in the late 1980's), and to zero for pigs (most sows of
the large pig farms were formerly artificially inseminated) and sheep (about 500,000 sheep were
artificially inseminated in the late 1980s).
Product Marketing
39.          The Government is active in the marketing and distribution of most food products. The
Ministry of Food is still the main buyer, but the canneries, dairies, and meat processing facilities are now
entitled to sell their products directly to any buyer. The exceptions are flour mills, which are allowed
to sell flour only to Government-owned bakeries, because bread is rationed and remains the only
subsidized food product; and wineries and liquor manufacturers because their products are exportable and
export of wine and liquor remains a government monopoly. Because of the food shortage in the country,
the canneries sell their products to the Government at prices lower-than-cost for school lunch programs
and to other government and welfare oriented agencies.
40.           Milk and meat products are still sold mainly through state-owned retail shops, primarily
because state shops have cooling facilities. Prices for dairy products are now relatively high, compared
to pre-independence, and products are scarce. Yerevan, which has more than 30% of the national
population, receives only 25 % of the milk supply, partly due to increased transportation cost. In regard
to meat products, due to shortage of animal feed, price increases far exceed the increase in income and
demand has been falling.
Financial Services
41.           At present, availability of agriculture credit is not a limiting factor to production and
investments because agro-industries, due to the blockade and shortage of energy, are operating at very
low production capacity. Farmers have low demand for inputs due to the difficult economic situation.
With improvement of the economy it is expected that credit would become a limiting factor to agriculture
because the financial intermediaries have low processing capacity for loan evaluation, as well as for
savings, compared to the substantial growth in potential clientele.



The Agricultural Sector                                                                    83
42.           The total credit granted by the banking system amounted to 37 billion rubles in 1992.
Of this amount, about six billion rubles, or 16%, went to agriculture. The specialized agricultural bank,
Agrobank, provided at least 80% of this amount and the remaining 20% was provided by other state
banks and new private commercial banks.
43.           The Armenian State Commercial Joint-Stock Agrobank, or Agrobank for short, is the
predominant lender to agriculture. It is a joint stock company and has a wide ownership of 1,549
shareholders, of whom about half are state enterprises under the supervision of the Ministries of
Agriculture, Food, and Light Industries, and the other half are non-state enterprises such as cooperatives,
private enterprises, associations and private individuals. About one half of loans are being made to
shareholders.
44.           Lending rates are highly negative considering an inflation rate of over 1000% during the
past year. Rates are set mainly on the basis of the Central Bank discount rate. They are, however, lower
than in other banks where rates ranges between 3% and 10% per month. For agricultural loans, the
annual interest rate is 60 %', for non-agricultural state enterprises, 84%, and for non-agricultural private
borrowers and shareholders, 108%. The Agrobank obtains advances from the Central Bank at 30% and
is limited to an interest rate spread of 4%, i.e. annual lending rate of 34%.
45.           Arrears are surprisingly low, amounting to R 328 million, or 6% of the loan portfolio.
Rolling over loans, however, is common.
46.           Branch staff practices some form of loan assessment. The purpose of loans, profitability,
and repayment capacity are considered. Land titles and other assets are required to guarantee loans. For
those who have no collateral to offer, the guarantee of the state enterprise is required. Loan recovery
is not yet a problem, but is expected to become more critical in the future.
47.           State and Commercial Banks. Since the banking sector is highly segmented, very little
financing for agriculture is provided by state banks and the new private commercial banks. The State
Industrial and Construction Bank, which is the largest bank, lends no more than 1 % of its loan portfolio
to agriculture. While the new private commercial banks may be more inclined to lend to agriculture, the
amount of loans these banks may provide will not make any significant impact on the availability of credit
to agriculture in the next few years. There are also some cooperative banks but they are undercapitalized
and their operations are oriented to urban commercial lending.
48.           Government Lending to Agriculture. Because of the crucial need to sustain operations
of critical state enterprises and to support the newly privatized farms, the Government has launched a
special credit program. Loans are processed through the County Council. Agrobank administers the
lending program as a disbursement and collection agent.
49.           Informal Rural Credit Market. An informal rural credit market is slowly developing.
Suppliers provide farm inputs on credit but at significantly higher prices than government prices. In
return, farmers deliver agricultural commodities as payment, thereby guaranteeing the purchase of their
products. It is reported that many farmers favor this arrangement primarily because it is an assured
market, versus the problem of being unable to collect from state agroprocessing enterprises. As the
I      It is 34% if the loan is rediscounted by the central bank.



84                                                                                      Annex 2
distribution of farm inputs becomes privatized, trade related informal finance may be expected to expand.
Agriculture Education, Research and Extension
50.           Agricultural Research. There are 8 agricultural research institutes in Armenia with 26
experimental stations. The institutes are for:
-      Agricultural Science
-      Viticulture, Vine and Horticulture
-      Plant Protection
-      Soil and Agro-chemistry
-      Vegetables
-      Livestock Breeding and Fodder Production (para 2.35)
-      Veterinary Medicine
-      Agricultural Economics
51.           All Institutes have drastically reduced their research activities due to budgetary
constraints. Traditionally, research has been financed from budgetary allocations, contributions from state
and collective farms, and the sale of products by the relatively large farms attached to the research
institutes. In the past two years, however, public funding has been significantly reduced and
state/collective farm contributions have ceased. Presently, available funding just about covers salaries
and wages and, consequently, does not permit any meaningful research work. If the country's
agricultural research infrastructure is to respond to the requirements of the emergent new farmers,
substantial funding and reorientation/intensification of research activities is required.
52.           The most important shortfalls of the institutes are lack of access to research results,
technology, and methodology of adaptive research in other parts of the world. Basically the institutes
lack funds to provide training of Armenian scientists abroad, or to invite expatriate visiting professors
to Armenia; to establish up-to-date agricultural libraries, including subscriptions to essential scientific
journals and literature; and for comprehensive variety of field testing and demonstration work on farmers'
fields. Forage and pasture improvement research has been neglected in the past, as has research in farm
economics, farm management and marketing. Agricultural policy analysis is not pertinent to the
contemporary changes in the sector, including privatization. Finally, before the land reform implemented
in 1991, organized extension was not needed in the collective and state farms then self sufficient in regard
to the required skills they needed. This situation is drastically different now that land is divided between
several hundred thousand farmers with no access to efficient agricultural extension.
53.           Extension. Armenia does not have any formal organization responsible for transferring
technology and information to farmers. There are 10 to 20 Ministry of Agriculture technical staff per
rayon, such as agronomists, and livestock, machinery, and plant protection specialists. Although these
specialists have mainly administrative and supply-driven functions, they nevertheless can move
information to farmers. Many of them reportedly provide excellent technical assistance to the emergent
new farmers.
54.           Assisted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Armenia made commendable
efforts in 1993 to develop a modern, client-driven agricultural extension service relevant and responsive
to farmers' needs. Six USDA extension agents with 26 Armenian counterparts had taken up their posts



7The Agricultural Sector                                                              85
at six regional extension centers by mid-1993. Three additional centers became operational by the end
of 1993; and Government has made R100 million available to operate the centers in 1993, and to provide
them with basic equipment and transport and working facilities. By the end of 1994, the extension
service is expected to have a staff of about 150 persons, nine vehicles, a substantial number of bicycles,
and video recording capability. The service is already issuing weekly and monthly papers for distribution
to farmers, and has a weekly hour of "Rural Weekly" television coverage.
55.          There is an ample pool of qualified staff in the country from which extension agents can
be recruited. Government is now in the process of finalizing extension concepts and design. The main
considerations in establishing the extension service are: cost-effectiveness and lowest possible recurrent
cost requirements; how many rayons each extension center should be servicing; distance of the extension
centers and the extent of linkage to research and training facilities; and the extent of mass media
utilization.
56.          Training. Higher-level education in agriculture and livestock production is being offered
by the Agricultural University and the Institute for Zootechnology and Veterinary Medicine; and
technician-level training is provided by 10 agricultural colleges. A total of 598 higher-level students
graduated in 1992, up by about 60% from the three years before, including 135 agronomists, 74 land
conservation engineers, 194 mechanical engineers, and 195 veterinarians. However, training has not been
reoriented to meet the challenges of privatized agricultural and livestock production. This means that
there is not sufficient emphasis on cost-effective, smaller-scale production systems, appropriate natural
resource management, farm management economics, and produce marketing.






ANNEX 3: THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER SUPPLY
AND IRRIGATION
1.          The Department of Water Supply and Irrigation (DWSI) has the prime responsibility for
water supply, irrigation and drainage. Until 1991, DWSI was an independent Ministry. Since then it
has become a Department in the Ministry of Agriculture, headed by a Deputy Minister and a Managing
Director. The headquarters are in Yerevan, with some 156 field units covering all irrigated areas in the
country.   The DWSI supplies and distributes water to some 225,000 smallholder farmers on
approximately 286,000 ha of irrigated land.
2.           The Department employs some 11,000 permanent and 3,000 temporary staff, the latter
during the irrigation season. Due to financial constraints, the management is considering a reduction of
the permanent staff by approximately 10%. Most of the staff are skilled in the engineering and technical
aspects of water supply and in irrigation and drainage. However, project management, procurement,
contracting, economic and financial assessment, and monitoring and evaluation, are activities with which
they are unfamiliar. They also lack modern equipment such as computers, software, and basic laboratory
equipment.
3.           The DWSI is divided into three sections (see Organogram 1). The largest section is the
Construction and Water Supply section, which has six divisions:
-     Construction, with 56 field units;
-     Operation and Maintenance, with 66 field units;'
-     Pumping Stations, with 32 field units;
-     Vorotan-Arpa-Sevan-Operational Management, with two project units;
-     Rock Excavation; and
-     Industrial Support, which supervises production of pre-cast concrete canal sections and
the repair of pumps.
4.           The Water Resources and Reservoir Section has two divisions:
-     Water Resource Management; and
-     Special Assignment.
5.           The third section deals with the planning of water resource development. The work is
carried out by two independent planning and research institutes:
-     the Water Planning Institute (WPI), which plans and designs all water supply activities,
irrigation and drainage schemes; and
-     the Hydrological Studies Institute (HSI), which is responsible for applied research,
hydraulic modelling, water quality control and the introduction of new technologies. HSI
has eleven laboratories and two research stations.
This division collects water charges from the Village Councils.

ANNEX 4: THE IRRIGATION REHABILITATION
ENGINEERING PROGRAM
A. GENERAL
The Engineering Components
1.           The irrigation rehabilitation program covers an area of about 164,700 ha, about 60% of
the Armenian irrigated land. It consist of 12 irrigation schemes, including groundwater development.
2.           There are four types of rehabilitation works under the project:
*     rehabilitation of the conveyance systems, including canals, aqueducts, siphons and
hydraulic structures in eight major irrigation schems: Shirak, Talin, Abovian (Kotaik),
Arzni Shamniram, Lower Razdan, Octemberian, Artashat, and Getik. The area covered
under this category is about 151,400 ha (92% of the project area);
*     replacement of pumps and pressure pipelines. This category include four pumping
schemes, of which one, the Vorotan, is an independent scheme, covering about 1,600 ha
(1 % of the project area). The other 3 - Azizbekov, Mkchian and Arevshat - are within
two of the eight major conveyance schemes to be rehabilitated;
*     rehabilitation/ replacement of about 650 tubewell pumps. These are located in the
Ararat valley, within the command areas of Octemberian, Lower Razdan, and Artashat
conveyance schemes; and
*     the rehabilitation of four dam storage schemes (reservoirs). Three of these dam
storage schemes - Aparan, Mantash, and Sarnakhpiur - have their own command areas
totaling about 11,700 ha (7 % of the project area), and one dam storage scheme (Karnout)
is part of the larger Shirak conveyance scheme.
Sources of Water and Area of the Eight Major Conveyance Schemes
3.           All the eight schemes are characterized by being river gravitation systems. They are fed
by four of the Armenian major rivers: the Razdan, Akhurian, Araks, and Debed (through its Chichkan
tributary).
4.           The Razdan river provides water to four of the eight schemes; Abovian, Arzni Shamiram,
Artashat, and Lower Razdan, which together cover about 79,600 ha (about 52% of the eight schemes).
5.           All the irrigation projects in the Ararat valley rely on supply of water from the Razdan
River, of which about 300 million m3 per year originate from lake Sevan and 730 million rn3 originate
from tributaries of the Razdan River below its departure from the Sevan Lake. Additional water is
provided to the schemes irrigated by the Razdan sources, mainly by pumping from the lower Sevdjur
River and its diversion canals (through Arevshat, Mkchian, Ranchpar, and other pumping schemes). The
Sevdjur/Kasakh Rivers (with annual runoff of over 1,050 million m3 per year), and the Azat/Vedi (with



90                                                                                 Annex 4
a flow of about 300 million m3 per year), are the main supplementary source, along with a large amount
of water pumped from tubewells (estimated at 500 million m3/year) that utilize the huge groundwater
aquifer of the valley.
6.           The Akhurian River, with average annual flow of 985 million m3, is the main provider
of water to two schemes, Shirak and Talin (43,800 ha). It is the only river in Armenia which is equipped
with enough storage capacity to accumulate the winter and the snow-melt flows that are required to back
up the decreasing rivers' flows of the spring/summer irrigation season.
7.           The Araks River, with an annual flow of 1,930 million m3, feeds the Octemberian
scheme (21,600 ha). Armenia's share in the Araks flow is 50 percent, according to an agreement with
Turkey; the two countries share the diversion facilities. Presently Armenia experiences a shortage of
water to provide the Octemberian scheme in the late season. Such shortage cannot be resolved before a
joint reservoir being negotiated with Turkey, is constructed. Meanwhile, pumping from lower Sevdjur,
drainage collectors, and tubewell pumping cover the water deficit of the Octemberian scheme during the
irrigation season.
8.           The Chichkan/Pambak rivers, a sub-tributary and a tributary of the Debed River
respectively, with average annual flow of 1,090 million m3, provide the water to the Getik conveyance
scheme (6,400 ha). The Chichkan River flows decrease during the spring and summer. Only after
completion of a storage reservoir (started in 1985 but stopped after the 1988 earthquake) could the scheme
be extended by about 50%. However, the winter flows could be used, in the meantime, to produce
hydropower to the Spitak area.
9.           All the eight schemes are, basically, gravity systems. However, all of them are provided
with pumping facilities of one of two types': (a) pumping that brings additional water to the scheme (i.e
Sevdjur's Mkchian, Arevshat and Ranchpar, drainage collectors, tubewells); and (b) pumping facilities
that lift water from the schemes' gravity main or secondary canals to higher lands within the command,
or raise, within the command, the water pressure in closed pipes for sprinkler irrigation. The majority
of the sprinklers are now abandoned, as the 1991 land reform resulted in land fragmentation, which made
irrigation with the large sprinklers unpractical.
B. SCOPE OF WORKS REQUIRED
General
10.          The rehabilitation works under the project include some 141.5 kmn of main canals, 523.2
km of secondary canals, 1,411.0 km of tertiary canals and 548.5 km of non-pressure pipes, of which
412.9 km are made of concrete and the balance of 135.6 km are made of steel.
11.          Most of the conveyance network is in an unsatisfactory condition. The unlined canals
have lost their geometrical cross-sections, due to earth slides, erosion, and encroaching vegetation. The
condition of lined canals is not much better. In many cases long stretches of lining have deteriorated and
in places completely disappeared. In the reinforced concrete aqueducts, the concrete has deteriorated and
I     The pumping do not exceed a lift of more than 100 m.



The Irrigation Rehabilitation Engineering Program                                          91
water is leaking through the walls and floor of the aqueduct. In some places enterprising farmers have
made use of a free water supply. In some locations the collapse of the aqueduct appears imminent.
12.           The deterioration of the conveyance system may be attributed to a combination of causes:
inappropriate design; lack of quality control during construction; bad and insufficient construction
material; indifferent workmanship; lack of maintenance; normal aging; adverse climatic conditions and
possibly corrosive water.
13.           As experience indicates, the quality of concrete produced in precast factories is better than
the concrete cast on the building sites. However, the precast concrete is also deficient. One of the main
reasons for the low quality concrete is the use of unwashed aggregates and sand, with high contents of
quarry dust. This, however, is relatively easy to correct. There are other deficiencies as well, as it was
observed that the joints are not interlocking appropriately. It is therefore necessary to establish norms
where standard designs for precast elements of various types,2 including the joints between the sections,3
should be developed by DWSI.
14.          In sections of the conveyance system, steel pipes of various diameters are used. These
pipes are not under pressure. Sections of such defective pipes will have to be lifted and new pipes in-
stalled. In other cases, the concrete supports on which the pipe rests have to be repaired or rebuilt.
Wherever possible, part of the steel pipes should be replaced by the much cheaper and much more
durable concrete pipes.
The Conveyance System
15.           The works required in the eight conveyance schemes and brief description of pertinent
features are described below:
*      The Arzni Shamiram Scheme. The scheme commands an area of about 34,000 ha in the
Ashtarak and Nairi Districts. The rehabilitation works within the conveyance systems
of the scheme include the construction of 20 kn of main canals, 47.3 km of secondaries,
343.0 km of tertiaries and 236.5 km of pipes, of which 163.8 km of concrete and 72.7
km of steel. The estimated cost of these works is US $4,418,000, or about 130.0
US$/ha.
*      The Talin Scheme. The scheme commands an area of about 30,000 ha in the Talin and
Bagramian Districts. The rehabilitation works within the conveyance systems of the
scheme include the construction of 280 km of main canals, 157.8 km of secondaries,
244.4 km of tertiaries and 11.3 km of steel pipes, and the estimated cost of these works
is US$ 2,100,000, or about 70 US$/ha.
*      The Octembrian Scheme. The scheme commands an area of about 21,600 ha in the
2      Panels to line earth canals, aqueduct sections, small concrete flumes (canaletti) and control and outlet structures.
3      Precast units should be designed to interlock with each other, and where water-tightness is required the joints
should be provided with water stops and sealants.



92                                                                                    Annex 4
Bagramian and Armavir (Octemberian) Districts. The rehabilitation works of the scheme
include two components:
(a)    the intake and diversion canal on the Araks river. This include: (i) rehabilitation
of the intake; (ii) construction of the sand silting basin (0.82 km of the diversion
canal); and (iii) increase of the main canal capacity along the first 4 km from 35
m3/sec up to 53.0 m3/sec. The rehabilitation is in compliance with an agreement
with Turkey (March 30, 1979) for increasing the intake and the diversion canal
capacity for better operation and maintenance of the irrigation system4; and
(b)    the conveyance system, which include: construction of 39.6 km of main canals,
79.0 km of secondaries, and 216 km of tertiary canals. The estimated cost of
these works - including the diversion - is 2,155,000 US$, or about 99.8 US$/ha.
*      The Artashat Scheme.  The scheme commands an area of about 24,000 ha in the
Artashat, Masis, Yerevan and Ararat Districts. The rehabilitation works within the
conveyance systems of the scheme include the construction of 19.9 km of main canals,
41.0 km of secondaries, 265.6 km of tertiaries and 85 km of pipes, of which 71 km of
concrete and 14.0 km of steel. The estimated cost of these works is US $2,429,400,
about 101.2 US$/ha. In addition US $6,156,000 (257 US$/ha) would be invested in the
two pumping schemes: Azizbekov and Mkchian I & II, that comprise part of the Artashat
conveyance scheme.
*      The Low Razdan Scheme Complex. The complex scheme comprises five sub schemes
and commands a total area of about 13,300 ha in the Yerevan, Echmiadzin, and Nairi
Districts.  The rehabilitation works within the conveyance systems include the
construction of 12.0 km of main canals, 144.4 km of secondaries, and 46.0 kn of
tertiaries. The estimated cost of these works is US $1,982,400, about 149.1 US$/ha.
In addition US $3,121,000 (235 US$/ha) would be invested in the pumping scheme of
Arevshat I & II that is also part of the Lower Razdan conveyance scheme.
*      The Shirak Scheme. The scheme commands an area of about 13,800 ha in the Akhurian
District. The rehabilitation works within the conveyance systems of the scheme include
the construction of 7.1 km of main canals, 28.7 km of secondaries, 167 km of tertiaries
and 114.5 km of pipes, of which 103.1 km of concrete and 11.4 km of steel. The
estimated cost of these works is US $1,578,600 or about 114.4 US$/ha.
*      The Kotaik (Abovian) Scheme. The scheme commands an area of about 8,300 ha in the
Kotaik (Abovian) District. The rehabilitation works within the conveyance systems of
the scheme include the construction of 2.9 kin of main canals, 93 km of tertiaries and
59.7 km of pipes, of which 49.0 km of concrete and 10.7 km of steel. The estimated
4      The intake was constructed in 1930 on thc Araks river, with a total capacity of 35 m3/sec, equally divided between
the riparians. Turkey had already completed the works on their river bank, rehabilitated its intake and increased the
diversion capacity to 53.() mt'sec. Thte Armenian completed so far only the design (in 1991). but. because of lack of funds
did not start the rehabilitation.



Thle Irrigation Rehabilitation Engineering Program                                   93
costs of these works is US $1,260,300 or about 152 US$/ha.
*     The Getik Scheme. The works within the conveyance systems include construction of
8.0 km of main canals, 25 km of secondary canals, 36 km of tertiaries, 3.6 km of 2
parallel II-SP steel syphons, and 34.3 km of non pressure pipes, of which 26 km are of
concrete. The estimated cost of these works is US $2,565,000 or about 400 US$/ha,
including US $496,000 for on farm systems on 6,400 ha, the eventual irrigated area of
Getik. The Getik scheme rehabilitation was prepared in detail quite a long time ago.
Implementation has started in 1986 but stopped after 1988 earthquake. The scheme was
designed and built as a gravity supply system, diverting the water of the Chichkan River,
and providing it to about 4,000 ha at the river outlet to the Pambak valley. In the early
1980s, a dam site was selected about 4 km upstream the existing diversion, and work has
started on the dam site in 1986. After the 1988 Spitak earthquake, whose epicenter was
located some 15 km from the dam site, the diversion canal was severely damaged, and
a provisional pumping station was installed at the entrance of the main canal from
Chichkan River to the command area at both banks of the Pambak valley, and the works
on the dam were discontinued. It is now intended to complete the project as a gravity
scheme, with a new, larger canal at a higher elevation. The canal intake shall start
downstream the dam site, at elevation + 1,850 m above sea level. The existing
command, of 4,040 ha, which at present is only partially irrigated, would be increased
by about 2,400 ha of new areas, with complementary water supply to the existing
command and, eventually, generation of power at both the dam site (will not be built
under this project), and the tail end of the main canal.
The Pumping Schemes
16.          Four pumping schemes are included under the project. In all the four schemes, pressure
pipelines conveying water from the pumping stations to the distribution systems and some of the pumps
are in critical condition, and the replacement of the pressure pipes and some of the pumps are included
in the project. However, radical anti-corrosion steps are required to be introduced promptly, to avoid
the same situations in the future in these and other schemes. Protecting new, as well as existing pipelines
that still can be recovered through lining, coating and other anti corrosive devices will be financed under
the project.
17.          The works required in the four pumping schemes and brief description of pertinent
features are described below:
*     The Vorotan Pumping Scheme. The Vorotan pumping scheme which commands an area
of about 1,615 ha at the Goris District, at the far south east of Armenia, is part of a
larger command that gets its water from the Regional Vorotan Hydroelectric Complex.
The rehabilitation works within the pumping systems and the pressure pipelines of the
scheme include: (a) replacement of 2,015 m of 720 mm steel pressure pipeline, with 8
num wall thickness; and (b) replacement/rehabilitation of 3 pumps, at the total estimated
cost of US $188,000.
*     The Azizbekov I and II Pumping Stations. The Azizbekov I and II pumping stations are
commanding an area of about 1,622 ha at Masis District, within the upper reach of the



94                                                                                 Annex 4
Artashat scheme. The rehabilitation works include replacement of 2,800 m of 630 mm
steel pressure pipeline, with 8 mm wall thickness, at an estimated cost of US $156,000.
*     The Mkchian I & II Pumping Stations. The Mkchian I & II pumping stations are
providing complementary water to the Artashat scheme which commands an area of about
24,000 ha at the Yerevan, Masis, Artashat and Ararat districts. It comprises two
pumping stations, the lower with a discharge totaling 16.6 m3/sec, an average yearly
supply of 122 million m3, a lift of 75 m, equipped with 9 parallel pumps with 14.4 mw;
and the upper one, at elevation 872 m above sea level with a discharge totaling 9.4
m3/sec, an average yearly supply of 74.8 million m3, a lift of 85 m, equipped with 6
parallel pipes, with 9.6 MW. The rehabilitation works within the pumping systems and
the pressure pipelines of the scheme include: (a) replacement of 18,000 m of 1,850 mm
steel pressure pipeline, with 14 mm wall thickness and 1,784 m of 1,800 mm steel
pressure pipeline, with 14 mm wall thickness; and (b) replacement/ rehabilitation of 15
pumps, at an estimated cost of US $6,000,000.
*     The Arevshat I & II Pumping Complex. The Arevshat I & II pumping complex is
providing supplementary water to the "Lower Razdan complex" which commands an area
of about 13,300 ha in Yerevan, Echmiadzin and Nairi Districts. The rehabilitation works
within the Arevshat I & II pumping systems and the pressure pipelines of the scheme
include: (a) replacement of 15,800 m' of 1,420 mm steel pressure pipeline, with 12 mm
wall thickness, and (b) replacement/rehabilitation of 7 pumps, at an estimated cost of US
$3,121,000.
The Tubewell Rehabilitation Program
18.          Groundwater provides water in the Ararat Plain for irrigation and drainage, for drinking
water, and for industrial use. In irrigation, the main role of groundwater is to provide complementary
supply toward the end of the irrigation season, when other river sources are dwindling at a crucial time
for the plants, negatively affecting the yields. Wells for complementary irrigation are used only for 2
to 3 months per year. Another use of wells is to drain, through pumping, the large areas of lowlands,
which are negatively affected by high water tables. Of the 650 wells included in the project, more than
half (347 units), covering an area of over 11,000 ha, are used for drainage, for up to 5 to 6 months per
year. Their water is not lost however, as they are drained into collectors and their water is reused for
irrigation at adjacent lands. The wells are of various depths, from 30 to 270 m. The shallower are the
drainage wells, with capacities of up to 70 liters per second (250 m3/h), operated with electric submers-
ible pumps. The most common are 100 m deep wells, with an average capacity of 120 m3/h (33.3
liter/sec), and with pumping head of about 60 m.
19.          The condition of the equipment, both mechanical and electrical, is unsatisfactory and
hundreds of pumps are out of service. One hundred and sixty pumps were locally repaired prior to the
1992 irrigation season. The submersible pumps are made in Russia and their life expectancy, under
normal working and maintenance conditions, is four years.5
5     The reported life expectancy of the Russian pumps is low by any accepted western standards, where eight years is
dte norm.

20.          Under the project about 215 pumps would be replaced during each of the first three years
of project implementation (650 in total), at an estimated cost of US $6,950,000. The replacement is
expected to be within the Octemberian, Lower Razdan, and Artashat conveyance schemes. The
replacement would include: (a) 290 pumps in the Octemberian District (along the Octemberian collector
and Sovietachen pumping station); (b) 143 pumps in the Echmiadzin District (around Sovietachen and
Igerlich pumping stations and Sevdjur, Lower Razdan, Echmiadzin and Nedjirly collectors); (c) 29 pumps
in the Masis District (around Nedjirly and Artashat collectors); (d) 65 wells in the Artashat District (along
Artashat and Arazdaian collectors); and (e) 123 pumps in the Ararat District (also along the Artashat and
Arazdaian collectors).
21.          The proposed three-year reconstruction and rehabilitation program would include:
*     Boreholes:
(a)    drilling of 150 new boreholes in strict compliance with existing design
specifications; and
(b)   rehabilitation of 300 existing boreholes.
*     Pumpsets:
(a)   supply and installation of 250 new pumpsets, including the required metering and
control equipment;
(b)   supply of spare parts for the existing Russian pumps, to enable the repair and
overhaul of approximately 400 pumpsets;
(c)   rehabilitation of 400 Russian pumpsets; and
(d)   installation of 650 new and rehabilitated pumpsets.
Rehabilitation of Storage Dam Schemes
22.          The project would provide financing to rehabilitate four storage dams which are in
extremely precarious condition. All the four dams are earthfill and have a service spillway and irrigation
outlets. The investigation and survey of the storage dams focused on defects and on changes in the design
criteria since the dams were constructed. That included:
*     Revised seismic criteria for dam design. All the dams were constructed prior to the 1988
earthquake. At that time, seismic design criteria was for dams to withstand the effects of
earthquakes with an intensity of eight on a Mercalli scale of twelve. After 1988, the
criteria was changed, and dams must now withstand an earthquake intensity of nine.
*     Spillway designs were reviewed to ensure that the embankments will not be overtopped
because of inadequate maximum flood flow assumptions, or insufficient freeboard.
Present Armenian practice is to select a design flood on the basis of long term stream



96                                                                               Annex 4
flow measurements and by statistical projections. Western practice is to design spillway
capacities for a flood resulting from a storm producing Probable Maximum Precipitation
(PMP). If investigation shows that the dam may be overtopped by flood flows generated
by such a storm, corrective actions would have to be taken. In addition, large snow melt
flows, which are typical to the Armenian watersheds, need also to be taken into
consideration.
*     In at least one dam - the Karnout - dangerous deformations of the embanlanents,
including movement and settlement, were observed. In other dams, seepage through the
embankments and piping were observed as well.
*     In all the four dams erosion and severe deterioration of concrete in tunnel liners and
structures were observed. Water leaks through the concrete and at construction joints
exceed any reasonable level expected from the normal ageing process of these structures.
*     Preventive measures are necessary as well, as there is an accelerated deterioration of steel
pipes, gates and valves due to a continuous corrosion and cavitation.
23.          The storage dam rehabilitation program under the project would include repairing of the
following defects:
*     the Aparan Storage Dam: The dam maximum height is 51 m. The storage capacity is
about 91 million m3 at normal water level of 1835 m. Serious leakages appear along the
right hand side of the reservoir, with water losses estimated at 1.0 m3/sec. Attempts to
seal the bottom and sides of the reservoir through a program of grouting was
discontinued, because of lack of funds, and should be completed along a length of
approximately 950.0 m. Wet spots were observed on the downstream slope of the dam
embankment. The concrete lining of the spillway tunnel and the chute is completely
destroyed in many sections. Also, in various sections along the outlet tunnel the steel lin-
ing has collapsed and water is leaking into the tunnel; the regulation gates and their
lifting gear need to be replaced and the cone valves repaired. The cost estimate for
rehabilitation of the Aparan dam is US $724,100.
*     the Mantash Storage Dam: The dam height is 31 m and it is constructed of zoned layers
with a central impervious core. Cutoff and grout curtains are provided. The dam crest
is at elevation of 2,000.8 m with a maximum height over the river bed of 31 m. The
storage capacity, at normal water level of the reservoir, is 7.9 million ry3 net. There are
numerous cracks and serious deterioration of the outlet conduit, with muddy water
leaking into the conduit. The accumulation of mud at the bottom of the conduit is an
indication that an internal process of erosion and piping is taking place. Repair of the
conduit is urgently required. The concrete in the intake tower, the spillway, and the
spillway channel also requires rehabilitation. The irrigation outlet pipe is corroded and
the regulation valves should be repaired. The estimated cost for the rehabilitation of the
dam is US $179,100.
*     The Sharnakhpiur Storage Dam: The dam height is 29 m with a storage capacity of 4.2
million n3. The dam is built as a zoned embankment with a central impervious core.



T7he Irrigation Rehabilitation Engineering Program                                    97
The dam crest is at an elevation 1,847 m with a maximum height over the river bed of
29 m. A side channel spillway with a crest of 19 m. is located at the left side of the dam
and evacuates flood flows through a chute of 170 m. long. Water is released for
irrigation through an intake tower with three gate entrances at different water levels and
conveyed through a 600 mm steel pipe laid in a gallery through the embankment.
Presently the condition of the dam requires that the spillway has to be reconstructed, and
a stilling basin at the end of the chute provided. Strong vibrations endanger the outlet
works. The intake should be redesigned and the gates and valves rehabilitated. The
estimated cost for the rehabilitation of the dam is US $188,200.
*      The Karnout Storage Dam: The dam height is 35 m with a storage capacity of 21.3
million m3 at normal water level of 1,598.7 m. The dam is constructed of homogenous
layers. The crest level of the embankment is at 1,601.0 m. A side channel spillway with
a 28.0 m long overflow weir is located at the left side of the dam. Water is released
through an intake tower and regulating valves, and is conveyed through a steel pipe laid
in a reinforced concrete gallery through the dam structure. Another regulating valve is
installed in a valve chamber at the toe of the dam. The dam embankment is in process
of settling. The elevation of the dam crest is now 1,600.2 m, some 80 cm below
construction level and only 90 cm above maximum water level. The original wave wall
has also settled. Interim measures such as reducing the storage level in the reservoir are
imperative. The concrete of the outlet conduit is cracked in several places and there is
leakage of muddy water into the gallery. This indicates serious internal erosion ('piping')
in the dam structure. The estimated cost of the dam rehabilitation is US $222,300.






ANNEX 5: WATER MANAGEMENT
A. CURRENT STATUS
System Functioning
1.           The Armenian irrigation systems clearly indicate a state of transition. The land reform
program has turned former collective and state farms into a patchwork of small holdings, generally
ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 ha, which in many cases are split into several plots in various locations. The
people presently irrigating the land are former factory workers, school teachers, shop keepers, bus drivers
and farmers, etc; associated with the original collective or state fanns. Many of the present farmers are
inexperienced, working their new holdings instead of pursuing their chosen occupations.
2.            The irrigation delivery systems were designed to service large farms which may have
irrigated 50 to 400 ha from a single headgate or canal outlet. Presently, the same outlet may service 400
or more farmers, which in many cases, makes it difficult to deliver necessary irrigation water to farmers
not in close proximity to the canal outlet. Therefore, many farmers have installed earth ditches to
transport irrigation water to their fields. In some instances, the earth ditches must be installed across one
or more adjacent farm plots. Some adjacent farmers will not allow ditch easements through their plots
due to seepage and/or the loss of land. The result of these kinds of conflicts is that many farms do not
receive adequate irrigation water during the irrigation season.
3.            At this time, no formal network of authority to implement on-farm infrastructure has been
developed, and the result is a helter-skelter installation of earthen delivery ditches. Further consequences
are that some farmers located even a minimal distance from the existing outlets have no way of directly
receiving water and no dependable scheduling technique is used to benefit all farms. In some areas,
water distribution is erratic and many irrigators have broken concrete canals and pipes at points closer
than the originally installed outlets in order to get irrigation water, and then repairing the broken canal
or pipe with soil or sod, which leaks. As the number of repaired points in a canal system increases, the
delivery efficiency decreases. Consequently, those near outlets have a virtually unlimited water supply
and in many instances those at or near the end of the system remain water short.
4.            The primary irrigation delivery infrastructure is designed for surface irrigation and
consists of main canals with secondary and tertiary canals, supplemented by lift pumping in various places
to raise the water for gravity flow. A small number of former state and collective farms had more
modern irrigation infrastructure--center pivot and sprinkler systems--of which underground pipes and
risers remain. These systems are rarely used because of their energy demands, but primarily because
they were intended to irrigate a large area of a single crop, thus they are not suitable for the current farm
structure, with smaller diversified plots growing various crops that require different watering schedules
and applications.
5.            Stories of system difficulties, poor water service and poor ditch/canal maintenance are
numerous. There are also many instances in which things work much better than might be expected,
given the poor condition of the infrastructure, an administration that is under funded and unprepared to
deal with so many clients, and the disheartening environment in which farmers must work. They cannot
afford inputs; they almost cannot afford to transport their produce to market. In some instances, payment
by state agribusinesses that purchase the farm produce is delayed for months. Nonetheless, the farmers



100                                                                                Annex 5
are now charged for their water, an unprecedented development.
6.           The most problematic areas of the irrigation systems are those that depend on electric
pumps to lift water to gravity systems which irrigate 42% of the total farmed land in Armenia.
Unpredictable black-outs and low voltage due to a shortage of electricity have paralyzed many of the
pumps, leaving farmer without water. This past irrigation season the Ministry of Energy, due to lack
of resources, was only able to supply 46% of the electricity needed to meet the pumping requirements
for crop production. This predicament left many farmers with minimal water, and farmers at the end of
most pump systems had no water at all.
Water Users, Water Distributors, and Delivery
7.           Despite the nominal establishment of water user associations (WUA), there is little
evidence in the field that such organizations actually function. In reality, water users are organized by
villages, with outlet boundaries corresponding to village boundaries. Last year, during the first irrigation
season after privatization, the Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (OME) made agreements with each
individual farm unit specifying the amount of water the unit would receive and the water fees for the
season. The OME was overwhelmed by approximately 260,000 agreements and the government was
disappointed by a collection rate of a mere 27% of the water charges in 1992. Therefore, the government
instructed OME to make agreements with Village Councils for delivery and charges this second year.
The Government expected the Village Councils to execute agreements with individual farmers and collect
the water charges. This expectation has only partially been realized.
8.           Under this Village Council arrangement, water is managed by water masters or water
distributors who are supposed to manage distribution within an area up to 150 ha, generally supporting
300 to 400 farmers. This means two to four water masters per village. Originally, water masters were
paid directly by OME. With the new agreements, the villages are to retain 7 to 10% of the collected
water charges to pay the water masters a fair salary. According to official OME descriptions, the water
miasters gather information about crops to be grown the next growing season. With the technical
assistance and approval of OME and based on crop, area, and provisional delivery schedule, the village
councils prepare a precise water demand estimate upon which the water charges are levied. Farmers are
expected to pay 50% of the estimated charge by February 20, and are billed for actual deliveries by
August 1 and again at the end of the irrigation season.
9.           In actuality, most water users sign agreements with Village Councils but few really
understand the distribution schedule. Water users are given little information on the availability of water
or appropriate times to irrigate. Therefore when water is available, water users irrigate with little or no
cooperation among farmers. Without irrigation schedules or lack of compliance with proposed schedules,
water is not available to those users farther away from the canal. To eliminate the unpredictability of
water delivery to these end users, a responsible water master must establish irrigation schedules among
farmers and ensure water is delivered to the appropriate farm when scheduled.
10.          Currently, water masters perform their intended functions in some areas, but are virtually
invisible in others, except when trying to collect water charges. Not surprisingly, overall payment rates
are low; if payments are made at all most occur at harvest time. In most cases, Village Councils have
collected very little (11 % by October 1) leaving the water masters essentially unpaid this year, which in
turn affects their performance. This year, farmners in many parts of the republic suffered frost damage



Water Management                                                                        101
for which they are scheduled to receive compensatory payments. The government arranged to have
outstanding water charges deducted from the frost payments and paid directly to OME.
11.          Existing institutional arrangements do not encourage cooperation among water users, and
the design of the existing irrigation system does not encourage the establishment of WUA. Since the
privatization of land, irrigation delivery units are too large and ill defined to foster functioning work
related groups. Rather, they constitute huge units of 300 - 400 people, too many to be considered WUA.
With the installation of headgates, secondary, and tertiary canals, smaller delivery units will be formed
and WUA can be established and function as intended.
B. ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
System Design
12.          Water delivery units are presently too large to be operated efficiently or to support WUA
formation. The present design is lacking in farm infrastructure. In many areas, secondary and tertiary
canals need to be installed to deliver water to the approximate location of several farms and then install
earth ditches strategically to deliver the water directly to individual farm plots. Other areas simply need
earth ditches installed from the existing canal to deliver water to individual farms. In any case water
measurement and/or metering devices must be installed to ensure proper water management and minimize
the effect on overall water quality. The on-farm infrastructure can be simple, and in most cases can
consist of precast concrete and earth ditches, simple headgates, and weir control measuring devices.
Nonetheless, before a complete redesign of the water distribution is implemented, it would be useful to
carry out pilot projects in a few villages to transform the systems by creating major delivery units of
perhaps 75 to 100 farm units, further broken into small farmer outlet units, encompassing 10 to 15 farm
units. This should be done in consultation with the Village Council and farmers.
13.          The pilot projects should vary in design and could include pipe with individual outlets and
water meters, concrete ditches where siphon tube irrigation can be demonstrated and ditches with
automatic outlets. In addition some areas where sprinkler systems now exist but are not in use should
be included in the pilot projects utilizing the sprinkler outlet, installing water control valves, water meters
and various methods to distribute water to the field. Technical assistance would be required for location
and design of pilot projects along with training of irrigators and water masters in irrigation water
management. After pilot projects are initiated, monitoring must be established to identify which one is
best suited for particular situations and practices.
14.          Additional headgates should be installed at strategic locations to allow more efficient
delivery of irrigation water. Water users have damaged canals and pipes at locations closer than installed
outlets to get irrigation water because existing headgates are too far away and/or water is too difficult to
get to individual fields. OME should be able to determine additional headgate requirements while
preparing plans and schedules for standard repair and maintenance of the irrigation system.



102                                                                                Annex 5
Reliability of Water Delivery
15.          Experience in many countries has shown that the most critical characteristic of irrigation
service is reliability. It is more important for farmers to have reliable water deliveries than it is to have
adequate supplies, because they can adjust to shortages if they know when to expect water. Reliable
supplies enable farmers to work together cooperatively to meet their varying needs, while unreliable
supplies encourage misuse, over watering, and competition among farmers. The deterioration of the
irrigation infrastructure in Armenia, together with the parcellization of previously large farms, threatens
the economic and social status of farmers. Priority should thus be given to rehabilitating the existing
systems to assure functioning; designing inner irrigation structure for improved water delivery to make
water more accessible to farmers; promoting gravity alternatives in systems that now depend on irregular
energy supplies; and improving O&M and establishing procedures to sustain O&M. All of these steps
will improve reliability.
Water Charges
16.          For the immediate future, given the precarious economic status of farmers, and uncertain
opportunities for non farmers who currently work their new landholding, a portion of the recurring O&M
costs should be covered by project funds rather than depending entirely on water charges. Meanwhile,
the process of collecting water charges should be established more systematically and with better
information, clearly indicating to farmers that charges will be raised gradually until they meet real costs.
At the same time information about costs should be disseminated, and farmers and Village Councils
should have an active role in setting local O&M priorities and budgets so they know how their money
is being spent. Once the current major constraints on the economy disappear, transporting products
becomes more economical, and electricity is more reliable, full cost recovery should be phased in over
approximately a five-year period.
17.          Presently, energy costs for pumping irrigation water is totally subsidized by the
Government of Armenia through the Ministry of Finance. Since energy costs are increasing at a higher
rates than farm income, energy subsidies should be continued until the economic status of the farmers
is improved. The Government is now considering changing its policy and passing energy cost on to
OME. If this happens project funds should cover such energy costs as part of the O&M cost package
for which farmers are responsible. The change should be introduced transparently however so that
farmers know far in advance how much their water charges will increase as the subsidy is withdrawn over
a five year period.
18.          Over time, water charges should be set to reflect real O&M costs of the region, including
a share of overall institution costs, and electricity charges should be added according to local use. That
is, systems without pumps should not subsidize pumping costs of other systems, but the pumping charges
should be pro-rated according to all who benefit from the pumping. Similarly, if highland water charges
are to be subsidized, the subsidy should come from government revenue, not from the water charges of
lowland farmers. In addition, the cost of river and stream bank stabilization and mud flow protection
and restoration should not be included in water charges as they presently are. Such activities have
national environmental impact, rather than benefiting farmers alone, thus they should be paid from
government revenue funds. Drainage improvement costs that are attributable to non local causes, such
as high river levels from increased hydroelectric production and neighboring irrigation systems that raise
water tables, likewise should not be included in present water charges.



Water Management                                                                       103
19.          Over time, as WUA develop and assume increasing responsibilities for O&M, they should
become the collection agents for water charges. Until then, Village Councils are the most reasonable
collection mechanisms, through water masters or other agents. At present, however, the Councils have
little incentive to assume the responsibility. In order to operate and maintain the irrigation system, it is
feasible for the government to advance funds to OME and charge them to Village Councils, which would
then be motivated to collect water charges in order to repay the advance. As full cost recovery is phased
in, the portion that is to be collected from water users would be advanced to OME, thus getting water
users and Village Councils involved gradually and consistently.
Discipline
20.          Current water laws provide sanctions for destruction of canals and nonpayment of water
charges, but existing fines are small and there is no real enforcement. Village Councils are responsible
for imposing sanctions for destruction of canals and other infrastructure, as well as non payment of water
charges. The Village Councils do not want to assume responsibility for enforcement, for political and
other reasons, and they also prevent OME from taking action. OME has no authority to enforce
sanctions, however, it is trying to get legislation that will enable it to work through District Councils.
OME would like to levy fines for nonpayment, which would be multiplied every year that the farmer is
delinquent. Such action is bound to be self defeating, however as the larger the fine becomes, the less
likely it will be paid. Consequently, this approach would not achieve the objective of inducing
compliance. Ideally enforcement should be direct and immediate, such as cutting off the farmer's water
supply. The existing physical structure precludes such action, however, if the command area is broken
into smaller units, it would be possible to use group pressure to enforce payment if small outlet units are
cut off when farmers in the group are delinquent.
21.          Before this can successfully occur, a clear policy must be developed, supported by
necessary regulations or legislation and an enforceable mechanism must be established and promulgated.
Given the intent of the project to phase in full cost recovery, these provisions should be in place by the
third year of project effectiveness, at the latest.
Institutional Re-orientation
22.          OME is an administrative organization, rather than a service organization. Like most
bureaucracies, OME treats farmers as subjects rather than clients. One component of technical assistance
should be public relations and management support to transform OME into a focused, pro-active service
enterprise. This would consist of several elements: develop clear and effective communication channels
from top management to farmers and back up the hierarchy; develop regular information campaigns to
inform staff and farmers about opportunities, constraints, and schedules; assist regional and lower-level
staff to develop more effective ways to communicate with Village Councils and farmers; develop
consultative planning programs that engage Village Councils and farmers in the process of setting O&M
priorities and budgets; and prepare staff to be able to respond creatively to a growing role of water user
associations both as advising groups and management entities, including such actions as subcontracting
maintenance responsibilities to groups.
23.          Village Councils currently have mixed roles in water management depending on the
interests of the chiefs. Technical assistance should be available to Village Councils to engage them more



104                                                                                 AnnexS
actively in technical water management issues, rather than political. Information and training could be
directed to strengthen such a role, and at the same time, financing could be used to structure the interest
of the Councils. For example, Village Councils currently agree to collect water charges for OME, and
then follow the agreement with greater or lesser interest. If the government advanced funding to OME
and billed the Councils, they would have incentive both to collect water charges from farmers and to
demand high quality service from OME.
Water User Associations
24.           Over time, WUA should be formed and given responsibility for O&M and water charge
collection. A two-tiered structure should be developed, with outlet-level water user groups of 10-15
farmners, aggregated into a village (system) level umbrella association. Present conditions are unsuitable
for investment in forming WUA, as the physical structure does not support user groups and the Village
Councils are not suitable for the aggregating role. Nonetheless, the rehabilitation project can play an
important role in establishing proper conditions. First, pilot programs to develop simple, low cost
methods of dividing command areas into manageable units trying different techniques and methods to
determine which approach is most appropriate for Armenian farmers. Second, reorienting the OME and
Village Councils will create a better institutional climate for WUA to develop. Third, as OME gains
institutional experience as a service organization, it will learn which O&M tasks can be delegated to local
offices and eventually to WUA, thus increasing the underlying rational for such groups. Technical
assistance will be structured to facilitate these processes and direct resources and attention appropriately,
both directly and indirectly, through nongovernmental organizations, if promising ones are found.
C. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Objectives
25.           The field-focused technical assistance team will work in five major areas, each of which
has a specific objective to be achieved during the period of assistance:
(a)    Institutional reorientation
Objective:
Change the OME from an administrative organization that manages water supplies and
water infrastructure to a client-centered service organization that transparently serves the
needs of its clients.
(b)    Decentralized water delivery
Objective:
With the active participation of Village Councils and farmers, design and construct
secondary channels and outlets (major on-farm civil works) to serve no more than 50
farmers each.
(c)    Water User Associations Pilot Schemes
Objective:



Water Management                                                                       105
Determine the most effective ways to organize farmers into active, effective WUA by
executing 3 or 4 pilot schemes designed to test different participatory methods and
approaches. Active and effective WUA assume responsibility for developing minor on-
farm channels and outlets serving 10-15 farmers, low-level operations and maintenance,
water scheduling and the collection of water charges.
(d)    National Water User Associations Program
Objective:
Develop and begin implementation of a program to establish active WUA throughout
Armenia, based on insights gained from pilot schemes.
(e)    Cost Recovery
Objective:
Develop and implement a program to achieve full O&M cost recovery within 5 years of
project-effectiveness, in conjunction with WUA organizing efforts.
Institutional Reorientation
26.          Compared to most irrigation agencies, OME is in an advantageous position. It has a clear
mandate, potential financial autonomy and a relatively lean staffing pattern. In order to make the best
use of those advantages however, OME needs to change one significant characteristic that it shares with
most irrigation agencies: it has an administrative orientation, as opposed to a management orientation.
Consequently, OME sees itself as the administrator of infrastructure and water supplies, rather than a
client-centered service orientation, in which it acts as a management entity responsive to the needs of its
clients. The administrative orientation is manifest in a number of ways:
(a)    OME gives priority to developing its revenue flow (water charges) rather than assuring
water delivery, thus the "success" of a district office is determined by payment rates,
rather than the reliability or adequacy of water delivery.
(b)   It gives priority to farmers' obligations (to pay water charges), rather than their rights
(to know about O&M programs and budgets, and to receive reliable, equitable service).
(c)    OME issues directives, delivery calendars and water charge schedules without following
up to see whether or not farmers receive the information and directives, understand them
or consent to them.
(d)    OME collects water charges to fund budgets and work programs that are internally
generated; however, farmers are not informed about the use of water charges and have
no say in setting O&M priorities or in developing or overseeing the implementation of
work plans, thus they are not sympathetic to OME pleas to pay their fees.
(e)    OME's payment schedule reflects the budgetary needs of the enterprise, rather than the
seasonal cash flows of the farmers, thus requirements to pay do not necessarily coincide
with ability to pay.
(f)    OME recognizes that one of the most difficult problems farmers face is to establish field

channels to move water to their individual plots, which involves both technical skills and
the cooperation of neighbors, but it has taken no steps to prepare sub-district staff,
Village Council members, or water distributors to provide assistance to farmers in this
area.
27.           Over time, OME must depend on water charges to generate the revenue it needs to
operate satisfactorily. To enhance the likelihood that it can generate the needed revenue, OME will need
to change the way it does business. In a word, OME must reverse its overall orientation, becoming
accountable to its clients, the water users, rather than expecting the water users to be accountable to it.
This will require changes in substance and in appearance; it must adopt new objectives and procedures
and it must make sure its clients know about the changes. Specifically, technical assistance will help
OME acquire at least the following six characteristics:
(a)    Informative. OME must make concerted efforts to inform other officials and farmers
about the enterprise--its objectives and plans, calendars and budgets, strengths and
weaknesses, opportunities and constraints, and its needs and deeds. It should adopt
simple, direct ways of disseminating information and ensure that the messages reach
target groups. It must formulate a coherent communication strategy and mobilize various
communications methods to implement the strategy, acquiring the skills needed to
package and disseminate its messages effectively.
(b)    Responsive. OME must develop consistent, dependable ways to identify problems and
needs of its clients, and to adapt its programs to resolve problems and meet the needs that
are articulated, or else provide adequate feedback to enable clients to understand why
there is no response. Equally important, it must demonstrate concretely how it is
responsive--specifying which ideas are generated and how they are incorporated into
policy or program changes--and inform clients accordingly.
(c)    Transparent. OME operations and budgets must be made transparent so that clients
know what resources are required, how they are used, and what will be the result.
Without transparency, water users have no way of knowing whether or not their money
is being spent productively, effectively, and efficiently. Unless they are convinced that
they get valuable services for their money, OME's clients will not provide resources
unless they are coerced. Transparency in planning, budgeting and implementing will
enable OME to gain the confidence and support of its clients.
(d)    Participatory. OME must bring clients into the decision-making process. It should
develop mechanisms that enable water users, or water user representatives, to participate
in processes that set priorities, develop budgets, oversee implementation, and monitor
quality. Participation supports transparency and assures accountability, with little cost
and great potential benefits to an enterprise like OME.
(e)    Proactive. OME must be responsive, transparent, and participatory; however as a
professional enterprise, it must also be proactive, anticipating problems and needs before
they arise, and preparing itself and its clients to face them. In short, OME cannot be
effective if it is passive and responsive; it must assume leadership in ways that
demonstrate professionalism as well as responsiveness, that demonstrate a long-term



Water Management                                                                          107
vision of the enterprise and irrigated agriculture, as well as a precise understanding of
the current situation and how to move from the present to the future. This characteristic
differentiates OME from its clients, and potentially is the greatest value obtained from
water charges.
(f)    Skldled. To be proactive and credible, OME must have the skills needed to assume
current and future responsibilities. In the most concrete sense, this means that all the
people engaged in OME operations--full-time staff, part-time workers and water
distributors-are fully qualified to undertake their responsibilities. OME has moved
quickly from a governmental unit that delivers water to large collective and state farms,
to an autonomous enterprise that delivers water to thousands of farmers working on small
plots, without changing the orientation or the skills of its staff. The new arrangement
requires new public relations skills, as well as field skills, such as the ability to help
farmers create and maintain field channels, which staff must acquire in order for OME
to be seen by farmers as a credible, professional, and useful organization. At present
such credibility is at risk.
28.           A  technical assistance institutional specialist will help OME  acquire these six
characteristics by assessing OME communications, operations, and skills, and by working with staff to
formulate and implement programs to reorient the enterprise along the lines suggested above. The
programs will:
(a)    develop new communications patterns up and down the OME hierarchy, and between
OME and outside entities;
(b)    modify operational policies, objectives, and procedures to assure participation,
transparency, and responsiveness, and to communicate the changes to clients and
colleagues; and
(c)    formulate and help implement a human resources development strategy that gives staff
the skills they need now to work effectively, and prepares staff and farmers for future
responsibilities.
Decentralized Water Delivery
29.           Despite the fact that the irrigation systems were designed to deliver water to an outlet that
serves a large collective or state farm, and that the command areas have been divided into many small
parcels that must each receive water, the systems are operating better than one would expect. Without
assistance, and without an established means to adjudicate conflicts or differences of opinion, most
farmers have dug field channels to reach their fields in one way or another, either from existing outlets
or new outlets that they created by breaking the canals. However, many of these adjustments are
wasteful, inefficient, and ineffective; thus water delivery is irregular and inequitable, or at least
potentially so. As quickly as possible, secondary, tertiary, and on-farm delivery systems must be
regularized and fully articulated to ensure that water deliveries can be equitable and efficient.



108                                                                                Annex 5
30.          Water delivery should be decentralized in a two-stage process using project financial and
technical assistance resources. In the first stage, secondary and tertiary channels and outlets (major on-
farm civil works) will be constructed to deliver water to units of 20 ha or less, depending on terrain.
In the second stage, implemented while organizing WUA, micro-channels (minor-on-farm civil works)
will be constructed to deliver water to groups of 10 to 15 farmers.
31.          Major on-farm channels will be constructed under OME supervision, using local
participation in design and construction as much as possible. Village boundaries coincide with irrigation
system boundaries, thus the Village Council can assist in mobilizing participation and, as appropriate,
oversee the process.
32.          A technical assistance water management specialist (on-farm irrigation engineer) will help
OME develop general specifications for the major on-farm channels and gates and, working with the
technical assistance community organizer, train OME field-level staff to carry out the operations.
33.          The objective in the design and construction of the major on-farm civil works is to make
the work as simple as possible, technically and socially. That is, using acceptable technical criteria, the
channels should make the best use of the terrain, be as short as possible and take up as little land as
possible. Field execution will have three critical components: consultation, technical design, and
participatory execution. At the outset, the OME engineer will meet with the Village Council and farmers
to explain the task and obtain the advice of officials and farmers on the location of channels. Technical
design will follow, based on field surveys and observation. Once the design is completed, the engineer
will meet again with the Village Council and farmers to describe design options considered, explain the
rationale for the selection of the final choice, describe O&M implications of the choice and seek consent.
Once agreement is reached on the design, the engineer and Village Council will organize the construction
process. The engineer will specify labor and material requirements and the Village Council will mobilize
farmers to maximize participation in the construction phase and thus to maximize local ownership.
34.          Once the approach is fully developed and organized, and staff are trained, this whole
process can be executed in a decentralized fashion. Constrained by the number of sites for which each
field engineer would be responsible, this program should be fully completed within two years of project
effectiveness. First priority would be given to villages that would be the site of WUA pilot schemes.
Work in such villages must be completed during the first year.
WUA Pilot Schemes
35.          The WUA pilot scheme program  would be designed to test different methods of
organizing farmers and mobilizing their resources for minor on-farm civil works, to determine the most
cost-effective way to develop and implement a national water user association program. A technical
assistance community organizer would design and advise OME in the implementation of pilot schemes
in 3 or 4 villages. The schemes would cover a whole irrigation system (village), using different
organizational methods in different parts of the system. Specific pilot schemes would be designed and
organized with the active involvement of the Village Council and farmers, based on commitments
negotiated at the outset. The program design would specify the experimental framework used, identifying
variables to manipulate, indicators to monitor and outcomes to evaluate. At least four different
approaches would be used to organize farmers using: regular OME staff; Village Council members;
outside organizers; and trained local organizers. To the extent possible, the different approaches will be



Water Management                                                                       109
used in each site, varying the level of intensity of contact in each.
36.          The most important caveat in the design of the pilot schemes is to ensure that the pilots
require no more financial, technical, or staff resources to implement than can reasonably be expected to
be available for any site through a national program.
37.          The technical assistance community organizer will design the program, train staff, advise
during implementation (two years), oversee a program evaluation, and draft a final report that presents
findings, conclusions, and recommendations for a national program.
WUA National Program
38.          By the middle of the fourth year of project effectiveness, the technical assistance team
will jointly prepare a program to organize water user associations throughout Armenia, drawing on the
findings of the pilot schemes and lessons learned while implementing the major on-farm civil works
program and various communications efforts. Given the level of accumulated experience at that point,
the program should be designed to begin implementation during project year five and continue entirely
with OME staffing after the withdrawal of the technical assistance team at the end of year five.
39.          The program would be designed to establish a proper legal and institutional framework
for WUA, enabling them to have the responsibility and authority to collect water charges, to enforce
payment through group sanctions, and to contract with OME to undertake O&M responsibilities as
desired. The framework would recognize the rights of WUA to participate in OME decision-making
processes, establish OME's accountability to WUA, and specify the relationship between WUA and
between WUA and Village Councils.
Cost Recovery
40.          Perhaps OME's greatest challenge is to make itself financially autonomous, to generate
from water charges the revenue it needs to execute routine O&M, replace machinery, and upgrade
systems. This is an opportunity afforded to too few irrigation agencies, an opportunity to make the
enterprise accountable to farmers, who can express their satisfaction by paying or not, and who can be
assured that their payments stay in the irrigation sector, rather than go to a general revenue office.
Nonetheless, OME has a few obstacles to overcome to make this opportunity a real opportunity for
advancement.
41.          Prior to the parcellization of state and collective farms, water charges were invisible to
farmers, if they existed at all. Once the land was distributed, however, and OME was made an
autonomous entity, Armenian farmers were told that they must pay water charges. In most countries,
such new cost recovery policies are effected when systems are newly constructed or rehabilitated, and
farmers are due to see immediate benefits. They are imposed with prior warning, so farmers know what
to expect and there may or may not be concomitant enforcement mechanisms to assure compliance. In
the case of Armenia however, cost recovery policies were adopted without prior warning, unrelated to
system improvements. Indeed, water charges were imposed at the point when the systems were required
to meet needs for which they were not even designed. Instead of signalling an improved situation, water
charges signalled the deterioration of the irrigation systems. Given this situation, collection has been



110                                                                                 Annex S
greater than one might expect.
42.           OME has tried two methods of levying and collecting water charges: first, by making
contracts with individual farmers; and then by contracting with Village Councils, who were to write
individual contracts. Not surprisingly, neither system has worked. OME has not done an effective job
of informing farmers about water charges or water schedules and, except for the odd opportunity to
deduct water charges from frost subsidies or state enterprise payments, OME has not aggressively sought
to collect. Consequently, OME's ability to function has been compromised--it does not have the budget
it needs to do the work that would have the impact that would induce farmers to pay the charges. OME
is caught between what is required and what is reasonable. That is, it cannot be too aggressive about
collecting until it can demonstrate its effectiveness in O&M, because of political repercussions; yet it
cannot demonstrate effectiveness until it generates the revenue it needs. It has received subsidies at the
end of the year, but they come too late to allow OME to establish the credibility it wants and needs.
Moreover, if it indeed is required to pass electricity charges on to farmers in 1994, the situation will
worsen, because charges will increase markedly without obvious justification.
43.           Given the current situation, OME should revise its water charge schedule to phase in full
cost recovery over a five-year period, corresponding to the project period, increasing 20% each year.
Project funds will cover the balance, thus enabling OME to do its work, fulfill its responsibilities, and
establish credibility. The full technical assistance team will assist in this process by helping to:
(a)    create effective communication patterns and information flows, thus giving farmers
proper information and adequate warning;
(b)    make systems complete and functional, assuring reliable water delivery;
(c)    ensure that O&M programs are well conceived, cost-effective, well executed, and well
publicized;
(d)    establish means for farmers to participate in decision-making processes, ensuring
transparency and accountability; and
(e)    create and disseminate a corporate vision, with appropriate action plan, so people inside
and outside of OME know where the enterprise is going and how it will get there.
These steps, reflecting the achievement of other objectives identified above, will create the environment
in which OME can seriously implement a cost recovery program that will be acceptable to farmers.
D. TERMS OF REFERENCE
Background
44.           Concurrent with the privatization of land in Armenia in 1991, the Ministry of Agriculture
turned a department responsible for irrigation operation and maintenance into a financially autonomous
state enterprise, the Operation and Maintenance Enterprise (OME). The irrigation systems were designed



Water Management                                                                       111
to deliver water to large state and collective farms, each of which was considered a client. The
privatization of land brought three major changes:
(a)   first, the number of clients rose from 860 state and collective farms to about 300,000
individual fanrs and peasant collectives;
(b)    second, both farmers and OME had to try to manage water in irrigation systems that
were not designed to deliver water to a plethora of small plots; and
(c)   third, the OME was constrained to generate its operational budget through water charges,
thus giving farmers the unprecedented obligation to pay for deteriorating or unreliable
service.
45.           Not surprisingly, collection rates have been low, which has contributed to OME's inability
to carry out maintenance or improvement programs. The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project is designed to
fund investments to halt the deterioration of the irrigation infrastructure, improve irrigation systems, and
to provide technical assistance and temporary financial support to OME to help it become a viable,
functional, and sustainable enterprise.
46.          Technical assistance to OME has four major objectives:
(a)    reorient OME  to  be a client-centered  service enterprise, through  improved
communications, restructuring and training, so that it works effectively with, and on
behalf of its clients--water users;
(b)    complete major and minor on-farm civil works to ensure equitable water delivery to all
farmers;
(c)    develop active water user associations (WUA) that serve as clients and O&M partners to
OME, testing organizational approaches in pilot schemes and than launching a national
program; and
(d)    achieve full cost recovery to enable OME to function efficiently and effectively as a
financially autonomous enterprise.
Descripdon
47.          The OME technical assistance team will be housed in the office of the Managing Director
of OME, acting as advisors to the Managing Director and working closely with appropriate departments
and field offices to design and execute work programs. The team will consist of three members--an
institutional specialist (Team Leader), an on-farm irrigation engineer, and a community organizer. They
will work on most tasks as a multi-disciplinary team, but individual team members will have primary
responsibility for specific programs and tasks. Team members will work through OME counterparts who
are responsible for coordinating each technical assistance program, and who will be expected to assume
full responsibility at the end of the technical assistance period.



112                                                                                Annex 5

legal recognition; and mobilize short-term expertise as needed;
(b)   the On-Farm Irrigation Engineer will have major responsibility for helping OME
prepare appropriate specifications and manuals for major on-farm civil works; train field
staff for field application; prepare information manuals describing alternative designs,
materials, and standards for minor on-farm civil works executed by WUA; and, in
conjunction with other team members, develop training programs for WUA on minor on-
farm works;
(c)   the Community Organizer will be responsible for helping OME design and implement
WUA pilot schemes intended to determine the most effective ways to organize farmers
in Armenia; oversee monitoring and evaluation of the pilot schemes; work with other

ANNEX 6: LCB PROCEDURES, CONTRACTS
AND PROCUREMENT PACKAGES
A. PROCEDURES FOR LCB
Procurement of goods (equipment and materials) and related incidental services, as well
as civil works (including incidental electro-mechanical works) would be handled in accordance with IDA's
Guidelines for Procurement (May 1992 version). Presently there are no local competitive bidding (LCB)
regulations in Armenia. Hence, whenever the need for procurement under LCB arises, the IDA
guidelines for ICB procedures would be adapted to LCB. Requirements for LCB requirements should
include:
(a)    LCB bid offerings to be based on agreed modifications to sample/standard Bank ICB
documents. Key requirements should be:
(i)   the provisions in the documents must be detailed using Data Sheets;
(ii)   agreed basic documents should be translated into Armenian (legally certifiable
quality) reproduced and distributed as a separate document (similar to Bank
standard documents) for inclusion in all Contracts;
(iii)  the agreed basic documents in english should be similarly reproduced (preferably
with accompanying Armenian version) for the ready reference of non-Armnenian
speaking entities but must be clearly identified as a reference document; and
(iv)   Data Sheets and other variables unique to each offering are to be provided for the
Bank's prior review and no-objection on the basis of a certifiable quality
translation from Armenian to English. These prior reviews would continue until
a pre-agreed number of bid offerings have been reviewed and approved without
substantive changes. In this manner, any concerns with the application of the
LCB process can be addressed and corrective measures identified.
(b)    Advertisement should be extended beyond the limited number of available newspapers
(two exist but only one is now used) to include:
(i)   increasing local awareness of firm/enterprises by mounting a substantial effort
through the available media;
(ii)   specific notices (SPN's) should:
(1)    be posted in key locations (possibly bulletin boards) identified by the
Government; and
(2)    placed in key Ministries (e.g., Agriculture, Construction) having a
tradition of state ownership of firms. This traditional source of works
construction and goods production constitutes an information network
that currently exists and which, until the transition to a fully privatized



116                                                                                         Annex 6
competitive economy is attained, should be utilized to promote
competitive bidding procedures giving the Government increased
visibility in their privatization efforts. Access to the information should
remain an open and free resource available to all enterprises.

ANNEX 7: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION UNIT AND CONSULTANTS
A. TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT
OF THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT
1.           The Project Implementation Consultant is to be an internationally recruited firm (the Firm)
retained to establish, staff, and operate the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (the Project). The Project is dependent on the future signing of the Loan
Agreement for its financing. Financing for the operation of the PIU has, however, been made available
in the form of Projects Preparation Facilities (PPF) funds provided by the World Bank. The PIU reports
directly to Project Management Board (PMB) which in turn reports directly to the Minister of the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).
2.           The Firm will fulfill a series of evolving responsibilities throughout the estimated four
year duration of the Project which is projected to begin approximately six months after the start of the
Firm's Contract. During the initial phase (Stage 1) of the assignment the Firm will establish and oversee,
as specified in the following paragraphs, the setting-up of a fully-staffed, operational, and autonomous
Project Implementation Unit. For the remainder of the Project (Stage 2), the Consultant will supervise
the PIU to assure its continued compliance with established procedures, Bank guidelines, and agreed
project elements and schedules.
3.           During Stage 1 of the Firm's contract, estimated to last for one year, the Firm is to:
(a)    provide qualified staff for the four expatriate positions of the PIU whose responsibilities
are detailed in Section B;
(b)    establish policies and procedures guiding all activities (e.g., procurement, accounting,
inspection, etc.) the PIU is to autonomously perform in fulfilling its responsibilities
within the Project;
(c)    develop annual project schedules for presentation to the Board on the basis of identified
undertakings, objective levels of performance and schedules for procurement activities;
(d)    prepare agendas and presentations for semi-annual Board meetings to update the status
of the project and highlight positive and negative variations from standard established
in the preceding schedules approved by the Board;
(e)   liaise with the Ministry of Agriculture and its designated Project Management Board to
ensure coordination between respective actions and establish an effective communication
system;
(f)   recruit local personnel to:
(i)    complete the staffing of the PIU, and
(ii)   replace key expatriate staff upon completion of the Stage 1;



122                                                                                 Annex 7
(g)    design and conduct all necessary training to ensure appropriate transfer of skills from the
expatriate staff to the locally recruited personnel;
(h)    procure listed items for the Project Implementation Unit in accordance with World Bank
guidelines and procedures;
(i)    establish an internal system designed to facilitate supervision and as-needed technical
assistance to the PIU during Stage 2 of the Consultant's contract. This shall be separate
and distinct from the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within the PIU whose function is
project oriented;
(j)    phase the appropriate transfer of responsibility from its expatriate staff to its locally
recruited staff in accordance with the schedule and plan originally proposed and
subsequently adjusted by the firm; and
(k)    maintain quality controls on the Project within the planned time of four years as
measured from Loan Agreement effectiveness.
4.            The Project Director shall be nominated by the Project Management Board and approved
by the World Bank but shall be employed by the Firm. The Firm will establish an appropriate level of
com>pensation for the Project Manager and will provide orientation and other training as the Firm may
deem appropriate for assumption of Stage 2 responsibilities. In the event the nominated candidate should,
in the Firm's evaluation, prove inadequate for the task, the Firm may request the Board provide a
replacement and its request will be considered.
5.           In recognition of the conditions in Armenia, it is proposed that:
(a)   the Firm will supply a certificate of health for each of its proposed expatriate staff.
Particular attention is called to the limited emergency and evacuation services as they
may affect conditions of the heart, diabetes, and similar medical concerns; and
(b)    subsequent to the Firm's selection and signing of the Contract, if an expatriate member
of the Firm's staff is determined to be marginally or unqualified as regards their technical
skills, health, or cultural incompatibility, the Board should notify the Firm and agree on
the schedule for the individual's departure and the arrival of a replacement expatriate
more suited to the assignment.
6.            Within the Project Implementation Unit are two unique sub-units:
(a)    Pilot Projects: This sub-unit will be separately financed outside the Firm's Contract and
the consultant's will be retained on the basis of invitation documents prepared by the
PIU. When established, the Pilot Project's sub-unit will be administered through the
PIU. The PIU will not, however, be held liable for the performance of the sub-unit.
The Pilot Projects sub-unit will not be established until after the Loan Agreement is
signed and effective.
(b)    Water Master Plan: This sub-unit also has financing from outside the Firm's Contract
for financing the updating of the Master Plan. The Water Planning Institute (WPI) has



Terms of Reference for the Project Implementation Unit and Consultants                 123
been nominated by the Board and approved by the World Bank to provide such services
as are needed as an extension of its previous Water Master Planning assignment. The
Firm will negotiate a sole source contract with the WPI on an equitable basis. Work or
services needed by the Firm or requested by the Board prior to Loan effectiveness may
be financed from the available PPF as an advance procurement for compensation upon
Loan effectiveness. Additionally, the Water Master Plan will be responsible for
preparation of the next project proposed for World Bank financing. Funding for the
preparation will be secured separately. The PIU will coordinate the project preparation
activities.
7.           In recruiting local employees for employment by the Firm, the Firm will be expected to:
(a)    develop job descriptions for these employees and review them with the Board prior to
their recruitment. The Board may identify their concerns with the job description and
these concerns will be considered by the Firm.
(b)   independently establish salaries for their locally recruited staff of employees that
consistent with the local economy and availability of the needed skills within that
economy while being adequate for employees to rely on the Firm's income as their sole
support.
8.           The first period of the consultant's contract will be considered ended when the milestone
of an effective skills transfer to the long-term PIU staff has been accomplished; this is referred to a the
Stage 1 Milestone. For this purposes, MOA and the World Bank (the Bank) will agree on the basis for
evaluation and will jointly review the progress of the skills transfer program after 6 and 12 months from
mobilization. In the event it is determined the requirements cannot be effectively provided by the locally
recruited staff, the duration of the expatriate experts' residence in Armenia may be required to be
extended. Following the joint evaluation in which it is determined the locally recruited staff has acquired
the required knowledge, skills, and competency to provide quality services, the full-time expatriate staff
will be released. In the event the available expatriate staff is suited and agreement regarding their Terms
of Reference and compensation can be reached, they may be retained to accomplish specifically identified
objectives not within the present Terms of Reference.
9.           The second phase of the assignment will involve the continued autonomous operation of
the PIU with primary reliance on the firm's locally recruited staff. The firm will continue to be directly
responsible for the performance and will remain liable for any failure of the PIU to exercise due care in
the performance of their activities. The Firm should be prepared to provide additional technical inputs
and guidance as needed by their PIU staff in addition to periodic reviews and monitoring from the firm's
home office throughout the life of the Project.
10.          The Firm's reporting on the progress and management of the Project through the Project
Manager to the Board. Various forms of reports will need to be prepared and presented including, inter
alia:
(a)    A PIU Inception Report will be developed and presented to the Board within two months
of Contract effectiveness. The report will outline the planned actions anticipated in the
Contract, their current status, problems encountered and recommendations for any
changes determined appropriate in the agreed action plan.



124                                                                              Annex 7
(b)    Monthly status reports will be developed and provided to the Board members no later
than the seventh day of the month following.
(c)    Contract status/deviation reports.
(d)    Disbursement and accounting reports.
11.          The Project will be audited annually to determine its compliance with requirements of the
Loan Agreement and World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures. In addition to establishing and
maintaining a suitable accounting system covering all activities under its control and providing reports
on those activities, the PIU will assist in the preparations for the audits. Final arrangements to obtain
auditors is outside of the scope of the PIU.
Incentive for Early Completion:
12.          The early completion of the project infrastructure rehabilitation (e.g., dam/channel
rehabilitation but excluding administrative actions such as the Pilot Projects and Water Master Plan and
operation of the PIU through final disbursement and project closing) is deemed desirable and the Board
is accordingly offering the following incentives to the Firm:

ANNEX 8: AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
1.           The proposed project area will consist of a total of about 164,700 ha, of which some
134,600 ha (82%) will be in the lowlands, and the remaining estimated 30,100 ha in the midlands.
A. TYPICAL CROPPING PATTERNS
2.           The latest statistics on cropping patterns date from 1992. In 1993 there have been
significant changes which are likely to continue. The following Table 1 summarizes the 1992 data from
the district statistics and presents the best estimates for 1993. The estimates were made by specialists of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in cooperation with the Bank's Agricultural Sector Mission and the
Project Preparation Team.

grapes
3.           The greater part of the project area is situated in the lowlands (the Ararat valley),
where traditionally more than 80% of Armenia's agricultural output is produced. The underlying
assumption is that the cropping pattern evolution in the next five years is as presented in Table 2.
4.           The project will secure water supplies to presently irrigated areas, increase the areas
which can be irrigated, or firm up supplies to presently under-irrigated areas. It has been assumed that
future changes in the cropping patterns would occur mainly in response to market forces. As shown in
Table 2, the scenario for the likely development of cropping patterns indicate the following possible
changes:
(a)    cereal area would decrease as affordable grain imports would become available, and land
would be liberated for higher value crops;
(b)    vegetable areas in the lowlands would increase as fresh produce exports and processing
would resume;
(c)    potato area would increase for similar reasons as vegetables;



134                                                                                          Annex 8
(d)    overall forage area would go up in line with anticipated increasing livestock numbers; and
(e)    orchards and grapes would in general gradually increase as areas occupied by grain crops
would become available for higher value crops.
5.             As at present, about 13%  of the irrigated area would continue to be in "home plots"
(kitchen gardens); these small, intensively cultivated fields will continue to produce vegetables and fruits
for home consumption. The area under home plot cultivation, however, would not increase because they
already take up all suitable land near the villages.
6.             Although the project would be predominantly located in the lowlands, to give a national
overview, the table below informs also on expected changes in midlands and highlands in percentage of
irrigated area:

B. CROP WATER REQUIREMENTS.
7.             Crop water requirements at the plant root were calculated for all agro-ecological regions
and districts of Armenia by the Department ("laboratory") of Irrigated Crops (Laboratoria Oroshenia
Seldkhozkultur) of the Research Institute of Water Affairs and Hydrotechnics (Institut Vodnykh Problem
i Gydrotekhniky). Representative figures for amount of water, as well as frequency of irrigations, which
were used for the lowlands and midlands calculations of the crop budgets and farm models, are given in
the Table 3:



Agricultural Development                                                            135

Potatoes            3,000       5x         3,000         5x
Vegetables          8,000       lox       6,000         12x
Forage              8,000       6x        4,000         5x
Orchards            6,000       7x          5,500       7x
Vineyards           7,000       7x         6,000         7x
8.          It is estimated that the "with project" yields presented below could be attained if 70%
of the above crop water requirements would reach the plant roots at the right time, and thus would
prevent shortages of water at critical phases of crop development.
9.           The project would assist management to ensure that good principles of irrigation
scheduling are being respected. The three imperatives of efficient irrigation water management are that
the water supply must be reliable, adequate, and timely. When the first two requirements have been
ensured, timing becomes particularly crucial and demands some irrigation agronomy insight and
considerable experience. To strengthen the irrigation agronomy capability of the research and extension
establishment, the project would finance some soil water measuring equipment, such as one weighing
lysimeter, one time dimension reflectometer, and a number of tensiometers and gypsum blocks, as well
as soil augers.
10.          While overall water use efficiency from the source to the plant without the project is
estimated at 35% at best, it is judged that in the "with project" situation the efficiency would increase to
a reasonable 50%.
C. THE "WITHOUT PROJECT" SITUATION
11.          Rehabilitation of the conveyance systems and the tubewells would mostly affect the
lowlands, where rainfall is totally inadequate for crop production. These areas include most districts of
the fertile Ararat Plain, with a total annual precipitation of about 250 mm, of which usually less than half
falls during the main vegetation period. The assumption was made that the system would not completely
fail immediately, but that water losses would gradually increase. As less water reaches the fields yields
would diminish, followed by changes in the cropping patterns. For the economic analysis it was assumed
that water supply would decrease by 5% annually, if no rehabilitation measures were taken and would
remain at 20% of the preproject level from year 17 and on.



136                                                                                     Annex 8
12.           Farmers' first response to a growing water shortage would be to under-irrigate. First,
the cereals and forage would get less water, followed by orchards and, finally, potatoes and vegetables.
Wheat, now irrigated three or four times, would receive two and eventually only one irrigation. This
would reduce yields to about 2.5 t/ha with two, and 1.5 t/ha with one irrigation. Lucerne could no
longer be grown: farmers would revert to a single cut of cereal hay, irrigated once, yielding about 2.0
t/ha. Eventually, only inadequately irrigated cereals would be grown for grain. The last to be deprived
of water would be the home plots.
13.           In the dam rehabilitation component the assumption was made that without rehabilitation
the dams would cease to function. Apart from the physical and environmental damage, their command
areas would be left without water, or at best with much reduced supplies from run-of-the-river flows.
These limited quantities would only be used for the home plots. Since most of the command areas are
at medium and high elevations, crops grown would be rainfed cereals for grain and fodder. The cereals
grown for grain would yield about 1.5 t/ha; fodder yields would be about 2.0 t/ha. No viability
calculations were made for the dam rehabilitation component; dam failure would threaten hundreds of
lives and that has to be considered as adequate justification.

D. THE "WITH-PROJECT" SITUATION
14.          The repair of the conveyance structures, pumps and dams would ensure reliable and
adequate water supply in the command areas. Yields, now affected by a shortage of water, would
increase and farmers would be more willing to invest in purchased inputs and landshaping. This would
eventually raise average yields to levels now achieved by the better farmers. It is unlikely, however, that
the irrigated areas would expand significantly, unless there are large unirrigated areas (tail-enders),
equipped with on-farm systems and not irrigated because of a shortage of water.
15.          With adequate and secure water supplies, the primary issue affecting agricultural
production would be the availability of inputs, and whether expenditure on them will be justified in view
of the market situation.
E. TYPICAL CROP BUDGETS AND FARM MODELS
16.          The calculations of budgets, models, and incremental production were done under the
following assumptions:
(a)    Calculations are based on the end-October 1993 exchange rate of Rb 2,400 = US $1;
(b)    Producer prices used were on the conservative side; they were either those paid by
Government ("goszakupki"), or the lower estimates of free market prices, where
Government prices were not established or not available;
(c)    All prices of inputs which have to be imported were taken at, or close to, world market
prices. Fertilizer was costed at US$ 120/t (Rb290/kg), the average nutrient rate was taken
as 30% which about corresponds to the average nutrient content of most used fertilizers;
pesticide prices were estimated at US $10 (Rb24,000) per kg or liter; one tractor hour
was costed at about US $8.30 (Rb2O,000); one combine hour at US $10.80 (Rb 26,000).
Note that the actual prices in October 1993 for most of the inputs, except the mechanized
field operations, were substantially lower;
(d)    Cost of water was calculated on the basis of US $0.015/Kwh, and a consumption of 0.5
Kwh per 1 m3 of 100 m lift, coming to Rbl8/m3 which was rounded up to Rb2O/m3. (For
comparison, in Washington, D.C., the residential cost of electric power in November
1993 was US $0.08174/Kwh, and commercial cost wasUS $0.04239/Kwh.
(e)    The returns to forage (lucerne and esparcet), of about Rb -46,000/ha in the lowlands and
Rb38,000 in the midlands, are calculated up to the point of hay production. In the farm
models they were recalculated into animal production. One ha of forage thus produces
in the lowlands about 195 kg of dressed wight of beef (at Rb2,000/kg a return of
Rb390,000/ha), or about 3,210 1 of milk (at Rb400/l a return of Rb 1.284 M/ha). In the
midlands 1 ha of forage generates about 2,570 1 of milk (Rbl,030 M/ha), or 156 kg of
beef (Rb312,000/ha);



138                                                                             Annex 8
(f)    The forage unit (FU) coefficients per kg of fodder crop used in Armenia are: 1.15 for
barley; 0.26 for straw; 0.5 for hay; and 0.2 for silage. It is considered that 1.4 FU will
produce 1 It of milk, and 12 FU 1 kg of beef. Dressing percentage of beef is estimated
at 52 percent. In the farm models, it was assumed that half of the forage would be used
for milk production and half for beef production;
(g)    The proportion of annual planting material cost in grapes is based on a spacing of
2.5x 1.25 m, or 3,200 plants/ha, a cost of Rb300/cutting, and an economic plantation life
of 40 years. Similarly, the planting material cost for orchards is based on an average 375
trees/ha, Rb 550/seedling, and an economic life of 25 years;
(h)    The tractor work in orchards and vineyards is for spraying;
(i)    Transport cost estimates are based on ARMPLODORODIE charges which are: Rb3,000

transport is charged at Rb400-500 per tkm with a diesel operated truck (Kamaz 8, 10,

18.          As indicated earlier, calculations are based on the assumption that with the progressively
deteriorating conveyance system, pumping stations, boreholes and dams, yields would progressively
decline year after year, until they would reach 20% of pre-project levels by about project year 17.
F. INCREMENTAL PRODUCTION
19.          Tables A.10 and A.11 show the
estimated annual incremental production, based on
the differences of expected yields in the last year  Table 5: Summary of Increment
before system rehabilitation, which is anticipated
to be PY3 for about 60% of the project area, and  Crops              Full Development
PY4 for some 40% of the project area. The data
show that vegetable production would be almost  Grain                     44,707
three times higher than in 1993; forage output  Potatoes                  32,118
would be more than four times higher; potato
production would be expected to double; fruits  Vegetables                135,309
would almost double; while grape production
would increase only by about 5%, indicating the  Forage                   117,195

even under the current circumstances. Table 5
summarizes  the  total  annual  incremental     Grapes                    60,709
production between full development and 1993.
G. NET FARM BENEFITS
20.           The farm models in Tables A.6 and A.7, shows the net income per farm and per hectare
at full project development. Table 6 below summarizes the net income per farm in project year one and
at full development.

The full development of the Low Lands would be reached in PY12. In the Mid Lands it is expected to be reached
faster in PYIO, because in in smaler area the adjusment is expected to be quicker.

21.          A more detailed analysis of net farm benefits was done for the lowlands and midlands
showing income per ha is presented in Tables A.8 and A.9. Under the prevailing cost and price
structure, the results are as presented below:
(a)    highest net returns per ha are being achieved from vegetables, followed by fruits, grapes
and potatoes; despite the conversion of forage into milk and meat, forage fares relatively
poorly, just somewhat better than wheat, which gives lowest returns;
(b)    highest retums per laborday come from fruits, followed by vegetables and wheat; and
(c)    best returns from the cubic meter of water are from potatoes and vegetables, followed
by fruits.
