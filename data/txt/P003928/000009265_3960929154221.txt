MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TME INTERNhTIONAL BANR FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR AN AGRICULTURAL PINANCING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$106.1 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years. including five years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
an Agricultural Financing Project. The proceeds of the loan would be on-lent
by the Governmrent of Indonesia (GOI) to six Participating Banks (PBs) for a
term of 15 years, including three years of grace, at a variable interest rate
reflecting the market rate for domestic term funds. 00I would bear the
foreign exchange risk. The PBs would re-lend these funds to their
subborrowers at prevailing market rates.
2.        Background.  Agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, more
than 50 percent of total employment, and about 48 percent of non-oil exports.
Agribusiness, contributing over 25 percent of GDP in 1987, links Indonesia's
agricultural economy to greater employment and higher earnings through value-
added processing of raw material inputs and provides a market for the
country's agricultural producers. Although trade in these sectors has been
regulated, the aggregate level of protection to agriculture is 11 percent
compared to 57 percent in manufacturing, and in some instances results in a
tax on producers. GOI continues to pursue a series of trade deregulation
measures to improve the competitiveness of domestic production. In the
financial sector, G0I has also undertaken major deregulation measures to
develop an efficient financial system including the elimination of barriers to
entry as well as phasing out subsidized liquidity credit programs. GOI's
financial reforms combined with an open capital account have laid the basis
for an efficient and market-based financial sector.
3.        Rey Sector Constraints.  While recent financial reforms have removed
some of the impediuwnts to the supply of credit, a number of institutional
weaknesses persist, and the access to credit of small- and medium-scale
enterprises remains restricted. Existing rural financial institutions are
unable to meet the term credit needs of agriculture and agribusiness because
they are too small and weak to engage in term lending. Agricultural lending
by the state commercial banks has traditionally been in the form of directed,
subsidized credit programs. As most of these programs are being phased out,
the state commercial banks have to mobilize resources from alternative sources
if they are to provide term credit to small- and medium-scale agricultural and
agribusiness enterprises. Private comercial banks have largely ignored the
credit needs of small- and medium-scale enterprises, particularly those in
agriculture, because of a number of factors: lack of long-term funds, the
relatively higher lending costs associated with smaller loans, and
unfamiliarity with agricultural lending and the perception of low
profitability and high risks associated with agriculture and agribusiness
enterprises. Collateral problems associated with land titling, inadequate
transport, poor communications and infrastructure support in the rural areas,
and underdeveloped credit information systems such as the lack of credit and
financial records have also impeded the flow of formal credit to small- and



- 2 -
medium-scale agricultural and agribusiness enterprises. Although the private
sector has reacted vigorously to the financial reforms, the market will take
time to respond to the term credit needs of the targeted sectors and a
substantial effort on the part of the banks will be needed to develop
agricultural term lending.
4.        Rationale For Bank Involvement.  To sustain sector growth, incomes
and employment, term credit is needed to finance new sources of growth based
on non-rice agriculture and the development of forward 'inkages to agro-
industry. The demand for term credit from the agriculture and agribusiness
sectors is potentially large. In the past, agricultural term credit was
financed primarily by Bank Indonesia (BI) subsidized funds, provided with GOI
guarantees and liberal credit insurance, and lent principally by government-
owned banks at below-market rates to priority groupe. The Bank's past
operations have supported these subsidized credit programs and reflected the
traditional lending focus on a single financial intermediary with directed
credit to specific commodities and target groups. Based on the findings of
the relevant Project Completion Reports and the Rural Credit Sector Review
(Report No. 6917-IND,, the results have been less than satisfactory --
inefficient and inequitable allocation of credit, poor loan collections and
unsustainable sources of credit. In light of previous experience, the Bank
has recently started moving away from subsidized lending and significantly
limited single beneficiary lending. The Bank's current strategy in the
financial sector focuses on strengthening the state comnercial banks to enable
them to compete in the new financial environment and fostering the further
development of the money, term funds, and capital markets. In agricultural
credit, the Bank's objective is to promote the availability and efficient use
of credit to the agricultural sector in order to support GOI's objective of
maintaining growth, incomes, employment and exports on an efficient basis.
The specific agenda consists of promoting private sector participation in
agricultural lending and investments, redressing the market failure in the
supply of credit to small and medium enterprises, and strengthening the small
rural financial institutions. This project, designed as a complement to the
Bank's Small and Medium Industrial Enterprise Project (Loan 3041-IND) which
provides credit and technical assistance to small- and medium-scale industrial
enterprises, will address the first two items on this specific agenda while
the third is the focus of a proposed Asian Development Bank technical
assistance project to strengthen regional development banks and Rural
Financial Institutions (RPI1). It is expected that the targeted approach in
the Bank's financial sector lending operations to date will be phased out as
the policy environment for resource allocation improves and the financial
system becomes increasingly competitive. As a transitional measure, however,
it is necessary to support efficient delivery of credit to groups of borrowers
whose access to credit is constrained.
S.        Proiect Objectives.  In support of the Government's financial sector
reform measures and its policy to phase out subsidized credit as a means of
promoting agricultural development, the project objectives are tot
(a) strengthen the capacity of the PBs to lend, on a long-term basis at market
rates, to private small- and medium-scale agricultural, fishery and
agribusiness enterprises and cooperatives; (b) improve the availability of
term credit to small- and medium-scale agricultural and agribusiness



- 3 -
enterprises during the transition period when the financial system is
adjusting to the deregulated regimel and (c) finance economically and
financially viable, and environmentally sound investments in the agriculture
and agribusiness sectors.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project would comprise:  (a) an
investment credit component to finance subloans made by PBs to eligible small-
and medium-scale investments in agriculture and agribusiness; and tb) a
technical asssistanc6 component to provide subloan appraisal advisory and
Management Information System (MIS) assistance to the PBs, staff training, and
assistance to eligible enterprises to prepare subproject proposals and to
manage their projects successfully. Out of the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan (US$106.1 million equivalent), US$105.0 million would finance, over a
three-year commitment period, an estimated 350 subloans requiring a total
investment capital of about US$187.5 million; US$1.1 million equivalent would
finance the technical assistance component of the project. The estimated
total financing requirement for the project is US$189.9 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange requirement of US$105.4 million. The bank loan would
finance 56 percent of project costs, and 100 percent of foreign exchange
expenditures. Technical assistance would be provided through the Indonesia
Banking Development Institute (LPPI). A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methodis of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9112-IND, dated August 8,
1991, is being distributed separately.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements were reached with
001 ons (a) eligibility criteria for investments which would be financed
under the project, (b) technical assistance financing, (c) arrangements
between GOI, BI and the PBs for the onlending of the proceeds of the Bank
loan. Agreement was also reached with GOI on B1'ss (a) monitoring the
financial performance of the PBs, (b) procedure for informing 001 and the Bank
in the event that any of the PBs fails to meet BI's financial soundness
(sehat*) criteria, and (c) provision of services to LPPI and to the PBs to
enhance their capabilities to implement the project.  Agreements were reached
with each PB ons (a) subloan eligibility criteria, (b) subproject review
arrangements, (c) onlending terms to subborrowers, (d) annual audits, and
*        (e) eligibility for continued access to Bank funds.  Agreement was reached
with LPPI on recxuitment of an Appraisal Advisor and an agronomist and
implementation of a training program for PB staff.
8.        Conditions of loan effectiveness are:  (a) the appointment by LPPI,
of an Appraisal Advisor and an agronomist, (b) assignment by BI, of an
agricultural economist to LPPI, (c) the signing of financing agreements
between GOI and BI and between BI and LPPI in respect of technical assistance
funds, (d) the signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and BI, and
(e) the signing of at least two Subsidiary Loan Agreements between BI and
state-owned PBs and at least two Onlending Agreements between BI and the
private PBs. The signing of a Subsidiary Loan AgreementlOnlending Agreement,



-4-
satisfactory to the Bank, with GOIB and BI would be a condition for
disbursement for each PB.
9.        Role of Women.  In Indonesia, women play a prominent role in most
productive economLc activities. In agriculture they constitute a major part
of farm labor and participate in the marketing of agricultural output. They
also partLcipate in the management of small-scale family-owned businesses. It
is expected that some of the recipients of financing and technical assistance
to be provided under the proposed project would be women. It is estimated
that about one half of the jobs genezated by lnvestments which would be
financed under the project would be held by women.
10.       Benefits.  The proposed project would support 001's objective of
maintaining agricultural growth, incumes, employment and exports by increasing
the access of target borrowers to term credit and sustaining the availability
of agricultural credit during the transition period while the financial system
is adjusting to the deregulated regime. It would finance economically and
financially viable subprojects and promote efficiency in the agriculture and
agribusiness sectors. The project would also contribute to the institutional
strengthening of the PBs.
11.       Risks.   There are no major risks, perceived at this time, that
could inhibit the attainment of the project's objectives. However,
uncertainties in credit demand and the PBs' lack of familiarity with the
appraisal and administration of small agricultural subleans, may lead to slow
project implementation and loan disbursements. These risks are mitigated by a
prudent loan amount and the selection of PBs with a long-term interest in
developing the agricultural credit market.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
