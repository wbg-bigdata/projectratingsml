A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and Sector Issues

Sector Issues

1.1     Madagascar has a population o f over 17 million, a third o f which is urbanized. Average
per capita income i s about US$290. In2004, 72.1% o f the population was deemed to be at or
below the poverty line. The primary sector o f the economy accounts for a third of GDP but 80%
of employment. Despite some macroeconomic instability in2003-2004, characterized byhigh
inflation and a rapidlydepreciating currency, the real economy grew by over 5.3% in2004 and
by4.6% in2005. The overall macroeconomic situationhas stabilized andinthe medium-term,
real GDP growth is expected to average 5%. This implies robust growth inthe demand for
electricity. Unfortunately, power shortages have become a bottleneck to growth as the demand
for electricity recovered strongly in2003-2004, without any accompanying increase insupply
capacity. The majority o f enterprises inthe Export Processing Zones, which employ over
100,000 workers (mainly ingarment manufacturing) were not equippedwith standby generators,
so the adverse impact on output was acutely felt when power cuts began inmid-2005. Load
shedding is estimated to have cut 0.5% o f f last year's economic growth rate. These shortages
also adversely affect the overall investment climate and discourage Foreign Direct Investments
(FDI). Power is anessential inputto the success o fthe Government o fMadagascar (GOM)
economic growth agenda.

Electricity Sector

1.2     At present, with the exception o fa handful o fprivate power producers, electricity supply
and distribution i s entirely inthe hands o f JIRAMA, the state-owned power and water utility
company. JIRAMA, with 6,500 staff, supplies about 400,000 electricity consumers in 112 urban
centers and 125,000 water consumers across 65 urbancenters. Access to electricity outside the
capital i s low (about 15% nationwide, but far less inrural areas). There i s no interconnected
national electricity grid and JIRAMA operates small grids inand around three major urban
centers, while the rest o f the country i s served by stand-alone systems, mostly supplied by high-
cost diesel generators. Madagascar has a very large hydroelectric resource potential, about 6,000
MW, whichhas barelybegunto be tapped.

1.3     The presently installed capacity o f the grid serving Antananarivo (140 MW) i s inadequate
andload shedding of at least 10 MW occurs at times o fpeak demand. This gridsupplies 70% of
Madagascar's electricity consumption. An additional 40 MW o f fuel-oil fired generation
capacity i s expected to enter service inmid-2007, which will ease the supply constraints inthe
Antananarivo grid.

1.4     JTRAMA's total installed generating capacity is about 300 MW, over 35% o f which i s
hydroelectric. Electricity sales in2005 were 754 GWh. Sales have increasedat an annual
average rate of almost 7% since 1996, somewhat above the average increase inGDP over the
same period. Hydroelectricity accounted for 65% o f production in2005. Total energy losses in
2005 were about 24%.




                                                    1

1.5     A new agency for rural electrification(ADER) operatingoutside the areas coveredby
JIRAMA's concessionwas set up inlate 2002, along with a national electrificationfund. ADER
began operating inmid 2004 and has as its mandate the objective of electrifying all 7,300
villages with more than 400 inhabitants over the next 15 years. It has an annual target o f 30,000
new rural connections over the next five years, but has yet to raise the necessary financing.

1.6      Legislation creating an electricity sector regulator (ORE) was passed in2001, but for
practical purposes it only began operating inmid 2004. It i s still inthe early stages o f
establishing itself as a full-fledged institution capable o f exercising its legal mandate. More
details about the electricity sector are given inAnnex 1.

1.7      Access to public water supply inthose areas served by JIRAMA i s about 50%, but i s only
about 20% nationwide. In2005 JIRAMA produced about 95 millioncubic meters of treated
water, over 50% of which was inthe capital. Unaccounted for water represents a third o f total
production. JIRAMA has uniform water charges nationwide. In2006 the average revenue from
water sales i s expected to be about USc30 per cu.m. Legislation setting up a water and sewage
regulatory agency has beenpassed, but not yet implemented.

Financial Issues

.1.8     JIRAMA has beenunder severe financial stress for the past two years. Tariffs remained
frozen from 2001 to mid-2005, even though this was a period o f highinflation, sharp devaluation
of the local currency and risingworld oil prices. Furthermore, electricity production costs also
rose because all additional demand inthe past few years has hadto be met by using expensive
diesel-powered plants. The inaction on the part o f the GOM, due to political reluctance to raise
tariffs, directly contributed to the financial insolvency o f JIRAMA. The latter was forced to
buildup large arrears to its fuel suppliers and was incapableof servicing its debts. The inability
even to pay for fuel to runits power plants and the resulting power cuts brought matters to a head
inmid-2005. GOMwas obligedto interveneandbailout JIRAMAwitha cashinjectiontopay
for fuel, to help ease the power shortages, which lasted from May-September 2005.

1.9      These shortages badly hurt the manufacturing and export-oriented industries such as
garments, seafood processingetc. which were unpreparedto deal with load shedding due to a
lack o f standby generators. This crisis brought an end to the complacency and neglect o f the
power sector on the part of the authorities, as it was a sharp warning o f the vulnerability o f the
entire economic recovery and growth program to disruptions arising from a lack o f electricity.

1.10     Very limitednew investment has takenplace inrecent years to increase power supply,
while demandhas increased substantially as the economy recovered from the political crisis o f
2002. Most ofJIRAMA's power plants are now inadequate to meet demand intheir service
areas. Over 6,000 requests for new connections inthe capital (backed by down payments) are
currently frozen, due to the lack o f materials to connect them and the capacity to supply them.
Additional generation capacity has been added on an ad hoc basis inthe past few years through
expensive quasi-IPP/leasing contracts awarded on a non-competitive basis. JIRAMA's
operationalperformance is unsatisfactory, with highlosses and poor maintenance. Thermal

plants are generally ina very poor condition. Billing, metering and revenue collectionpractices
are weak. Unpaid arrears o f large consumers, bothpublic (like universities) andprivate
(numerous manufacturing enterprises), exceeded three months' billings at end-2005.

Recent Reforms

1.11 After an extended stalemate on institutional reforms o fthe sector in2003, the new
government decided against privatization o f JIRAMA's assets. A diagnostic study and
management audit o f JIRAMA carried out at that time revealed the severity o f the problems
facing JIRAMA. This study led to GOM's decision to opt for a two-year management contract
as a first step towards raising JIRAMA's performance to a level where it can carry out its
mandate of providing satisfactory service to electricity andwater consumers. Giventhe changed
international investment climate inthe early years o f this decade and the lessons from
privatizations o f other developing country utilities, the Bank concurred with this approach. As a
result, JIRAMA has been under private management since April 2005 (paras. 1.16-1.17) and
GOMhas decided that the present short-term management contract will be succeeded by a
longer-term solution based on a public-private partnership.

1.12     Two belated but large electricity tariff increases were introduced in2005, amounting to a
cumulative rise of 75%. A further 10% rise intariffs took place inApril 2006, consistent with
the GOM sector reform program. Average revenue this year should therefore be about
UScl3/kWh. Average water tariffs were also raised by a third in2005 and by 20% inApril
2006. JIRAMA does not have a policy o f pan-territorial pricing for electricity, andtariffs
charged inareas supplied entirely by thermal energy are substantially more than inthose with
access to hydroelectricity. Time o f day pricing i s applied to medium and highvoltage
customers.

GovernmentObjectives,Policies,and Commitment

Linkages to Macroeconomic Policies

 1.13    The GOM's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states the overall objective o fthe
government as the reduction o fpoverty by half inten years. The three key priorities set out by
the PRSP are: (i)  improving governance; (ii)   promoting broadbased growth; and (iii)     providing
human and material security. Achieving rapid economic growth requires improved
infrastructure, particularly improved transport links and the availability o f a reliable electricity
supply. The absenceo fthe latter is bothan additional cost to existing businesses as well as an
impedimentto attracting inflows ofnew foreign investment. The provision o fpotablewater is
also a key element inachieving the goal o fproviding human andmaterial security.

 1.14    GOMhas decidedto stimulate private sector led economic growth inthree distinct
geographical poles, Nosy B e (for tourism) inthe north, Antsirabe-Antananarivo (for export
processing) inthe center and Taolagnaro, formerly Fort Dauphin, (for minerals) inthe south. It
i s indispensable for the success o f the growth poles strategy that the recent electricity supply
problems do not recur.

Sectoral Policies

1.15     Restoring and improving electricity supply to acceptable levels necessarily requires both
substantial new investment and major reforms to the power sector. The first major step in
reforming the power sector took place in 1999, with the passageo f a law abolishing JIRAMA's
monopoly and creating a regulatory body. This opened the door to private investment in
generation for sale to JIRAMA, as well as to the creation o f new generation and distribution
enterprises outside JIRAMA's current operating areas. New legislation was also passed for the
water sector.

1.16     JIRAMA's top management was replaced inearly 2005 and the utility is currently being
rununderatwo-year, IDA-funded management contract, which has already brought positive
results. Better generation plant dispatching, optimization o fplant operations, enhanced revenue
collection and cost control measures, have all contributed to improved cash flow and reduced
financial losses. Financial recovery from a situation ofnear-bankruptcy is now under way.
JIRAMA's balance sheet has also been restructuredthrough a mix o fwrite-offs and debt-equity
conversions (Annex 9).

1.17     JIRAMA's recovery process is fully supported by GOM, as shown by the measures
already taken, andbyhigh-level commitments publicly made to the donor community at a round
table conference onthe sector held inJanuary 2006. A task force with wide representationfrom
outside GOM was set up in2005 to study and advise on the best long-term structure for the
power and water sectors. Its work i s close to completion and GOMhas indicated that it will
follow the Task Force's proposal that JIRAMA be retained as a combined power and water
utilityunder state ownership butwith operations delegated to aprivate firm. JIRAMA will be
offered to the private sector to manage on a long-term basis under `affermage'- type' contractual
terms that are inthe process o fbeing defined. It is expected that recruitment o f the long-term
partner would be finalized inmid2007. IFC has already been retainedby GOM to act as its
transaction adviser to guide and manage the selection and contractual process. Figure 1
illustrates the ongoing sector reform process.




'  GOM would remain the owner o fthe assets and be financially responsible for all major asset renewals or system
expansion. The operator would have a long-termoperating contract and pay an annual `rental' fee to GOM for the
use of the assets. I t s remuneration would not be guaranteed, but would have to be generated from the cashflow o f
JIRAMA.

                                    Figure I:JIRAMA's ReformProgram




1.18    The Government's letter o f sector policy (Annex 11)reflects the progress made inthe
reform agenda and the future role o f the energy and water sector as engines o f growth. The
government's strategy articulates inter alia, the main goals o f the reformprogram, GOM's
commitment to the public-private partnership model and the implementation o f cost-reflective
tariffs.



2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

2.1     The Bank has been engaged inthe power sector inMadagascar for several decades, with
mixedresults. However, after years o f resistance to fundamental sector reforms, the Bank was
able to convince the government to consider far-reaching reforms, going beyond the interim step
o f a management contract, and viewed as the only way to resolve the utility's poor and declining
performance. The Bank has established a constant dialogue with the Government o f Madagascar
over the last three years, and i s therefore considered as the lead donor inthe sector.

2.2     Donor assistance would continue to be needed to finance long-term sector investments,
even when JIRAMA i s under private management. Inreality, given prevailingconditions inthe
internationalutilitybusiness, combined with Madagascar's handicaps o f small market size,
remote location, political history, lack o f a convertible currency, etc., a firm and explicit donor
commitment to participate in financing long-term investments appears to be a precondition for
attracting any private sector interest inoperating JIRAMA.




                                                   5

2.3       The Bank's close involvement with GOM's `rescue' o f JIRAMA in2005 and the design
o f its financial andoperational recovery program over the past year is showing signs o f success.
Inorder to maintainthe momentumofsector reforms, it is essential that the Bank remains fully
engaged. Bank support of the recovery program was clearly an important signal to other donors
at the recent roundtable conference to back GOM's reform efforts. They now expect the Bank to
continue to lead external assistance to the sector reforms.

2.4       As clearly identified inthe World Bank's Africa Action Plan, better power supply is vital
to promote growth and it i s an essential input for the success o f other Bank-supported projects.
While the IDA supported Integrated GrowthPoles Project (IG2P) will address the most
immediate barriers to accelerated growth inthree keyregions, the allocation inthe IG2P project
for electricity is necessarily limited. The importance of a reliable power supply cannot be
understated, particularly at a time when Malgache garment exports to the U S A and EUare facing
severe competition from Chinese suppliers. IG2P does not have the means to tackle the very
large needs o fupgrading JIRAMA's main grid.

2.5       The proposed operation is a logical follow-on to the Energy Sector Development Project
(ESDP) that closed on December 31,2005, but which left a large agenda o f unfinished business
that still needs to be tackled, particularly the short-term recovery program for JIRAMA and the
transition to a sustainable long-term arrangement for managing the utility. With the GOM
decision to put JIRAMA under an operations & maintenance (0& M) contract (uffeermage), it is
clear that there will continue to be a need for public funds for investment insystem rehabilitation
and expansion. N o international private operator ready to runJIRAMA will, however, be willing
to commit substantialrisk capital on a long-term basis to the utility. GOM will therefore
necessarily turn to the donor community to help finance JIRAMA's capital investment program.
Further external support i s also needed to reduce the degree o f risk faced by foreign private
investors considering generation IPPs inMadagascar and/or taking over JIRAMA's operations.
Instrument o f credit enhancements such as IDA PRG, IFC A & B loans or MIGA guarantees
could be employed as necessary.

2.6       The primary objective of providingIDA guarantee support would be to help make
JIRAMA's O&M contract appealing to prospective operators by mitigating those critical
sovereign andpolitical risks which have kept private operators and investors away from the
power sector inMadagascar.

2.7       The attractiveness of JIRAMA's O&M contract and o f small private hydropower
generation investment program will be greatly enhanced by the PRGbackingo f government
commitments under the project. A fraction o f the PRGF amount would be used to issue a partial
risk guarantee covering selected GOMobligations towards the O&M contractor. Tentatively, the
mainrisks that could be covered by an IDA guarantee would be: (i)       the regulatory risk i.e., the
risk that the G O M and/or JIRAMA do not abide by the country's regulatory framework; (ii)         the
risk that GOM and/or JIRAMA breach their contractual obligations under agreements signed
with the private operator; and (iii) inlaw, political force majeure, or currency
                                     change
convertibility risks.

3. Higher Level Objectives to which the ProjectContributes

3.1     The GOM is currently preparing its "second-generation" PRSP called the Madagascar
Action Plan (MAP)that sets out the "roadmap" aiming to produce a quantum leap inthe
country's development process. The Bank i s currently preparingits new CAS inparallel which
will support the implementation o fthe MAP. The CAS will reflect the GOM's focus on
infrastructure provision to underpingrowth and private sector development. The proposed
project i s thus a core element inthe Bank's support to the MAP because it addresses a critical
gap ininfrastructure and a key constraint for private sector development inthe Madagascar
economy. Growth andjob creation inthe modem sectors are vulnerable to inadequacies inthe
public electricity supply system.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

1.1     The proposed lendinginstrument for this operation would be a two-phase, six year APL
(mid-CY 2006 - mid-CY 2012). Only Phase 1(mid-CY 2006 to mid C Y 2008) o f the proposed
APLispresented here. IDAfundingofUS$10millionvia APL-1is described indepthinthis
report. An adjustable program loan provides the GOM with the necessary flexibility o f content
and timing it needs to reform the sector and facilitate an orderly commercial transition o f
JIRAMA. The GOM intends to commercialize JIRAMA through private operations. The search
and recruitment o f a new private operator to runJIRAMA has yet to commence, and the terms of
the PPP under which G O M and its donors would fund long-term investments for the `new'
JIRAMA,have yet to be defined. These actions are expected to be undertakenwith APL 1.

 1.2    This operation (APL-1) aims to assist the Government to prepare JlRAMA for enhanced
operations and private participation. The content o f APL-2 has yet to be defined indetail, but
components will be selected from a well-defined Government investment program to be
presented at the next donors' round table, planned for September 2006. The two phases APL
provides the Bank the possibility to introduce appropriate triggers that would be linkedwith
satisfactory progress on the agreed recovery of JIRAMA and its future sustainable operation.


2. ProgramDevelopmentObjectives

2.1     The aim ofthe program is to restore an adequate public utility service for electricity and
water inurbanareas o f Madagascar and to create the foundation for a sustainable expansion o f a
commercially-oriented service inthe most cost-efficient way.

2.2     A successful outcome for the initialphase o fthe program wouldbe for a financially
solvent JIRAMA to be inthe hands o f private managers on a long-term basis. (See figure 2).
This outcome appears to offer the best prospects for efficiency and sustainability and is a
necessary precondition for addressing the huge unmet needs for electricity andwater outside the
mainurbancentres of Madagascar. It is also the considered andagreed choice o fthe Task Force
appointed to advise GOM on its options for the long-term future o f JIRAMA.

2.3      At the conclusion o fAPL-2, the expectationis that JIRAMA would havebecome an
efficient, profit-making and creditworthy enterprise, providing good-quality services, to an
expanded customer base, and be able to finance a reasonable portion of new sector investments.

3. Project Components

3.1      To address immediate technical shortcomings inthe utility, JIRAMA has identified a
short-term investment plan estimated to cost approximately US$100 million for electricity and
US$100 million for water, to lower the cost and improvethe performance o f its generation
plants, cut technical losses and improve commercialperformance. The Bank, incoordination
with other donors, would finance some o fthe most pressing and high-priority investments o fthis
recovery plan. This is the centerpiece of APL-1. Specifically, the program would assist with:

    (a) reduction ofgeneration costs: rehabilitation o f existing hydroelectric and thermal units,
    as well as conversion o f some diesel generators to heavy fuel oil;

    (b) reduction of technical losses in transmission and distribution: upgrading o fkey sections
    of MV lines, replacement o f overloaded transformers and undersized distribution lines and
    cables;

    (c) improvements to metering, billing and revenue collection: meter verification and
    replacement, high-value customer management, updatingof customer records, introduction
    o f prepayment meters and spot meteringtechniques inselected clusters;

    (d) modernization of JIRAMA's information systems and IT equipment: installation o f a
    company-wide computer network and associated hardware and software.

3.2      Only the most pressingneeds ofthe electricity sector would be covered by APL-1, which
is entirely focused on restoring JlRAMA to a minimum acceptable level o f operational and
financial performance, an essential precondition to attracting a private firm. The specific
investmentsto be financed have been selected on the basis o ftheir short payback periods and
highimpact onJIRAMA's earnings.

3.3      APL-1 would also support the long-term objectives o f improving the electricity and water
sectors' performance by assisting Madagascar inproviding funds: (a) for complementary actions
and communication activities needed to accompany the transaction advisor (IFC) inthe process
of selecting and contracting a new private operator to take over JTRAMA; (b) for prolongation of
the current management contract to avoid any hiatus before the takeover by the selected strategic
partner; (c) TA for preparation o f future generation projects incoordination with IFC's IPP
mandate; (d) TA to the Ministry o f Energy (MEM) to steer the above process to a successful
outcome and for capacity buildingwithin MEMincluding environmental and social safeguards
issues; and (e) the technical and safeguard studies required for APL-2 as well as the due
diligence requirements for private hydro generation investments.

US$30 million, covering investments ingeneration, transmission and distribution system
expansion, as well as capacity buildingand consulting services for implementation o f the
institutional reform of the sector. A significant part o f APL-2 funding could be allocated to a
credit enhancement facility (such as partial risk guarantee facility) to attract foreign investors.
The second phase would be conditioned on satisfactory progress towards financial recovery o f
JIRAMA and a signedPPP agreement for the long-term management o fthe utilityby a private
firm.

3.5             The content o f APL-2 has yet to be defined indetail, but components will be selected
from a well-defined Government investment program to be presented at the next donors' round
table, planned for September 2006. Additional funding i s expected to be secured from AfDB,
bilateral donors and the private sector.

3.6             Furtherdetails on APL-2 canbe found inthe table inAttachment 4.2 o fAnnex 4.


FinancingRequirementsand FinancingPlan

3.7             The GOM's energy/water sector recovery plan estimates a need for US$lOO milliono f
short-term investment financing for the years 2006-2009 for the Electricity and Water sectors
respectively. These estimates do not include the developments o f Hydro Generation facilities
that, although offered for private sector financing as PPs, are likely to require significant public
sector support.




                                                                                                         10

3.8     APL 1& APL-2 wouldtogether cover approximately 25% ofJIRAMA's priority
investments duringthe period 2006 - 2011. US$125 million o f donor support (including the
combined US$40 million from IDA) are already committed. Further financing for long-term
investments are expected to be pledged at a second donor's conference to be held inSeptember
2006.


4. LessonsLearnedand Reflectedinthe ProjectDesign

4.1     The recently-closed Energy Sector Development Project (ESDP, Cr. 2844), implemented
between 1996 - 2005, was over-ambitious, too complex andtoo broad inits scope. Within a
single project it simultaneously attempted to improve service to existing consumers, extend
access to electricity inrural and urban areas, undertake fundamental sector reforms to facilitate
private sector entry, promote energy efficiency and conservation and improve management o f
woodfuel supply and usage. The lesson learnt from ESDP and applied here is that the proposed
project i s much more narrowly focused and does not attempt to address broader issues inthe
energy sector.

4.2     ESDP didnot adequately address weak corporate governance inJIRAMA, including non-
transparent and non-competitive contracting, abuse of privileges by staff, lax management and
poor customer service. These problemshave now been sufficiently exposed to public scrutiny
and the transfer o f JlRAMA to a private operator will serve to keep a check on costs, improve
revenue collection and inculcate higher standards o f service. Transparency and accountability
are also expected to be enhanced.

4.3     The early years o f ESDP (pre-2003) were also characterizedby an excessively dogmatic
approach to institutional reformby the Bank, which led to stalemate. The proposed project has
avoided repeating this error by its consultative andparticipatory approach to reforms, as
illustratedby the importance attached to the role and recommendations o f the Task Force on
reforms. Muchmore attention has been given to keeping the labour unions fully abreast o f all
matters affecting JIRAMA staff, and regular press briefings have also been given to inform
public opinion.

4.4     The experience under ESDP also shows that there i s a need to be more vigilant with
respect to tariffs during inflationary times. The failure by GOM to address the erosion o f tariffs
caused by devaluation and risingworld oil prices, contributed to the financial insolvency o f
JIRAMA. The conditionality o f the proposed project reflects this lessonby front-loading actions
expected o f GoM.

4.5     Experience and the lessons learned from similar projects elsewhere shows that attracting
private operators to runAfrican utilities is fraughtwith difficulties. Recent cases also illustrate
that even ininstances where long-term contracts were entered into private firms are ready to
revoke them ifthe operating environment turns unfavourable. The proposed project will
therefore seek to minimize such risks by ensuring that the ground rules and contractual
 arrangements are drawn up as clearly as possible, byproviding GOMwith suitably experienced
international financial and legal advisers.

5. Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

5.1     A number o fstrong argumentsfavor an APLrather than a SIL. Inthe current context o f
a utility emerging from near-bankruptcy, ina period o f transition involving changes to its
corporate culture and business practices, some flexibility o f actions and their timing are felt to be
needed and these are more easily accommodated in an APL structure than ina SIL.

5.2     Itwouldhave beenpossible to continue with the existing JIRAMA management contract
on an open ended basis period, however this would have not incentivized the operator to improve
performance. It would also be expensive, and require donor or GOM financing, since
JIRAMA's own internal resources would be insufficient to cover its cost.

5.3     The option o f separating o f water from electricity activities was examined indetail by the
consultants hired to assist GOM indeciding on JIRAMA's long-tern structure. The consultant
recommended that a separation was inappropriate for a company o f relatively modest size.
Vertical and horizontal unbundlingo f JIRAMA's electricity operations was also studied by the
same consultants and advised against for the same reason.

5.4     The most extreme option could be called the `do-nothing' scenario, i.e. allow the current
management contract to lapse andthen leave J R A M A to struggle on as best as it could. This
would have been a recipe for rapid collapse, widespread damage to the modem export-oriented
sector o f the economy and a repeat o fthe expensive 2005 G O M bailout for the sector.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership Arrangements(ifapplicable)

1.1    All donors involved inthe sector are closely coordinating their interventions for
maximum effectiveness. This has been clearly expressed inthejoint aide memoire o f the
January 2006 Paris donors' round table. The aide mCmoire set forth a common set o f
conditionalities requested by the donors to commit financing to support GOM's recovery plan
for JIRAMA, as well as for the sector's medium-termexpansion requirements. (See figure 3).


                       Figure3: MediumTerm Power Generation& Investment Plan
                               .......................       .......................

                               .................             .....................     2I




1.2    The European Investment Bank (EIB) i s very active inwater supply and ..as alreac .y
approved a project o f 47 million inmid-2006. The Dutch government is contributing grant
funds towards the construction o f a 40 MW fuel-oil power plant (expected inservice inmid-
2007) that will help relieve the current supply shortages as well as substitute for higher-cost
diesel generation. Agence Franqaise de DCveloppement (AFD) has indicated that it will support
implementation of the JIRAMA recovery program with a contribution in2006 o f about US$lO -
12million. A third 30 MW generator at the existing Andekaleka hydro plant is about to begin,
with financing from the Banque Arabe pour le DCveloppementEconomique de 1'Afrique
(BADEA). The African Development Bank (AfDB) has indicated its potential sector financial
support in2008. Since the financing plan for APL-2 is still to be completed, the involvement o f
other donors will be needed and firm pledges obtained early enough to be included inthe
information and guidance to potential private partners for JIRAMA.

1.3     Within the WBG, there is close cooperation between IFC andthe Bank. IFChas already
beenhired by GOM to act as a transaction adviser for a series o f hydro generation projects that
are to be offered to private investors to develop as PPs. Inresponse to the difficult climate for


                                                          13

attracting FDIto the power sector inMadagascar, an IDA-supported PRGis also beingprepared
to complement IFC's efforts to attract potential investors andto attempt to lower the risk
premium (and hence the cost) ina bulk supply contract to JIRAMA.

1.4      Inaddition, IFCwill also bethe GOM's investmentadviser and leadthe process o fhiring
a private partner to manage JIRAMA. Inorder for IFC to successfully carry out its two
mandates it requires the close collaboration o fthe Bank and other donors to provide financing
for the preparatory work such as feasibility and environmental impact studies for the generation
IPPS.


2. Institutionaland ImplementationArrangements

2.1      The project would havetwo distinct implementation entities. One would be an integral
part o f JIRAMA's DEEL (Direction de 1'Equipement Electricitk), and would deal with hardware,
procurement and physical implementationby JIRAMA o f its rehabilitation sub-proj ects. The
other would be a small coordination and advisory group responsible for the policy and
institutional reform components as well as for monitoring and evaluation o f the project inits
entirety that would be attached to the office o f the Minister o f Energy and Mining.

2.2      The physical rehabilitation works do not present any significant technical difficulty for
JIRAMA, and the implementation cell would predominantly deal with procurement-related
matters. Adequate expertise for this exists within JIRAMA, backed up by local consultants on a
short-term basis as required.

2.3      MEM,however, has aserious problemoflack ofadequate capacityto leadthe process of
selecting a new private operator and carry through sector reforms. Despite GOM's decision to
recruit IFC as its investment adviser to manage the selection process from start to finish, the
MEMinterfacewithIFCwill needto be strengthened, andfor thispurposeit isenvisaged that
the project will finance the services o f a resident expatriate adviser inMEMfor about two years.
The adviser would also be responsible for managing the small coordination and advisory group
(Cellule de coordination-CELCO) attached to the office o f the MEM(see above).

2.4      MEMandthe DEEL(JIRAMA)will maintain separate accounts for alltransactions
related to each component for which they have overall implementation responsibility and will
produce their individual annual financial statements inaccordance with internationally accepted
accounting principles. The consolidation o fproject accounts ifnecessary, the production o f
quarterly Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs) incompliance with international accounting
standards and IDA requirements and the monitoring of the project progress will be assured by
MEM.

2.5      While the capacity of JIRAMADEEL is deemed adequate, the capacity o f
M E M K E L C O to deal with financial and accounting matters will need to be strengthened by: (i)
improvingthe fiduciary system inplace to ensure timely delivery o f data on project activities;
and(ii)  recruiting a qualified and experienced accountant to assist the MEMaccounting staff in




                                                   14

performing financial management tasks including budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, and
disbursement operations.


3. MonitoringandEvaluationof Outcomes/Results

3.1      The implementation o fthe project will be monitored through quarterly progress reports
that the Project coordinators (both at JIRAMA andMEM)will prepare and submit to IDA. This
will provide a way o ftracking actual project execution against implementationmilestones
established at the time o f the project launch. These are the keyperformance indicators and
project outcomes that are detailed inAnnex 3.

3.2      Further, inorder to assess impacts that the project i s expected to have on the quantity and
quality o f electricity andwater supplied, it is envisaged that several surveys will be carried out at
different points on JIRAMA's network. Monitoringo frevenue enhancement measures will be
facilitated by the ring-fencing of clusters where these are to be introduced. Baseline data will be
collected inthese clusters prior to introductiono f the new customer management techniques.

3.3      Other indicators of JIRAMA's overall performance, their baseline values and targets have
been agreed duringnegotiations. These indicators are given inAnnex 3.


4. Sustainability

Thefollowing topics are relevant to long-term sustainability:

4.1      Policyframework:     The 1999 sector legislation is basically sound but will probably need
to be revised to reflect Government's decision regarding JIRAMA's institutional reform. Some
topics also need to be defined  with greater clarity andprecisionandthese will be addressed
under IFC's mandate as transaction adviser, which includes the provision o f legal support. The
electricity sector regulator (ORE) i s operational and has established some initial credibility inthe
recent round o f tariff increases. The Letter o f Sector Development Policy (LSDP) clearly spells
out GOM's vision of the sector for the next 5 - 10 years andpresents a good basis for both
private and donor participation in sector development.

4.2      Technical: It is expected that the future private operator o f JIRAMA will ensure that
maintenance i s carried out according to good operational practice. The remuneration o f the
future operator will depend on maximizing revenue andplant availability, which inturncreates a
strong incentive for sound 0 & Mpractices. It i s also expected that JIRAMA under a private
management would better assist the government inmaking strategic future electricity generation
choices by providing a more reliable long-term planning and data on expected load growth.

4.3      Financial: The 1999 law makes a provision for indexation o f tariffs, but this was
ignored. No cast-iron assurance canbe obtained that history will not repeat itselfinfuture, but
the lessons appear to have been learnt from the economic damage to the country and the financial
cost to the budgetof bailing out J W A in2005. The GOM has agreed to introduce a Credit



                                                   15

covenant under the proposedproject that will permit JIRAMA to apply tariffs that ensure full
cost recovery (para. 6 - Credit conditions and covenants). Inaddition, the introduction of
private management inJIRAMA will provide the necessary stimulus to improve revenue
collection particularly from large industrial users, cut down on electricity and fuel theft and
inject greater all-round cost consciousness within JIRAMA.

4.4     Fiscal: The GOM's budgetary support to JIRAMA in2006 i s expected to exceed AR 70
billion (roughly US$30 million), inorder for it to continue operating and to help it meet payment
obligations, predominantly to fuel suppliers (over AR 180billion). Depending upon the
evolution of world oil prices, further budgetary support will be needed from G o M in2007,
although on a greatly reduced scale. The project seeks to ensure that from 2008, JIRAMA will
no longer need to rely on budgetary support for its operating expenditures. However, it must be
recognized that this turnaround i s vulnerable to further rises inworld oil prices andor unforeseen
major delays incommissioning o f the 40 MW fuel oil power plant inmid-2007. It i s thus
proposed as a trigger for the second phase o f the APL that JIRAMA should break even interms
of EBITDA (Earning Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) in2007. Such a
target might not seem very demanding for a power andwater utility with a majority o f its
generation derived from hydroelectric units. However, it would represent a major improvement
compared to the situation that prevailed in2004 and 2005. Also given, the projected efficiency
improvements that will begin to have a full year effect only in2008, andprovided an adequate
tariff indexing formula i s effectively applied, JIRAMA's profitability should significantly
improve in2008 and 2009. By the end o f the decade, JIRAMA should be expected to generate
enough cash-flow from internal sources to fund the investments required to adequately maintain
its assets. Inthese respects, the project will have a positive fiscal impact. Nevertheless, it has to
be recognizedthat public funds through internationalloans or grants will still be requiredto fund
the bulk of JIRAMA's long-term-investments required to increase significantly the rates o f
access to electricity and water inMadagascar, but these will not have any budgetary impact.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicand FinancialAnalyses

Economic Analysis

1.1    System expansionplan: The recent oil price hikes have turned JIRAMA's stop-gap and
suboptimal choice o f diesel generators into a severe financial burden for its consumers and also
for GOM. The success o fthe proposedrecovery program for JIRAMA is predicated upon a
rapid move away from diesel generation, initially to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and then inthe
medium- to long-term to hydroelectricity. Unfortunately, inthe short- to medium-term, despite
Madagascar's evident hydroelectric resource potential, the scope for rapidly developing new
hydro power sources i s rather limited. Work on the addition o f a third 30 MW generator at the
existing Andekaleka hydro plant i s about to begin, with financing from BADEA. Under normal
hydrological conditions it will produce 200 GWhper year, representinga massive cost saving to
JIRAMA.Two minor sites (Sahanivotry and Lily) are at a sufficiently advanced stage o f
preparation byprivate developers to contribute a further 80 GWho fhydro power by 2009 -
2010. Due to a lack o f preparatory studies, other small to mediumterm hydro prospects are
unlikely to be commissioned before 2010 - 2011.

1.2    Inthe near term, major fuel savings cantherefore onlybe achievedthrough substitution
of heavy fuel oil burningplants inplace o f diesel generators (financed under APL-1).
Implementation o f a 40 MW HFOplant (with financing from Dutch Government) to be sited in
the capital has begunand it i s expected to be inservice inmid-2007. This plant will permit
JIRAMA to greatly reduce its use o f diesel, since the plant is capable o fproducing 200-250
GWhannually. All of the above new generationprojects have beendelayedby several years and
should already have been inservice. They produce substantial economic benefits and delays in
completing them would be very costly to JIRAMA.

1.3      Economic Rate o f Return: Giventhe diverse nature o fthe physical investments
envisaged under the recovery program and its nature as a two-part APL, the economic analysis i s
based on a 5-year time-slice (2006-2010) o f the electricity sector's total investmentprogram,
which has beenreviewed and found to be least-cost innature. Details are contained inAnnex 9.
Assigning specific benefits to particular project components would have been botharbitrary and
nearly impossible. The base case estimate o f the EIRR is 14.4%.

1.4      The physical benefits from these investments that have been quantified here are twofold:
first, (and most important) the incremental electricity supplied to consumers; second, the
reduction inhigh-cost diesel fuel consumption arising from the replacement of diesel generators
bymore economical ones usingheavyfuel oil (HFO).

1.5      The incremental demand that can be met as a result o f investmentsmade possible by the
program is based on the variant o f the load forecast prepared by JIRAMA's consultants, HQI.
For the purposes of the economic analysis, only five years (2007 - 2011) o f cumulative load
growth have been considered as benefits directly attributable to the 2006 - 2010 investment
program. Total electricity demandis projected to increase at an annual average rate o f 7.6%.
However, demand growth in2006-2007 is severely constrained to only 2% - 4%, due to a
deliberate attempt by JIRAMA to restrain consumptionprior to the entry inservice o f a large,
new HFOplant.

1.6      The minimumvalue o f the incremental sales has been taken to be the average tariff
across all customer categories charged by JIRAMA in2006, i.e. UScl3/kWh. This does not
represent the full value o f benefits to users from this electricity, but inthe absence o f an estimate
of the `consumer surplus' it i s a minimummeasure o fbenefits that has been used as a proxy. It
i s well below the JIRAMA tariff charged to LV consumers inZone 3 (isolated centers served
entirely by diesel), o f USc19-20/kWh. Fuel savings to JIRAMA have been estimated at the
difference between the cost o f generation using HFO inthe new HFOpower plant and diesel fuel
that it would otherwise have to use inits existing generators, about USclO/kWh at current oil
prices.

1.7      Fulldetails of the analysis andthe parameters usedinestimatingthe ERR are given in
Annex 9. The EIRRi s particularly sensitive to variations inoil prices, the size and timingo f the
investment program, delays incompleting more efficient plants, and to assumptions about
demand growth. As can be seen inAnnex 9, depending on the combination of negative factors
assumed, the EIRRvaries from 10.3% to 13.7%.

Financial

Financial Analysis of JIRAMA

1.8      The following conclusions canbe drawn from the financial forecasts presented inAnnex 9:

         (a)    Inspite o fthe large funds injected inthe company bythe government anddonors,
         the ongoingconversion o f debt into company equity, and the successive tariff increases
         for electricity andwater, JIRAMA remains ina precarious financial situation.


                                                  21

        (b)      With most o fits debts cancelled or rescheduled, JIRAMAhas beengiven a fresh
        start financially; however its most immediate problem remains an insufficient generation
        of funds from internal sources: cash-flow from current operations i s likely to remain
        negative in2006 and 2007. This i s the result o f JIRAMA's unfavorable generation mix,
        with too muchdiesel fired capacity, andthe ever-rising world price o f oil.

        (c)      Electricity tariffs have been raised bynearly 100%over the past year, bringingthe
        expected average revenue this year to UScl3 per kilowatt-hour, a level that i s similar to
        its value in2002 and 2003. However, oil prices are much higher today than they were
        then, and the current level o f tariffremains below what would be adequate to achieve
        cost-recovery. Further hikes duringthe next 12 months are politically and socially
        difficult to envisage. As a result, JIRAMA cash position is bound to deteriorate again
        over the period to 2008, especially ifthe company reduces its payment arrears to its
        suppliers, as envisioned inthe January 2006 `plan de redressement'. Therefore, a new
        injection of liquidity from GOMwill probably be needed inmid-2007.

        (d)      The financial forecast presented inAnnex 9 assumes several internal efficiency
        improvements, but the biggest source o fpotential savings is the reduction o f generation
        costs, which will occur from mid-2007 onwards.

        (e)      Tariff discipline i s essential ifJIRAMA i s to become financially viable on a
        sustainable basis. An updated tariff indexation formula needs to be defined and
        scrupulously followed. A FA covenant that would impose the consistent application o f a
        tariff indexing procedure from April 2007 onwards is thus proposed. Inaddition to this
        procedural aspect, the level o f the tariff should be set adequately (it is thus proposedto
        retain it as a trigger for the second phase o f the APL that JIRAMA should break even in
        terms o f EBITDA in2007).



Situation of JIRAMA at the Beginning of the Management Contract
1.09    A diagnostic study o fJIRAMA's operations carried out in2003 revealed the severity of
the problems the company had to face. The management contract, which has beeninplace since
April 2005, shed further lighton the true extent o fJIRAMA's financial difficulties. Insummary,
the situation inmid-2005 can be described as follows:

1.10    Extreme financial unsustainabilitv o f current operations: duringthe first semester o f
2005, the variable costs associated with thermal generation alone (fuel expenses and energy
purchase costs) were superior to the total revenues of the company leaving no source o f funds to
pay for other current expenses (maintenance, personnel etc), let alone new investments or debt
repayment.

1.11 Rapidlyaccumulating arrears to suppliers: giventhe structural disconnect between
current expenses and revenues, JIRAMA could not continue to operate without increasing its
level o f debt and arrears to suppliers. This practice merely postponed the liquidity crisis facing
JIRAMAuntilafter the management contract took effect.




                                                     22

1.12     Lack o f effective and reliable financial reDorting and internal controls: Illustrations o f
these deficiencies are the absence o f reliable and audited annual accounts, the lack o f monitoring
o f the cashposition of the company, incomplete and late reporting o f financial information from
the many remote outlying JIRAMA centers. The management contractor is already addressing
most of these issues.


The Financial Recovety Process Supported by APL-1

1.13     Financial restructuring of JIRAMA: JIRAMA cannot realistically service the debt it has
accumulated. The financial restructuring entails substantial debt cancellation by the GOM, as
well as an injection o f cash. Overall, the plan entails significant budgetary costs inexcess o f AFt
75 billion for GOM in2006. It is likely that an additional injection o f liquidity inJIRAMA will
be necessary again inmid-2007, depending upon the trend o f world oil prices.

1.14     Tariff increases: While further increases o f tariffs inreal terms might be necessary inthe
future, ifoil prices do not decrease, the bulk o f the adjustment effort inthis respect has already
been done, especially taking into account expected reduction ingeneration costs thanks to
planned investments. It is, however, vital that the current level o f tariffs be at least preservedin
real terms. The definition o f an indexing formula for electricity andwater tariffs and a
streamlined decision-making process to apply the formula and implement the necessary tariff
adjustment will provide protection against the volatility o f the currency and o f oil prices.

1.15     Additional Supportfrom GOM: Under the assumption laid out inTable 9 o f Annex 9,
JIRAMA would start to generate a positive cash-flow in2008, due to a combination o f moderate
tariff increases, a bettergeneration mix, and improved operational performance. JIRAMA will
nevertheless remain ina difficult situation with insufficient liquidity up to the end of 2008
(current ratio below 1 and increase o f short-term financial debt) without fresh injections o f cash
from GOMin2007. Provision for continuing cash injections to JIRAMA needs to be made in
the GOMbudget for 2007.


2. Technical

2.1      The investments underthe APL-1 havebeen designed to meet Madagascar's near term
electricity sector objectives and to enable a swift financial turnaround o f JIRAMA, viz.:

     '
     .   Convert costly diesel generation to HFO, resulting insavings ofUSclOkWh on every
         unitofelectricity produced;
         Assure a minimumlevelo f maintenanceo f key power plants to maintain existing

     ''' capacity and reduce the numberof power cuts;
         Reduce technical and non-technical losses;
         Improve revenue management and collections; and
         Encourage development o f cost effective generation sources, e.g. small hydro plants.

2.2      The investments were chosen among a list o f candidates totaling about US$lOO million
identified by JIRAMA as necessary for the success o f its financial restructuringplanpresented to


                                                    23

the donors' round table meeting inJanuary 2006. The first phase o f the APL focuses on
immediate critical generation needs and investments with highreturns to urgently mitigate the
severe financial problems o f JIRAMA. For these investments the biddingdocuments are already
well advanced. For some, advance procurement is already ongoing and JIRAMA plans to
quicklyutilize the IDA fundingbymeans o fretroactivefinancing right after Credit effectiveness.


3. Fiduciary

Financial Management

3.1     The financial management systems both at the DEELinJIRAMA andMEMneed to be
strengthened to address some deficiencies and buildtheir capacity to produce quarterly Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs).The mainmeasures to be taken are the following:

        0  For MEM: (i)    recruitment, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, o f a
           qualified and experienced accountant to assist the MEMaccounting staff inplace in
           performing FMtasks; (ii)   elaboration of a chart o f accounts to ensure the availability
           o f all relevant information for financial reporting; (iii)
                                                                    elaboration and
           implementation o fwritten operating instructions to ensure proper record keeping and
           adequate safeguarding o f assets; (iv) design and implementation of an accounting
           system to ensure timely production o f financial information required for managing
           andmonitoring activities to beimplementedbythe MEM.

        0. For DEEL: (i) of the DEELchart o f accounts to reflect components and
                            review
           activities outlined inthe PAD to satisfy reporting requirements; (ii) update of the
           current accountingmanuals o fprocedures inorder to include all necessary changes
           requiredbythis new project, facilitate adequate recordkeeping and the maintenance
           of proper control over assets; (iii)review and adjustment o f the accounting software
           acquired within the context of the Energy Sector Development Project inorder to
            satisfy DEELrequirements and ensure timely production of financial statements and
           FMRsrequiredby IDA. All these recommendationsshould be implemented prior to
            credit effectiveness. The content and formats o f financial statements and FMRs have
           been determined during appraisal mission and agreed at negotiations.


3.2     Theproject financial statements (CELCO andDEEL) will be audited annually by
independent and qualified auditors acceptable to IDA in accordance with International Standards
of Auditing. The auditors shouldbe recruitedprior to credit effectiveness. The audit report will
be submittedto IDAnot later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year.


Procurement

3.3     A new Malagasyprocurement code was enacted inJuly 2004 but, since then, the texts for
their application have recently been approved but it will take some time before entering in
effectiveness and thus the existing Procurement Code o f 1998 will continue to be used at least
untilearly 2007. The Bank has ascertained that deficiencies identified inthe 1995CPAR have



                                                 24

beenproperly addressed. IDA standard biddingdocuments (SBDs) are widely used in
Madagascar. However, an area o f concern i s the cumbersome and overly bureaucratic approval
process for contract signingby GOM, which causes unnecessary delays. Inaddition, insufficient
programming and procurement planning contribute to delays inproject implementation which
result inslow disbursement. To mitigate risks o f delays for the proposed project, proper
prerequisites for the use of Bank SBDs, includingevaluationreports for National Competitive
Biddingprocedures (NCB) havebeenagreed uponwith Government duringnegotiations. The
procedures manual will be updated as a part of the Project ImplementationPlan.

3.4     A Procurement Capacity Assessment o fJIRAMA was not conducted duringappraisal
because it was agreed with JIRAMA's management that the same team will be maintained in
place as the one which dealt with the recently-closedESDP. Onthe basis o f the experience
acquired by the JIRAMA procurement team, an action plan was drafted to address areas where
capacity needs to be strengthened. The action planincludes (i)    a specific section on procurement
inthe ProjectImplementationManualto befinalizedor updatedbefore Credit effectiveness;
(ii)improvement o f record keeping o fprocurement-related documents; and (iii)     refresher
procurement training sessions for project staff.

3.5     A separate ProcurementCapacity Assessment was conducted for the MEMprocurement
Unitduringappraisal. The assessmentreviewedthe organizationalstructure for theunit. The
key issues and risks concerning procurement by MEMhave been identified. Corrective
measures which have been agreed are: (i)    recruitment, under terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA, o fa qualified and experienced procurement expert; and (ii) close follow-up o fthe
                                                                    the
agreedprocurement plan and activity scheduling. A procurement action plan will be fine-tuned
quarterly and the main procurement planwill be updated accordingly.


4. Environmental and Social

4.1     APL-1will finance generationrehabilitation, disti-ibution reinforcement and
rehabilitation o f the existing transmission lines and substations invarious towns inMadagascar.
The investments are entirely aimed at upgrading existinginstallations. N o new greenfield sites
will be developed or human resettlement undertaken.

4.2     JIRAMA has undertaken an Environmental and Social Impact Management Framework
for phase 1o f the proposed APL. Phase 2 o f the APL will be the subject of a complete study
(ESIA) duringthe executiono fphase 1. The JIRAMA subprojects envisagedinAPL Phase 1
comprise 3 distinct groups:

        - Group 1: Rehabilitation o f thermal power stations.
        -- Group 2: Rehabilitation o f hydroelectric power stations.
           Group 3: Rehabilitation o f transmission and distribution networks.

4.3     The rehabilitation o f thermal power stations inAmbohimanambola, Mahajanga,
Toamasina, Toliary, Antsiranana includes the rehabilitation o f the existing Power Plants. The
environmental examination o f the projects related to the rehabilitation o f the power stations



                                                  25

showed that the environmental impacts are generally neutral. However, the impacts of the
investments alone cannot be considered independently from the totality o f the installations and
the current environmental situation inthe site inwhich they are located. The main impacts are
noise, the atmospheric emissions, pollution o f ground and water due to non efficient
management o f effluents, and poor risk management including absence o f an emergency plan.
The mainmitigationmeasures to address these issues along with the action plans are available in
the Environmental and Social impact ManagementFramework for phase 1.

4.4      The rehabilitation o f the hydroelectric power stations o f Antelomita 1, Ankazobe,
Tsiazompaniry, Vatomandry, Andekaleka and Volobe, consist o f replacement o f used turbine
and alternator parts, turbine cooling equipment, general revision o fplant, and rehabilitation of
the civil engineering works. The investments will not alter the current design o f the dam,
existing water levels nor surpass the original capacity o f the turbines. The main environmental
impact identified concern the safety o f the sites (e.g. the transformer Switchyards are not locked
and the fire fighting equipment is outdated) andthe silting up o f the reservoirs because o f the soil
erosion on the basin slopes. The review o f the environmental impact o f these subprojects
concluded that they are non significant and reversible, with the exception o f the environmental
impacts o f the civil engineering works planned for the hydroelectric station inVatomandry (192
KW). For this plant, JIRAMA must meet the requirements o f the Bank safeguard policy OP 4.37
on dam safety. This rehabilitation will not be implemented until a review o f the dam's safety,
carried out by an independent expert, has beenjudged satisfactory by IDA.

4.5       The transmission and distribution rehabilitation subprojects present very minor
environmental issues. Specific attention i s given to the rehabilitation o f transformers inwhich
the PCB (Polychlorinated Biphenyl) represents an environmental risk. JIRAMA has agreed to
comply with the actionplan for the elimination o f Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP),
elaborated incollaboration with the Malagasy Environmental Administration, the coordination
committee o f POP and supported byUNEP. JIRAMA will therefore ensure safe storage of the
old transformers inaccordance with the recommendations o f the action plan.

        M A D A G A S C A R : Power/Water Sectors.Recovery and Restructuring Project

Energy resources

1.      Despite a substantial hydroelectric potential inexcess o f 7,000 MW, Madagascar has so
far only developed under 100 MW o f generating capacity usingthis resource. Access to
electricity is extremely low (less than 5% inrural areas) and the vast majority o f the population
relies on petroleum products and wood fuel for cooking and lighting. Little has been done so far
to develop alternative energy sources likebagasse, solar or wind power.


Electricity consumption

2.      One o fthe notable features o fMadagascar's electricity supply system is its fragmentation
and the absence of a national high-voltage transmission grid. Because of the low levels of
demand, andthe large distances separating load centres; local supply systems still represent the
least-cost solution for supply inthe majority o f cases. There are only three urbaninterconnected
networks inMadagascar, serving Antananarivo-Antsirabe, (representing 70% o f national
electricity sales), Toamasina andFianarantsoa, which together account for 80% of total sales.
For the remainder o fthe countryJIRAMA has 112 separate supply systems serving other small
urban areas, not all o f which provide 24-hour service. Electricity productionby JIRAMA2was
988 GWhin2005, with total sales o f 754 GWh. JIRAMA's electricity losses were about 24% in
2005, o f which half are estimated to be technical.


Existing generation facilities

3.      Electricity production inMadagascar i s based on a mix o f hydro and thermal plants for
base load. Currently production capacity i s 292 MW with 105 MW (or 36%) o f hydro capacity
and 187 MW o f thermal capacity, which are capable o fproducing about 1,000 GWhper year. A
further 40 MWbelongs to private auto producers. The largest hydro plant, Andekaleka (2 X 29
MW) was built with IDA assistance in 1982. Dueto recent modifications o fthe operating
regime that was formerly extremely conservative, the plant is now capable o f delivering 10%
additionalpower - i.e. 64 MW.

4.      Ingeneral terms, Madagascar's generation facilities are very old. As a consequence, a
large number o f the existing thermal units needto be retired before year 2010. While the hydro
production facilities are inrelatively good shape, mainly due to donor support, some o f the
power plants also need substantial maintenance o f their turbines inorder to continue to function
at nameplate capacity.




  Including purchases o f 24 GWhfrom private producers.


                                                     28

5.      The state of the thermal plants i s generally poor due to lack ofpreventive maintenance,
spare parts and fimding for new generators, especially inthe areas served exclusively by thermal
diesel plants. JIRAMA's recent financial crisis has accelerated the problem to a point where if
considerable investment resources are not provided, regions could be completely deprived of
supply for sustained periods of time. Poorly managed andmaintainedthermal power plantshave
further ledto an increase indiesel consumption that on average i s 20% above benchmark values.


Evolution of Demand

6.      L o w voltage users accounted for 63% o f JIRAMA's electricity sales o f 754 GWhin2005.
As shown inFigure 1, demand growth duringthe period 1995-2005 was 7% annually, markedly
faster than the previous decade, when it barely averaged 3% p.a. The last three years since the
end of the political crisis in2002 exhibited unprecedented double-digit growth o f 12%, albeit
after a 9% decline indemand in2002. The strong demand growth can be attributed inpart to the
sharp decline inthe real cost of electricity to consumers, resulting from a four-year tariff freeze
(2001-2005) at a time of highinflation and depreciating exchange rate. Peak demand inthe
Antananarivo network was 148 MW in2005, which does not reflect the true level of demand due
to load shedding arising from a shortage o f generating capacity.

7.      The number of consumers increased from about 190,000 in 1994 to 402,000 in2005, an
average annual growth rate o f 7%. The distribution o f consumers i s highly concentrated: Only
30 JIRAMAsupply centres have over 1,000 clients, while there are under 10 sites with 5,000 or
more consumers.

Tariff policy

8.       Madagascar i s unusual in not having a pan-territorial pricing policy for electricity. To
reflect differences incosts (particularly fuel), and infactors such as load density and load factor,
JIRAMAhas classified its networksinthree "tariff zones", with prices being lowest for zone 1
and highest for zone 3. Zone 1comprises three o f the larger systems, where generation comes
mainly from hydropower. Zone 2, including Mahajanga and Toliary, corresponds to larger
thermal systems that use mainly heavy fuel oil. Zone 3 covers the rest of the systems, which
generate power from plants usingonly diesel. The general low voltage residential tariff inzone
3 is presently 2.4 times than the one paid by consumers inzone 1. For high and medium-voltage
consumers, rates are differentiated by time o f day (peak, day, and night). The peak price inzone
1is over five times the night rate, inan attempt to flatten JIRAMA's evening peak.

9.       In1992, GOMpassedan importantdecree (No.7800-92) which introducedthe principle
of automatic tariff adjustments, based on an indexation o f tariffs to the exchange rate, the price
o f oil, and the local consumer price index. However inpractice this indexationpolicy has never
been systematically applied. The current JIRAMA tariff schedule i s presented at the end o f
Annex 9.

Future demand for electricity

10.      Demandfor electricity is projectedto increase at anaverage o f 6.5% to 7.5% annually,
according to the load forecast undertaken as part o f the Least Cost Generation Master plan
preparedin2005-2006 by Hydro Quebec International. The study forecasted electricity demand
up to 2030. The increase isprimarily fuelledby an increase inthe number o f consumers and
could be further accelerated if GDP per capita growth figures increase more than projected. As
seen inthe chart below, the difference inthe forecasts between the highand low case scenarios is
highlydependent on the construction o f a small number o f large industrial/mining projects.

11.      Inthe short- to medium-term, however, itis expected that demand growth willbemuch
lower (2% - 4%) over the period 2006-2007, due to supply constraints, but once these are
eliminated, there will be a rapid `catch up' period (2008-2009) when demand is expected to
increase by 8% - 10%p.a.

12.      The Madagascar grid i s highly dispersedacross the country, with a large number o f small
unconnectedgrid systems. Peak energy demand projections for investment purposes are
therefore unsuitable on an aggregate basis for the country as a whole, since the type o f load and
amount o f commercial use vary greatly between the regions and the various grids. It i s o f greater
relevance to study the main growth centres such as the Antananarivo network, that represents
70% o f the electricity consumption and half o f the total medium and highvoltage loads inthe
country. Peak demand here has been projected to rise from 147 MW to 594 MW, or over 300%
inthe 25 years between 2005 and 2030.

13.      This massive increase opens up the possibility o f interconnectionsbetweenthe three main
load centres o f Antananarivo, Toamasina and Fianarantsoa, to make better use of untappedhydro
resources and achieve economies of scale ingeneration expansion that would otherwise be
difficult to justify ifintended solely for one o f these grids taken alone. The interconnections are
expected to cost U S 7 5 million for the Antananarivo - Fianarantsoa interconnectionand US$47
million for the Antananarivo - Toamasina transmission line3and will enable JIRAMA to save
about US$400 millionon fuel duringthe 2006-2029 period compared to the scenario o f having
three independent, unconnected systems. These transmission links will also enable JIRAMA to
connect the future hydro generation sites o fVolobe and Antetezambato with the main grid.

14.     The Supply/Demand Balance for the Antananarivo networ--(R Tana) over the next 5
years is largely dependent on an ambitious investment program and JIRAMA's ability to keep
the old plants going long enough prior to the entry inservice o f new plants. (see Figure 3).

 15.    As shown inTable 1, peak supplyis barely keepingupwith demand duringthe wet
season. Load sheddingo f 10% o f the supply duringthe dry season occurs at present, since hydro
output is reduced. Several ofthe old thermalplants are inapoor state or at the endoftheir
estimated lifetime, causingbreakdowns and further interruptions insupply. This precarious
situation is likely to persist untilthe commissioning of the first batch o f generation investments
inmid/late 2007.

16.      Inorder to meet the increasingdemandandputanendto the current supplyshortages,
the government has identifiedthe most urgent generation investments for the medium-term.
These are geared towards increasing supply and loweringthe cost o fproduction o f existing
plants, while investmentswill bemade innew HFOplants with quick returns on investment
largely replacing more expensive diesel alternatives. These investments can be clustered as
follows:


     0   Rehabilitationand conversion

         Rehabilitation and conversion of the thermal power plants inAmbohimanambola,
         Antsirabe, Antsiranana, Mahajanga, Toliara. The investments o f about USSl.7 million
         would save around US$lmillion per year infuel costswhile improving reliability and
         increasing production by 27 GWh.

     e   New Production

             o A new 40 M W HFOthermal power plant for the Antananarivo grid. This will be
                able to produce 200-250 GWh annually at base load.
             o The addition ofathirdturbine inAizdekaleka hydro plant to increaseproduction
                capacity by 30 MW and 200 GWWyear under normalhydrological conditions.
             o Construction ofsmall sizedhydro plants as IPPs, notablySahanivotry and Lily
                adding 12+4 M W of base load capacity and total average energyo f 80 GWh.
             o Leasingor IPPsfor anumberof smaller power plants for the regional centers of
                Antsiranana,Mahajanga, Toliary.

Introduction

1.      The proposed lending instrument for this operation is a two-phase, five year
Adaptable ProgramLending(APL). The APL programi s conceived as a 6 year effort
(mid-CY2006/mid-CY 2012) to be implementedintwo phases. Only Phase 1o fthe
proposed APL (mid-CY 2006 to mid-CY 2008) i s presented indetailed inthis annex with
a detailed cost table presented inAttachment 1. A preliminary description of APL-2 is
presented inAttachment 2 o f the present annex. IDA'Scontribution to the first phase
(APL-1)is expected to beU S 1 0million and for the secondphase (APL-2) is expected
to be about US$30 million and should provide resources to implement critical
investments and guarantees for investmentsto be made by the private sector.

2.      Through a programmatic approach, the proposedproject aims at supporting the
most pressing needs o fthe electricity sector. Hence APL-1 i s entirely focused on
restoring JIRAMA to a minimumacceptable level o f operational and financial
performance. This restoration i s an essential precondition to attracting a private firm to
operate JIRAMA under an `affermage' contract. APL-1would inter alia, provide funds
for TA to GOM to facilitate close cooperation with the IFC transaction advisor's team in
the process of selecting and contracting a newprivate operator to take over JIRAMA at
the end o f the current management contract, as well as for prolongation o f the current
management contract to avoid any hiatus before the takeover by the selected strategic
partner. APL-1will also provide funds for some preparatory studies needed to buildup a
pipeline o f APL-2 investments and Guarantees.

3.      APL-1comprises two components:

        ComponentA: Investments for: (Ala) Power generation reinforcement
        (rehabilitation); (Alb) retroactive financing; (A2) Reduction of transmission and
        distribution technical losses; and (A3) Revenue management and Modernization
        of Information Systems and IT equipment.

        ComponentB: Fundingand technical assistance for: (Bl) close cooperation with
        the IFC transaction advisor's team inthe process o f selecting and contracting a
        new private operator and communication; (B2) prolongation o f the current
        management contract; (B3) preparationof future generation projects in
        coordination with IFC's (second) IPP mandate; (B4) strengthening o f the Ministry
        of Energyand Mining; (B5) feasibility and environmental studies for APL-2
        investments; (B6) monitoringand evaluation; and (B7) project implementation.




                                              43

ComponentA: Short-terminvestments(including;continpencies:IDA: US$7.0
million)

4.      To address the immediate technical shortcomings o fthe utility, JIRAMA has
drawn up a medium-term (2006 - 2010) investment plan estimated to cost US$200
million (for both electricity andwater), to improve the performance o f costly andpoorly
performing generation plants, reduce hightechnical losses and introduce improvements
inrevenue management. TheBank, incoordination withother donors, would finance
some of the highestpriority and most urgent investments of this plan. This is the
centerpieceof APL-1. This component will be executed byJIRAMA. Bidpackages for
these projects are under preparation.

SubcomponentAla: Power generation reinforcement (rehabilitation)
(IDA: US$2million)

5.      This subcomponent supports the project objective o frestoring and improving
electricity supply and contributing to JIRAMA's financial recovery. It includes
rehabilitation of existing hydroelectric and thermal units, and conversion o f generation
units from diesel to heavy fuel oil (HFO).

    (a) Replacement o f hydro-refrigerants system for the ANDEKALEKA hydropower
        plant (2 x 32 MW): The project proposes to finance the replacement (6) and
        rehabilitation (7) of those hydro-refrigerants.

    (b) Rehabilitationo funitNo3 o fthe ANTELOMITA 1hydropower plant (0.8 MW):
        The current state o f Antelomita 1does not allow using its energy to full capacity.
        The project proposes to finance the acquisition o f components to rehabilitate the
        plant. The project will also finance some training insystem control and
        protection.

    (c) Renovation works inthe VOLOBE hydropower plant (6.7 MW) The present
        condition o f Volobe does not allow its energy potential to be fully used. The
        project proposes to finance acquisition o f components to rehabilitate and restore
        the plant. Generalrehabilitation o f some equipment (turbine wheels, alternators,
        etc.) o fthe plant will also be done under the proposedproject.

    (d) Rehabilitation of small hydropower plants o fANKAZOBE, TSIAZOMPANIRY,
        AMBODIRIANA and VATOMANDRY: The project proposes to finance the
        rehabilitation o f these small hydropower plants to reduce JIRAMA's dependence
        on thermal generation inits isolated system.

    (e) Rehabilitation o f mechanical auxiliaries o f the AMBOHIMANAMBOLA thermal
        power plant (3 x 6 MW): Most o f the mechanical auxiliaries are inpoor
        condition. The plant cannot be runon a permanent basis with HFO. A first
        tranche of rehabilitation is already ongoing, and this will be completed under the
        project by replacement o f some mechanical auxiliaries such as boilers, re-heaters
        and exchangers.


                                              44

    (0 Rehabilitation of thermalplantsinMAHAJANGA(Unit 1303), TOAMASINA
        (2 x 8 MW) and TOLIARY (Unit 1305) are expected to be financed by the
        Agence Franqaise de Dkveloppement (AFD).



SubcomponentA1b: Retroactivefinancing (IDA: US$l rnillion)

6.      Some of the urgent works needed to rehabilitate JIRAMA's thermal plants were
to have been financed under the previous IDA Credit for ESDP that closed inDecember
2005. As these could not be finished prior to the closing date, JIRAMA has had to
finance them from its own resources. Some o f these expenditures meet the requirements
o f OP 12.10 on Retroactive Financing; inparticular because (i) they represent less than
10% o f the Credit amount; (ii)they have beenpaid for within 12 months o f Credit
signing; and (iii) followed Bank's procurement processes. An amount o fup to
                 they
US$1 million would be eligible for retroactive financing under the proposedproject. The
concerned contracts for the following works will be reviewedfor eligibility:

    (a) Rehabilitation of the Ambohimanambola thermal power plant (3 x 6 MW)
        (tranche 1): Contract C1190/ 911823/T0501A with SEMT PIELSTICK.

    (b) Rehabilitationof the Antsirabe thermalpower plant: Contract
        C1200/91824/T0502A with SEMT PIELSTICK.

    (c) Rehabilitation o fthe Mahaianga thermal power plant: Contract
        C1210/91825/T0503A with MANB & W Diesel.

    (d) Rehabilitation of theAmbohimanambola thermal power plant (3 x 6 MW)
        (tranche 2): Contract C1220/91826/T0504A with POLYRESINE.

    (e) Rehabilitation of the Ambohimanambola thermal power plant (3 x 6 MW)
        (tranche 3): Contrat C1240/91828/T0506A with SEMT PIELSTICK.

Subcomponent A2: Reduction of traizsmission and distribution technical losses
(IDA: US$I.3million)

7.            Reduction o f losses: rehabilitation o f transmission networks (APL-1:US$0.3
million): Reliability o f the transmission system is poor arising from a combination o f
factors like old equipment, lack o f protection and control equipment and inaccurate
metering. Highvoltage networks inMadagascar need to be strengthened and
rehabilitated; this upgrade will result inincreased power reliability with a reduction o f
significant outages inthe network to be rehabilitated. The project proposes to finance the
rehabilitation o fthe AmbohimanambolaNandraka transmission line, which serves
Antananarivo.

8.            Reduction o f losses: rehabilitation o f distribution (APL-1:US$lmillion): Many
of JIRAMA's distribution transformers and lines are already saturated, which leads to
voltage drops, hightechnical losses, low reliability and load shedding. The project would
finance the acquisition o f distribution materials and equipment to rehabilitate and
reinforce networks inthe RITANA (peak demand o f 136 MWl698 GWhin2004) and in
some other centers such as MORONDAVA (1.375 kWl5 MWh), MANAKARA (890
kWl3 MWh), ANTSIRANANA (7.083 kWl32 MWh),S A M B A V A (1.680 kWl7 MWh),
ANTALAHA (1.3 15 kWl5 MWh), AMBANJA (735 kWl3 MWh)andTOAMASINA
(13.250 kWl59 MWh). Specific subprojects are being finalized and would be financed in
part by APL-1 and by AFD.

                                       -
and acquisition of IT equipment (IDA - US$2.3million)

9.            Revenue management (APL-1:US$1.35 million and JIRAMA: US$0.385
million): While the overall revenue collection performance o f JIRAMA is reasonable,
there is still considerable scope for improvement, particularly as regards industrial
clients. The Project will support targeted investments that aim at improving the
commercial side o f the distribution business as measuredby enhanced billingand
increased revenues. The mainrationale o f these investments is to create value inthe
Madagascar electricity business and demonstrate the returns on such investments so that
they canbe replicatedon a larger scale.

10.            Giventhe large investment requirements compared to the available IDA
financing,           the desired developmental impact would not be achieved ifinvestments are
thinly spread and ifthey are not directed to achieve specific outcomes inidentified areas.
Inorder to addressthis concern, itis proposedto adopt a"cluster" approach in
implementation o f the Project. Investments would be implemented inthese clusters to
create "islands o f excellence" to be replicated inthe Second Phase o f the APL or by the
JIRAMA operational budget. The results would thus be improved revenues, reduced
losses and reduced billing complaints. The choice o f clusters will be made inclose
cooperation with JIRAMA following specific criteria.

11.           The rationale behind such an approach is: (a) spreading activities thinly across
JIRAMAmaynot demonstrate clear impact; (b) it is easy andpracticalto establish a
baseline for key performance indicators at a cluster level, or for a specific type o f
customer; and (iii)                   measurement o f impacts will be facilitated.

12.           A set o factivities is proposedto be financed under APL-1, some ofwhich will be
comprehensive, as for industrial customers, while others will be more on a trial basis that
may be extended under APL-2, if good results are obtained.

     (a) OrganizatiodManagement: The revision andimplementationo f a standard
              flowchart for commercial teams will be carried out during the Management
              Contract, inorder to revise andimprove commercial procedures andto improve
              the circulation o f information. Tasks and responsibilities will bebetter assigned

                                                                47

    andjob descriptions made more appropriate. This action does not require any
    financing, but i s part o f the accompanying actions inthe JIRAMA recovery
   program.

(b) Improvement o finvoicing: Increasingthe ratio o fmeter readerdcustomers ando f
   the number and qualification of supervisors will reinforce internal controls and
   will improve billing. This action does not require any financing through APL-1.

(c) Fight against fraud  -  adiustment o f the penalties: Another aspect of the reduction
    o f costs and the improvement o f efficiency i s the revision and the upward
    adjustment o f the penalties applied to fraudulent customers. This action does not
   require specific financing.

(d) Meter and residentialcustomer records verification program: This program
    covers the following activities: (i) carrying out, in conjunction with local
    authorities, a technical and administrative check o f the meterdcustomers, by
    neighborhood (cluster level); (ii)  identifyingand dealing with frauds and
    abnormalities and updatingthe meter/customer databases, both for electricity and
    water; (iii) creating and training anti-fraud units; (iv) carrying out technical and
    commercial adjustments such as replacement/normalization o f connections and
    meters; and (v) acquiring metering tools, IT equipment and GPS. The project
    proposes to finance an exhaustive verification program inpre-identified zones
    (clusters). IDA financing will be intended for the purchase o f metering tools and
    implementation o f the program.

(e) Purchase and installation o fprepayment meters: Inorder to address problems o f
    payment recovery insome o f the more difficult service areas, Prepaid Systems
    (prepayment meters) ina predefined cluster area will be implemented. This trial
    at the level o f an entire zone will be spread to administrative customers and to
    some specific customers with highconsumption. The project proposes to finance
    the purchase and installation o f these prepayment meters.

(f) InvestmentsinSpot MeteringEquipment and Systems: Better cash flow
    management and revenue control by introduction o f spot billing which involves
    hand-held terminals, printers, modems and associated accessories. Inthis method,
    bills are printed and delivered on the spot at the customers' premises whentheir
    meters are read, and the utility's customer database i s updated electronically.
    Customers have the additional advantage o f staggered payment due dates, thus
    reducing crowding at cash collection centers on or near the due date. Apart from
    improving customer service, this intervention also compresses the cash flow
    cycle, and introduces electronic data recording, facilitating diligence on this
    critical revenue generating part o f the business. It is proposed that 100Meter
    readers ina defined distribution cluster o f Antananarivo would be equipped with
    spot billing equipment.

    The project will also finance consultant support for training and capacity building
    of JIRAMAstaff inthe application o f spot metering and pre-payment metering
    techniques inthe selected clusters. The component will include on-the-job


                                            48

      training inuse o f spot billing equipment by meter readers so as to fully benefit
      from the new technology as well as training in software applications to use the
      customer data made available. The project will further assist inestablishing a
      suitable framework for pre-payment metering o f residential consumers.such as
      arrangements for card sales licensing, meter verification procedures, suitable
      client interface etc.

   (g) Systematic verification o f installations inPremises o f all 800 industrial customers:
      About 800 industrial subscribers represent more than 30% o f total electricity
      consumption; because o f lack o f resources, industrial installations are verified and
      checkedby specialized JIRAMA staff only every 5 years. The systematic
      verification o f these HV/MV installations is an absolute priority. The results of
      these verifications and the necessary corrective actions need to be implemented
      without delay, giventhe potential loss o f revenue to JIRAMA. The project
      proposes to contribute to the financing of the corrective actions.

   (h) Purchase andinstallationofelectronic meters for all 800industrial customers: In
       order to improve demand management, to have a better knowledge of HV and
       MV customers and for a better understandingand monitoring o ftheir
       consumption (daily load), it i s essential to replace the traditional mechanical and
       electro-mechanicalmeters by electronic meters. This action was started under the
       previous IDACredit and will be completedwith JIRAMA financing.

13.    Modernization o f information systems and acquisition o f IT equipment: (APL-1-
US$0.95 million)

   (a) Interconnexion of all JIRAMA premises: The objective o f this action is: (i)    to
       open up the Inter-Regional's Services; (ii)   to reduce time for data processing
       transfers, to accelerate the exchange o f local information; (iii) to reduce the
       various expenses (transport, computer supplies) linked to present non-networked
       exchanges o f information; (iv) to improve customer satisfaction (internal and
       external) by the reduction o f response times; (v) to facilitate monitoringo f
       connections reliability; and (vi) reduce telephone costs within JIRAMA. The
       project proposes to finance the introduction of an internal IT ((backbone)) for all
       JIRAMA's site. The progressive installationo f adequate communication support

23.       The second phase o f the APL would be conditioned on satisfactory progress towards
financial recovery of JIRAMA and a signed"affermage" contract for the long-term management
o f the utility by a private firm.
24.       APL-2 would seek to lay the foundation for a sustainable expansion of a commercially-
oriented utility inthe most cost-efficient way by investing in strategically important areas such
as: (i) HV interconnectionso fthemainload-centres; (ii)                  preparation o f the next large scale hydro
facility; and (iii)       investments and TA necessary to make JIRAMA raise its performance to
developing world utility best practice.
25.       APL-2 funding (mid-2008 - mid-2012) from IDA would tentatively be about US$30
million. A significant part ofAPL-2 fundingwill be allocated to apartial risk guarantee facility
to attract private investors for large scale PPP hydro operation. Additional funding i s expected to
be secured from AfDB, bilateral donors and the private sector.
26.       Further definition o f the investment component will be funded by the TA component o f
APL-1. The table below proposes indicative areas o f investments to be included inAPL-2.

        MADAGASCAR: Power/WaterSectors RecoveryandRestructuringProject




1.      The proposed Power/Water Sectors Recovery and Restructuring Project would have two
distinct implementation entities. One would be an integralpart o fJIRAMA's DEEL (Direction
de 1'Equipement Electricitk), and would be responsible for implementation o f Component A,
Equipmentand services related to JIRAMA. The other would be a small coordination and
advisory group (Cellule de coordination-CELCO) responsible for the policy and institutional
reform components, Component B, as well as for monitoring and evaluation o f the project inits
entirety. CELCO would be attached to the office o f the Minister o f Energy and Mining.

Implementingagencies

2.      JIRAMA's DEEL: DEEL(Direction de 1'Equipement Electricitk) is a department within
JlRAMA incharge o fproject Management activities for JIRAMA electricity sector investments.
DEELwas within JIRAMA, incharge o fthe implementation o frelatedcomponents o fthe
former energy project PDSE. Financial management andprocurement procedures and staffing
expertise were found to be adequate.

3.      MEM's CELCO: MEM's own assessmenthas demonstrated that there is a lack o f
adequate capacity within the ministryand that therefore a small coordination and advisory group
(Cellule de coordination-CELCO) attached to the ministrywould be responsible to implement
Component B o f the project. The CELCO i s composed o f (i)    a resident expatriate advisor who
will manage the unit; (ii)qualified and experienced accountant to assist MEMaccounting staff
                           a
inperforming financial management tasks including budgeting, accounting, financial reporting,
and disbursement operation; and (iii)  a qualified and experienced procurement officer familiar
with World Bank procurementprocedures to assist MEMinall procurement activities.
Incremental costs of the unit will be supported by the project.


ProjectReporting,Monitoringand Evaluation

Project implementation manual
4.      BothDEELand CELCO will prepare a Project ImplementationManual. The PlMswill
set forth all operational andprocedural steps regarding activities evaluation, reviews and
approval, flow o f information, procurement and financial management arrangements.

Financial management
5.      CELCO (MEM) and DEEL (JIRAMA) will maintain separate accounts for all
transactions related to each component for which they have overall implementation
responsibility and will produce their individual annual financial statements inaccordance with
internationally accepted accounting principles. The consolidation o fproject accounts if
necessary, the production of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) incompliance with
international accounting standards and IDA requirements andthe monitoring o f the project

                                                 57

progress will be assured by CELCO (MEM). They will also need to upgrade the fiduciary
systems already inplace to ensure timely delivery o f data on project activities.

Audits
6.      CELCO andJIRAMA financial statements will be audited annually by an international
private accounting firm acceptable to IDA inaccordance with International Standards o f
Auditing and the FMPractices inWorld Bank-financedInvestment Operations issuedbythe FM
Sector Boardon November 3,2005. The auditors will be required to: (i) an opinion on
                                                                              express
the project financial statements; (ii)carry out a comprehensive review ofthe internal control
procedures and provide a management report outlining any recommendations for their
improvement. The audit reports will be submitted to IDAnot later than six months after the end
o f each fiscal year. The auditors should be recruitedprior to credit effectiveness. The terms of
reference o f the audit will be reviewed by the financial management specialist o f the Bank/IDA
to ensure the adequacy o fthe audit scope, drawing special attention to particular risk areas
identified during project preparation.

Monitoring and evaluation
7.      The implementation o fthe project will be monitoredthrough quarterly progress reports
which the Project coordinators (both at JIRAMA and MEM)will prepare and submit to IDA.
This will provide a way o ftracking actual project execution against implementation milestones
established at the time o f the project launch. These are the key performance indicators and
project outcomes that are contained inAnnex 3.

8.      Further, inorder to assess impacts that the project i s expected to deliver on the quantity
and quality o f electricity and water supplied, it i s envisaged that several surveys will be carried
out at different points on JIRAMA's network. Monitoring o frevenue enhancement measures
will be facilitatedbythe ring-fencing o fclusters where these are to be introduced. Baseline data
will be collected inthese clusters prior to introduction ofthe new customer management
techniques,

9.      Other indicators o f JIRAMA's overall performance, their baseline values and targets have
been agreed duringnegotiations. These indicators are given inAnnex 3.

        MADAGASCAR: PowerrWaterSectors Recovery andRestructuringProject




Introduction

1.     Inaccordance with Bank policyandprocedures, the financial management arrangements
o fthe DEEL (Direction de I'Equipement Electricitk, a department o f JIRAMA) and the MEM
(Ministryo fEnergy and Mines) respectively responsible for the implementation o fthe
components A (Investments) and B (TA, studies etc.) o f the proposed Credit (Power/Water
Sectors Recovery and RestructuringProject) have beenreviewed to determine whether they are
acceptable to the Bank.

2.      This review is rather an update for the DEEL (JIRAMA) since the FMsystems of this
entity have already been assessedinthe context o f the previous Energy Sector Development
Project closedinDecember 2005. The conclusions o f this review are given inSection D
(Appraisal Summary) o f the main body of this P A D and not repeated here.

3.      With regardto MEM,no FMassessmenthas beencarried out yet since the Coordination
Unit(CELCO) incharge ofimplementationofcomponent Bis stillnotinplace. However, we
have started to define with the MEMthe characteristics o f the FMsystem(s) to be implemented,
and developed an agreed action plan to ensure that the ingredients for sound project financial
management are inplace prior to Credit effectiveness.


Countryissues

4.      The World Bank's CFANCPAR, completed in2003, and some diagnostic works carried
out over the last three years by the Bank and other donors, identified a range o f weaknesses and
issues hampering the performance o fMadagascar's budget and expenditure management system.
To address these issues, the Government has developed in2004 and 2005, inconjunction with all
key development partners, a priority action plan for public finance reform. The main
achievements encountered so far include: (i)  adoption o f a new organic public finance law; (ii)
introduction o fprogram budgets to improve the presentation o f the budget and its alignment with
policy priorities of the government as specified inthe PRSP; (iii) reinforcement o f the Treasury
internal control system by recruiting additional staff and improving the operational efficiency o f
the "Brigade du Tresor"; (iv) simplification o fthe expenditure managementprocess by
integrating the functions o f "sous- ordonnateurs" and credit managers; (v) creation o f an internal
control mechanism (IGF: General Finance Inspection) at the level o f the Ministry o f Finance;
(vi) review o fthe legal framework for the control institutions (IGF, Brigade du TrCsor, Auditor
general) and implementation of capacity buildingmeasures to improve their efficiency; (vii)
development and implementation o f a computerized integrated financial management systemin
six maintreasuries, capturing the different phases ofthe expenditureprocess. The reinforcement
of the Treasury internal control and the implementation o f the integrated financial management
system (IFMS) insix treasuries have improved timeliness and quality o f financial information.



                                                 59

5.       The Auditor General has also cleared the backlog o f accounts and completed the
examination o f the draft budget execution laws for the years 1998 until 2003. The oversight
function o f Parliament has been strengthened through capacity buildingand trainingo f the
Public Finance Committee.

6.       While overall implementationprogress o f the reform program i s encouraging, significant
actions remain to be done, including the following: (i)    improvement o fbudget execution rate in
priority sectors; (ii)reinforcement o f the capacity o f the line ministries inpublic financial
management, especially inthe implementationo f the new program budget structure; (iii)
strengthening o f cash management; (iv) production o f the treasury accounts within the legal
timeframe; and (v) reinforcement o f control over state owned companies andnational public
institutions. The strategic coordinationo f the multiple reforms and the monitoring & evaluation
system also need to be improved. To mitigate risks inpublic expenditure management, the
World Bank, throughthe Governance and Institutional Development Program (PGDI), and a
number o f donors continue to support Government's public finance reforms reflected inits
annual priority action plan for 2006.

7.       Regarding the accountingprofession, some positive developments have been noted over
the last three years through assistance providedby the FIDEF (Fbdbration Internationale des
Experts Comptables Francophones) and INTEC (Institut National des TechniquesEconomiques
et Comptables). However, a number o f local accounting firms continue to operate below the
international standards due to the lack o fproper auditing standards, clearly defined guidelines
and procedures for systematic peer reviews, quality control mechanisms to harmonize
methodology. To improve the capacity and the competitiveness o f local auditing firms, the
following measures have been taken while auditing Bank/IDA financed projects: (i)         obligation
for local auditors to enter into partnership with international accounting firms; and (ii)  effective
participation of the international accounting firm inaudit fieldworks and submission o f audit
reportjointly signed by the local and international audit firms. An accounting and auditing
ROSC (Reports on the Observance o f Standards and Codes) would be certainly helpful to
identify clearly both issues and actions to be taken to strengthen the capacity o f the accounting
profession inMadagascar.


Budgeting

8.       Budgetingarrangements for the MEMandJIRAMA are clearly documented. The
budgeting needs o f the project will be fulfilled by the DFB (MEM-Directorate o f Finance &
Budget) regardingcomponent B and by the JIRAMA Directorate o f Finance regarding
component A. The accounting software actually inplace (at the MEMand DEEL) can
adequately cater for the budgeting arrangements o f the project.


Accounting

9.       The DEELaccounting system is incompliance with generally accepted accounting
standards. It uses standard book accounts (journals, ledgers and trial balances) to enter and
summarize transactions and operates on a double entry accrual principle. The accounting system
to be usedby CELCO will present exactly the same characteristics. However, regarding
budgetary executionprocedures, CELCO will apply the procedures actually used within the

                                                  60

MEM(Le, preparation ofexpense commitment formbythe DFB,verification ofthisrequestby
the Expenditure Commitments Oversight Directorate, execution o f the transactions by the
project, determination o fthe exact amount to be paidupon reception o f final bills, preparation o f
payment order andpayment after appropriate verification o f the validity o f the transactions) and
will provide the Budget Directorate o fthe Ministryo fFinance with monthly statement o f
commitment and payment drawn under the project credit lines.

10.      DEELwill maintainseparate financial records for all transactions under its responsibility
and will send, o n a monthly basis, the balance sheet to CELCO for consolidation. CELCO will
be incharge o f timely production o f monthly trial balances for the ACCT (Agence Comptable
Centrale du TrCsor), and quarterly FMRs.

11.      To ensure better understanding and proper application o f policies and procedures by the
project staff (DEEL and JIRAMA), appropriate accounting manuals o f procedures will be
prepared and implemented both at the MEMand JIRAMA. This manual will describe inter alia
the outline of the project accounting system, the accounting policies to be followed, the formats
of books and records, the Chart of accounts, the financial reporting, and relevant information to
facilitate record keeping and maintenance o fproper control over assets. The consultant incharge
of this implementation will also provide adequate training to project staff.

12.      DEELandCELCO will use the integratedcomputerized system acquiredwithin the
context o f the previous Energy Sector Development Project, which inparticular facilitates annual
programming o f activities and project resources, record-keeping (general accounting and cost
accounting), financial and budgetary management and preparation o f project financial
statements. However, this software needs to be adjusted to meet DEEL andMEMrequirements,
especially to allow for procurement management, fixed assets management, timely production o f
quarterly FMRsrequired for managing and monitoring project activities, and follow-up on
project implementation progress. The consultant incharge o f this update will also provide
training for users to ensure efficient use o f all modules offered by the software. The TORSfor
this consultant will be reviewed by the Bank Financial Management Specialist. The new
computerized systemwill be fully functional before project implementation begins.


InternalControl& InternalAuditing

 13.     DEEL's accounting staff i s qualified and has relevant experience to be fully successful in
carrying out their functions. For CELCO, the recruitment o f a qualified and experienced
accountant will be required to assist the MEMaccounting staff inplace inperforming FMtasks.
The recruitment o f this accountant is a condition o f effectiveness. To ensure efficient use o f
credit funds for the purposes intended and consistent application o f procedures on procurement,
financial management, disbursement, the IGF/IGEinclose collaboration with the JIRAMA
Internal Audit Department will play the role o f internal auditors. They will report directly to the
Minister o f Finance, the Minister of Energy and Mines, and the JIRAMA Board o f Directors.
All issues identifiedduringinternalaudit shouldbe addressed quickly to improve the project
performance.

transaction-based disbursementsprocedures (traditional mode) outlined inthe Bank's
Disbursement Handbook. The use o freport-based disbursements could be possible ifrequested
bythe borrower and ifthe following criteria are met: (i) FMrating (both at DEELand
                                                          the
CELCO) has been maintained at satisfactory level; and (ii)   the submission of at least three
quarterly satisfactory FMRs that could be relied upon for purposes o f disbursement. Detailed
disbursement procedures will be described inthe project accounting manual o f procedures.


MinimumApplication Size

18.     The minimumapplication size for direct payments, and special commitments is 20% o f
the amount advanced to the related special account.


Use of Statementsof Expenses(SOEs)

19.     Disbursementswould be made against Statement o f Expenses(SOEs) for contracts and
    .
goods not requiring the Bank's prior review. Therefore disbursements for all contracts for:
    ... Contracts for equipments and goods in an amount inferior to US$200,000;
        Contracts for consulting services, training by firms o f less than US$lOO,OOO;
        Contracts for consulting services, training by individual of less than US$50,000;

        on the basis o f SOEs and certified by the DEELconcerning the component A, and
        CELCO with regard to component B. SOE statements would be audited semi annually
        byindependent auditors acceptable to the Bank. All SOEs supportingdocumentation
        would be kept therefore by the executing agencies and made available for review by
        donor supervision missions, and internal and external auditors.


DesignatedAccounts

20.     To ensure that finds will be available when needed, two designated accounts inUS$ will
be established ina local commercial bank under conditions satisfactory to IDA. The designated
account A will be opened inthe name o f DEELwhereas the designated account B will be inthe
name o f the CELCO. The authorized allocation for the designated accounts A and B covering
IDA's contribution would be respectively US$500,000 and US$350,000 covering IDA'sshare o f
four (4) months o f estimated expenditures. CELCO and DEELwould be responsible for
preparing disbursement requests for components under their responsibility. The designated
accounts would finance all project eligible expenditures inferior to 20% o f the authorized
allocation, and replenishment applications would,be submitted at least on a monthly basis.

21.     The designated accounts would bereplenished on the basis o f documentary evidence o f
payments required by IDA, made from the designated accounts, eligible for financing under IDA
Credit. All SOEs supportingdocumentationwill be keptby the executing agencies andmade
available for review by bank supervision missions and external auditors.

B.      Assessmentof the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

9.      Procurement activities will be carried out by JIRAMA for component A and by MEM
through CELCO incollaborationwith the Unit for Public Procurement (UGMP) for component
B. JIRAMA is properly staffedandits Procurement unitconsists ofproficient procurement
officers and procurement assistants. MOEMAJGMP is staffed with a procurement officer who
will be further supported by an initialprocurement officer to be recruitedby CELCO.

10.     An assessmento fthe capacity o fJIRAMA to implement procurement actions for the
project has not been carried out because its procedures and staffing were already found to be
satisfactory duringthe implementation o fthe former Project PDSE and has since then not
substantially changed. An assessment o f the capacity o f MOEMAJGMPwas carried duringthe
appraisal mission o f May 2006. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project staff responsible for
procurement and the Ministry's central unit for administration and finance.

11.     Most o f the issues/risks concerningthe procurement component for implementation o f
the project have been identified. Identified issues and corrective measures which have been
agreed are described inthe table below. Considering the lack o f capacity within the MEM,the
overall project risk for procurement is considered high.

A. Economicanalysisof the Prowam

Introduction

1.      The proposedprogram offers the prospect o f higheconomic returns to the economy o f
Madagascar, which i s clearly suffering from inadequate electricity supply. Lack o f power
severely hurtthe modem, garment manufacturing sector in2005, with adverse consequences on
output, lost orders andlower exports thanwould otherwise have beenpossible. GDP growth is
estimated to have been lower by 0.5% simply as a result o f the load shedding imposed by
JIRAMA on its clients. Evenbefore the 2005 financial crisis, the service renderedby JIRAMA
was inadequate and declining due to insufficient investment and neglected maintenance. Finally,
resource constraints meant that JIRAMA was not ina position to either extend service or to
increase its generating capacity ina timely, least-cost manner. Many sizeable urban centers
outside JIRAMA's main grids have long had daily power cuts and supply interruptions due to
lack o f fuel and/or equipment breakdowns. These issues are all beingaddressed under the 5-year
restructuring and recovery program for the power sector.

2.      Inaddition, the program also putinplacethe necessary conditions and operating
environment needed to attract private investors to the sector. The sector's large investment
backlog is beyond the limitedbudgetary resources o f GoM. Puttinginplace a private operator to
manage JIRAMA will provide bothpotential IPP investors as well as Madagascar's development
partners with the assurance that JIRAMA will be professionally managed, internal efficiency will
be raised and service quality to consumers improved. A solvent JIRAMA with a healthy cash
flow and good payments record is an essential precondition to private participation indeveloping
Madagascar's plentiful hydroelectric potential.

Least-cost generation plan

3.      JIRAMA's current mix o fgenerationplant reflects sub-optimal choices madeover the
past decade. Poor management, delayed decision making and o f late, lack o f funds have led to
an excessive reliance on diesel generators, even insites where hydroelectric or heavy-fuel
generators would have produced cheaper electricity. For reasons o f expediency and rapidity
several high-cost diesel generators have been acquired on a rental/leasing basis, without
competitive tendering. The recent oil price hikes have turned the choice o f diesel generators into
a severe financial burden for JIRAMA, its consumers and also for GoM. The success o f the
proposedrecovery program for JIRAMA is predicated upon a rapid move away from diesel
generation, initially to HFO and then inthe medium-to long-term to hydroelectricity.



                                                 72

4.      Inthe short- to medium-term, despite Madagascar's evidenthydroelectric resource
potential, the scope for rapidly developing new hydro power sources i s rather limited. Work on
the addition o f a third 30 MW generator at the existing Andekaleka hydro plant i s about to begin,
with financing from BADEA. Undernormalhydrological conditions it will produce 200 GWh
per year, representinga massive cost saving to JIRAMA. Two minor sites (Sahnivotry and Lily)
are at a sufficiently advanced stage o fpreparationby private developers to contribute a further
80 GWho f hydro power by 2009-2010. Due to a lack o fpreparatory studies, other small to
medium-term hydroprospects are unlikely to be commissioned before 2010-2011. Nor has there
been sufficient technical investigationor pre-feasibility work done on the larger hydro sites
(Lohavanana, Volobe and Antetezambato) that have been identified as the least-cost options for
2012 onwards.

5.      Inthe nearterm, major fuelsavings can therefore onlybe achievedthrough substitution
o f HFO plants for high-cost diesel generators. Implementation o f a 40 MW HFO plant to be
sited inthe capital has begun and it is expected to be inservice inmid-2007. This plant will
permit JIRAMA to greatly reduce its use o f diesel, since the plant is capable o f producing 200-
250 GWhannually. Andekalela 3, has been delayedby several years and should already have
been inservice. It produces even greater economic benefits and delays incompleting these two
projects would be very costly to JIRAMA.

Economic Rate of Return

6.      Given the diverse nature o f the physical investments envisaged as part o f the program,
the economic analysis is based on a 5-year time-slice (2006-2010) of the electricity sector's total
investment program, which has been reviewed and found to be least-cost innature (see table 3).
Assigningspecific benefits to particular project components would havebeenboth arbitrary and
nearly impossible.

7.      The physicalbenefits from these investments that havebeen quantified are twofold: first,
(and most important) the incremental electricity supplied to consumers; second, the reduction in
high-cost diesel fuel consumption arising from the replacement o f diesel generators bymore
economical ones usingheavy fuel oil (HFO). Benefits from reduced technical losses and
improved reliability o f service have not been quantified inthe economic analysis presented here
(Table 2). The base case estimate of the EIRRis 14.4%.

8.      The incremental demand that can be met as a result o f the investment program is based
on a variant o f the load forecast preparedby JIRAMA's consultants, HQI.For the purposes o f
the economic analysis, only five years (2007-201 1) o f cumulative load growth have been
considered as benefits directly attributable to the 2006-2010investment program. Total
electricity demand is projected to increase from about 770 GWh in2006 to 1,110 GWhin2011,
equivalent to an annual average increase of 7.6%. However, demand growthin2006-2007 is
severely constrained to only 2% - 4%, due to a deliberate attempt by JIRAMA to restrain
consumption prior to the entry inservice o f a large, new HFO plant. By way o f comparison,
duringthe period 1995-2005, electricity demand rose at an average o f 7% annually, despite the
minimal investment inthe sector to expand service.




                                                  73

9.       The minimumvalue o f the incremental sales has been taken to be the average tariff
across all customer categories charged by JIRAMA in2006, Le. USc13kWh. This does not
represent the full value o f benefits to users from this electricity, but inthe absence o f an estimate
o f the `consumer surplus' it i s a minimummeasure o f benefits that has beenused as a proxy. It
is well below the JIRAMA tariff charged to LV consumers inZone 3 (isolated centers served
entirely by diesel), o f UScl9-20/kWh.

10.      Fuelsavings to JIRAMA havebeenestimated at the differencebetweenthe cost o f
generation using HFO inthe new HFOpower plant due inservice inmid-2007 anddiesel fuel
that it would otherwise have to use inits existing generators. This works out at about
USclO/kWh at current oil prices6.

11.      Fulldetails o fthe analysis andthe parameters usedinestimatingthe EIRRare given in
the tables below. The EIRR i s particularly sensitive to variations inoil prices, the size and
timingofthe investment program, delays incompletingmore efficient plants, and to assumptions
about demand growth. As can be seen from Table 1, depending on the combination o f negative
factors assumed, the EIRRvaries from 10.3% to 13.7%.

B. FinancialInternal Rate of Return Analysis of the Project

12.     The Project proposes a blendof investments intechnical facilities (rehabilitation o f hydro
and HFO generation, transmissionnetwork rehabilitation and/or reinforcements, reinforcement
of distribution facilities), as well as a support to commercial activities (loss reduction, IT...).

13.     The following financial analysis o f the Project i s based on an aggregate cost-benefit
analysis o f its maincomponents for the first phase o f the APL (including the costs that will be
supported by the client). The scope o f this rate o f return analysis i s therefore much narrower
than for the EIRRanalysis presented above which considers the whole investment program of
JIRAMAo fwhich only a fraction is financedbythe Bank (for a financial analysis o fJIRAMA
as a whole, see part C o f this annex).

14.     The project investments yield the following distinct benefits: reduction o f generation
costs, additional revenue from incremental electricity supply, reduction of T & D technical
losses, reduction o f commercial losses. Other economic benefits o fthe project such as an
improved reliability o f supply are not considered because the main beneficiaries will be
JIRAMA's customers rather thanthe company itself.

15.     The Base Case and L o w case FIRR calculation are given inthe table below. The
calculation is based on a total costs o f 7.3 MillionUSD for the components o f the project
included inthe analysis (retroactive financing and technical assistance are not included, and 15%
of contingency costs are added to Bank costs).

16.     The Low Case scenario i s based on more pessimistic assumptions for the profitability o f
the Project (Le., hels prices 20% lower, electricity tariffs 20% lower, contingency costs o f 25%
instead o f 15%). The profitability o f the activities supported by the Project remains highunder
the low case, reflecting past under-investment by JIRAMA.

17.     The FIRR for technical investments i s based on technical parameters that are relatively
straightforward. The forecasting for the revenue management activities is fraught with greater
uncertainties (our assumptions are muchmore conservative than JIRAMA's). Beyond their
direct impact, the revenue management activities have an experimental value. On the basis o f
their results that will be carefully monitored, it should bepossibleto base future investment
decisions on more reliable forecasts (regarding, for instance, the decision to invest inthe
generalizationo fprepaid meters).

C. Financialanalvsis of JIRAMA


Introduction

18.    The Project strategy i s centered on:

       (a)      Rescuingthe company from financial and technical collapse;

       (b)      Implementing small but highly profitable investments to rehabilitate existing
       generation, transmission and distribution facilities, and increase revenues;

       (c)      Creating the adequate organizational, institutional, technical and financial
       conditions that will allow inthe medium-term to pursue a more ambitious policy o f
       access expansionbased on larger investments notably in additional hydro generation
       capacity.

       (d)      The Project will complement the restructuring planthat has been initiated,
       including activities Key actions to be accomplished: Recreating the basic process and
       procedures necessary to efficiently manage JIRAMA,restructuring o f JIRAMA balance
       sheet, (financial restructuring o f liabilities, re-capitalization o f the company). A financial
       restructuring exercise is currently underway andthis summary analysis incorporates the
       measures that have beendecided.

19.    The present annex describes and analyzes succinctly (i)       the recent financial history o f
JIRAMA;(ii) situationo fthe company in2005 when the full extent o fits difficulties became
               the
apparent with the beginningo fthe management contract; (iii)        the restructuring plan o f the
company that i s underway and the medium-term financial prospects o f the company.

20.    Among the conclusions that can be drawn from this forecasting exercise, the following
stand out:

       (a)      Inspite o fthe large hnds injectedinthe companybythe government anddonors,
       the projected conversion o f debt into company equity, and the successive tariff increases
       on electricity and more recently on water, JIRAMA remains ina precarious financial
       situation.

       (b)      With most o fits debts cancelled or rescheduled, JIRAMA has been given a fresh
       start financially, however its most immediate problem remains an insufficient generation
       o f funds from internal sources: cash-flow from current operations is likely to remain
       negative in2006 and 2007, given JIRAMA's unfavorable generation mix (new HFO and
       hydro plants not yet inoperation, Andekaleka will not be operating at full capacity during
       rehabilitation works).

       (c)      As aresult, JIRAMA cash position is boundto deteriorate again over the next two
       years (especially ifthe company reduces its arrears towards suppliers as envisioned inthe
       "plan de redressement"), and will probably need a new injection o f liquiditybefore 2008.




                                                    78

(d)    Our financial forecast assumes several efficiency improvements (reduced
transmission and distributionlosses, improved revenue collections, better management o f
personnel costs). The biggest source o fpotential savings is however the reduction o f
generation costs. The Project includes several activities components precisely devoted to
the rehabilitation o f hydroelectric installations. These activities have an extremely very '


highrate ofreturn.

(e)    However, once these "low-hanging fruits" are harvested (the small investments
that should have beenmade years ago), a further reduction inaverage generation costs
can only be achieved by following a disciplined investment planning approach, based on
the least-cost expansion plan. Giventhe leadtime o f large hydroelectric projects, this
approach will take several years before its benefits are felt interms o f increased supply
and/or lower tariffs.

(f)    Tariff discipline i s essential ifJIRAMA i s to become financially viable again: an
updated indexing formula should be defined and scrupulously followed. Our financial
forecast assumes yearly tariff adjustments (the next one being scheduled for April 2007)
slightly above the rate o f localinflation. The average tariff perkWhexpressed inUSDis
currently similar to its value in2002 and 2003, and oil prices are much higher today than
theywere then.

(g)     There is a trade-offbetweenthe expansiono f access and the affordability o ftariff
for existing users that needs to be acknowledged. To be able to invest, with donor
support, inaccess expansion, JIRAMA needs to generate a positive cash-flow from
current operations. A way to address this issue is through the sequencing o f activities and
investments. An ambitious policy to increase access to electricity can only be based on
the availability o f new sources o f generation at an affordable price because as long as
JIRAMA meets extra demand at the marginwith thermal generation, any effort to
increase supply will directly deteriorate its cash position.

(h)     JIRAMA needs to betterprioritize its investment program: after years o f neglect
and under-investment, all domains o f JIRAMA's operations (generation, transmission,
distribution, commercial, administrative, IT...) seem to require significant investments.
However, financing has yet to be found for a large portion o f the investment program that
JIRAMA initially has presented for the years 2006 - 2009. This initial program seemed
extremely over-ambitious financially, but probably also inoperational terms. The current
project attempts to address this need for a more prioritized and better sequenced investing
approach. Therefore, during the first phase o f the APL, the project targets the most
profitable investments. Also, concerning revenue management activities, it will allow the
experimentation o f several approaches inorder to facilitate future decisions regarding
larger scale investments. For the next phase o f the APL, the use o f a PRGguarantee
should bringan important leverage and allow the financing o f large scale expansion
investments.

Recent Financial History of JIRAMA

21.     From 2001 to 2005, the financial performance o f JIRAMA has severely deteriorated,
primarily on account o fincreasingly inadequate electricity andwater tariffs. Tariffs have
remainedunchanged in local currency from July 2001 to July 2005. Over this period,
Madagascar has experienced political troubles in2002 and a significant domestic rate o f price
inflation. This has been accompanied by a substantial depreciation o f the national currency
against the U S dollar from 2003 onwards.

22.     Throughout the period, for various reasons including the political instability, the lack o f
financial resources, and a systematic preference by decision-makers for solutions yielding quick
results, no rigorous planning process o f investments was followed. Given their short lead time
and low investment costs, diesel generators were systematically preferred to hydroelectric
generation or even to HFO-powered generators. Also, in2003 and 2004, JIRAMA entered into
contracts with Independent Power Producers. Usually negotiated ina situation o f emergency
given the risk o f disruption o f supply created by the lack o f advanced planning, the contracts
with IPPwere usually costly because (i) were based onthermal generation; (ii) were
                                           they                                         they
not always tendered on a competitive basis; (iii)   the independent producers rationally demanded
a large risk premium on their investment given the uncertainties attached to JIRAMA's
signature.

23.     The choice o f thermal generation with diesel oil proved disastrous. The combination o f a
depreciating national currency and o frising oil prices inU S D on international markets logically
increased the cost o f thermal generation. In2001,fuel costs represented 48% o f the revenues
derived by JIRAMA from electricity sales, an already highproportion given that thermal
generation made up less than a third o f the generation mix o f JIRAMA at the time. From 2001 to
2005, the volume o f thermal generation rose by 35%, but the corresponding fuel costs increased
by 280%. As aresult, in2005, fuel costs alone were significantly above the revenues derived
from electricity sales. JIRAMA was infact selling each kWhlargely below its variable cost o f
generation.

24.     The decline inthe profitability of the company goes back to at least the year 2001, but
became really acute in2004. In2002, the operations o f the company suffered from the
consequences o f the political situation but J W A paradoxically benefited fi-om reduced
demand that allowed a significant reduction inthe volume o f thermal generation. In2003, a
further deterioration ofoperatingprofitability was maskedinthe annual accounts bya change in
the accounting rules governing the depreciation o f assets. This accounting change, though
without impact on cash-flow, allowed JIRAMA to show an operating profit in2003, inspite o f a
barely positive EBITDA.

25.      Over the course o f the FY2004, the price o f Diesel Oil inlocal currency more than
doubled, provoking severe cash-outflows. The magnitude o f the operating losses should have
prompted a large tariff increase, primarily inorder to prevent a bankruptcy o f JIRAMA, but also
to recreate an adequate economic signal (due to non-reevaluated tariffs, electricity hadbecome
extremely cheap compared to oil and natural gas).




                                                  80

26.     Instead, JIRAMA's management didnot attempt to address the structural inadequacy o f
revenues but chose to continue to operate as long as possible within the existing tariffs, by
implementing short-term solutions. A positive step that was undertaken is the improvement o f
revenue collection. The company managed to collect significant amounts of arrears from its
customers (mainly from the government). However, the other measures taken aimed at saving
cash inthe short-term went against the medium-term technical and financial viability o f the
company. JIRAMA managed up to the endo f 2004 to maintain a quasi-normal electricity supply
inmost ofthe country only byaccumulating largeamount ofdebts toward its suppliersandthe
government (non payment o f taxes and nonrepayment o f financial debt). The lack o f funds also
prompted the company to more or less halt muchneeded maintenance operations. Investments
had already been severely restricted for several years.

27.     The pronounced deterioration o f JIRAMA finances was entirely predictable given the
increase inthe price o f oil and the absence o f tariff reevaluation. The need for an immediate and
significant tariff increase should have been recognized much earlier. Indeed, the sector regulator
hadrecommendedinthe fall o f 2004 to increase electricity tariffs by nearly 80% on average. It
must be noted, however, that the (unaudited) financial accounts producedby JIRAMA did not
adequately reflect the severity o f the situation. For instance, the accounts for 2003 presented a
net positive result. Also, the management o f JIRAMA should have been clearer on the
seriousness o f the liquidity crisis. The lack o f sincerity o f JIRAMA's accounts and o f financial
transparency played a part inthe failure ofthe GOM to recognize earlier the absolute necessity
of a large tariff increase.

28.     The historical financial results o fJIRAMA that are summarized inthe table below must
be taken with caution. They originate from the annual accounts that have been reviewed but not
been certified by external auditors (the audit firm Mazars). Inparticular, there are reasons to
thinkthat JlRAMAdidnot adequately depreciate its inventories andits customer receivables.

29.     As the table above illustrates, JIRAMA operated in2001 with a relatively low level o f
margin (interms of EBITDNsales) for an electricity andwater utility. This meant that the level
o f cash flow fi-omcurrent operations was probably barely adequate to maintain andrenew
existing assets, but not to service its long-term debt and/or fund an expansion o f service.
However, the situation became really dramatic in2004, primarilydue to the increase inoil prices
inlocal currency. (The abyssal deficit for 2005 isprobably somewhat overstated andthe deficit
for 2004 underestimated due to lack o fproper provisions for inventories and receivables at end
2004).

30.    Facedwith a liquidity crisis, JlRAMA was able to continue to operate in2004 thanks to
improved revenue collection and a very large accumulation o f short-term debt.

31.     JIRAMA's operationalperformance, while unsatisfactory, didnot deteriorate
significantly over the period for most parameters. The main causes ofthe financial difficulties
experienced by the company are the inadequate level o f tariffs and the bad investment choices
for new generation capacity.



Situationof JIRAMA at the beginningof the managementcontract

32.     A diagnostic study o fJEWMA carried out in2003 revealed the severity o f the problems
facing JIRAMA. The findings o f this report coupled with the insistence o f the World Bank,
eventually prompted the GOM to decide on a two-year management contract for JIRAMA. This
management contract, when it became effective during the first semester o f 2005, hadthe effect
of shedding light on the true extent o f JIRAMA's financial difficulties.

33.     Summarized, the situation that became apparent can be described as follows:

        (a)      Extreme financial unsustainabilitv of current operations: Duringthe first semester
        of 2005, the variable costs associated with thermal generation alone (fuel expenses and
        energy purchase costs) were superior to the total revenues o f the company leaving no



                                                       84

        source o f funds to pay for other current expenses (maintenance, personnel.. .) let alone
        new investments or debt repayment.

        (b)     Rapidlybuildingup arrears towards suppliers: given the structural disconnect
        between current expenses and revenues, could not continue to operate without increasing
        its level of debt. Around the endo f year 2004, the company switched to a practice o f
        payingfuel oil with letters o fcredit allowing for a delay o f four months before the cash
        payment became due. The effect o fthis practice was to postpone the liquidity crisis o f
        JIRAMA untilafter the management contract took effect.

        (c)     Lack o f effective and reliable financial reporting and internal controls:
        Symptomatic illustrations o fthese deficiencies are for instance: the absence o f reliable
        and auditedannual accounts, the lack o f monitoring o f the cash position o f the company,
        the incomplete and late reporting from the isolated centers.

34.     This does not meanthat the company hadno administrative infrastructure or procedures
inplace. Onthe contrary, for most domains (commercial, technical, financial.. .),staffmembers
o f JIRAMA were used to prepare numerousperiodic reports to retrace the activities o f each
department and o f each territorial level. However, this reporting, while very time-consuming,
hadbecome largely useless for operational purposes. Among the reasons for this were:
excessive quantity and uneven relevance o f the information reported, long delays inproducing
the reports, lack o f geographical exhaustivity o f the information (missing data from several
isolated centers), impossibility to adequately assess the reliability o f the data or cross reference it
(impossibility for instance to assess the consistency between commercial statistics, and the actual
cash revenue collected from customers).

35.     While the reporting system inplace was very inadequate, there are reasons to think that
with limitedinvestments inIT and office equipmentand software, and an impulsion from the top
management o f the company; JIRAMA administrative staff has the required capacity to maintain
adequate reporting systems. One area where the lack o f effective control i s particularly
damaging is the insufficient monitoring o f fuel consumption. A systematic reporting on a
monthly basis and for each electricity center o f the quantities o f fuel used, power generated,
energy metered and billed, ando f the actual revenue collection from the customers would help to
detect quickly problem areas within the company.


T h e recovery process supported by the project

36.     The restructuring process is materializedby a restructuring plan ("plan de redressement")
supported by the GOM. The main dimension o f this planare the following:

        (a)     Financial restructuring o f JIRAMA: JIRAMA cannot realistically service the debt
        it has accumulated. The financial restructuringwill entail substantial debt cancellationby
        the GOM, as well as an injection o f cash. Negotiations are underway with the other
        creditors o f JIRAMA (mostly suppliers), with the objective o frescheduling the
        repayments o f capital by JIRAMA and transforming part o f the debt inequity. Overall,
        the planentails significant budgetary costs (of which 50 billions AR incash in2006) for



                                                   85

the GOM. Inaddition, it i s likely that an additional injection o f liquidityinJ W A will
be necessary before 2008.

(b)      Tariff increase: successive and significant tariffs increase have beendecided and
implementedin2005 (two increases of electricity tariffs) and 2006 (increase of water and
electricity tariffs). One obvious lesson fi-om the recent history o f JlRAMA is the absolute
necessity of maintaining adequate cost-recovering tariffs. Inaddition to the front-loaded
tariff increase that has already taken place, this should be achieved inthe future through:

         (i)     Maintaining transparency regarding the financial situation o f JIRAMA
         (see covenant on reporting obligations for JIRAMA);

         (ii)    Vigilance from donors and from the IMF (considering the budgetary cost
         and the macroeconomic effects of a collapse o f JIRAMA);

         (iii)   The definition o f an indexingformula for electricity and water tariffs and a
         streamlined decision process to apply the formula and effectively implement
         necessary tariff changes: the volatility o f the currency and o f oil prices will
         remain a problem going forward and JlRAMA, givenits low or negative margins,
         will not be able to bear the cost o fthis volatility (see covenant on tariff indexing).

(c)      Efficiencyimprovements. The key operationalparameters to improve the
financial viability o f JIRAMA are the following: (i)     lowering the cost o f existing
generation; (ii)  technical losses reduction; (iii)improved revenue collection. Those are
the three priorities for the initial investment component o f the APL. While relatively
small, the investmentsto be financed under the first phase should have a significant
financial impact, giventheir extremely highoverall projectedrate o f return. This
situation reflects the past mismanagement o f the company, and the fact that modest
investments with extremely rapid pay-back have not been carried out. The project also
supports small investments inIT which should contribute to improved financial reporting
and internal controls.

38.    Under theses assumptions, JIRAMA would start to generate a positive cash-flow on
current operations (EBITDA less interest expenses) in2008, due to tariff increase, a better
generation mix, and improved overall operational perfonnance.

2008 (current ratio below 1 and increase of short-term financial debt), inpart because of the
progressive reduction o fpayment arrears towards suppliers.

40.    The cash flow statement highlightsthe deterioratingcash position o f JIRAMA up to the
year 2008 included. The support o f the government i s apparent inthe equity increase. However,
the cancellation of long-term financial debt by the GOMwill not solve the immediate liquidity
problem of the company. The build-up of short-term financial debt inthe forecast i s not healthy
and would be costly for JIRAMA (highinterest rates) or impossible to finance. Therefore, as
explained inthe main text of this appraisal document and discussed with the GOM, additional
budgetary support of JIRAMA will probably be needed in2007.

        MADAGASCAR: PowerWater Sectors Recovery andRestructuringProject



A. Overview

1.      Duringthe preparationofthe JIRAMA financial recovery andrestructuringplan, the
Malagasy Government incollaboration with the Utility has developed an investment Plan for the
period 2006 -2012.

2.      The investment Plan relates to all the activities o f JIRAMA: electricity, water, as well as
the activities related to customer management, financial and commercial issues. The part o fthe
proposedprogram to be supported by IDA focuses on financing needs for the most pressing and
high-priority investments and will be executed intwo phases: the first phase APL-1 for the
periodmid-2006 -mid-2008 and the second phase APL-2 for the period o f mid-2008 - mid-
2012.

3.      Phase 1o f the program (APL- 1 would assist JIRAMA recovery planwith:

(a) reduction of generation costs by rehabilitation of existing hydroelectric and thermal units, as
well as conversion o f some diesel generators to heavy fuel oil;

(b) reduction of technical losses in transmission and distribution by upgrading ofkey sections of
MV lines, replacement o foverloaded transformers andundersizeddistribution lines and cables;

(c) improvements in metering, billing and revenue collection by meter verification and
replacement, high-value customer management, updating o f customer records, introduction o f
prepayment meters and spot metering techniques inselected clusters;

(d) modernization of JIRAMA 's information systems and IT equipment by installation o f a
company-wide computer network and associated hardware and software.

4.      APL-1would also support the long-termobjectives o f improvingthe electricity and water
sectors' performance by assisting Madagascar inproviding funds: (a) for complementary actions
needed to accompany the transaction advisor (IFC) inthe process o f selecting and contracting a
newprivate operator to take over JIRAMA; (b) for prolongation o fthe current management
contract to avoid any hiatus before the takeover by the selected strategic partner; and (c) TA to
the Ministry o f Energy(MEM)to steer the above process to a successful outcome and for
capacity buildingwithin MEM.

5.      APL-1 will also support the technical and safeguard studies required for APL-2 as well as
the due diligence requirements for private hydro generation investments to be eligible for IDA-
backed guarantees ina subsequent PRGoperation currently under preparation.




                                                 92

6.      JIRAMA selected a consultant to carry out the preparationo fanEnvironmental and
Social impact Management Framework (ESMF) for investments to be implementedunder APL-
1. The ESMFwas prepared inaccordance with Bank guidelines andnational environmental
policies (Environment Charter and Mecie decree relatedto the necessity o f investments'
compatibility with Environment).

7.      Investments proposed to be financed under APL-1concern rehabilitation and
reinforcement o f existing installations. The reinforcements consist mainly o freplacement o f
transformers and faulty equipment. As no new Greenfield sites will be developed or human
resettlement undertakenby JIRAMA as an effect o f the investments under APL-1,it is unlikely
that this Operational Policy (OP) will be triggered. This Operational Policy i s likely to be
triggered for the second Phase o f the project APL-2.

8.      The environmental classification o fthe APL-1part o fthe project is Category B (partial
Assessment). Duringthe preparation o f phase 2 (APL-2), ESIAs with RAPSwill be conducted
and submitted to ASPEN for review and clearance.



B. Methodology

9.      The following methodology has beenused inthe preparation f the ESMF: (i)            review f
investment plan; (ii) o f legal and regulatory framework and analysis o f environmental
                     review
safeguard triggered by World Bank policies; (iii)  field visit; (iv) data analysis, identification and
assessment o f the potential project impacts andmitigation measures; and (v) proposal for
environmental measurements with mitigation measures.



C. EnvironmentalAssessment Findings

Rehabilitation of tlzermalpower station

10.     Rehabilitation o f thermal power station o f Ambohimanambola, Mahajanga, Toamasina,
Toliary, Antsiranana consist of the replacements o f machine parts, includingthe rehabilitation o f
auxiliaries and general revision of the generator Units.

11.     The environmental examination o f the projects related to the rehabilitation o fthe power
station showed that the environmental impacts are generally neutral. However, the impacts o f
the investments alone cannot be considered independently from the totality o fthe installations
andthe current environmental situation inthe site inwhich they are located. The main impacts
are noise, the atmospheric emissions, the pollution of ground and water due to non efficient
management of effluents, and poor risk management including absence of an emergency plan.

Rehabilitation of hydroelectric power station

12.       Rehabilitation of the hydroelectric power station o f Antelomita 1, Ankazobe,
Tsiazompaniry, Vatomandry, Andekaleka and Volobe, consist of replacement of used turbine
and alternator parts, Turbine Cooling equipment, general revision of plant, and rehabilitation of
the civil engineering works.




                                                               94

13.      The analysis o f the environmental impacts o fthe projects concluded that impacts are non-
significant and reversible except for the environmental impacts o f the restoration o f the civil
engineering works plannedfor the hydroelectric power station at Vatomandry. Specific attention
needs to be given to the rehabilitation of transformers inwhich the PCB (Polychlorinated
Biphenyl) represents environmental risk. JIRAMA has agreed to comply with the actionplan for
the elimination o f Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), elaborated incollaboration with the
Malagasy Environmental Administration, the coordination committee o f POP and supported by
the UNEP. JIRAMA will therefore ensure safe storage o f the old transformers.

14.      For the hydroelectric power stationinVatomandry (192 KW), JIRAMA must meet the
requirements o f the safeguard policy OP 4.37 on the Safety o f Dams. This rehabilitation will
therefore only be realized after an expert report on the dam safety, carried out by an independent
expert, judged satisfactory to IDA.

projects include reinforcement o f the networks, replacement and repair o f transfonners and
faulty equipment. The current problems are especially due to acts o f vandalism, dilapidating
Structures on the 63 kV line and out-dated equipment. Generally, the likely environmental
impacts are non significant for the 63 kV Transmission line.

Assessment of implementation and monitoring capacity

16.     The execution o f the APL-1will require JIRAMA to amend its organization to integrate
"environmental Management" which i s currently missingfrom its management structure. An
entity within JIRAMA should manage all environmental actions involving the Company. This
environmental unitwill report to the Managing Director o f JIRAMA or to a directly designated
highlevelmanager inthe hierarchy. The Unitwill beresponsible for the supervision o f
environmental management within the Company, as well as to propose a revised environmental
policy. The environment unitwill be the focal point for the environmental Administration and
will represent the Company on all questions relatedto environmental issues. The Unitwould be
responsible for prior examination o f all projects undertakenby JIRAMA as well as
environmental monitoring o f the existing installations.

 17.    Onsite, compliance with the environmental actionplanwill be ensured by the heads o f
operation who will submit a report to the environmental services. These tasks relate to the
implementation o f environmental measurements as well as the follow-up o f the environmental
impacts o f the activities.

        MADAGASCAR: PowerNater Sectors RecoveryandRestructuringProject


This is an abstract in English of the letter dated 29 May 2006from the Minister of Energy of
Madagascar to the Vice-president,Africa Region. A copy of the letter in French is contained in
the Project Files.


Objectives o f electricity sector policy

    a   Contribute to economic growth;
    a   Accelerate access to electricity;
        Reduce the burden o fthe sector on public finances.

Short-term actions for JIRAMA's recovery

The 2005-2009 recovery plan consists o f internal measures to reduce costs, improve JIRAMA's
technical and commercial performance accompanied by restructuring of its balance sheet, a
recapitalizationo f the company, injection o fworking capital by the Government, exoneration o f
certain taxes and duties and substantial tariff increases. It i s to be accompanied by a high-
priorityprogram o f investments.

Long-term management option for J W A

The Government has decided to accept the recommendation o f the Task Force set up to review
the institutional and management options for JIRAMA. Consequently:

    a   JlRAMA will remain state-owned;
    a   Water and electricity activities will not be separated;
    a   The enterprise's electricity branchwill not be unbundledbut will remain vertically
        integrated;
    a   A private partnerwill becompetitively recruitedto operate JIRAMA under atype o f
        leasing contract (contrat d'affermage).

Other Government commitments

    a   Provide JIRAMA with additional working capital ifrequired;
    a   Clear up payment arrears to JIRAMA o fpublic bodies and set up a mechanism to prevent
        a recurrence;
    a   Support JIRAMA inits efforts to improve its payment rate from industrial andhousehold
        consumers;
    a   Launch an IPP program with the assistance o f IFC;
    a   Introduce an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism.
