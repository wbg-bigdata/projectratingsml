                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since March 2009, the World Bank's program in Madagascar has been guided by its Operational Policy 7.30, "Dealing with de facto governments", designed to deal with situations
                         where a government comes into power by means not provided in the country constitution. Consequently, the project was put on hold during the last two years. In July 2012, the World
                         Bank approved the restructuring of the project including the reformulation of its objective to reflect the sector environment that has changed. The implementation of the project has
                         now resumed.
