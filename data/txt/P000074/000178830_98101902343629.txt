INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECODMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Benin for the equivalent of
US$10.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an industrial develop-
ment project. US$8.6 million out of the proceeds of the Credit would be
relent to Banque Beninoise pour le Developpement for 18 years including 5
years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
Part I - The Economy
2.        The latest economic report on Benin (Report No. 2079-BEN, issued
in May 1979) was the result of a basic economic mission which visited the
country in fall 1977. The paragraphs below are based on this report, but
include updated information.
Introduction
3.        Following independence in 1960, there were numerous changes in
Government emanating from the rivalry between the three kingdoms which had
traditionally formed the country. No single leader was able to maintain a
dominant role until the revolution in 1972 which brought to power the
military Government of President Kerekou.
4.        The new regime took immediate steps to replace the foreign
domination of the modern sector and strengthen the Government's involvement
in the agricultural sector. These measures initially disrupted the economy
since there was an inadequate number of trained Beninese to replace the
departing expatriates. However, the Government also pursued conservative
financial policies which resulted in budgetary surpluses and the maintenance
of the debt service ratio at less than five percent.
5.        Benin has now enjoyed a comparatively long period of political
stability under which a blend of pragmatic nationalism and socialist philoso-
phy has emerged. Following the adoption of a new constitution Lieutenant
Colonel M. Kerekou was recently confirmed President of the Republic for a
3-year term by a newly-elected National Assembly. Mtr. Kerekou has in turn
appointed a civilian dominated government.
6.        The nation is poised for a period of moderate growth propelled by
major investments in the industrial sector. But Benin's near-term prospects
should be assessed with caution because they are dependent on a few key
factors: strength of the Nigeria and Niger markets, success of key industrial
projects and, continuation of a prudent budgetary policy.



-2-
Recent Economic Developments
7.        With a population of 3.2 million people and a GNP per capita of
$230 per annum, Benin remains one of the least developed countries as
defined by the U.N. Over the 1972-78 period, the country enjoyed an average
real GDP growth rate of 4% and a sound public finance position. Exports are
little diversified (mainly oil palm products, cotton, and cocoa), and a large
resource gap (25% of GDP over 1972-78) has been recorded. Foreign reserves
have remained at about one month's imports; a decline in late 1978 has subse-
quently been reversed.
8.        The Agricultural sector, which generates income for about 60
percent of the population and which generated 37 percent of the GDP in
1978, has not substantially increased its output over the past decade.
Foodcrops have at best followed the growth of population. Cotton production
peaked in 1972 at 50,000 tons but has since fallen to around 15,000-20,000
tons. Palm oil production continued to increase in the mid-1970s, but
output has been reduced following a severe drought in 1976. Institutional
changes, insufficient price incentives, lack of financial resources and
the absence of technical assistance are the main reasons for this unsatisfac-
tory performance. Since 1974 the Government has experimented with a number
of organizational and policy approaches to the sector's problems, but
conflicts between agencies, a desire for centralized control, and a neglect
of extension services have seriously eroded the efficiency of the sector.
9.        The industrial sector is still undeveloped due to a lack of
skilled manpower, smallness of the local market and institutional con-
straints. It employs less than 2 percent of the labor force, contributes 12
percent to GDP (1978) and consists mostly of agricultural processing and
import-substitution activities. The sector achieved an 11 percent annual
growth rate during 1972-76, but slowed down to 4.0 percent during 1977-78
because of a fall-off in demand from the Nigerian market. Currently, Benin is
beginning to exploit its natural resources through several major industrial
projects, for example, the Onigbolo cement factory (limestone), the Save sugar
plant and the Seme offshore oil field.
10.       The tertiary sector (mainly transport and commerce) constitutes
the second most important activity of the economy, accounting for 41
percent of GDP (1978) and employing almost 40 percent of the labor force.
The port of Cotonou has traditionally provided access to the sea for
landlocked Niger and the western part of Nigeria. The volume of transit
trade through Cotonou Port was insignificant as late as 1974, but rose
to 330,000 tons in 1977. This transit trade, however, declined in 1978
due to Nigerian import restrictions.
11.       There has been a significant improvement in the central Government's
current financial situation over the last decade. The chronic current
budget deficits of the 1960's, financed by French Treasury transfers, were
eliminated during the first half of the seventies. During 1976-78 the
budget registered current surpluses averaging a high 23 percent of current



- 3 -
revenues. The Government has controlled the growth of current expenditures,
which did not increase in real terms during the 1972-1977 period. The
1976-1977 surplus was due to the sudden rise of tax revenues resulting from
the growing transit trade to Nigeria and also, to a lesser extent, to the
development of Beninese industrial activities. Some levelling off or decline
in public revenues related to the Nigeria trade, combined wi- expected
heavy demands on the Treasury for investment projects, will probably tighten
the budget picture in coming years.
12.       Prices have also been kept under control and the overall rate
of inflation (on an implicit GDP deflator basis) has declined from 11 percent
in 1976 to 8.5 percent in 1977 and 5 percent in 1978.1/ Thus, inflation
in Benin continues to be considerably lower than in neighboring countries,
owing to the commercial sector's vitality and the Government's policies of
wage restraint and limited spending. Should import prices continue to rise
and domestic food shortages occur again, inflation might however be expected
to pick up slightly to 6-7 percent in 1980. The increased economic activity
induced by the implementation of new investments is likely to maintain this
trend in the following years and inflation is forecasted at 8-9 percent for
1981 and 1982.
13.       The Government is committed to broad-based socio-economic policies,
but a key concern hitherto has been to keep wages and salaries low because
of limited public revenues. In real terms, both public and private sector
salaries have declined. Cash incomes of the farmers may have increased
slightly; the losses resulting from the drop in cotton production probably
having been made up by increased exports of maize to Nigeria. Thus, in
Benin, the gap between urban and rural income has not increased in recent
years. Education is one of the Government's top priorities. It is in the
process of implementing reforms aimed at both adjusting the education system
to the needs of the country, and reducing the high cost of formal education
which absorbs 40 percent of the Government's recurrent budget. Health faci-
lities are still poor, and the social indicators for Benin (literacy, life
expectancy, etc.) remain well below the average for low income developing
countries.
The 1978-80 Development Plan
14.       A Three-Year Plan (1978-80) was issued in October 1977, setting out
the Government's economic goals. Its stated objectives are to raise the
general standard of living, to achieve independent national direction of
economic policies, and to promote broad participation in the conception and
implementation of economic and social changes. Investment allocation proposed
in the Plan favors large-scale projects. The major items are: a 40,000-ton
sugar project at Save (US$210 million); a 500,000-ton cement plant at Onigbolo
(US$159 million); the Seme offshore oil production project (US$120 million),
estimated to yield about 20 million barrels and the Cotonou Port extension
(US$50 million), financed by IDA and seven other agencies. These projects
together account for some 45 percent of the investment foreseen in the Plan.
The sugar and cement projects are joint ventures with the Nigerian Government,
1/ IMF staff estimates.



- 4 -
with Nigerian marketing and financing guarantees. Work on Cotonou Port is
underway. The production of sugar, cement and oil should commence around
1983.
15.       Based upon an analysis of the major projects and Benin's financing
possibilities, Bank staff estimate that only 70 percent of the planned
US$1.1 billion investment will materialize, and will be disbursed over five
years rather than three. The Government's review of implementation of the
first year of the Plan (1978) revealed that only 36 percent of the projected
volume of investment materialized. Furthermore, the deepseated problems
facing the rural sector are not really addressed in the Plan. The low rate
of investment in agriculture is partly due to the lack of viable projects,
which in turn is related to institutional problems, the absence of effec-
tive extension services, and poor marketing arrangements for export crops.
However, the several large projects in the Plan will push the overall
public investment rate to 19 percent of GDP on average over the 1978-83
period, compared with 10 percent over 1972-77.
Prospects
16.       The medium-term outlook for economic growth in Benin is moderately
optimistic. Real GDP growth during 1979-85 is expected to average 5-6 percent
per annum. The downside risks to Benin's economy are the reliance on Nigerian
demand which has been weak over the past year, and the negative impact of
problems which may arise in implementing the large projects. The benefits
from these projects are, in turn, dependent upon price agreements (specifically
with Nigeria in the case of cement and sugar). Benin's growth prospects will,
moreover, depend on effective pricing and marketing policies in the rural
sector. In the long-term, Benin's growth potential will be limited by a poor
resource base to perhaps 4 percent per year, and even the achievement of this
rate will depend on the ability of Government to channel resources and orient
programs (in social and economic infrastructure, training, marketing, etc.) to
the development of food and cash crops.
17.       Benin's public finance and balance of payments situation may
fluctuate more over the next five years than has been the case in the
preceding half-decade. In the mid-1970s, conservative public policies led
to budget surpluses and a stable trend in foreign reserves. This partly
reflected, however, the lack of sizable new initiatives in public investment.
The situation is now changed with the implementation of the Three-Year Plan
which places heavy demands on the Treasury for counterpart funding, and
steps up the pace of capital and intermediate goods imports matched by
foreign financial inflows. The balance of payments will undergo fluctuations
between now and 1985 under the impact of the major projects. Since the
large projects underway will heavily influence the trade balance and public
finances, their successful implementation is essential for Benin's medium
term outlook.



18.       Benin's total external debt (including undisbursed), which until
the end of 1978 had remained relatively low, amounting to US$260 million
with a debt service equivalent to 5-6 percent of the country's exports, is
expected to rise substantially as investments increase and borrowing
conditions harden. The debt service ratio is projected to reach 22-27
percent of --ports in the mid-80s. This ratio is high, but up to 80
percent of the debt service is accounted for by the large projects, two of
which are guaranteed by Nigeria. Nevertheless, this points up Benin's
vulnerability. Were any of the major projects to encounter serious
problems (cost overruns, inefficient management, or unprofitable pricing
agreements with Nigeria) then the debt burden could quickly become unmanage-
able. The low level of Benin's traditional exports (only 19 percent of GDP
in 1972-77) does not permit much flexibility in this respect.
19.       In view of the country's low per capita income, the growing need
for external funding of priority projects in an expanding economy, and
Benin's narrow export base, it will be necessary to increase the volume of
foreign financing on concessionary terms. Benin is expected to be able to
finance no more than 10-15 percent of its overall public investment program.
Thus foreign donors should continue to provide a large share of total
project costs, including the financing of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BENIN
20.       To date the Bank Group has extended nine credits to Benin, plus
two supplementary credits totalling US$67.8 million. Three of the credits
were for agriculture (19 percent of total lending), four for highway con-
struction and maintenance (59 percent), and one for the extension of port
facilities. The ninth operation was an education project focussing on
training of rural youth. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
Group operations in Benin as of December 31, 1979, as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
21.       IDA's first operation in Benin was the Hinvi Agricultural
Development Project (1969), which provided for oil palm plantings and food
crop development and the construction of an oil palm mill. The project was
successfully completed in 1974. The second agricultural credit was the
Zou-Borgou Cotton Project (1972). This operation, co-financed by FAC, was
aimed at expanding cotton and fooderop production in the Zou and Borgou
provinces. Due to organizational upheavals, managerial problems and
frequent policy revisions in the agricultural sector during its implementa-
tion, the project failed to achieve its main objective, resulting in a
severe decline of Benin's cotton program. The Performance Audit Report for
the Zou-Borgou project (Sec M78-353) was issued in April 1978 and that for
the Hinvi Agricultural Development Project (Sec M78-451) in May 1978. The
third project, Technical Assistance (1977), is scheduled for completion in
June 1980. Its objectives are to reverse the Zou-Bourgou Project setbacks, to
strengthen the country's agricultural institutions and to prepare follow-up
rural development projects. The first of these, in the Borgou Region, is due
for appraisal in mid-1980.



- 6 -
22.       The Bank Group's involvement in the transport sector in Benin
began in 1969, when the Bank acted as Executing Agency for a UNDP "Land
Transport Study". This study led to the financing of a four-year (1970-
1974) Highway Maintenance Project. Under the first project, the Government
department then responsible for maintenance was reorganized and a training
program was carried out (Completion Report N. Sec. M77-758 of October 25,
1977). The Second Highway Project, co-financed by USAID, comprised princi-
pally the reconstruction of 320 km of the Parakou-Malanville road, Benin's
most important north-south trunk road which links Cotonou to the Niger
border, and the continuation of the road maintenance program. This project
was completed in June 1977 with the help of a supplementary credit of US$9
million due to severe cost overruns. The Third Highway Project, approved
in November 1977, provides for the rehabilitation of a 107 km section of
the southern part of the north-south axis (between Godomey and Bohicon) and
the expansion of the maintenance program, including the elimination of the
backlog in resurfacing bituminous and laterite roads. In addition, a Feeder
Roads Project, which provides for the construction and maintenance of about
1,270 km of feeder roads and for the preparation of a long-term feeder road
development program in support of agriculture, was approved in FY77. A first
Port project was approved in FY78. Its major objective is to raise the cargo
capacity of the port of Cotonou from 720,000 tons per year to about 1,100,000
tons by providing about 660 m of additional berth capacity together with
additional storage facilities. The project includes technical assistance to
improve the efficiency of port operations, cargo handling and the operations
of the Cotonou-Parakou railway.
23.       The First Education Project, which was approved in FY 74, provides
for the improvement of rural youth training programs and the construction and
equipment of a skills upgrading center in Cotonou. The project includes a
pre-investment study for a follow-up training/education project currently
under preparation.
24.       The emphasis in future IDA operations in Benin will shift from
transportation to agriculture and rural development. Two rural development
projects are envisaged for FY81 and FY83. The lending program will also
probably include support for the development of the SEME oilfield and
urban development in Cotonou.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The Industrial Sector
25.       Benin's industrial sector is still embryonic, contributing only
about 12 percent of GDP and employing about 2 percent of the labor force.
Fueled by exports to Nigeria (an estimated three-fourths of Benin's indus-
trial output find their way into Nigeria), industrial growth has been
rapid: between 1971 and 1976 value added increased 26 percent a year in
real terms, turnover 21 percent and investment 35 percent. Modern industry
accounted for most of this growth: the traditional artisan sector only
a small percentage.



- 7 -
26.       Modern industry comprises about 75 firms, of which 63 are located
in Cotonou, Porto Novo and Parakou. These firms are mostly involved in
agricultural processing, manufacturing and construction. Eight firms (all
nationalized) account for three-fourths of total sales. They are primarily
producers of cement, textiles, oil processing and beverage industries.
Most of the remaining firms are small and privately owned. `ley include
food processing, beverages, vehicle assembly, mechanical worKshops, bakeries,
furniture making, paint, perfume and other consumer goods. An interesting
cooperative (COBEMAG) producing agricultural implements -animal drawn carts
and ploughs- has been operating in Parakou since 1976. It is wholly owned
by its 150 workers.
27.       Vegetable oil processing accounted for about one-fourth of
industrial output during 1972-76. But the palm crop was severely affected
by insufficient rainfall in recent years and marketed palm oil production
declined sharply from 38,500 tons in 1975/76 to 9,400 tons in 1978/79.
Palm fruit and palm kernels production dropped by about 50 percent during
the same period.
28.       Manufacturing has traditionally been oriented towards import-
substitution. It includes a shoe factory, a modern brewery, a flour mill
and clinker grinding plants. There are, however, some export oriented
industries such as the integrated textile plant in Parakou (IBETEX). This
is a joint venture (48 percent state ownership) with European firms with
the capacity to produce about 3,200 tons a year of made-up articles and
garments.
29.       Small-scale enterprises, though common in the commercial field
in Benin, are not well-developed in manufacturing. Only eight firms
currently benefit from the Investment Code provisions for "small-scale"
Beninese entrepreneurs, according to a 1977 industrial survey. The
artisan population is quite large. A limited 1979 survey by the Ministry
of Industry identifies some 10,000 master-artisans. As elsewhere in
Africa, tailoring, metal working and woodworking are the most important
crafts (23, 16 and 13 percent respectively).
30.       Benin's transit role to Niger and Nigeria has led to a rapid
growth of the road transport industry which carries 70% of all freight
and 90% of all domestic passenger traffic. Although Government nationalized
the two main transport agents, and created a national Truckirg Company
(Trans-Benin) as well as regional transport companies, 350 small operators
(with less than four trucks each) still handle the bulk of the traffic.
31.       Benin's construction industry has a turnover of CFAF 6.5 billion
in 1976 up from CFAF 2 billion in 1970-75. Foreign contractors handle
most civil works but building construction remains in the hands of local
firms whose capacity is constrained by the lack of equipment and capital.
To lessen foreign domination on the sub-sector, Government established
two public companies, Societe Nationale de Construction et des Travaux
Publics (SONACOTRAP) in 1976, and Societe Nationale de Gestion Immobiliere
(SONAGIM) in 1978.



- 8-
Industrial Promotion and Training
32.       No institution is specifically equipped to promote industry:
"Bureau Central des Projets", a planning ministry agency in charge of
industrial assistance focuses mostly on large-scale, government sponsored
projects included in the Plan. The "Direction de l'Industrie" within the
"Ministere de l'Industrie et de l'Artisanat" has only a regulatory and
statistical function. The "Centre de Perfectionnement du Personnel des
Entreprises" (CPPE) provides low level clerical and vocational training.
The "Centre de Formation Administrative et de Perfectionnement" (CEFAP)
trains Government and public sector employees. The only institutions
catering to the needs of entrepreneurs and managers of small or medium-scale
enterprises are the Chamber of Commerce (CCI) and Banque Beninoise pour le
Developpement (BBD). CCI has successfully organized several training
sessions for its members and managers of public enterprises. It also
plans to organize its industrial extension service with the advice of
UNIDO. BBD's "Direction des Etudes et de la Promotion" is the most active
promotional agency, but it lacks engineering and managerial expertise.
33.       Although the Government has been officially encouraging the
formation of artisan cooperatives, no concrete measures have been taken
and channels to deliver assistance to artisans have yet to be established.
Prospects and Issues in Benin's Industrial Sector
34.       Industrial Policy.  The industrialization of Benin is considered
essential to its development and the Three-Year Plan foresees an industrial
growth rate much higher than that for the whole economy. Government has
assigned three objectives to industry: (i) satisfy the immediate needs of
the population, (ii) produce agricultural inputs and (iii) process agricul-
tural products. To affirm public leadership over the sector, the State has
taken over eight major firms which account for three-fourths of industrial
sector sales, mostly in the cement, textile, oil processing and beverage
industries. The state has been encouraging cooperatives for small-scale
enterprises, but it keeps a pragmatic and positive attitude towards private
enterprises in an effort to direct the strong business community from commerce
to industry. The liberal investment code of 1972 is still effective and
provides substantial incentives to enterprises investing more than CFAF 25
million, including exemption from import duties on equipment and machinery,
reduction of up to 75 percent in import taxes on raw materials, exemption
from the domestic turnover tax, etc.  Incentives are granted on a case by
case basis following a review of each project's merits and requirements.
A special system (Regime D) benefits small Beninese entrepreneurs investing
at least CFAF 10 million and employing more than 10 employees; these pay no
duties on imported equipment and raw materials. In addition they are
exonerated from the turnover tax for five years. The investment code is not
likely to be amended until the Second Development Plan is adopted (1981);
improvements then to be sought include the abolition of export taxes, the
elimination of the minimum investment requirement of CFAF 10 million, and the
listing of all industrial activities reserved to private intiative. At
negotiations, the Beninese delegation indicated that BBD would keep IDA
informed of any proposed changes.

35.       Despite a recent slackening in demand due to a fall-off in
demand from the Nigerian market, Benin's industrial sector is expected to
continue in the next five years the fast growth rate it enjoyed during the
1972-76 period. This growth would primarily result from the large industrial
and transport projects identified in para 13 above. Benin's favorable
location on. everal transit routes, its proximity to the large Nigerian
market, its low wage structure, the Government's positive attitude towards
private enterprises and a liberal investment code provide substantial
incentives to help broaden the base of Benin's industrial development.
36.       Although prospects have improved in recent years, obstacles to
a better performance of the industrial sector remain substantial. First,
artisanal and industrial enterprises suffer from various operational
constraints such as low capacity utilization, irregular supply of equipment
and raw materials, lack of technically competent personnel and poor
managerial practices. Second, Benin offers a rather narrow market and a
large share of Benin's industrial growth in recent years can be attributed
to formal and informal exports into Nigeria. Certain risks are inevitable
in this dependence on a single external market. Third, although Government's
attitude towards industrial entrepreneurship is essentially pragmatic, its
socialist philosophy inevitably deters private investment. Finally, very
little technical or financial assistance is currently available to artisans
and entrepreneurs.
Financial Institutions
37.       Besides the Central Bank (BCEAO) the banking system comprises
three state-owned, highly specialized banks. "Banque Commerciale du Benin"
(BCB), specialized in commercial banking operations, resulted from the
merger of three previously French-owned commercial banks. With 15 branches,
80 percent of total loans and 75 percent of total deposits, it is Benin's
biggest bank. "Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole" (CNCA) was established
by the Government in 1976 as the apex organization for regional and local
agricultural savings and loan institution. "Banque Beninoise pour le
Developpement" (BBD) is the country's main term-lending institution.
Credit Policies and Interest Rates
38.       As a member of the West African Monetary Union (UMOA), Benin shares
a common currency (CFAF), Central Bank (BCEAO) and credit and monetary
policies with Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Upper Volta. Under its
operating guidelines, BCEAO controls money supply and credit expansion by
providing liquidity to the banking system. Since 1976, the Central Bank has
also decided to apply a formalized sectoral credit policy directing funds
towards priority sectors, which has yet to be fully implemented. Finally,
to improve the use of liquid funds within each country and the Union, BCEAO
operates a money market for daily operations between the commercial banks
and the Central Bank. Benin has so far practiced a policy of low interest
rates. Thus, preferential loans (Government, housing, crop financing and
small-scale entreprises) command an average interest rate of 7 percent whereas
BCEAO authorizes a maximum of 8.5 percent, based on a preferential discount



- 10 -
rate of 5.5 percent. Other loans command an average interest rate of 9.5
percent whereas BCEAO authorizes a maximum of 13 percent, based on a normal
discount rate of 8 percent. Under the proposed project, BBD has agreed to
increase its lending rate to small- and medium-scale enterprises to 8.5 per-
cent and 11 percent respectively. As of June 1978, credit outstanding in the
economy amounted to 43 billion CFAF (US$205 million) of which more than
three-fourths was short-term.
39.       The banking system is almost exclusively dependent upon Central
Bank refinancing which is subject to an overall country ceiling. Within
this limit, the Government is entitled to borrow 20 percent of the preceding
year's tax revenues and the balance is available for the banking system.
Each bank can claim Central Bank refinancing for up to 35 percent of its
lending operations. At present, loans by the banking system to the economy
are covered by Central Bank refinancing (79 percent), Government surpluses
(12 percent) and public or private deposits (5 percent). As the country
is now embarking on a substantial development program led by the public
sector, Government surpluses and parastatal deposits will in part be
withdrawn to finance new investments and purchases of equipment abroad.
Furthermore the Government might be compelled to draw on the Central
Bank up to its statutory limit, thus curtailing the amount of refinancing
available to the banks. To compensate for smaller deposits and tighter
rediscounting, the banks must search for alternative sources of finance.
The proposed line of credit for small and medium-size industrial projects
will provide BBD with the alternative resources it needs to fulfill its
developmental role.
Banque Beninoise pour le Developpement
40.       A government-owned institution with a share capital of CFAF 1
billion (US$4.8 million), BBD became Benin's specialized term-financing
bank for all economic and social development projects in 1975. It grants
medium- and long-term loans, occasionally with equity participation, to
all sectors of the economy whether public or private. BBD has had an
impressive rate of growth and stands out as a well managed and profitable
institution. Its 113 member staff is organized into five departments
responsible for project promotion and supervision, credit applications,
accounting and finance, administration, and legal matters.
Policies and Procedures
41.       BBD's By-Laws define its policies and operating guidelines. Equity
participations are limited to 25 percent of a company's share capital and
their sum cannot exceed BBD's unimpaired capital and reserves. BBD's exposure
in each project is limited to 90 percent of total project cost for SMEs, 65
percent for industrial enterprises and 50 percent for other projects.
There is however no limit placed on individual loans in relation to BBD's
equity. At negotiations, BBD agreed to amend its By-Laws to include an
exposure limit in relation to its own equity, acceptable to the Association as
well as a maximum debt/equity ratio of 5:1 (Project Agreement, Section 2.07).
BBD's interest rates now range from 6.5 to 8.0 percent for indigenous SSEs,
from 9.0 to 11 percent for other industries and from 9.5 to 12 percent for



- 11 -
trade and services. BBD's procedures are generally efficient. Appraisals
cover most aspects of project evaluation and, following the Bank's identifi-
cation mission of November 1978, now include economic rate of return
calculations and monitoring of employment creation. Supervision of problem
projects is good but it should be generalized to all projects. Loan col-
lection procedures are well established and efficient. BBD accounts are
currently reviewed by a "commissaire aux comptes" whose investigations,
consistent with the practice in the region, are only superficial. Although
competent, the "commissaire aux comptes" is not familiar with the long form
audit as required by IDA. Consequently audits under this project would be
carried out by a firm of auditors acceptable to IDA (Project Agreement,
Section 3.02).
42.       BBD has in the past, carried the foreign exchange risk on some
foreign borrowings. So far, its exposure has been minimal since half of
the CFAF two billion borrowed is denominated in French Francs (which has
a fixed parity vis-a-vis the CFAF) and the other half in US$ (which has
depreciated vis-a-vis the CFAF) and with a large spread (6 to 8 percent).
Nevertheless, BBD confirmed during negotiations its willingness to set aside,
each year, an amount equal to 2 percent of the outstanding on these borrowings
as a provision for exchange risk on past borrowings. In addition BBD has
agreed not to carry the foreign exchange risk on its future borrowings.
Dispositions satisfactory to IDA will be taken by BBD before December 31,
1980. (Project Agreement, Section 3.06).
Operations
43.       The structure of BBD's US$56.6 million portfolio (CFAF 11.9 billion
in 1977/78), of which three-fourths are for several large equipment loans and
one-fourth for a multitude of small social loans, is a reflection of the
transition BBD has undergone since 1975, from a multipurpose bank to a devel-
opment bank. With equipment lending now accounting for two-thirds of its US$30
million yearly approvals, BBD's operations are geared towards development
lending. BBD's portfolio affected by arrears represents almost 43 percent of
its total portfolio. However most of these are technical arrears on state-
owned or guaranteed loans often due to start-up delays in project implementa-
tion which do not affect the ability of clients to repay. Accordingly, BBD's
estimate of doubtful loans (12 percent of its portfolio) and the level
of provisions for these (about 5 percent of its portfolio) are considered
adequate. Nevertheless, BBD's monitoring of arrears could be improved and a
plan to reduce arrears to an acceptable level would be submitted to the
Association for its approval not later than October 1, 1981 (Project Agreement,
Section 2.11).
Financial Performance
44.       BBD has grown rapidly and its assets have tripled over a four
year period to reach US$68.6 million as of September 1978. With outstanding
commitments and approvals of some US$33 million, BBD's resource position shows
a term resource gap of about US$20 million. In securing more term resources,
BBD is trying to decrease its dependence on BCEAO by locating alternative
sources of term finance. It has already succeeded in mobilizing new deposits



- 12 -
of approximately US$7.1 million, and has US$4.5 million available from
existing lines of credit (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, USAID,
African Development Bank and Algerian Development Bank)l/. In addition BBD
obtained recently a US$4.5 million loan from the OPEC Special Fund. This
loan would be administered by IDA in conjunction with the proposed Credit.
Moreover BBD agreed to increase its capital not later than December 31, 1980
by at least US$2.4 million (Development Credit Agreement Section 3.02).
BBD's earnings before taxes have risen steadily from US$300,000 in 1975 to
US$700,000 in 1978. Administrative expenses have been maintained at a
reasonable level and their share of average total assets has declined
from 2 to 1.2 percent in 1978.
Prospects and Issues
45.       BBD's strategy for the future is not only to continue its current
role as the main source of term financing for all clients, public and private,
outside the agricultural sector, but also to intensify its promotional,
appraisal and supervisory services for small and medium-scale industries. BBD
currently has a pipeline of projects amounting to CFAF 7 billion or US$33
million for the next three years. Projects under consideration include
bakeries, ice-making, packaging, textile, food processing, charcoal making,
transport, metal working, etc. BBD's pipeline, lending program and past
performance show that its financing of small and medium industrial projects
could easily reach US$15 million over the next four years if its project
preparation capability is rapidly upgraded.
46.       BBD's Departement des Etudes et de la Promotion (DEP), which is
in charge of promoting and assisting SME's, is clearly understaffed; it needs
the services of an experienced industrial engineer with managerial experience
to assist in identifying, promoting and supervising SHE investment projects.
To fulfill its promotional role vis-a-vis local entrepreneurs, DEP - in
liaison with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry -- would also require
expertise in preparing and implementing training and promotion programs. Due
to the unavailability of local personnel experienced in these fields, outside
technical assistance would be provided under the project. In addition, BBD
has been encountering some difficulties keeping its accounts up to date and
optimizing its liquidity management. A review by a firm of experienced
external consultants of the financial department's functions and procedures
would be carried out under the project.
47.       Financial forecasts show that BBD resource requirements until 1984
would reach an estimated CFAF 12.8 billion (US$61 million) until 1984. This
would be met by an increase in capital, deposits, central bank rediscount
and lines of credit. BBD's projected financial ratios show that its financial
position would remain sound throughout the period; the term-debt/equity ratio
would remain below 5:1 and the total debt/equity ratio would stay around 8:1.
Profitability would remain stable relative to net worth because the forecasted
increase in average interest rate from 8.2 percent in 1978 to 9.5 percent in
1981, would be gradually matched by the increase in administrative and financial
expenses.
1/ In 1978 BBD's average cost of funds stood at 4 percent of total assets.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
48.       Following an official request by the Minister of Plan, an iden-
tification mission visited Benin in November 1978. It concluded that there
was a need in Benin for alternative sources of long-term foreign exchange
resources to finance productive investments in the industrial sector, and
that, subject to improvements in its financial management and promotional
role, BBD could become an adequate channel of Bank Group assistance. The
project was appraised in the field from April 8 to 20, 1979. Negotiations
were held from January 16 to 18, 1980. The Beninese delegation was led by
Mr. Baba Moussa, Director General of BBD. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
2719-BEN is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III
of this report provides supplementary project data.
49.       The main thrust of the proposed IDA credit would be to provide
an alternative source of term financing, to build up BBD's capacity to
identify, promote and assist industrial projects and to advise the Government
on industrial and financial sector issues (export strategy, employment
creation, artisans role, investment code). Specifically the project seeks to
bring the Government to focus not only on large-scale projects, but also on
small manufacturing and artisan industries.  To achieve these objectives, the
project would be supported by a line of credit to BBD for the financing of
industrial projects and a technical assistance program to strengthen the
institution. An advance of US$320,000 under the Project Preparation Facility
was granted in December 1979 to ensure an early start of the technical
assistance and for the preparation of ad hoc feasibility and engineering
studies.
Project Costs and Financing
50.       The project will cost US$12.3 million net of taxes, of which US$9.1
million is foreign exchange. Taxes are estimated at US$1.3 million. The
proposed IDA credit of US$10 million would therefore represent 81 percent of
total project cost net of taxes. It would finance 100 percent of total
foreign expenditures. In addition, it would finance US$0.9 million of local
expenditures (7 percent of total project cost) under the small-scale and
technical assistance components.
51.       US$8.6 million from the IDA credit proceeds would be onlent to BBD
as a line of credit to finance economically and financially sound investments
in the following areas:
Small-Scale and Labor Intensive Investments
(i) At least US$2.6 million of the line of credit (30 percent)
would benefit small-scale investments defined as projects



- 14 -
costing less than US$238,000 (CFAF 50 million). BBD would be
authorized to finance 90 percent of the investment cost (CFAF
45 million or US$214,000) of such projects; IDA would finance
100 percent of BBD's loans. BBD would be expected to finance
about 25 to 30 investments in the typical areas of wood and
metal working, food processing, road transport, fisheries,
tailoring, repair and maintenance activities. Artisanal
enterprises would also be eligible for financing under this
component. Moreover, as an incentive for employment generation
in medium-scale industry, any industrial project creating
employment at a cost per job of US$10,000 or less would be
eligible for a loan at conditions similar to those for small-
scale enterprises (Development Credit Agreement, Section 2.03).
Medium-Scale Investments
(ii) Up to US$6.0 million of the line of credit would benefit
medium-scale investments defined as projects costing between
US$238,000 and $2.4 million (CFAF 50 to 500 million). BBD
would be expected to finance up to 65 percent of the investment
cost of such projects representing their estimated average
foreign expenditures (CFAF 325 million or about US$1.5 million).
IDA would finance 100 percent of such BBD's subloans. Under
this component, BBD would finance 10 to 15 projects in a wide
range of activities such as manufacturing of agricultural tools
and implements, vehicle assembly, small hotel projects, produc-
tion of consumer goods, construction companies (Development
Credit Agreement Section 2.03).
Terms and Conditions of Sub-Loans
52.       The line of credit would be onlent by the Government to BBD at 8
percent for eighteen years including five years of grace. BBD would be
charged a commitment fee of 0.75 percent and repayment would be on a fixed
amortization schedule of equal, semi-annual payments of principal and interest
(Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 2); a fixed amortization schedule is
justified to provide BBD with increased resources through roll-over of funds
and to ease the administrative burden of frequent schedule readjustments.
53.       The terms of sub-loans would vary according to the type of project.
Maturities would range from 2 to 15 years. Averages are expected to be
about five years for small-scale investments and eight years for medium-
scale investments. The grace period on principal repayment could reach up
to five years but would seldom exceed three years. The interest rate to
medium-scale sub-borrowers would be 11 percent per annum. This rate repre-
sents a 1.5 percent increase above BBD's average rate. It would yield a
positive return given the low current inflation rate (para. 12) and would give
BBD an adequate spread of 3 percent to cover its overheads. Sub-borrowers
would also be charged a commitment fee (0.75 percent of the undisbursed
balance). The interest rate charged on small-scale and labor-intensive



- 15 -
sub-projects would be 8.5 percent per annum, in line with BCEAO's preferential
rate (Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 2). To ensure BBD an adequate
and consistent spread, the Government has agreed to compensate BBD for the
interest lost on its lending on small-scale and labor-intensive projects
(Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 2 paragraph 1 (e)).
54.       BBD would calculate the investment cost per job and the internal
financial rate of return and the economic rate of return of all its sub-
projects. All subprojects financed under the line of credit would have,
normally, a minimum economic rate of return of 10 percent, encourage employ-
ment creation, and give due consideration to the use of appropriate technology.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government (Development
Credit Agreement, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(d)). A free-limit of US$150,000
for individual subloans and an aggregate free-limit of US$2 million would be
established. However, the first three sub-projects below the free-limit
would be reviewed by IDA. BBD would also limit its long-term borrowings to
not more than    five times its paid-in share capital and unimpaired reserves
(Project Agreement, Section 3.05).
Technical Assistance Program
55.       Technical Assistance is an important aspect of this project and
US$1.4 million of the proceeds of the Credit would be earmarked for
this component. The program's objective is firstly to help improve BBD's
financial management and strengthen its project identification, promotion
and supervision capabilities, and secondly to assist BBD and the Direction de
l'Artisanat in the Ministry of Industry in the formulation of an artisan
promotion policy and the preparation of a practical cost-effective artisan
project component.
56.       Assistance to BBD would include 18 man-months of consultant
services to help organize BBD's data processing capability and improve
financial reporting and management, 3 man-years of an industrial engineer
services to help BBD's "Departement des Etudes et de Promotion" in the
identification, promotion and supervision of industrial investments. An
allocation of US$130,000 from the proceeds of the credit would be made
for the preparation of engineering and feasibility studies for projects
prometed by BBD and US$115,000 to finance the cost of in-house training and
fellowships for BBD's staff. BBD would in addition carry out, jointly with
the Chamber of Commerce, training programs for SME entrepreneurs. The credit
would provide for 2 man-years of the services of a training and extension
expert to organize BBD's in-house extension service and carry out studies.  An
allocation of US$145,000 would be made to finance the cost of training ses-
sions.
57.       Finally, 10 man-months of consultant services would be provided to
advise BBD and the Ministry of Industry's Direction de l'Artisanat on policies
related to artisans and to help prepare an artisan project component proposal
for a possible follow-up industrial development project. IDA would approve



- 16 -
the qualifications, terms and conditions of employment of advisors and
short-term consultants financed under the project (Project Agreement, Section
2.06). Provision has been made to finance five man-years of advisors and 28
man-months of short-term consultancies estimated at an average foreign
exchange cost of US$8,750 per man-month, plus US$1,600 (net of taxes) per
man-month for local expenditures and subsistence.
Monitoring
58.       BBD would submit to IDA semi-annual operational and financial
reports, annual reports and audited financial statements. In addition,
BBD would furnish information on staff training, and its coordination
with other project-related organizations (Direction de l'Artisanat and
the Chamber of Commerce).
Procurement and Disbursement
59.       BBD is expected to follow usual DFC procurement procedures.
Disbursement would be made on the following basis:
(1) line of credit: 100 percent of BBD's subloans;
(2) technical assistance, consulting services, and training
expenses: 100 percent of expenditures.
Disbursements under all categories would be fully documented.
Benefits
60.       Benefits are expected to accrue to the Beninese economy in the
form of productive investments, employment creation and institution
building. The project would result in the implementation of about 45
financially and economically viable subprojects, representing an investment
of about US$12.0 million in industry. The line of credit is expected to
contribute to the creation of about 900 jobs at an average cost per job
of US$7,100 for SSE/labor-intensive investments and US$19,500 for medium-
scale investments. The institutional improvements in BBD would increase
BBD's overall efficiency and the quality of its investments. By making
credit and technical assistance available, the project would provide the
first organized attempt in Benin to upgrade the skills of local artisans
and entrepreneurs.
Risks
61.       The small size of the Beninese economy, the uncertainties
surrounding the Nigerian market, the centralized management of the
economy and the lack of skilled labor are factors which could prevent sub-
project investments from materializing as quickly as expected, resulting
in slower disbursements. To balance this the positive factors are the
coming into force of the trade provisions under the ECOWAS Agreement, the
expectation that the Nigerian market will continue to absorb Beninese
products, that state enterprises will undertake substantial investments



- 17 -
and that the Government will maintain its pragmatic attitude towards
small and medium-scale private investments. The lack of BBD expertise
in designing and implementing investment proposals would be addressed
by the early provision of a substantial technical assistance package.
The project being centered around an efficient and dynamic intermediary
should ther-''re be implemented smoothly.
PART V. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Benin and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
63.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
III. Special conditions of effectiveness included in the Development Credit
Agreement would be the execution of a Financing Agreement between the Govern-
ment and BBD and the amendment of BBD's "Reglement Interieur" to establish an
exposure limit and a maximum debt/equity ratio acceptable to the Association.
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
65.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

B. Projects in Execution
Credit No. 415: Second Highway Project; US$11.8 million credit
of July 3, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979. Due to inflation and
currency realignments, project cost estimates increased to US$23.3
million or 77 percent above the original cost estimates. The Association
provided a supplementarty credit of US$9.0 million on March 10, 1976.
Physical execution of the project has been completed. About US$3.9
million is expected to remain undisbursed under the Credit. The Govern-
ment has requested that these funds be used to upgrade a bridge which
constitute a major bottleneck on the alignment of the Parakou Malanville
road which has been upgraded under the Project, or alternatively to help
complete the feeder road program begun under Credit 717, BEN. Credit
funds would be exhausted by September 1980, leaving about 300 km still
unimproved.
Credit No. 583: Rural Education and Training project; US$4.0
million credit of September 5, 1975: Closing Date: June 30, 1981. This
credit provides for (i) construction and supply of training materials
for a Skills Upgrading Center in Cotonou; (ii) construction, equipment
and technical assistance to improve the ongoing rural youth training
program; and (iii) preparation of a second education project. The
construction of the National Support Center (CNAC) and of a Regional Support
Center for the rural training component of the project have been completed.
The two remaining regional centers are still under construction. Personnel
have been appointed to the CNAC. Equipment has been selected and issued
to the youth clubs. Training for extension staff and group leaders has
begun. Construction of the Skills Upgrading Center (CPPE) is nearing
completion. Overall project execution is about 18 months behind schedule.
Credit No. 716: Technical Assistance Project; US$1.7 million
credit of May 30, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This project is
designed to prepare the way for a rural development project. The project
which was to be carried out over a two-year period is nearing completion.
It provided for technical assistance to SONAGRI, the project executing
agency, in financial management and project preparation and evaluation,
procurement of trucks and staff vehicles, consultant services for the
preparation of investment proposals and for cotton and food crops adaptive
research. Project preparation which started rather slowly is now proceeding
satisfactorily. The technical assistance program has been extended to
June 1980.
Credit No. 717:  Feeder Roads Project; US$5.5 million Credit of
May 30, 1977; Closing Date: September 30, 1981.  This project consists of
a three-year program for the improvement and subsequent maintenance of about
1,270 km of feeder roads, the purchase of highway maintenance equipment and
spare parts, and technical assistance to the Ministry of Equipment. Project

ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
start-up was delayed for about 18 months because of delays in equipment
delivery. Credit funds are expected to be exhausted by September 1980 leaving
about 300 km of project roads still unimproved.
C lit No. 746: Third Highway Project US$10 million Credit of
November 18, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980. This project is
designed to facilitate access to the Port of Cotonou by providing for the
rehabilitation of a 107 km section of the country's main north-south highway;
it also aims at expanding the highway maintenance program begun under the two
previous highway projects, including the elimination of the backlog of
bituminous and laterite roads resurfacing. Project start-up was delayed
because of administrative problems which stem from frequent reshuffling of
personnel at the head of the service and an appalling lack of support staff.
However, there are signs of improvement. One bitumen and one gravel brigade
have been constituted and have begun work. The training program has been
carried out satisfactorily. It is proposed to extend the program by training
15 additional technicians.
Credit No. 926: Cotonou Port Project; US$11.0 million credit
of October 6, 1978, Closing date: March 31, 1982. This project provides for
the extension of the existing general cargo port facilities, involving
dredging of a new basin, construction of 610 m of berths, with transit sheds,
hardstandings, roadway, and railway services; the construction of a new
cut-off breakwater and entrance channel dredging; technical assistance for
all port operations including railway and a study of coastal erosion problems.
Eight co-financiers including IDA had originally agreed to participate in the
project and to provide about US$44.0 million of external financing. A US$3.0
million EEC Special Action Credit was approved on November 9, 1979 to close
the financing gap created by the withdrawal of one of the cofinanciers.
Civil works are proceeding satisfactorily.

5 times its paid-in share capital and unimpaired
reserves (para. 54).
Special conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a) The Financing Agreement has been executed on behalf
of the Borrower and BBD, respectively;
(b) BBD shall have amended its By-Laws to include inter
alia an exposure limit in relation to its own equity
acceptable to the Association, as well as a maximum
debt/equity ratio (paras. 41 and 63).
