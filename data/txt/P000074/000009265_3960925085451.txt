PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BENIN
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 997-BEN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the
Industrial Development Project in Benin. A credit of US $10.0 million was
approved on March 20, 1980 and became effective on August 10, 1981. The
project was closed on June 30, 1989, four years later than expected, and
following four extensions of the closing date. By December 30, 1989
US$ 6.7 million was disbursed, with the last disbursement processed in
January 1990. US$ 3.3 million was cancelled on March 14, 1990.
This PCR was prepared by the Occidental and Central Africa
Department. As the Borrower has not submitted Part II, the PCR consists of
Parts I and III.
The PCR is based on a report prepared by a consultant,
including a mission to Benin, as well as on the Staff Appraisal Report,
supervision reports and other documents and correspondence in the project
files.
On May 7, 1990, the Bank sent to the Borrower Parts I and III
for their review and comments, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BENIN
INDbSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 997-BEN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        Objectives.  The project had the following four objectives:
(a) to initiate a dialogue with the Government and the Borrower on
industrial and financial sector issues and policies; (b) to strengthen the
financial structure of BBD (Banque Beninoise de Developpement). the project
financial intermediary, through the provision of term resources for
financing small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs); (c) to improve Benin's
capacity to identify, promote and assist small and medium sized industrial
ventures; and (d) to upgrade BBD's financial management and reporting
system as well as its project monitoring capability. To achieve these
objectives, the project consisted of a line of credit of US$ 8.6 million
and technical assistance in the amount of US$ 1.4 million (paras 3.01 -
3.05).
2.        Implementation.  The project implementation faced serious delays
from the outset. In addition to a 16-month delay in project effectiveness.
disbursements on the line of credit were slower than expected. The main
reason for these delays was the poor investment climate resulting from
inappropriate macroeconomic policies. The deterioration of Benin's banking
system, including BBD, aggravated the difficulties of the project, as
described below (para. 4.01).
3.         BBD's arrears have always been high.  As early as 1978, the
portfolio affected by arrears represented almost 432 of the total
portfolio. These arrears problems were compounded by a drop in public and
private deposits; BBD managed for some time to edge off a liquidity crisis
by drawing increasing amounts from the Central Bank's refinancing facility.
Eventually, BBD reached (and for some time actually exceeded) its
refinancing limit 1/, and as a result was precipitated into a major
liquidity crisis (para. 4.02).
4.        BBD's financial problems could not be addressed in isolation
from the other two Beninese bonks, BCB (commercial bank) and CNCA
(agricultural bank), both of which were equally insolvent. The Bank
therefore helped design an overall restructuring program of the banking
system in the context of the preparation of an economic adjustment program.
The project supported these efforts: the last two extensions of the closing
1/   BCEAO statutes limit refinancing to a bank to 35Z of the bank's sound
portfolio.

date included a reallocation of funds from the line of credit, which was
not disbursing, to the technical assistance component. This reallocation
of funds provided the Governmenit with the additional resources required to
prepare the banking system reform (paras. 4.03 and 4.04).
5.        Results.   As mentioned above, the utilization of the IDA line
of credit was constrained by the adverse economic conditions and investment
environment during project implementation, which translated into a limited
demand for financing of industrial investments. The line of crAdit only
financed 14 subprojects instead of the 45 estimated at the time of
appraisal and created 194 jobs instead of 900, at an investment cost per
job of US$ 12,129 for small-scale (SSEs) and US$ 43,937 for medium-scale
enterprises. Of the 14 subprojects financed, eight enterprises are no
longer in operation because of losses incurred, and two are in serious
difficulty, although their performance could improve, if rehabilitated.
Only three enterprises, all small-scale enterprises (SSEs), are in a good
financial position. As far as the technical assistance component is
concerned, except for the training of BBD staff in project evaluation
techniques, its contribution was limited. 'levertheless, the project was
instrumental in supporting the restructuring of the financiallbanking
sector as a whole (paras. 5.01-5.08, 7.02).
6.        Sustainability.  Project implementation coincided with a period
in which the Beninese economy was experiencing serious difficulties.
Benin's rapidly deteriorating economic conditions are the key reasons for
the project's failure to achieve its original objectives. BBD has now been
liquidated (paras. 4.04 and 6.01).
7.        Findings and Lessons Learned.  The following are some lessons
learned by this operation:
(a) The poor utilization of the line of credit clearly
demonstrates the negative impact of an adverse economic and
policy environment on industrial investments. The project
should have been preceded by thorough industrial sector
work to identify inadequacies in the policy environment and
regulatory framework and other constraints confronting
private sector operators. Measures to address these
constraints are now being implemented in the context of the
Structural Adjustment Loan.
(b) This project provides another example of difficulties of
development banks, particularly in the absence of competent
management and appropriate supervision. A project in
support of a specialized, state-owned institution, largely
influenced by the Government, is likely to fail.
(c) Audits of BBD accounts should have been carried out by
independent external auditors, acceptable to IDA, before
the project was appraised. Such audits would have
highlighted the serious problems that BBD was facing at the
time and could have affected not only the design of the
project but also the feasibility and justification of the
project itself (paras 7.01 - 9.01).

PART I: PROJEC _REVIEW FROM THE BAN' S PERSPECTIVE
1. PROJECT IDENTITY
Name                s Industrial Development Project
Credit Number       : 997-BEN
RVP Unit            : Africa Region
Country             s Benin
Sector             s Industry
2. BACKGROUND
2.01      Benin is a small country of 4 million people with an annual
income per capita of about $340 (1987). The economy's most important
natural resource is its arable land which enables the country to enjoy
overall food sufficiency as well as produce cash crops of which oil palm
and cotton are the most important. A nascent manufacturing sector
producing mainly light consumer manufactures, a vigorous informal trade
sector and a small offshore oil field, with modest known reserves producing
about 6000 barrels per day and with an expected life to run through 1992,
are the other main economic activities.
2.02      The relatively high growth rates in the late 1970s reflected the
favorable evolution of the economic situation in neighboring countries and
the undertaking by the Governmernt of major state projects (Seme Petroleum,
Save Sugar and Onigbolo Cement). This internal and external stability was
also due to strong re-export trade with neighboring Niger and Nigeria,
which were at the time experiencing uranium and oil export-led booms.
However, this situation did not last. In 1982, a severe drought
significantly affected agricultural yields and with the sharp decline of
re-export trade and the closure of the Nigerian market, there were major
delays in the commercial operation of the completed cement and sugar
plants. Investment expenditures in these new public enterprises and
growing outlays on administration became a major drain on the economy,
reducing even further the already insufficient budgetary resources. The
result was a growth rate of below 2 percent in 1983-1984, an overall budget
deficit equivalent to about 10 percent of GDP and an irreversible financial
decline. As the public sector's net position continued to deteriorate and
as the increasing external current imbalance had to be financid largely by
commercial borrowing, the foreign asset position of the banking system
weakened, creating a major liquidity crisis in the country.
2.03      Although the 1982 slump in regional trade explains in part
Benin's difficulties, errors in domestic policy have also had serious
repercussions on the Beninese economy. During the 1975-82 period the
political and philosophical orientation of the Government led to policies
which had a negative impact on the industrial as well as on the financial
sectors. The Government, believed that tighter control over the economy is



- 2 -
more likely to optimize resource allocation, accelerate growth and bring
about social improvements. In its dfforts to gain control over the
surpluses generated by the activities of the modern sector, the Government
nationalized most privately owned industries and added to public ownership
several new ones. The introduction of political and social considerations
in the management of nationalized enterprises led to the deterioration of
performance of even the enterprises which were good performers before
nationalization. Many of the newly created state-owned enterprises ran
into difficulties not only because of poor design, but also from inadequate
managerial capability, undercapitalization and limited market
opportunities. The net result was a decline in the manufacturing sector's
share to GDP, from 6 percent in 1977-1980 to 3 percent in 1985-1987.
2.04      The initiatives of the 1975-1982 period had a devastating effect
on Benin's financial sector. The banks, which had been nationalized in
1975, ended up financing public enterprise expenditures, which would have
been largely financed by the budget. All three banks which made up Benin's
banking system, Banque Commerciale du Benin (BCB), Banque Beninoise de
Dkveloppement (BBD) and Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA), failed
to apply rigorous standerds in appraising credit demands from public
enteirprises. The Government drew down all the deposits it had in the
banking system to finance the deficit and by 1984 it had become a net
debtor to the banks. An estimated CFAF 69 billion in domestic arrears was
accumulated by the end of 1987. 60 percent of BRD1s loans were classified
as bad debts. In the case of BCB, 61 percent of loans outstanding were
non-performing and in the case of CNCA 81 percent. Delays in meeting the
payroll which had started in 1986, worsened in 1988, when civil service
salaries were delayed for as long as three months. By end of 1988, the
proportion of taxes paid in liquid form fell to about 10 percent of all
receipts and Benin had reached a stage of crisis.
2.05        In 1989, an IDA Structural Adjustment Program Credit was
approved to implement economic and financial reforms which reflect a
radical re-orientation of Benin's economic policies in favor of the private
sector. The reforms included the restructuring of the banks as well as
reforms on trade policy and deregulation of markets.
3.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01      Proiect Objectives.  The project had the following objectives:
(a) to initiate a dialogue with the Gov,ernment and the Borrower on
industrial and financial sector issues and policies; (b) to strengthen
BBD's (Banque Beninoise de Developpement) financial structure through the
provision of term foreign exchange resources for financing small and medium
scale enterprises (SMEs); (c) to improve Benin's capacity to identify,
promote and assist small and medium sized industrial ventures; and (d) .o
upgrade BBD's financial management and reporting system as well as its
project monitoring capability. To achieve these objectives, the project
consisted of a Line of Credit US $ 8.6 million and technical assistance in
the amount of $ 1.4 million.



- 3 -
3.02      Proiect Description.  The project included the following
componentst
3.03      (a) The Line of Credit.  US$ 6.8 million of IDA credit proceeds
were to be onlent to BBD to finance economically and financially viable
small-scale and labor intensive investments and medium scale investments.
(i) At least USS 2.6 million was designated to assist in the
financing of small-scale investments, defined as projects
costing less than CFAF 50 million (equivalent to
US$ 240.000 in 1980 exchange rate). BBD would finance 90?
of the investment costs and IDA would refinance 10O of
BBD's subloans which cover the estimated cost net of taxes.
It was estimated that BBD would be able to finance 25 to 30
such investments in the areas of wood and metal working,
food processing, road transport, fisheries tailoring,
repair and maintenance activities. As an incentive for
employment generatior in medium-scale industry, any
enterprise creating employment at an investment cost per
job less than $10,000 would be eligible to the same lending
conditions as small-scale entert r 'es
(ii)   US$ 6.0 million was designated for financing medium-scale
investments defined as projects costing between CFAF 50 and
500 million. BBD would finance 65 percent of the
investment costs of such projects and IDA would finance 100
percent of BBD's subloans which cover the estimated foreign
exchange cost involved. It was expected that BBD would
finance 10 to 15 projects in activities as manufacturing
agricultural tools and implements, vehicle assembly, small
hotels, production of consumer goods, construction
companies etc.
3.04      Maturities would range from 2 to 15 years with an average of 5
years for SSEs and 9 vears for SMEs and interest rates were 8.5? for SSEs
and 112 for SMEs.
3.05      (D)  Technical Assistance to BBD. Institution building was
another major objective of the project. US$ 1.4 million (or 14? of the
total credit) was designated for technical assistance to BBD to improve
BBD's financial management and strengthen its project identification,
promotion and supervision capabilities. This allocation was to finance:
(i) Eighteen man-months of consulting services specialized in banking
operations to help to organize data processing, improve financial reporting
and management ($190,000); (ii) three man-years of an industrial engineer
to strengthen BBD's capabilities in project identification, promotion and
supervision ($380,000). An allocation was made for financing engineering
and feasibility studies to complement this technical assistance ($130,000);
(iii) Two man-years of a training and extension services specialist to
conduct a training program for SME entrepreneurs, organize BBD's in-house
extension service and carry out sector studies. This person would work
closely with the Chamber of Commerce ($365,000); (iv) Ten man-months of
technical assistance to Direction de l'Artisanat to establish a realistic



- 4 -
policy of artisan promotion (6120,000); and (v) Training for BBD staff,
including internal and external seminars ($115,000).
4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.01      Project implementation difficulties surfaced immediately after
the project was approved. Delays in project effectiveness were caused by
delays in Government's fulfilling certain legal requirements, such as the
legal opinion of the 'Cour Centrale Populaire' on the decree ratifying the
IDA Development Credit Agreement and the publication of the decree in the
Official Journal. Once effective, the project started facing other
problems. Disbursements were slower than anticipated because of the
deterioration of the general economic conditions in the country.
Furthermore, BBD was experiencing growing portfolio problems and increasing
a:rears. The magnitude of BED's financial problems, however, only became
known in 1981, when BBD's external auditors refused to certify BBD's
accounts. The auditors found imbalances in customers' accounts, an
unreliable computerized accounting system, and underlined the lack of
comprehensive portfolio analysis.
4.02      BBD's financial position deteriorated throughout project
implementation. Arrears were high, and as early as 1978 represented almost
43 percent of the total portfolio. Provisions were too low and did not
reflect the high level of risk sustained by BBD. Furthermore, there were
major imbalances at- the structure of its financial resources as a result of
the lack of medium and long term resources (except for lines of credit) to
support its term lending activities. Between 1979 and 1983, long and
medium term lending was five to six times greater in volume than term
borrowings. The portfolio problem and maturity imbalances resulted in a
liquidity crisis when public and private deposits started falling. The
Central Bank, given its statutory limits on rediscounting, was unable to
compensate for the substantial drop in resources. In 1984, BBD exceeded
its rediscounting limits and was forced to stop new credit opertions,
except on external lines which continued to disburse slowly. The
Government requested the Bank's support to prepare a restructuring plan,
and credit proceeds supported this effort as outlined below.
4.03      At the request of the Government, the Credit was amended several
times, , to reallocate funds from the line of credit, which was not
disbursing, to the project's technical assistance component to provide the
Government with urgently needed funds to restructure the country's
banking/financial sector. Credit proceeds have been used for a series of
studies and technical assistance tasks aimed at addressing the financial
difficulties of BBD as well as of the banking system as a whole. More
specifically, proceeds iinanced technical assistance to help update the
BBD and BCB accounts and to audit their portfolios, assess the extent of
banking losses and establish a restructuring strategy. It also provided
funds for technical assistance to assist in the search for private partners
for Beninese banks.
4.04      Attracting private operators proved extremely difficult given
the particularly poor state of BBD and the prudence of European banks vis-
a-vis Benin. The foreign banks contacted were reluctant to associate
