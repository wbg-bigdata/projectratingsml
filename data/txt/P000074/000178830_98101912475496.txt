STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE SETTING
1.01      Benin is a 670 km-long and 80 km-wide corridor between Togo and
Nigeria; it is one of the world's poorest countries with an income of US$230
per capita. Its 3.3 million population, which grows at a rate of 2.8% a
year, is mostly rural (86%) and concentrated in the more humid south. A long
history of regional imbalance, ethnic diversity and aggressive kingdoms,
although smothered under fifty years of foreign rule, resulted after indepen-
dence in a tripartite power struggle. After twelve years of factional rivalry
and political unrest, the present military government of Lieutenant-Colonel
M. Kerekou seized power in 1972. Benin has now enjoyed a comparatively long
period of political stability under which a blend of pragmatic nationalism and
socialist philosophy has emerged. A civilian government was recently installed
following the adoption of a new constitution and the election of a National
Assembly in November 1979.
A.   The Economy 1/
1.02      The new government inherited an economy typical of many sub-Sahara
countries with the primary sector--mainly foodcrops and a few cash crops--
contributing 43% to Benin's CFAF 72 billion GDP (at factor costs), industry
and construction accounting for a meager 12% and services for the balance.
Today the picture has not changed much; two-thirds of the total agricultural
output consist of low-value subsistence root crops while palm oil, cotton and
groundnuts remain the country's major export crops. With 33% of GDP, transport
and commerce have become the second most important activities and illustrate
Benin's key transit role with the Port of Cotonou serving both landlocked
Niger and Western Nigeria. The country's embryonic industrial sector (vege-
table oil processing and a few import-substitution industries) has grown more
rapidly in recent years and, with the active construction sector, now accounts
for roughly 14% of a CFAF 148 billion GDP.
1.03      Employment figures reflect the rural orientation of the economy.  Of
the total active population (1.6 million) only 3.5 percent, or 56,000 are urban
wage earners; the rest is engaged in farming, trade or crafts. In 1977, formal
employment was distributed as follows:

Bank report No. 2079-BEN entitled "The Economy of Benin", published May
31, 1979 and the International Monetary Fund staff report entitled

55,900         100.0
Poor qualifications and low salaries characterize the Beninese workforce
which shows a persistent tendency to emigrate. Vocational training is now a
priority: an IDA and UNDP financed vocational training center, the Centre de
Perfectionnement du Personnel d'Entreprises (CPPE) has begun training foremen,
skilled workers, administrative personnel, accountants, secretaries and clerks.
Urban unemployment might be less of a problem in Benin than in many other
African countries because of the narrower gap between urban and rural incomes
and opportunities. Nevertheless, the urban unemployment rate was estimated
at roughly 18% in 1977.
1.04      Economic management has been drastically altered under the new
regime. Anxious to achieve Beninese control over the economy, the new Govern-
ment stepped up state involvement in agriculture and nationalized major
industries and services. Major institutional reforms and poor rainfall
initially resulted in a severe disruption of economic activity and a stagna-
tion of agricultural output and, from 1972 to 1975, real GDP remained constant.
But since 1976, a recovery in agricultural production, a better performance in
the industrial sector and a buoyant activity in trade and construction have
fueled a real growth in GDP of roughly 5% per annum which should continue in
1979 and 1980.
1.05      Since 1972, the Government has also successfully pursued conservative
financial policies. Fed mostly by increasing import tax receipts, its revenues
have grown much faster than the tightly controlled current expenditures and,
despite growing investment spending, each budget since 1975 has generated an
overall surplus of several CFAF billion. Despite a large trade deficit (CFAF 40
billion in 1978), the Government has managed to keep external borrowings to a
minimum: at the end of 1978, the total external debt (including undisbursed
commitments) was estimated at US$260 million and, owing to its concessionary
terms, the debt-service ratio stood at a low 5-6% of exports.
1.06      Prices have also been kept under control and the overall rate of in-
flation (on an implicit GDP deflator basis) has declined from 11% in 1976
to 8.5% in 1977 and 5% in 1978.1/ Thus, inflation in Benin continues to be con-
siderably lower than in neighboring countries, owing to the commercial sector's
vitality and the Government's policies of wage restraint and limited spending.
Should import prices continue to rise and domestic food shortages occur
again, inflation might however be expected to pick up slightly to 6-7% in 1979
1/   IMF staff estimates.



and 1980. The increased economic activity induced by the implementation of new
investments is likely to maintain this trend in the following years and
inflation is forecasted at 8-9% for 1981 and 1982.
1.07      Development Strategy.  Benin's strict economic policies reflect the
strategy implicitly pursued by the Government which wanted to set the stage
for a substantial investment effort in the late 1970's.l/ In 1977, Benin
adopted its first State Economic and Social Development Plan covering three
years, starting in October 1977. The plan's objectives are: (i) to foster
growth by adopting a sizeable investment program heavily concentrated on
agro-industrial, import substitution, and transport projects; (ii) to ensure
independent national direction of the economy through state control of major
enterprises, processing of local production and development of the local
market, and (iii) to involve the people in the formulation and implemen-
tation of national policies. The plan targets an annual growth rate of 18%
(at current prices) and net total investments of CFAF 244 billion. This
investment program, heavily concentrated on capital-intensive industrial
(46%) and transport (22%) projects is overly ambitious. Owing to implemen-
tation delays and administrative bottlenecks, only CFAF 21 billion have been
invested during the Plan's first tranche (1978). Despite an improved perform-
ance in 1979, the Plan's objectives will have to be scaled down. Given the
current limitations on the country's absorptive capacity, investments in all
sectors should be accompanied by a strong institution building effort.
B.   The Artisan and Industrial Sectors
1.08      Description.2/  A limited survey (Annex 3) completed in January 1979
identifies 10,000 master-artisans; as elsewhere in Africa, tailoring (23%),
metal working (16%) and woodworking (13%) are the most important crafts. These
figures are uncertain since earlier data mention 19,000 artisan enterprises
employing about 50,000 workers. An ongoing national population census should
result in better estimates. Data on Benin's manufacturing industry are more
reliable: a 1976 census by the Ministry of Industry identifies 75 industrial
enterprises 3/. Sixty-three of these firms are located in Cotonou, Porto-Novo
and Parakou 4/. Only eight enterprises are state owned; they are heavily geared
IL   Benin's development strategy and prospects are fully described in the
Bank's economic report (op. cit. p. 33 to 47).
2/   The Ministry of Industry distinguishes between artisan enterprises (em-
ploying fewer than 10 workers) and industrial enterprises employing 10
workers or more.
3/   A thorough description of the industrial sector is provided in the Bank's
Bank's economic report (op. cit. Annex B).
4/   Parakou is the main business center in northern Benin.

towards import-substitution and agricultural processing (textiles, beverages
and vegetable oil processing) and account for three quarters of the value
added in the modern industrial sector. Other (mostly private) industries
include food processing (flour and noodles), paint, perfume, vehicle assembly,
wood and metal working, foam manufacturing, mechanical workshops and cashew
nut processing. Despite an annual growth rate of 11% in recent years and a
sizeable investment effort, this sector remains embryonic; it contributes less
than 10% to GDP and employs no more than 6,000 workers. Benin's transit role
to Niger and Nigeria has led to a rapid growth of the road transport industry
which carries 70% of all freight and 90% of all domestic passenger traffic.
Although Government nationalized the two main (foreign) transporters, and
created a national trucking firm (Trans-Benin with 180 trucks) as well as
regional transport companies, 350 small operators (with fewer than four trucks
each) still handle the bulk of the traffic. Altogether, the transport industry
accounts for more than 7% of GDP. Benin's construction industry (building and
civil works) had a turnover of CFAF 5.6 billion in 1978 up from CFAF 2.0
billion in 1970-75; its contribution to GD:P is roughly 4%. Foreign contractors
handle most civil works but construction is in the hands of local firms whose
capacity is constrained by the lack of equ:ipment and capital. Government
established two public construction companies, Societe Nationale de Construc-
tion et de Travaux Publics (SONACOTRAP) in 1976, and Societe Nationale de
Gestion Immobiliere (SONAGItI) in 1978.
Assistance, Promotion and Training
1.09      Under Benin's "loi fondamentale", artisans are invited to form
cooperatives on a voluntary basis, but little has been done to assist them.
Except for some marketing assistance offered by Office National du Tourisme
et de l'Hotellerie (ONATHO) and financial assistance obtained directly from
Banque Beninoise pour le Developpement (BBI)), the artisans have received no
organized support. For some years, DirectiLon de l'Artisanat (a two-man
office) has been advocating the creation of- an overambitious Centre National
de Promotion Artisanale (CNPA) to deliver technical and marketing assis-
tance as well as credit in kind and guarantees to artisans, but there is
no consensus yet in the Government on the nature and functions of the proposed
CNPA.
1.10      The various government agencies dealing with industrial develop-
ment, are poorly equipped to promote small and medium enterprises: "Bureau
Central des Projects", a planning ministry agency in charge of industrial
assistance focuses mostly on large-scale, Government-sponsored projects
included in the plan. The "Direction de l'Industrie et de l'Artisanat"
which has only a regulatory and statistical function, monitors Investment
Code benefits. "Centre de Perfectionnement du Personnel des Entreprises"
(CPPE) provides low level clerical and vocational training (para. 1.03).
Another training center, CEFAP, is training Government and parastatal
employees.



- 5 -
1.11      Two institutions have so far responded to the needs of
entrepreneurs and managers of small- or medium-scale enterprises, although
on a limited scale: the Benin Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI)
and Banque Beninoise pour le Developpement (BBD). The Chamber of
Commerce, chaired by BBD's general manager, is a lively forum for Benin's
business community. With the ad hoc assistance of foreign training institu-
tions, it has recently organized several basic management training sessions
for its members as well as public enterprise managers. It gives informa-
tion on the Beninese environment to potential investors and, through its
recently established "Assistance Technique au Commerce" service, provides
businessmen with basic accounting and managerial assistance. In an effort
to attract businessmen towards industrial activities, the Chamber of Commerce
has also plans to organize an industrial extension service (Assistance a
l'Industrie). It has obtained UNIDO technical assistance to draw the mandate
and the organization of this service. BBD's Department des Etudes et de la
Promotion (DEP) works closely with CCI and is currently the only active in-
dustrial promotional agency; it coordinates with the Ministry of Plan, conducts
sector work, identifies investment opportunities and assists existing clients.
Nevertheless, it seriously lacks engineering and managerial expertise which
would be provided under the proposed project.
1.12      Industrial Policy.  The industrialization of Benin is considered
essential to its development and the Three Year Plan foresees an industrial
growth rate much higher than that for the whole economy. Government has
assigned three objectives to industry: (i) satisfy the immediate needs of the
population, (ii) produce agricultural inputs and (iii) process agricultural
products. To affirm public leadership over the sector, the State has taken
over eight major firms which account for three-fourth of industrial sector sales,
mostly in the cement, textile, oil processing and beverage industries.
Judging from a sample of financial statements 1/, public industrial enter-
prises have fared much better than state agricultural enterprises or commercial
monopolies, with the exception of IBETEX, an ambitious integrated textile
factory which has faced serious management, production, and marketing problems.
The state has been encouraging cooperatives for small-scale enterprises, but
it keeps a pragmatic and positive attitude towards private enterprises in an
effort to direct the strong business community from commerce to industry. The
liberal investment code of 1972 is still effective and provides substantial
incentives to enterprises investing more than CFAF 25 million, including
exemption from import duties on equipment and machinery, reduction of up to
75% in import taxes on raw materials, exemption from the domestic turnover
tax, etc. Incentivers are tailored according to each projetct's merits and
requirements.Aspecial system (Regime D) benefits small Beninese entrepreneurs
investing at least CFAF 10 million and employing more than 10 employees; these
pay no duties on imported equipment and raw materials as well as no turnover
tax for five years. The investment code is not likely to be amended until the
Second Development Plan is adopted (1981); improvements then to be sought

include the abolishment of all export taxes, the elimination of the minimum
investment requirement of CFAF 10 million,, and the listing of all industrial
activities reserved to private initiative. At negotiations, the Beninese
delegation indicated that BBD would keep I[DA informed of proposed changes.
Issues and Prospects
1.13      Obstacles to a better performance of the industrial and artisanal
sectors remain substantial:
(a)  Operating problems.  Artisanal and industrial enterprises
suffer from various operational constraints such as low ca-
pacity utilization, irregular supply of equipment and raw
materials, shortage of skilled labor and poor managerial
practices and administrative constraints.
(b)  Exports markets.  Even though Government emphasis has been
on the development of the local market, most of Benin's
industrial growth in recent: years can be attributed to
exports, as a large share of Benin's industrial output
probably finds its way into Nigeria. This dependence on one
market may be risky in light of Nigeria's attempt to curtail
imports. The creation of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of
West African States), a regional common market which includes
both Benin and Nigeria, is the ultimate solution; meanwhile,
the authorities have associated Nigeria to Beninese large-
scale export-oriented projects such as the Onigbolo cement
plant or the Save sugar complex. They have also left
maximum flexibility to industry, which, after a temporary
inventory build-up, has increased its marketing efforts
and overcome its difficulties.
(c)  Investment climate.  The easrly nationalization carried out
by the new regime had a deterring effect on private foreign
and Beninese investments despite an adequate and timely
compensation. Presently, Government attitude towards
industrial entrepreneurship is far more tolerant than the
official reference to Marxism-Leninism would suggest. There
is no guarantee that this pragmatic attitude will prevail in
the long run, but recent economic and political developments
indicate the regime is becoming more liberal.
1.14      Prospects.  Benin's favorable location on several transit routes,
its proximity to the large Nigerian market and its low wage structure
offer reasonable prospects for industrial development. Given the limited
domestic market and shortage of trained personnel, future large-scale
projects 1/ will need to be export-oriented and require substantial foreign
technical assistance. Small-scale industries could be active in import
1/   Such as the Onigbolo cement plant, the Save sugar complex, the
extension of the Ibetex textile mill, and the Seme oil field.

substitution of simple consumer goods and eauipment such as furniture
making, metal working, housing construction, food processing, equipment
assembly, repair and maintenance, etc. The rate of growth for the sector
is projected at 12% (in real terms) by the Bank and the sector's contribu-
tion to GDP is expected to reach 16% in 1985. Such a performance is
however subject to the availability of term credit through the banking
system, provision of support services and adequate entreprei.turship for
small and medium-industrial investments. The proposed project would in part
address these prerequisites to industrial development. Despite forecasted
slow growth 1/, the artisan sector's contribution to the economy will remain
important in terms of urban employment. The Government has yet to adopt a
policy regarding the role of the artisan sector, and to decide which
channels should be used to deliver assistance to artisans. The proposals
under consideration are still vague, unsubstantiated and apparently not
viable. It would, therefore, be premature at this point to finance a
full-fledged program of assistance to artisans, but useful technical
assistance would be given under the proposed project through BBD to Direc-
tion de l'Artisanat for the formulation of an overall policy framework and
the design of an artisan component which could eventually be financed under
a follow-up project. In the meantime, all existing artisan subprojects
(including worker-owned cooperatives) would be eligible for BBD assistance
and IDA refinancing under this project.
C.   The Financial Sector
1.15      As a member of the West African Monetary Union (UMOA), Benin
shares a common currency (CFAF), Central Bank (BCEAO) and credit and
monetary policies with Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Upper Volta.
Through its regional offices, BCEAO supervises all financial institutions
within the Union. Under its operating guidelines, it controls money supply
and credit expansion by setting country credit ceilings and global refinan-
cing allocations. It provides liquidity to the Banking system by rediscount-
ing short- and medium-term loans of up to ten years and reviews all bank loan
applications above CFAF 30 million under its prior approval mechanism. (At
present, an estimated 85-90% of credit to the economy in Benin is subject to
prior approval). Since 1976, the Central Bank has also decided to apply, in
all member countries a formalized sectoral credit policy directing funds
towards priority sectors, which has yet to be fully implemented. Finally,
to improve the use of liquid funds within each country and the Union, BCEAO
operates a money market for daily operations between the commercial banks and
the Central Bank.
1.16      The Banking System.  Entirely state-owned, the banking system
comprises three highly specialized banks. Banque Commerciale du Benin
(BCB), specialized in commercial banking operations, resulted from the
merger of three previously French-owned commercial banks. With total
assets of CFAF 58 billion (1977), 15 branches, 80% of total loans and 75%
1/   Bank Economic Report op. cit. p. 92.

of total deposits, it is Benin's biggest bank. Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA) was established by the Government in 1976 as the apex
organization for regional and local agricultural savings and loans institu-
tions: as of 1977, it had total assets of CFAF 2.9 billion. CNCA partici-
pates with the other two banks in seasonal crop financing, and invests in
rural development projects. Banque Beninoise pour le Developpement
(BBD) is the country's main term-lending iinstitution. As of 1978, it had
total assets of CFAF 15 billion. Other financial intermediaries that perform
some banking functions include the Treasury, the postal checking system (CCP)
and the Caisse Nationale d'Epargne (CNE).
1.17      Credit Distribution.  As of June 1978, registered loans 1/ (excluding
direct external bilateral loans) represented 80% of total credit outstanding
in the economy (CFAF 43 billion) as follows:
Loans:               Short-Term        Medium-Term      Long-Term           Total

Commerce and services were holding half of' short-term credit; industry was
using only 23% of short-term credit but it received 37% of all medium-term
loans. At the same time, Central Bank refinancing of term loans amounted
to more than 75% as against 18% of short-term loans, reflecting a high
level of sight deposits and a scarcity of alternative term resources.
Credits to the private sector represented 36% of medium-term loans and
almost 40% of total lending.
1.18      Interest Rates.  Benin has, until now, practiced a policy of low
interest rates. Thus, preferential loans (government, housing, crop financing
and small-scale enterprises 2/) command an average interest rate of 7% whereas
BCEAO authorizes a maximum of 8.5% based on a preferential discount rate of
5.5%. Other loans command an average rate of 9.5% whereas BCEAO authorizes a

maximum of 13% based on a normal discount rate of 8%. Under the proposed
project, BBD has agreed to increase its interest rate to small-scale enter-
prises to 8.5% and to other enterprises to 11%, a 1.5% increase over its
existing interest rate structure (Annex 5).
1.19      Issues.  The banking system has overcome most difficulties result-
ing from the 1974 nationalization and reorganization.  BCB has not fully
resolved its data processing and accounting difficulties; CNCA is developing
its agricultural lending and actively training personnel to staff its local
offices; and BBD has swiftly changed its role from that of a social bank 1/ to
that of a full-fledged development bank.  The banking system is nevertheless
likely to face a term resource constraint: at present, loans by the banking
system to the economy are almost entirely covered by Central Bank refinancing
(29%), Government surpluses (12%) and public or private deposits (57%). As
the country is now embarking on a substantial development program led by
the public sector, Government surpluses and parastatal deposits will in
part be withdrawn to finance new investments and purchase equipment abroad.
Furthermore, if the Government draws on the Central Bank up to its statutory
limit (20% of the preceding year's tax revenues), the amount of refinancing
available within BCEAO guidelines to the banking system will be curtailed.
To alleviate the shortage of resources banks are likely to experience, the
following actions need to be envisaged: (i) the equity of financial institu-
tions should be substantially strengthened and (ii) the banks should actively
search for alternative term resources to compensate for tighter access to
Central Bank refinancing. This is especially critical for BBD, Benin's bank
specialized in term lending. The proposed line of credit for small- and
medium-industrial projects would provide BBD an alternative source for the
funds it needs to fulfill its developmental role.
II. BANQUE BENINOISE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT
A.   The Institution
2.01      Description.  Following three intervening name changes and
mandate amendments since its establishment in 1954, BBD finally became, in
1975, Benin's specialized term-financing bank for all economic and social
development projects. It has a share capital of CFAF I billion, 100% state
owned. BBD mostly grants medium- and long-term loans, occasionally with
equity participation, to all sectors of the economy whether public or
private. It also participates in seasonal crop financing and maintains
checking accounts for its term clients whom it also assists in short-term
lending. BBD's short-term lending to the purely commercial sector is
limited to assisting small traders in amounts below CFAF 2 million. BBD
receives deposits (mainly short-term) from its clients and constructs
low-cost housing both for sale and rental.
2.02      Board and Management.  BBD's fifteen-member board is chaired by
the Minister of Finance. In addition, it includes six directors represent-
ing other government ministries, five representing BBD's personnel,
the head of BCEAO's national branch, a representative of the National Revo-
lutionary Council and a state inspector (Commissaire du Gouvernement).
1/ A multipurpose bank providing mostly housing loans, consumer credit and
small trade loans.



- 10 *-
BBD's general manager holds several key positions within the Government and
the party including that of financial advisor to the President of the Republic;
as President of the Benin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he is in close
contact with the business community. Under his leadership, BBD has shown an
impressive growth and stands out as a weLl-managed, well-staffed and fairly
profitable institution. The General Manager has obtained a broad delegation
of authority from the Board, including credit approval of up to CFAF 100
million for industrial loans and 50 million for commercial and SSE loans.
2.03      Organization and Staffing.  Under BBD's manager and his deputy,
five departments look over project promotiLon and supervision (Departement
des Etudes et de la Promotion--DEP), credit dossiers (Departement du Credit
et des Investissements--DCI), accounting and finance (Departement des Opera-
tions Financieres et Comptables--DOFIC), administration (Departement Admini-
stratif) and legal matters (Departement Juridique--DJ).  BBD has a staff of
113 of which 18 hold supervisory positions: all supervisors are university
graduates and eight also followed CCCE's dLevelopment banking course.   All
issues ranging from credit approvals to strategy making are discussed internal-
ly before decisions are taken. Communication between the various departments
is good, although somewhat cumbersome.
2.04      There are nevertheless some organizational weaknesses:  BBD's
Department des Etudes et de la Promotion (DEP), which is in charge of
implementing BBD's perceived role of promcoting and assisting industries,
though headed by a highly motivated and able Beninese, is clearly under-
staffed. DEP badly needs the services of an experienced industrial engineer
with managerial experience to assist in identifying, promoting and supervising
industrial investment projects. To fulfill its promotional role vis-a-vis
Beninese entrepreneurs, DEP--in liaison with the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry--would also require expertise in preparing and implementing
training and promotion programs in favor of Beninese businessmen and
artisans interested in setting up SMEs. Due to the unavailability of local
personnel experienced in these fields, outside technical assistance will be
provided under the project. In addition, BBD has been encountering
some difficulties keeping its accounts up to date and optimizing its
liquidity management. Its financial department (DOFIC), although staffed
with dedicated and competent personnel, needs to be upgraded. A review by
a firm of experienced external consultants of this department's functions
and procedures and implementation of warranted improvements will be performed
under the project. Specifically, this review would include (i) defining
guidelines regarding the bank's financial structure (sources and uses of
funds); (ii) improving BBD's financial reporting system, (iii) establishing
a financial forecasting system; (iv) strengthening the organization and
procedures of the section in charge of liquidity management, and (v)
reviewing the interface with the Government's computer processing BBD's
accounts.
2.05      Policies.  A "reglement interieur" carefully defines BBD's
policies and operating guidelines. To fulfill its development mandate, BBD
is authorized to grant loans (essentially long-and medium-term), take
equity participations, offer its guarantee, collect deposits and manage



- 11 -
special funds. Retroactive financing requires a special decision of the
credit committee. Each equity participation is limited to 25% of a company's
share capital and their total cannot exceed BBD's unimpaired capital and
reserves. BBD's exposure is limited to 90% of total project cost for Beninese
SMEs, 65% for industrial enterprises and 50% for other projects. There is
however, no limit placed on individual loans in relation to bAD's equity. BBD
has now agreed to limit its exposure in any loan and/or equity investment to
25% of its capital and unimpaired reserves. Although its reglement interieur
is quite thorough, IDA has suggested several amendments, which have been
agreed at negotiations (Annex 13).  Interest rates are in line with BCEAO
guidelines: on short- and medium-term loans, they now range from 6.5 to 8.0%
for indigenous SSEs (with an average of 7%), from 9.0 to 11.0% for other
industries(with an average of 9.5%) and from 9.5 to 12.0% for trade and
services. Deposit rates range from 2.5 to 6.5% 1/ depending on the term and
amount of deposit.
2.06      Procedures.  BBD's procedures are generally efficient:  a sample
of project files was reviewed and found satisfactory. Appraisals cover most
aspects of project evaluation and, following the Bank's identification
mission of November 1978, now include economic rates of return calculations
and monitoring of employment creation. More attention should however be
given to market analysis. Supervision of problem projects is good but it
should be generalized to all projects. Loan collection procedures are well
established and efficient.
2.07      Auditing.  BBD's accounts are currently reviewed by a commissaire
aux comptes whose investigations, consistent with the practice in the region,
are only superficial. Although competent, the commissaire aux comptes is not
familiar with the long form audit as required by IDA. Under this project,
BBD's audits would be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA.
2.08      Foreign Exchange Risk.  BBD has in the past, carried the foreign
exchange risk on foreign borrowings. So far, the exposure has been minimal
since half of the CFAF two billion borrowed is denominated in French Francs
(which has a fixed parity vis-a-vis the CFAP) and the other half in US$ (which
has depreciated vis-a-vis the CFAF). Although the large spread obtained on
these borrowings (6 to 8%) should be adequate to protect BBD against exchange
risks, BBD agreed at negotiations to set aside, each year, 2% of the outstand-
ing amount on these borrowings as a special provision for exchange losses. In
addition BBD would avoid assuming any exchange risk on its future borrowings.
B.   Operations and Finance
2.09      Portfolio.  Sustained by a spectacular increase in its term
lending, BBD's total portfolio has almost tripled over the last three years
from CFAF 4.1 billion in 1974/75 to CFAF 11.8 billion in 1977/78. It is
broken down as follows:

BBD's term portfolio of CFAF 8.8 billion as of September 30, 1978 includes
148 equipment loans 1/ (CFAF 6.5 billion), 1,442 housing loans (CFAF 1.9
billion), about 30 agricultural loans (CFA.F 0.1 billion) and some doubtful
loans (CFAF 0.3 billion or 3.6% of the term portfolio).  Its short-term
portfolio of CFAF 3 billion--including doubtful loans of CFAF 1.1 billion
2/ -- consists of roughly 800 commercial loans (CFAF 2.0 billion) and more
than 1,000 miscellaneous vehicle and social loans for the balance. Approxi-
mately 80% of BBD's outstanding loans (short-and long-term) are to public
or mixed enterprises and regional or local authorities and therefore
guaranteed by the Government.
2.10      Operations.  The structure of BBD's portfolio--a few large
equipment loans next to a multitude of small social loans--is a reflection
of the transition BBD has undergone since 1975, from a multipurpose social
bank to a full-fledged development bank. Prior to the 1975 specialization
of the banking system, two thirds of BBD's lending consisted of short- and
medium-term credits for commercial and social purposes; development lending
was limited except in agriculture. Changes have been substantial: first,
total approvals increased from CFAF 2.5 billion in 1974 to CFAF 6.5 billion
in 1977. Approvals declined somewhat in 1978 to CFAF 6.0 billion and are
likely to decline again in 1979, but BBD explains this drop by processing
delays on some pending large-scale projects. Second, the share of commer-
cial lending declined markedly to 24% of approvals in 1977, while the share
of equipment lending increased from 23% in 1974 to 71% in 1977 and 64% in
1978. Third, the term structure also changed, and whereas term loans
represented only 34% of total approvals in 1974, they accounted for 80% of
total approvals in 1978.  Fourth, following the establishment of CNCA,
agricultural credits decreased rapidly except for syndicated crop financing.
Fifth, after it took over a French-owned vehicle finance company in 1973,
BBD expanded its car and truck financing operations to reach CFAF 980
million in 1976. Lack of experience in the financing of second-hand
vehicles led to severe collection difficulties and BBD has now suspended
this type of operation. Finally, BBD has so far taken few equity participa-
tions; its portfolio of CFAF 132 million represent minority participations
in nine enterprises including two banks, two state enterprises and five
private businesses.
1/   BBD's equipment loans generally finance fixed assets for the manu-
facturing, transport and agro-industrial sectors.
2/   Most of which to the IBETEX textile complex, and the balance for
truck and car loans.



- 13 -
2.11      Arrears.  Reported arrears on BBD's portfolio amount to about
CFAF 1.0 billion, approximately half of which are in arrears of over one
year. The portfolio affected by arrears of close to CFAF 5 billion repre-
sents almost 43% of the total portfolio; most of these are however technical
arrears resulting from implementation delays of larger projects which do not
ultimately a-fect BBD's clients' ability to repay. Since a large part of the
affected portfolio is for state-owned and guaranteed projects which have been
repaying BBD, although with some delays, BBD's estimate of doubtful loans
(CFAF 1.4 billion or 12% of BBD's total portfolio) is considered adequate.
Actual losses which BBD could eventually suffer on its doubtful portfolio
would in practice be much lower since special laws enacted in favor of BBD
gives it the same collection privileges as the state. Provisions for bad
and doubtful loans amount to CFAF 0.6 billion or about 5% of BBD's port-
folio and 60% of the actual amount of arrears. In view of BBD's collection
privileges and the securities on its loans, the level of provisions appears
adequate. There is nevertheless room to improve BBD's monitoring of
arrears and a plan to reduce arrears to 25% of the outstanding portfolio
before year-end 1981 has been agreed at negotiations.
2.12      Financial Position.  As of September 1978, BBD's balance sheet
(Annex 11) totalled CFAF 15 billion.l/ Term sources and uses of funds were
as follows:
SOURCES       (CFAF billion)            USES           (CFAF billion)
Equity                        1.5         Fixed and other assets          2.1
Long-term borrowings          1.6         Long-term loans
& Investments                 3.7
Medium-term loans              4.9
Medium-term borrowings &                  Less Provisions                (0.6)

12.8
Term resource gap            4.3
BBD's term borrowings have not kept pace with the rapid growth of its
lending activity. As a result, BBD's term resources of CFAF 9.4 billion
(including equity) barely cover BBD's total fixed assets, term loans and
doubtful debts (CFAF 10.1 billion). With outstanding commitments and
approvals of CFAF 7.0 billion, BBD's resource position is bound to deteriorate
further. The difficulty would not come from the Central Bank regulation
limiting its refinancing to 35% of BBD's portfolio, since most outstanding

in the 35% ceiling. It would rather come from the countrywide target for

Central Bank refinance 1/. BBD is therefore trying to decrease its depen-
dence on BCEAO and locate alternative sources of term finance. It has
already succeeded in mobilizing new deposits of approximately CFAF 1.5
billion and obtaining a CFAF 0.9 billion loan from the OPEC special fund2/.
Another step in the right direction would be for BBD to increase its capital
by at least CFAF 500 million before December 31, 1980. This was agreed
to during negotiations. To further strengthen its financial structure, BBD
has agreed, under this project, to amend its "reglement interieur" to include
(i) an exposure limit relating its exposure in any single enterprise to 25% of
its equity, and (ii) a debt/equity ratio cf 5:1 relating its term debt obliga-
tions to its unimpaired capital and reserve; more generally, it will attempt
to better match the maturity of its resources with that of its lending. Since
the application of an exposure limit would prove difficult to implement in
practice as BBD is the sole term financier of all industrial projects, this
limitation would not apply to large-scale projects guaranteed by the Govern-
ment or international/regional fund of good standing.
2.13      Performance.  BBD's income statement (Annex 10) shows that its
financial performance to date has been satisfactory with earnings before
taxes rising steadily from CFAF 63 million in 1975 to CFAF 147 million in
1978. Administrative expenses have been maintained at a reasonable level
and their share of average total assets has declined from 2.0% to 1.2% in
1978. As BBD increases its onlending rates closer to the maximum allowed by
BCEAO, it will increase its profitability. This would give BBD the resources
it needs to strengthen its development functions (training, SME promotion and
assistance, engineering expertise, funding and management of a possible
participation and guarantee mechanism, etc.).
C.   Prospects and Issues
2.14      Prospects.  BBD's strategy for the future is not only to continue
its current role as the main source of term financing for all clients,
public and private, outside the agriculture sector, but also to intensify
its promotional, appraisal and supervisory services to small- and medium-
scale industries. BBD currently has a pipeline of CFAF 7 billion for the next
three years. Projects under consideration include bakeries, ice-making,
packaging, textile, food processing, charcoal making, transport, metal work-
ing, etc. BBD's pipeline, lending program and past performance show that its
financing of small and medium industrial projects could easily reach US$15
million over the next four years if its project preparation capability is
rapidly upgraded.
1/   "Maximum d'intervention de la Banque Centrale".
2/   The OPEC loan of US$4.5 million is on-lent by the Government to BBD
for 16 years (including 4 years of grace) at a rate of 2%. Twenty
percent of the interest received from subloans accrue to BBD and the
remaining spread is credited to a special account to finance SME-related
technical assistance, promotion and studies. Intended beneficiaries
include artisans and SME, and conditions to final borrowers will be
similar to those under the IDA credit. The OPEC loan will be adminis-
tered by IDA in conjunction with this project.

2.15      Financial Requirements.  The financial forecasts for the years
1979 to 1984 (Annexes 8 to 12) are based on conservative estimates of BBD's
prospects for expanding its equiipment lending (60% of total approvals) and
the likely growth of commercial lending (including syndicated crop financing),
housing finance and others (40% of total approvals). Under these conditions,
BBD would need an estimated CFAF 12.8 billion during the period 1979-1984.
These requirements would be met as follows:
CFAF billions
Cash flow from operations                         1.2
Capital increase                                  0.5

2/   Caisse Centrale, Algerian Development Bank and Conseil de l'Entente
(USAID).
3/   Including Central Bank Rediscount and OPEC loan.
This table shows that BBD would be in a position to mobilize enough resources
to finance its activities. Should the projected increase in deposits not be
as large as projected, BBD would need to increase its recourse to other
borrowings. BBD's projected financial ratios show that the bank's financial
position would remain sound throughout the period; the term-debt/equity ratio
would remain below 5:1 and the total debt/equity ratio would stay around 8:1
which is adequate. Profitability would remain stable relative to net worth
because the forecasted increase in average interest rate from 8.2% in 1978 to
9.5% in 1981 would be gradually matched by increasing administrative and
financial expenses.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Conception and Objectives
3.01      On March 10, 1978, the Minister of Plan officially requested
Bank Group support for BBD. An identification mission visited Benin from
October 31 to November 8, 1978; it concluded (i) that there was a need in
Benin for alternative sources of long-term foreign exchange resources to
finance productive investments in the SME sector, and (ii) that, subject to



- 16 -
improvements in its financial management and promotional role, BBD could
become an excellent channel of Bank Group assistance to Benin. The project
was appraised in the field from April 8 to 20, 1979.
3.02      The contribution of industry to economic growth is still minimal.
Yet, under the current plan, a major investment effort is underway, in which
BBD is playing a major role. Timely IDA support to this institution would
benefit the whole economy. The proposed project would therefore pursue the
following objectives:
a.   Initiate a dialogue with the Government and the borrower on
major industrial and financial sector issues and policies (export strategy,
employment creation, artisans' role, investment code,etc.)
b.   Strengthen BBD's financial structure by providing it the term
foreign exchange resources it needs to finance SME projects up to 1983.
c.   Improve Benin's capacity to identify, promote and assist small-
and medium-size industrial ventures.
d.   Upgrade BBD's financial management and reporting system as well
as its subproject promotion and monitoring capability.
To achieve these objectives, the project will be supported by a US$10 million
IDA credit to provide (i) a line of credit (US$8.6 million) to BBD for the
financing of small- and medium-scale industrial projects and (ii) technical
assistance to BBD, the Chamber of Commerce and the Direction de l'Artisanat
(US$1.4 million).
B.   Project Description
3.03      The Line of Credit.  US$8.6 million of the IDA credit proceeds
would be onlent to BBD as a line of credit to finance economically and
financially sound investments in the following areas:
a.   Small-Scale and Labor Intensive Investments.  At least US$2.6
million of the line of credit (30%) would benefit small-scale investments
defined as projects costing less than CFAF 50 million. BBD would be
authorized to finance 90% of the investment cost (CFAF 45 million) of such
projects; IDA would refinance 100% of BBD's loans which cover the estimated
cost net of taxes of such projects. BBD would be expected to finance about 25
to 30 investments in the typical areas of wood and metal working, food
processing, road transport, fisheries, tailoring, repair and maintenance
activities. Artisanal enterprises would also be eligible for financing under
this component.  Moreover, as an incentive for employment generation in
medium-scale industry, any industrial project creating employment at a cost
per job inferior to US$10,000 would be eligible for a loan (and IDA refinanc-
ing) at conditions similar to those in favor of small-scale enterprises.
b.   Medium-scale Investments.  Up to US$6.0 million of the line of
credit would benefit medium-scale investments defined as projects costing
between CFAF 50 and 500 million. BBD would be expected to finance up to 65%
of the investment cost of such projects (CFAF 325 million). IDA would

October 31 to November 8, 1978; it concluded (i) that there was a need in

- 16 -
improvements in its financial management and promotional role, BBD could
become an excellent channel of Bank Group assistance to Benin. The project
was appraised in the field from April 8 to 20, 1979.
3.02      The contribution of industry to economic growth is still minimal.
Yet, under the current plan, a major investment effort is underway, in which
BBD is playing a major role. Timely IDA support to this institution would
benefit the whole economy. The proposed project would therefore pursue the
following objectives:
a.   Initiate a dialogue with the Government and the borrower on
major industrial and financial sector issues and policies (export strategy,
employment creation, artisans' role, investment code,etc.)
b.   Strengthen BBD's financial structure by providing it the term

c.   Improve Benin's capacity to identify, promote and assist small-
and medium-size industrial ventures.
d.   Upgrade BBD's financial management and reporting system as well
as its subproject promotion and monitoring capability.
To achieve these objectives, the project will be supported by a US$10 million
IDA credit to provide (i) a line of credit: (US$8.6 million) to BBD for the
financing of small- and medium-scale industrial projects and (ii) technical
assistance to BBD, the Chamber of Commerce and the Direction de l'Artisanat
(US$1.4 million).
B.   Project Description
3.03      The Line of Credit.  US$8.6 million of the IDA credit proceeds
would be onlent to BBD as a line of credit to finance economically and
financially sound investments in the following areas:
a.   Small-Scale and Labor Intensive Investments.  At least US$2.6
million of the line of credit (30%) would benefit small-scale investments
defined as projects costing less than CFAF 50 million. BBD would be
authorized to finance 90% of the investment cost (CFAF 45 million) of such
projects; IDA would refinance 100% of BBD's loans which cover the estimated
cost net of taxes of such projects. BBD would be expected to finance about 25
to 30 investments in the typical areas of wood and metal working, food
processing, road transport, fisheries, tailoring, repair and maintenance
activities. Artisanal enterprises would also be eligible for financing under
this component.  Moreover, as an incentive for employment generation in
medium-scale industry, any industrial project creating employment at a cost
per job inferior to US$10,000 would be eligible for a loan (and IDA refinanc-
ing) at conditions similar to those in favor of small-scale enterprises.
b.   Medium-scale Investments.  Up to US$6.0 million of the line of
credit would benefit medium-scale investments defined as projects costing
between CFAF 50 and 500 million. BBD would be expected to finance up to 65%
of the investment cost of such projects (CFAF 325 million). IDA would



- 17 -
refinance 100% of BBD's subloans which cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost of such projects. Under this component, BBD would finance 10 to 15
projects in a wide range of activities such as manufacturing of agricultural
tools and implements, vehicle assembly, small hotel projects, production of
consumer goods, construction companies, etc.
3.04      On-lending terms:  The line of credit would be onlent by the
Government to BBD at 8% for eighteen years including five years of grace. BBD
would be charged a commitment fee of 0.75% on the undisbursed balance and
repayment would be on a fixed amortization schedule of equal, semi-annual
payments of principal and interest.  A fixed amortization schedule is justi-
fied to provide BBD with increased local resources (roll-over of funds) and to
ease the administrative burden of frequent schedule readjustments. Because
small and medium-scale subborrowers are not in a position to deal effectively
with the foreign exchange risk, it would be borne by the Government without an
additional fee.
3.05      Terms and Conditions proposed for all subloans financed under the
line of credit are as follows:
a.   Maturities would range from 2 to 15 years.  Averages are
expected to be about five years for SSE investments and nine years for
medium-scale investments. The grace period on principal repayment could
reach up to five years, but would rarely exceed three years.
b.   The interest rate on medium-scale subloans would be 11% per
annum. This rate represents a 1.5% increase above BBD's current average rate.
It would yield a positive return given the low inflation rate (para. 1.05) and
would give BBD an adequate spread to cover its overheads. Subborrowers would
also be charged a commitment fee (0.75% of the undisbursed balance). The rate
charged on small-scale and labor-intensive subprojects would be 8.5% per
annum, in line with BCEAO's preferential rate (para. 1.19). To ensure BBD an
adequate and consistent spread, the Government has agreed on an interest
subsidy equal to the interest lost by BBD on its small-scale and labor-
intensive lending (2.5%).
c.   A free limit of US$150,000 for individual subloans and an
aggregate free limit of US$2,000,000 would be established. However, since
this is IDA's first operation with BBD, the first three subprojects below
the free limit would be reviewed by IDA.
d.   BBD would limit its term borrowings to five times its
unimpaired capital and reserves. Its exposure in a single project would be
limited to 25% of its equity.
e.   For all subprojects, BBD would calculate the investment cost
per job, the internal financial rate of return and the the economic rate of
return. During negotiations, BBD agreed that all subprojects financed
under the line of credit would (i) have, in principle, a minimum Economic Rate
of Return of 10%; (ii) encourage employment creation; and (iii) give due
consideration to the use of appropriate technology.

3.06      Development Impact.  With the proceeds of this line of credit,
BBD is expected to assist 45 industrial investments over the next three
years. Permanent employment created could reach 900, at an average cost of
US$7,100 per job for the small-scale/labor intensive component and US$19,500
for the medium-scale component. The following table shows the financing
plan which could be expected for subprojects based on BBD's past experience,
its present pipeline and proposed lending patterns.

3.07      Technical Assistance Program.  Institution building is a major
aspect of this first IDF project in Benin which includes a US$1.4 million
technical assistance component (14% of the total IDA credit)l/.  This compo-
nent aims at improving BBD's financial management and strengthen its project
identification, promotion and supervision capabilities. It includes the
following:
a.   Eighteen man-months of consultant services specialized in bank
organization to help BBD's Department des Operations Financieres et
Comptables (DOFIC) resolve accounting delays, organize its data processing
capability, and improve financial reporting and management (para 2.04). A
diagnosis of DOFIC's functions has already been performed with external
assistance.
b.   Three man-years of an industrial engineer experienced in business
administration to strengthen the project identification, promotion and
supervision capabilities of BBD's Departement des Etudes et de Promotion
(DEP). BBD, one of the rare sources of business expertise in Benin, has
often been approached by Beninese businessmen willing to invest in small or
medium industrial project. DEP, which is torn between its numerous and
varied tasks cannot at this point offer more than a list of investment
opportunities. It needs the assistance of an industrial engineer to
identify investment opportunities, shape ul) investment proposals, review

external feasibilitv studies and technically assist promoters during the
different phases of their projects' conception and implementation. The
candidate to be recruited should be both technically competent and business
oriented. BBD is in the process of recruiting a qualified Beninese engineer
as a counterpart to the advisor. An allocation of US$130,000 would complement
this techni.cal assistance by the provision of engineering and feasibility
studies for projects promoted by BBD,
c.  Two man-years of a training and extension services specialist
with a good background in economics and previous field experience to design
and conduct a training program for SME entrepreneurs, organize BBD's in-house
etension service and carry out sector studies.  Although placed under BBD, he
would work closely with the Chamber of Commerce which is in close contact with
the business community. In addition, BBD would carry out--jointly with the
Chamber of Commerce--training programs for SME entrepreneurs. US$145,000
would finance the cost of 4-5 training sessions to be conducted from 1980 to
1982.
d.   The provision of ten man-months of technical assistance to Direction
de I'Artisanat to shape up a realistic policy of artisan promotion in liaison
with BBD's DEP. To simplify project implementation, this component would also
be administered by BBD. The purpose of this assistance would be in a first
phase to acquire sector knowledge, in a second phase to advise on policies
related to artisans, and in a third or final phase, to design a limited,
practical and cost-effective artisan project component proposal. This assist-
ance would be spread over two to three years.
e.   An allocation of US$115,000 for the training of BBD's staff to
finance the cost of in-house seminars organized by external training insti-
tutions, or of tuition and expenditures for training sessions abroad (courses
and internships), IDA would review the curriculum of such courses.
3.08      Project Preparation Facility (PPF).  A PPF advance of US$320,000 has
been granted on December 11, 1979 to ensure an early start of the technical
assistance program. It covers (i) the initial consulting services identified
under para 3.07 (a) above, (ii) the recruitment, settlement, and salary for
the first six months of the industrial engineer and the training expert and
(:ii) the cost of ad hoc feasibility and engineering studies.
C,  Project Costs and Financing
3,09      The project will cost US$12.3 million net of taxes of which US$9.1
million in foreign exchange. Taxes are estimated at US$1.3 million. The
proposed !DA credit of US$10 million would therefore represent 81% of total
project cost net of taxes. It would finance 100% of total foreign expendi-
b.ures, In addition, it would cover US$0.9 million of local expenditures (7%
of total project cost net of taxes) under the small-scale/labor-intensive and
technical assistance components, in line with IDA's policy of promoting SME
entrepreneurship.
3.10      Project costs and the proposed financing plan are summarized in
the following tables:

D.   Project Implementation
3.11      The project will be carried out by Banque Beninoise pour le Deve-
loppement which will also liaise with the Chamber of Commerce (to train
entrepreneurs) and Direction de l'Artisanat (to formulate an artisan policy).
3.12      Monitoring.  BBD would be required to submit to IDA semi-annual
operational and financial reports covering, usual DFC information. These
include financial statements, arrears and resource positions, operations
(approval, commitments, disbursements), an,nual reports and audits. In
addition, BBD would furnish information on staff training, and its coordina-
tion with other project related organizations (Ministry of Industry, BCP
and the Chamber of Commerce). Data on the economic characteristics of firms
financed under the project will be collected by BBD during subproject apprai-
sal and follow-up.  They will be used to keep the Subproject Data System
up to date.
3.13      Consultants.  IDA will approve the qualifications, terms and condi-
tions of advisors and short-term consultants financed under the project.
Provision has been made to finance five man-years of advisors and 22 man-
months of short-term consultant estimated at an average foreign exchange cost
of US$8,750 per man-month, plus US$1,600 (net of taxes) per man-month for
local expenditures and subsistence.
3.14      Procurement. BBD is expected to follow usual DFC procurement proce-
dures which would be adequate to ensure that goods and services are suitable
and reasonably priced.
3.15      Disbursement.  Disbursement would be made on the following basis:
(1) Line of credit: 100% of BBD's subloans;
(2) Technical assistance, consulting services, and training expenses:
100% of expenditures;
Disbursements under all categories would be fully documented. However,
for subloans below the free-limit, IDA could, if satisfied with BBD's perfor-
mance following normal disbursement procedures, allow disbursements against
certificates of expenditure, the documentation of which to be retained by BBD
and inspected during supervision missions. Annex 14 gives the estimated
disbursement schedule for the project.
E.   Benefits and Justification
3.16      The project is expected to generate the following benefits to Benin:



a.   Productive Investments.  The project will result in the implementa-
tion of about 45 financially and economically viable subprojects,
representing an investment of US$12.1 million in industrial invest-
ments. By supporting investments in diverse activities, the
project will contribute to the reduction of the country's dependence
on agricultural production.
b.   Employment Creation.  The line of credit is expected to create
about 900 permanent jobs at an average cost per job of US$7,200
for SSE/labor-intensive investments and US$19,500 for medium-
scale industrial investments.
C.   Institution Building.  The institutional improvements in BBD
to be achieved under the project such as better trained staff,
improved organization and control, better financial management,
as well as active promotion and supervision of projects will
increase BBD's overall efficiency and the quality of its invest-
ments.
d.   SME Assistance.  By making credit and technical assistance
available to SME, the project will provide the first organized
attempt in Benin to upgrade local artisans and entrepreneurs
thereby contributing to increased productivity and improved
technical and management skills.
3.17      Risks.  The small size of the Beninese economy, the uncertainties
surrounding the Nigerian market, the centralized management of the economy
and the lack of skilled labor may not be conducive to investment and there
is the risk that investments may not materialize as quickly as expected.
Nevertheless, there are enough indications that formally or informally, the
Nigerian market will continue to absorb Beninese products, that state
enterprises will undertake substantial investments and that the Government
will keep its pragmatic attitudes towards small- and medium-scale private
investments. Under this project, the lack of expertise in designing and
implementing investment proposals will be addressed by the early provision
of a substantial technical assistance package. The project, being centered
around an efficient and dynamic intermediary, should therefore be implemented
smoothly.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      This report recommends an IDA Credit of US$10 million to the
Government of Benin. BBD would receive US$8.6 million as a line of credit
on-lent by the Government to finance medium- and long-term loans to small-
and medium-scale industrial investments. The Government would grant the
remaining US$1.4 million to BBD to finance the program of technical assis-
tance.
4.02      During negotiations, agreement has been reached on the following
matters:



- 24 -
a.   The Government has agreed to:
(i)   on-lending terms and condit:ions (paras. 3.04 and 3.05);
(ii)  increase BBD's capital by at: least CFAF 500 million no later
than December 31, 1980 (para 2.12);
(iii) provide BBD an interest subsidy equal to the interest lost
by BBD on its sub-loans to small scale and labor intensive
projects (para 3.05 b).
b.   BBD has agreed to
(i) accept lending terms and conditions to sub-borrowers
(para 3.04 and 3.05);
(ii)  appoint the counterparts to technical assistants (para. 3.07);
(iii) adopt, before effectiveness, amendments to its Reglement
Interieur including the definition of an exposure limit of 25% and
a debt-equity ratio of 5:1 (para 2.12).
(iv)  build-up provisions to cover the foreign exchange risk on
its past borrowings and take measures satisfactory to IDA to
protect itself from the exchange risk on its future borrowings
(para 2.08).
(v) reduce its arrears to 25% of its outstanding portfolios before
December 1981 (para. 2.11).

ANNEX 8
BENIN
Banque Beninoise de Developpement
Forecast of Loan and Equity Approvals
Approvals
1.        Total loan approvals after experiencing dramatic growth from 1973
through 1977 (average annual growth +46%) declined in 1978.  From a peak of
CFA francs 6.5 billion in 1977 approvals decreased to CFA francs 6 billion
in 1978 and are expected to amount to no more than CFAF 5 billion in 1979.
BBD feels that this is a temporary slow-down resulting from processing delays
on some large-scale projects and that the growth rate should increase substan-
tially as from next year with approvals reaching close to CFA francs 8 billion
in FY79-80. While this might be so, as BBD is the sole term-financier for
development financing in the country, BBD's overall level of approvals, which
is highly sensitive to financing of large-scale projects will,nonetheless,
demonstrate sharp fluctuations over a period of time.  Consequently, for
projection purposes, it would be more realistic to assume a growth rate of 10%
from a base of CFAF 5 billion in FY79.
2.        Since the specialization of the banking system in Benin, BBD's
share of commercial financing has substantially decreased and now essentially
consists of consortial financing with BCB of seasonal crops. The relative
share of equipment loans has in the meantime increased accordingly, from a low
of 23% in 1974 to a high of 64% in 1978 with a peak of 71% in 1977.
3.        Reflecting these developments and consistent with BBD's current lending
operations, it is assumed that 60% of the total financing will be approved
for equipment loans; 20% for commercial lending including consortial seasonal
crop financing; 10% for housing finance and 10% for miscellaneous loans. Based
on BBD's past operations, it is assumed that term loans would finance equipment
and housing plus 50% of miscellaneous loans.
4.        Equity approvals, consistent with BBD's current policy, are expected
to average no more than CFAF30 million annually.
Commitments and Disbursements
5.        BBD does not keep statistics on commitments in relation to approvals.
However, it has a very efficient legal department and in a very short period
after the approvals, almost all of these are committed.  It is however assumed
that while all short-term approvals and equity investments will be committed
in the same year, only 75% of term-approvals will be committed in the year of
approval and the balance the following year. Data provided on disbursements
show wide fluctuations from one year to the other with a low of 41% of approvals
to a high of 82%. For the purpose of projections however, it is assumed that:
i) 75% of short-term commitments will be disbursed in the first year
and 25% the following year;



-33-
ANNEX 8
ii) 20% of term commitments will be disbursed the first year, 40%
the second and 40% the third;
iii) 100% of equity commitments will be disbursed the first year.
On the basis of the above, projected approvals, commitments and disbursements
should be as follows:

9.        Term.  Term loans are expected to average 9 years with 2 yearsof grace.
Short-term loans are expected to average one year. It is also assumed that 60%
of term loans will be medium-term and 40% long-term.



-  34  -                                 ANNEX 8
10.       Collection.   The average life of existing term loans is estimated
to be six years. Consequently it is assuned that one-sixth of the outstanding
term portfolio at the year end will be repaid the following year. It is
also assumed that 10% of new loans will fall in arrears and will thus represent
doubtful loans. It is further assumed that 50% of doubtful loans outstanding
will be repaid the following year. No sa:Les on equity participations are
anticipated during the projection period.  Repayments will evolve as follows:
1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984
Short-term credits               1,893   1,622   1,694   1,862   2,048   2,253

4,073   3,711   4,043   4,721   5,462   6,173
11.       Portfolio Build-up.  On the basis of the above assumptions, BBD's
portfolio build up will be as follows:  (outstanding end of the year)
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984
Short-term credits          1,893   1,622   1,694   1,862   2,048   2,253   2,479
Term loans                  8,456  10,218  13,288  14,905  16,064. 17,005  17,841
Doubtful loans              1,442   1,259   1,320   1,234   1,223   1,277   1,370
Equity investments            124      154     184      214     244      274     304
11,915  13,253  16,486  18,215  19,579  20,809  21,994
12.       Fixed Assets.  It is assumed that BBD's net investments in housing
will continue to increase at the rate of 20% annually. In addition BBD will
spend CFAF 15 million annually on its own buildings, furniture and fixtures.
Even though BBD's recent policy has been to sell off its housing investments
as soon as the houses are constructed, uncertainties surrounding completion
dates of on-going programs, future sales policies and prices, etc. do not
allow for any meaningful projection base for such sales. Consequently such
sales are not assumed to take place during the projection period.
13.       Current Assets and Current Liabilities.  BBD's current assets and
liabilities are assumed to remain at their level as of end year 1977/78.
14.       Resources.  After a 45% increase already witnessed in 1979, BBD's
deposits are expected to grow at a rate of 15% per annum as from FY80.
Borrowings from the Central Bank are expected to cover the major share (75%)
of BBD's short-term lending representing seasonal credits plus approximately
35% of BBD's term loans.  Refinancing on the proposed IDA line for eligible
subprojects is assumed to amount to approximately CFAF 400 million in 1980
and CFAF 700 million in each of the following two years. The balance of BBD's
resource needs are assumed to be covered by its own funds and other borrowings.
A 50% increase in BBD's share-capital is projected for 1980 to maintain BBD's
term-debt equity ratio below 5:1.



-  3 >'   -                             ANiNEX 8
15.       Revenues.  Interest received orn loans is expected to increase from
the current average of 8.3% to 8.5% in 1979; 9% in 1980 and 9.5% from 1980
onwards, reflecting higher rates BBD has been charging on recent loans as well
as the higher on-lending rates which the proposed IDA project intends to
propose to BBD.  Income from housing investments is assum&d to increase at
the rate of 20% per annum.  Income from commissions and miscellaneous is
expected to remain constant at its level in 1978.
16.       Repayment of External Borrowings.  Existing external borrowings
ate to be repaid as per specific schedules summarized in para 20.
17.       Financial Charges.  Sight and term deposits are assumed to cost an
average of 4% as in the recent past. Financial charges on the Central Bank
borrowings are to represent an average cost of 7.5% reflecting a large share
of rediscounting at normal rate. External borrowings w.ll be served the actual
rates which average for CCCE 4.25%; African Development Bank 2%; USAID 3.5%;
and IDA 8%. Interest on unidentified borrowings has been calculated at the
rate of 5% in view of BBD's past experience with external lines.
18.       Administrative Expenses.  Salaries are assumed to grow at the rate
of 15% per annum while other administrative expenses, which have been growing
faster in the past, are projected to grow at the rate of 20% per annum.
Depreciation charges are assumed to grow at the rate of 20%.
19.       Provisions.  Provisions are projected to increase each year to
remain at 5% of the outstanding portfolio.
20.       Borrowings (External).  Taking into account available funds on existing
external lines of credit, i.e. CFAF 588 million CCCE; 97 million USAID; 90
million African Development Bank and 203 million Algerian Development Bank, and
assuming a line of credit of 1,800 million from IDA, the net outstanding
amounts (after repayments) on these borrowings will evolve as follows:
