                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to increase productivity and employment in participating micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This objective will be achieved by
                         strengthening financial and non-financial markets to meet the demand of MSMEs, strengthening support for employable skills and business management, and reducing
                         critical investment climate constraints in MSMEs. The project will focus on key value chains and on both formal small and medium enterprises and informal
                         microenterprises that have high potential for dynamic growth, including "graduation" from informal to formal status.

                         Achievement of PDOs: The most important PDO of this Project is to “increase productivity and employment in participating MSMEs?. This PDO is considered as largely achieved,
                         although data to support it is relatively limited. Therefore, the rating towards achievement of PDO was conservatively maintained as Marginally Satisfactory. While the outcome

                         targets set at appraisal suffers from measurability weaknesses, productivity improvement and job creation are significant as measured by the "proxy values". Those values are based
                         on good data provided by the main project implementing contractors (called Technical Implementing Partners or TIPs), which appear to have used the raw data to gauge project
                         outcomes.

                         Productivity increases (PDO Indicator – Value added per worker increased by 20%): This PDO has been achieved but there were data limitations. Based on the available
                         information, the value added (change in turnover as proxy) per worker under the Risk Capital and TA funds (RKF) increased by 70% from the baseline year, which is more than two
                         times over the PDO target. The value added (average annual production as proxy) per coffee farmers' cooperative increased by 33.4%. In Kenya, coffee farmers' cooperatives
                         typically operate wet mills at micro or micro-to-small scale. Another evidence of the increased productivity of coffee MSMES is the improvement in product quality. Share of top-
                         grade products increased by 23.8% per annum per coffee growers cooperative. Other components/main activities have also contributed to the achievement of the productivity
                         objective through e.g. increased micro and SME loans, development of new financial products and services, expanded cotton plantation acreage, improved leather product quality,
                         accepted business plans for loans, and improved business education. However, the nature of the interventions makes it difficult and costly to document and measure every direct
                         and indirect MSME beneficiary's value added, and consolidate the data into a single value by activity. For a further qualitative discussion on the contribution to the PDO outcomes,
                         please refer to the section on component of this ISR.

                         Employment additions (PDO Indicator – At least 2,500 new jobs created): This PDO has been largely achieved (72% based on available data, but with some evidence suggesting it
                         could be much larger). New jobs created in the RKF beneficiaries were over 1,300. Given the fact that most (60%) of the beneficiaries are in non-manufacturing sector (e.g. a dry
                         cleaning shop, a scarcely staffed travel agency), arguably different than it was estimated at appraisal, this is a commendable result in employment. In terms of the value chain
                         component (2-3 estimated at appraisal, but 4 supported, with coffee and cotton receiving support for the longest period -see components description for further details), at least
                         sectors contributed to this indicator. At the coffee farmers’ cooperative level, the oldest value chain supported, data available is the number of total casual workers hired before and
                         after the technical services. Those casual workers are said to typically work full time, six days a week in two seasons (May-Jul and Oct-Jan). Using the estimated number of days the
                         casual workers were employed, the full-time jobs (equivalent) increased by 483 at the beneficiary coffee farmers’ cooperatives. For the cotton value chain MSME level (i.e. cotton
                         ginneries), the permanent jobs created after receiving technical services was 10. The job creation figure could be higher as increased coffee and cotton production at farmers’ level
                         indicates increased uses of casual workers. Unfortunately those smallholder farmers usually do not keep good record of casual workers they hired during peak seasons. A further
                         discussion on the relationship between the achievement of this PDO outcome and the other components/main activities can be found in the component section of this ISR.

                         Impact Assessment findings: The Project has a built-in Impact Assessment (IA) by an international consultant engaged by the Ministry of Industrialization (MOI). The baselines
                         surveys of the coffee and cotton farmers, which were the two value chains being implemented at the time with 1-2 more in progress, were undertaken in 2008 (partly delayed after
                         election violence of late 2007) and the baseline interviews of the MSME clients of two FIs under the Financial Deepening Trust (FSD) subcomponent and the interviews of the RKF
                         beneficiaries were undertaken in 2008 – 2009. Since the IA took place in 08 and early 09, about half of the sub-components of the project had either not started or facing major
                         delays, limiting comparability at end assessment for the remaining sub-components that started thereafter (see below). The end-of-project assessment was recently concluded,
                         making reference to the partial set of sub-components. While the IA is subject to a number of c onstraints (e.g. short observation periods, limited number of samples and non-
                         responsiveness of one FI beneficiary), it has confirmed that the turnover, profit and employment in the beneficiaries (MSMEs and farmers) have increased. For instance, a) the RKF
                         beneficiaries interviewed were able to increase profits by 79% in 2009 – 2011 and revenue by 33% in 2008 – 2011; b) coffee farmers in the treatment group saw their sales increased
                         by more than 5 times; and c) cotton farmers in the treatment group saw yield increased by 65%. The beneficiaries interviewed or in the treatment groups also reported significant job
                         increases: such as 25% growth of full-time jobs (equivalent) in 2009 – 2010 (RKF); and substantial increase in the number of male seasonal workers hired by coffee farmers and

                         substantial increase in the number of days of employment per seasonal worker hired by the cotton farmers. Those findings are additional evidence of the achievement of the PDO.

                         Other qualitative impact: Significant impact has been achieved, including on the number of sub-components or additional sectors that picked up or started since 2009. These include:
                         (a) Expansion of the RKF beyond the initial (South African) firm BPI to include 3-4 new Kenyan fund managers, in an industry that was virtually non-existent at appraisal. As explained
                         in the restructuring paper, the funds allocated to these sub-components proved to be more than required due to lower actual investments needed per MSME than estimated an
                         appraisal (about 300k instead of 500k on average), lower percentage of the investment needed for TA (10 percent instead of 20), and initial repayment of early loans that started to
                         come into the revolving TA fund and made available for other firms. As a result, some US$4million were deemed to be not needed at restructuring time, which were not expected to
                         affect achievement of objective due to change in estimated parameters at appraisal once the market emerged. These funds together with favorable exchange rate led to excess funds
                         that were partly reallocated and made available at closure for cancellation (see below); (b) FSD Kenya, created by the project together with DFID, is a crucial element of the financial
                         sector support landscape in Kenya, together with a parallel IDA loan (Financial and LEgal Sector Technical Assistance Program, FLSTAP), which is now also funded by other
                         partners and has supported transformational changes in the financial sector that together with the RKF market that has emerged facilitated by the project, have helped reduced what

                         has been reported in the latest investment climate survey (ICA) and poverty assessments among top three investment climate constraints for MSMEs. Investment climate constraints
                         were also improved at the sectoral level and via business services and market linkages in general with the following sub-components. (c) the value chain subcomponent is a salient
                         feature of the project and its impact goes beyond individual achievement, not only for the first 2 value chains that received longer support, but also for the last addition of the leather
                         value chain, with achievements at the policy/investment climate side that had been elusive for 20 years, while the pyrethrum value chain concentrated on market competition issues

                         that led to the submission to Parliament of the Pyrethrum bill for the liberation of the sector. The subcomponent is spilling over with long lasting effects, with its design and
                         implementation model being replicated by other WB projects (Infodev, WBI) and other donors reviewing it for their future programs (German cooperation, UNDP), while Deloitte and
                         Touche (implementing partner) has created a permanent division with the project team to carry on with similar ac tivities for other projects. (d) the Global Business School NEtwork
                         has also had strong impact, with the second round (introduced at restructuring) building on the successes of the first round, incorporating universities that benefited from the training
                         to train trainers from other universities, hence ensuring sustainablity and broader impact. (e) the first BPC round did not take place until 2010, even though it was expected early in
                         the project, but then they managed to do a second round in 2011/12 and it is also being picked up by other WB projects (WBI) on its design and planing to provide additional support
                         to participants taking them to the next level. (f) the work under the industrial training levy that was coordinated across relevant ministries helped revive an agenda that was dormant,
                         with a new ITL bill approved by Parliament during the project implementation, although the consultancy experienced delays later addressed. The overall qualitative impact is thus
                         deemed high, particularly since the project implementation accelerated after 2009 with all sub-components in full implementation.

                         Project restructuring and impact on PDO: The Project was restructured in December 2009 when Component 3 – Improving the Business Environment was dropped as the specific
                         measures supported were assigned by law to other institutions. The component was to assist the Government to simplify the MSME taxation regime and establish a one-stop window
                         for startups, with an aim to create incentives for MSMEs operating in the informal sector to graduate into more formal sector. This component had not performed well by 2009
                         (including due to implementation of consultants), but also it had been overtaken by events with the new MSM tax Bill passed and the mandate for one-stop shop transferred to a new
                         institution not related to the project. At the same time, FIAS (WB/IFC trust fund to support investment climate) had increased regulatory support to the Government of Kenya. The
                         Project Paper reports that there was anecdotal evidence in the economy pointing towards the achievement of the investment climate related project targets, as noted above, beyond
                         the two specific areas Component 3 was supporting. Thus, the Project Paper also points out that the closure of this component would not affect the Project Development Objectives
                         “as both components 1 and 2 are contributing to improving the business environment?. While improving investment climate is not the primary target of this Project (by design it was an
                         intermediate result), the Project has enabled the beneficiary MSMEs to e.g, a) access finance (e.g. RKF quasi-capital investments); and b) reduce market risk through value chain
                         linkages (e.g. services for product certification and demonstration at international exhibitions). The interventions under Component 1 and 2 have also contributed to progress towards
                         the original component objective on moving MSME beneficiaries' to more formal sector (refer to the component section of this ISR for details).

                         Overall implementation progress: Overall, implementation has improved substantially completing all the activities following the much faster and effective pace of implementation in
                         the last 3 years of the project with disbursement ratios increasing from 32% in June 2009 to 72% in June 2012. Out of the original eight Intermediate Results, five targets have been
                         met, two largely met and one partially met. Those good results have enabled the Project to achieve the PDO targets but data limitations have constrained fully documenting this
                         achievement. As a result the rating has been conservatively left as Marginally Satisfactory. For a detailed discussion on the implementation status and the contributions from
                         component results to PDO outcomes, please refer to the section on components in this ISR. The disbursement rate as of this ISR time is 72 percent, which is in line with assessment
                         at restructuring that deemed a large portion of funds in excess of what was needed to achieve sub-component objectives (i.e RKF) and benefits from exchange rate appreciation,
                         even after funds were reallocated and effectively used in 2009 beyond original expected outputs at appraisal (for value chain, BPC, GBSN, in particular). The GoK has recently
                         submitted a request for cancellation of US$6.6 million of the IDA credit proceeds that will not be utilized, but this is not affecting achievement of PDOs and implementation, as noted
                         above, with activities supported well above those identified at appraisal, in spite of the lower funds used. Based on these achievements, the supervision team was ready to upgrade

                         PDO indicator measurability: As discussed above, the design of the two PDO indicators suffers measurability weaknesses. This has affected the evaluation and full documentation of
                         the PDO outcomes and component results. While the project targets all three sizes of enterprises (micro, small and medium), the majority of the actual beneficiaries so far have been
                         smallholder farmers, and micro or micro-to-small enterprises, reflecting the missing-middle syndrome of many African economies. The majority of those beneficiaries turned out to be
                         in the non-manufacturing sectors (partly due to other investment climate constraints, notably energy and port of mombasa inefficiencies), while the PDO indicator on productivity is
                         more suitable for manufacturing industries or enterprises capable of good cost accounting where steady and reliable information on value added (revenue-inputs) per worker would
                         be easier to collect. Those beneficiaries in particular the smallholder farmers usually do not have the capability to keep a good record of casual jobs. The PDO indicators developed
                         at appraisal were based on a 2002 RKF in South Africa. At present, details of this South Africa risk capital fund is not available (e.g. average investment/TA loan size, average size of

                         Project effectiveness: Given the nature of the main interventions of the Project (consultant services in business development assistance and quasi-equity loans to micro/small
                         startups), quantitative analysis of project effectiveness is difficult, although at appraisal an estimated Net Present Value (NPV) was arrived (US$19.8 million). This NPV was expected
                         to be achieved in a 12-year period, and the breakeven point was to be reached during the 1st year after project completion (the 6th year per the original design of a 5-year
                         implementation period). The upcoming ICR exercise will try to locate the net cashflow analysis of the NPV at appraisal to determine if a similar NPV analysis at closure is a good
                         measure for project effectiveness; and if not, will conduct qualitative analysis.
