INDONESIA
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        An economic repurt, entitled "Indonesia:  Adjusting to Lower Oil
Revenues" (No. 6201-IND, dated May-20, 1986), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 27, 1986. Annex I gives selected economic data for the
country.
Background
2.        The Republic of Indonesia is a highly diverse country spread across
an archipelago of more than 13,000 islands with a land area of about two mil-
lion km. It has a population of over 158 million, growing at about 2.1%
p.a., and is the world's fifth most populous nation. The country has a
diversified resource base, with plentiful primary energy resources, signifi-
cant mineral deposits, large timber potential and a developed system of agri-
cultural commodity production and export. A high proportion of these primary
resources are located on the less populated islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan,
while two thirds of the population lives on Java, which has areas with some of
the highest rural population densities in the world. About a quarter of the
population lives in urban areas, and the current rate of urban population
growth is about 4% p.a. The 1984 estimate of GNP per capita is US§540, which
places Indonesia at the lower end of the middle-income countries.'
Macroeconomic Developments and Resource Management
3.        During the 1970s, the Indonesian economy grew at almost 8Z p.a.
This growth was associated with rapid increases in public expenditures, total
investment and savings. Following the turbulence of the mid-1960s, the
Government of Indonesia (cOI) took effective action to restore macroeconomic
stability, liberalize the economy, rehabilitate infrastructure, and provide
incentives for domestic and foreign private investment. However, the dominant
external influence was the huge expansion, and significant variability, in
foreign exchange earnings from oil. Net earnings from oil and LNG exports
rose from US$0.6 billion in 1973/74 to US$10.6 billion in 1980181, when the
current account enjoyed a surplus of US$2.1 billion. Oil and LNG also pro-
vided about 60Z of budget revenues by 1980/81 and helped finance a sustained
increase in demand. The pattern of expenditures helped foster diversified
growth. Of particular note has been the support for agriculture through

Atlas methodology for calculation of GNP.

investment in infrastructure and support services. This supported an
agricultural growth rate of almost 4% p.a. and Led to the recent achievement
of self-sufficiency in rice. Manufacturing also enjoyed a high growth rate
during the 19705 (of about 14% p.a.), although this was from a very low base
and predominantly oriented toward the protected domestic market.
4.        Over the past five years, the economy has been buffeted by unfavor-
able external developments, especially for oil. Accordingly, the external
terms of trade deteriorated by more than 15% from 1981/82 to 1985/86. In
response, the Government acted decisively to stabilize the economy and provide
a basis for longer-term structural adjustment. Related measures included:
(a) restraints on public investment and reductions in budget subsidies;
(b) maintenance of a flexible exchange rate policy (following a major devalua-
tion in March 1983); (c) wide-ranging structural reforms in the taxation and
financial systems; and (d) a major reorganization of customs, ports and
shipping operations. These measures had a positive impact on the balance of
payments, with the current account deficit reduced from US$7.2 billion (8.5%
of GNP) in 1982/83 to an estimated US$1.7 billion (2.2% of CNP) in 1985/86.
Domestic inflation was also reduced to less than 5% in 1985. However, this
stabilization process has involved a heavy cost in terms of lower investment
and growth. Since 1981, GDP growth has averaged only 2.6% p.a.; adjusting for
population growth and the terms of trade loss, per capita incomes have
fallen. The industrial sector has been particularly hard hit, with low rates
of capacity utilization and emerging financial problems in many enterprises.
5.        The economic outlook for Indonesia is dominated by the recent
collapse and uncertain prospects for world oil markets. Preliminary indica-
tors are that Indonesia's net oil/LNC export earnings could fall by more than
60% during 1986/87. Because of the cautious management strategy adopted by
the Government in recent years, Indonesia is better placed than most oil
exporters to cushion the short-term impact of lower oil revenues. External
reserves stand at over US$10 billion (equivalent to nine months of imports)
and another US$2 billion is available in undrawn comnercial credits. However,
the Government is still legitimately concerned about the impact of a prolonged
shortfall in oil revenues. Despite tight controls over public external
borrowing in recent years, the debt service ratio had reached 25% by 1985 and
will rise further (even without new borrowing) over the next few years. The
scope, therefore, for additional borrowing to cover the rescurce gap is
limited. Instead, the Government has opted for further measures, to restrain
aggregate demand and promote structural change in the economy. Already, an
austerity budget has been announced for 1986187, with total expenditure
budgeted to decline by 9% (24% for development expenditure). On September 12,
1986, the Rupiah was devalued by 31%. This decisive action helped to prompt
speculative capital outflows and will strengthen the balance of payments over
the medium term. With continued prudence and some recovery in oil prices, the
current account deficit could be brought back to less than 3% of GNP over the
next three years. However, economic performance would remain highly
constrained, with CDP growth close to 2% p.a. and declining per capita
incomes.



-3-
Policies for Growth and Adjustment
6.        Indonesia's ability to achieve its goals of sustainable growth with
equity will depend crucially on the skill with which it manages the transition
fruom oil dependency toward a.more diversified, semi-industrial economy. Some
of the elements of this strategy, including structural reforms in the taxation
and financial systems, are already in place. The recent devaluation will also
help to improve Indonesia's competitiveness and promote non-oil export
development. However, successful adjustment will require continued action in
three key policy areas: management of the public investment program (and
improvements in the regulatory/policy environment for private investment),
rationalization of the external trade regime and development of the financial
sector.
7.        The projected import constraint imposes serious limitations on the
rate at which Indonesia can undertake new investments over the next few
years. At the same time, some reallocation of resources towards regional
development and the social sectors might be justified, in order to reduce the
import content of investment while still meeting the Government's equity and
employment objectives. It is therefore important that mechanisms are estab-
lished to facilitate orderly and rational adjustments to the public investment
program. Possible options include preparation of multiyear expenditure plans
(at least for the larger projects), identification of a core program of high
priority projects and strengthening of project appraisal/selection proce-
dures. The Government is also considering ways to improve project implemen-
tation, so that investment returns can be realized more promptly.  Given the
budgetary constraints, it is expected that the private sector will be called
upon to play an increasingly important role in capital formation.;  To encou-
rage this process, the Government recently announced simplifications in
investment approval procedures and a major internal reorganization of the
Investment Coordinating Board. These measures were followed, in May 1986, by
a package of regulatory reforms to make Indonesia more attractive to foreign
investors.
8.        The recent decline in the price of oil has clearly demonstrated the
importance of reducing the economy's heavy dependence on a single source of
foreign exchange and, more generally, the need to rationalize the external
trade regime. The Government has set a target of doubling non-oil exports in
nominal terms over the next five years. This target should be attainable
provided that economic recovery in the industrial economies is sustained,
Indonesia's access to those markets is not constrained by protectionist
measures and, most importantly, Indonesia follows appropriate trade and
exchange rate policies. The Government has already introduced a range of
export promotion measures intended to improve export incentives, ensure ready
access to finance for exporters, raise product quality and enhance marketing
capacity. Most recently, in May 1986, the Government announced a policy
package designed to ensure that exporters would have access to raw materials
and intermediate inputs at international prices. However, over the longer
term, there is no effective substitute for comprehensive trade reform. On the
import side, Indonesia's trade regime has historically been characterized by a
predilection for high tariffs and quantitative restrictions. In March 1985,
the Government announced a major reduction in the range and level of nominal
import tariffs. However, other actions, including increased use of import



-4-
quotas/bans and regulations requiring higher local content in production, have
served to promote some potentially costLy and uneconomic investments which
could prove counterproductive to the export drive.
9.        The Government's decision to move towards a more liberal financial
environment raises a number of issues relating to resource mobilization,
financial intermediation and credit allocation. Over the longer term, as the
scope for subsidized credit is reduced, the banking system will have to play
an increasingly important role in mobilizing domestic resources. However,
during the transition period, some potential conflicts between the resource
mobilization and credit allocation objectives could arise. For example, the
increase in deposit rates following the recent financial reforms, while
encouraging resource mobilization, has also led to high real lending rates
which have tended to dampen investment and credit demand. This in turn may
restrain economic activity. It is therefore important to find ways to reduce
the high intermediation costs of banks. Consideration should also be given to
other ways of mobilizing financial resources, including development of a
capital market, expansion of the banking network (especially in rural areas)
and selective relaxation of restrictions on private banks (combined with
increased bank supervision).
Incomes, Employment and Human Development
10.       Indonesia's physical, human and economic resources are very urnevenly
distributed among its main regions. Java, for example, accounts for almost
50% of Indonesia's CDP and 62% of its population, but only 7Z of its land
area. Although all five of the country's main regions experienced rapid per
capita growth in the 1970s, regional differences in output tended to widen.
To a large extent, differences in performance are associated with the impor-
tance of the mineral sector, particularly petroleum. However, there are two
important processes at work in Indonesia which enabLe the benefits of growth
to be more evenly spread than indicated by output trends.- The first of these
is migration. Between 1971 and 1980, 4.3 million people (or 16% of the natur-
al increase in population) resettled permanently in provinces outside those of
their birth. Approximately 1.7 million people moved from Java to the Other
Islands, of whom one million were resettled through the official transmigra-
tion program. There has also been substantial rural-urban migration both
between and within provinces. The second process is the redistribution of
income through the government budget. Regional variations in per capita con-
sumption are much less pronounced than differences in per capita output. This
is largely due to the impact of taxation on the oil sector.
11.       An analysis of household expenditures indicates that Indonesia's
rapid economic development has been accompanied by significant progress in
reducing poverty. Between 1970 and 1980, the proportion of the population
living in poverty declined from 57Z to 40Z; the decline was particularly rapid
in the Other Islands and in urban areas. The core of the poverty problem con-
tinues to be in rural Java, where landless laborers form a large, and possibly
rising, proportion of the popuLation and where, for most of the 1970s, there
is little evidence of any rise in real agricultural wages. However, there was
a significant rise in real agricultural wages around 1980-81 associated with
the sharp increase in rice output and booming overall economic growth.



5-
Increases in rural nonagricultural and urban wages also occurred at the
beginning of the 1980s. Despite the slowdown in economic growth and stabili-
zation measures since 1982, the limited available evidence suggests that wages
and incomes have held up, partly as a consequence of continued agricultural
growth.
12.       In the future, the availability of productive employment will be a
key determinant of income distribution. The labor force is expeLted to grow
at about 2.3Z p.a. over the next decade, while economic growth will be lower
than in the 1970s. The resultant squeeze in the labor market could lead to
stagnant or declining labor income, especially in rural areas and the urban
informal sector. Given the balance of payments constraint facing the country,
Indonesia's employment outlook depends crucially on the pattern of econfomic
growth, and in particular the extent of labor absorption in the commodity-
producing sectors. Although over the long term the structural shift in
employment away from agriculture should aontinue, this sector will still
account for half or more of total employment and the growth in agricultural
incomes will be an important determinant of job opportunities elsewhere in
nonfarm activities. This will require continued priority to agriculture in
the form of supportive pricing and investment policy, with scme shift in
emphasis toward the Other Islands. On Java, attention will need to be paid to
issues of agricultural diversification and the pace of mechanization. With
respect to the industriaL sector, the development of an efficient, relatively
export-oriented pattern of production can also contribute to significant labor
absorption in the medium to long term, especially in Java; this will involve a
continuing major role for small-scale firms. If a favorable evolution of the
employment situation is to occur, there will also need to be an appropriate
pattern of public expenditure and supportive policies for the urban informal
sector; finally, the transmigration program can make a substantial contribu-
tion, provided it is closely coordinated with complementary agricultural
investment programs, in tree crops, water resources and livestock development.
13.       There has been substantial progress in extending the provision of
social services throughout the population. Universal enrollment in primary
education has been virtually achieved and the enrollment rate in secondary
schools is now about 35%.  However, the weak educational base of the popula-
tion continues to be a major obstacle to rapid economic development and a
substantial further expansion of secondary and tertiary education will be
necessary as well as a major effort to raise the quality of the whole system.
In the health sector, there has been a Large expansion in facilities, notably
at the subdistrict level, but continued investment and an improvement in
quality will be necessary to increase effectiveness. This will have to be
complemented by a major expansion in water supply and sanitation if the
improvement in indices of mortality and morbidity during the 1970s is to be
maintained. By 1981, only 18% of the rural and 40% of the urban popuLation
had access to safe water, compared with government targets of 60% and 75%,
respectively, for 1990.



-6-
External Capital Flows
14.       The ongoing program of economic reforms should help to hold the
current account deficit to sustainable levels over the medium term, despite
the impact of lower oil revenues. Even so, continued resource transfers from
abroad will be essential to sustain modest GDP growth (2% p.a.) over the next
three years. Staff projections indicate that new public medium- and long-term
(MLT) borrowing will have to average about US$4.8 billion p.a. from 1986/87 to
1988/89, including about US$2.4 billion p.a. of official development assis-
tance and the balance from import-related credits and untied borrowing.
Indonesia is well placed to arrange the necessary financing on reasonable
tenrs; the Government's record of economic management is good and a comfort-
able cushion of external reserves has been rebuilt over the-past three years.
15.       Total public debt outstanding at the end of 1985 is estimated at
US$28 billion, with an additional US$15 billion of undisbursed commitments.
Of the total debt disbursed and outstanding, official assistance (including
nonconcessional multilateral aid) accounts for 48% and obligations at variable
interest rates for only 21%; there is no short-term public debt. The average
maturity of public KLT debt at the end of 1985 is estimated at 16 years. The
Covernment continues to manage its external debt quite prudently. Un il 1981,
Indonesia had succeeded in maintaining its public debt service ratio, based on
gross exports, at below 10%. However, because of the sharp drop in oil export
receipts over the past three years, the ratio rose to about 20% in 1985. With
the projected levels and composition of borrowings and export earnings,
Indonesia's public debt, service ratio wouLd rise to about 31% in 1986 and then
gradually decline in later years. With private MLT debt included, the total
debt service ratio would rise from 25% in 1985 to around 37% in 1986 and then
decline again.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
16.       As of September 30, 1986, Indonesia had received 48 IDA credits to-
talling US$908.10 million (Less cancellations) and 113 Bank loans amounting to
US$8,835.19 million (less cancellations). IFC commitments totalled US$163.2
million. Annex II contains a summary of IDA credits, Bank loans and IFC
investments as of September 30, 1986. The share of the Bank Group in
Indonesia's public (disbursed) external debt outstanding at the end of 1985
was 14.8%, and the share of debt service, 9.7% compared with 14.5% and 8.8%,
respectively, in 1984. From 1968 until 1974, all lending to Indonesia was
made through IDA. Due to the country's improved creditworthiness following
the commodity and oil price boom in 1973/74, the bulk of the Bank Group's
lending in the remainder of the 1970s was through IBRD loans, with a modest
amount of IDA lending being justified primarily on poverty grounds, as the per
capita GNP was well below the IDA cutoff level. IDA lending was discontinued
in FY80. Given the critical importance of agriculture (including
transmigration) for employment, food security and exports, over one-third of
Bank Group-assisted projects have been in this sector. In addition, loans and
credits have been extended to virtually all other sectors of the economy,
including transportation, education, urban development, water supply, rural



-7-
development, industrial development financing (including small-scale
industry), power, telecommunications, population and nutrition, and technical
assistance.
17.       During Repelitas I (1969-74) and II (1974-79), and in line with the
objectives of these first two Five-Year Plans, a high proportion of Bank Group
lending was directed initially toward the rehabilitation and then the expan-
sion of infrastructure and production facilities. Special attention was also
given to meeting the shortage of skilled manpower and technical assistance
needed for preinvestment studies and project execution. Repelita III (1979-
84), published in early 1979, stressed the need for continued high growth and
stability, but departed from previous plans by placing special emphasis on
more equitable income distribution and poverty alleviation. This focus, which
was fully in line with the conclusions of the basic economic report, required
greater attention to employment generation (particularly in the industrial
qector) and to improvements in basic public services. While Bank lending was
already consistent with these objectives, increased emphasis has been given to
these priorities. However, the adverse economic developments that occurred in
the latter half of the plan period and the measures taken to address them, led
to a reshaping of development objectives for Repelita IV (1984-89). These
emphasize restoring growth of incomes and employment while continuing finan-
cial prudence, promoting structural change toward a more diversified economy,
and maintaining efforts to improve income distribution and alleviate poverty.
This shift in focus has underscored the need to follow through on reforms that
have already been initiated, seek increased efficiencies in the economy, mobi-
lize domestic resources to finance needed investments and recurrent expendi-
tures, and foster a policy environment conducive to the achievement of
required changes.
18.       The Bank has geared its lending and economic work program to address
these needs and to maintain a high level of resource transfer. The approach
is to continue to Emphasi-ze the ongoing dialogue on economic policy that has
been a cornerstone of the Bank's relationship with the Covernment for many
years, and to coordinate discussion of macroeconomic issues with advice on
institutional and policy reform in important sectors and subsectors, coupled
with lending operations and technical assistance that meet priority needs and
support institutional improvements in specific areas. Emphasis in economic
work is being given to trade and industrial issues, development of the finan-
cial system, and public resource management. In the lending program, agricul-
ture continues to receive the most attention. However, the program is broadly
based, and includes increasing emphasis on education and human resource deve-
lopment. Continued attention is being given to power and energy, where the
Bank is concentrating on policies to diversify Indonesia's energy base,
rationalize pricing and improve sector planning. In transportation, the Bank
is focussing on efficiency improvements in the maritime sector and on improv-
ing the national network of highways and rural roads. In urban development
and water supply, lending is being directed more and more to developing inno-
vative low-cost solutions, providing for cost recovery and strengthening local
institutions, in order to minimize demands on the Government budget and decen-
tralize the responsibility for addressing basic needs. In all, the Bank's
lendirg program is intended to contribute about 20% of Indonesia's capital
requirements during the next three years and is expected to be an important



-8-
catalyst in attracting other funds. Where possible, we are seeking also to
widen the impact of Bank lending through technical assistance, as well as
complementary investments and coordinated policy dialogue with other donors.
This is especially true in our lending programs for power, urban development,
water supply and transportation.
19.       Implementation, as reflected by disbursements, has 7een steadily
imprgying over the past three years. The disbursement ratioZ has risen from
15% - in FY84 to about 18.5% in FY86. Although this is not yet a satisfac-
tory level, this improvement reflects the results of efforts which the Govern-
ment and the Bank have been making to address key implementation problem
areas. These include budgeting and budget release procedures, procurement
procedures, managerial capacity, limited capacity in the local consulting and
contracting industries and land acquisition. Several special Bank missions
have addressed various aspects of these problems and made recommendations,
many of which have been adopted by the Covernment. Seminars on procurement
and disbursement procedures as well as others which have addressed more
broadly implementation problems of specific sectors have been held, in
addition to regular formal meetings between the Bank and the Government to
review implementation and disbursement performance and project and sector spe-
cific problems. As a consequence of these joint initiatives, the Government
has acted to streamline some complex budgetary and financial procedures,
improved its information system, and instituted training programs in proce-
dures and project management. In addition, a ministerial level committee
responsible to the President has been established to monitor implementation
performance, as well as a ministerial committee on land acquisition. To
continue to assist in alleviating the problems which persist, the Bank has
been, and will be in future, working with the implementation monitoring
committee as well as on specific problem areas agreed with the Government.
Activities are already underway include: developing the local consulting and
contracting industries, improving budgeting and financial procedures, and
strengthening-management information systems for procurement and post-contract
implementation monitoring.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Indonesia for US$24.5
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate, and would assist in financing a Fisheries Support Services
Project.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Indonesia provides employment and the
main source of livelihood for more than half of the labor force. Over the
last one and a half decades, agricultural growth has averaged about 4% p.a..
Rice production, which accounts for more than two-fifths of gross output, land
use and employment, has grown at 5% p.a., and has made a solid contribution to
the sector's impressive performance. It has also transformed the country from
one of the world's largest importers of rice to one with surpluses. The
strategic imperatives now are to exploit more fully the potential for agricul-
ture through greater efficiency and diversification, and to expand
agricultural exports to earn foreign exchange.
3.        Indonesia has the world's largest active fishing fleet.  The fisher-
ies sector accounts for about 2% of GDP, contributes over 60% of the animal
protein in the Indonesian diet, and earned US$233 million in foreign exchange
in 1985, mainly from the export of high-value shrimp. The sector provides
employment for about 2.2 million small-scale fishermen and aquaculture workers
who account for 95% of fisheries production. Fisheries' contribution to GDP
has grown at about 5% p.a. over the last decade, and in the fourth national
five-year plan, annual growth targets for production have been fixed at 10%
p.a. for aquaculture, 6% p.a. for marine fish and 18% p.a. for fisheries
exports. These targets will be difficult to realize, however, given declining
Government revenues from oil and LNG and the corresponding decreases in budget
resources. At a time of Government resource constraints, the Government's
strategy for the fisheries sector emphasizes support for activities which
increase production and exports with relatively low demand on the Government's
budget.
4.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to:
(i) expand private investment in the export-oriented segments of the fisheries
sector, particularly in shrimp and tuna; (ii) increase the productivity of
fisheries investments through well-focused research and extension support;
(iii) improve efficiency in the use of government funds (by channelling
unsubsidized credit to small-scale fishermen, improving credit recovery, and
reducing the role of costLy state-owned enterprises); and (iv) alleviate
poverty by locating improved services and investments in areas with a high
concentration of poor fishermen.
5.        Project Description.  The project would be implemented over a seven-
year period and include the foLlowing major ciomponents: Ci) rehabilitation of
295 km of primary and secondary brackish water canals serving 18,000 ha of

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



shrimp ponds in South Sulawesi, Aceh, and Southeast Sulawesi; (ii) provision
of credit and technical support for shrimp farm development and for the
establishment of fry rearing and distribution facilities run by fishermen;
(iii) provision of credit for expanding private cold storage facilities for
marine fisheries in East Nusa Tenggara and for purchase of 26 pole and line
vessels; (iv) provision of technical support for adaptive research, manpower
development, planning and project preparation in the Directorate General of
Fisheries; (v) support for restructuring state fisheries enterprises; and (vi)
development of a small pilot component to promote environmentally-sound
coastal aquaculture development involving the poorest coastal fishermen.
6.        The proposed Bank loan of US$24.5 million equivalent would finance
65% of total project costs of US$41.0 million equivalent, less duties and
taxes (US$2.9 million) and reserved procurement of vehicLes (US$0.3 million).
A breakdown of the costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD No. 19681) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6290-IND, is being distributed separately.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank involvement in the proposed
project would help ensure that government investmen .s are appropriately
targetted. Shrimp pond development would stimulate production for export; the
tuna component in East Nusa Tenggara would benefit one of Indonesia's poorest
provinces; and the pilot component for aquaculture development would benefit
some of the countries poorest fishermen. In addition, Bank involvement would
help ensure that appropriate steps1are taken to increase cost recovery,
support the role of private sector producers and processors, and reduce the
financial burden on Government's resources.
8.        Agreed Actions.  To achieve project objectives, assurances were
obtained at negotiations: Ci) that effective interest rates on credit to
project fishermen would be about 16-18% which is close to commerciai rates;
(ii) that Bank Rakyat Indonesia would enter into agreements with shrimp
processors to collect shrimp producer subloans through automatic deductions
from sales proceeds and to guarantee 50% of the cost of the subloan;
(iii) that Bank Rakyat Indonesia would enter into an agreement with the tuna
processor guaranteeing collection of loans for pole and line vessels; and
(iv) that the Government would prepare a plan by December 31, 1990 for the
recovery of operation and maintenance costs from project beneficiaries, and
that it would reassess the land values in project areas by September 30,
1992. The Government also confirmed at negotiations that proposals for
restructuring selected private enterprises would be available for review by
March 31, 1988; that advisory groups would be set up by June 30, 1987 to
advise on the work program of the Fishing Technique Development Centers; and
that the Bank would be consulted with regard to the preparation of fisheries
sector and Repelita V plans.
9.        A signed agreement between Bank Rakyat Indonesia and the private
processor in East Nusa Tenggara ensuring collection of subloans for pole and
line vessels is a condition of disbursement against these subloans; and Bank



approval of the investment loan for cold storage facilities is a condition of
disbursement against that component. The signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and Bank Rakyat Indonesia is a condition of
loan effectiveness.
10.       To facilitate project implementation, assurances were obtained that
the Government would (i) establish at least five Rural Extension Centers in
Aceh, South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi by March 31, 1988 and four more by
March 31, 1990; (ii) employ and station a hatchery consultant in South
Sulawesi by July 1, 1987; (iii) establish a technical committee for infra-
structure improvement; and (iv) designate a senior officer of the Ministry of
Population and Environment as project manager for the pilot component by
June 30, 1987.
11.       Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from improved physical infrastructure, input supplies, on-farm
development, marketing and pilot coastal aquaculture components. The main
beneficiaries would be about 6,900 small-scale coastal aquaculture fishermen
and some 400 small-scale marine fishermen, most of whom have per capita
incomes below the rural poverty level. The project would increase shrimp and
tuna production and exports by nearly 6,000 tons p.a., representing foreign
exchange earnings of over US$28 miLlion p.a. The overall economic rate of
return for the project is estimated at about 24%.
12.       Risks.  One project risk is possible delay resulting from diffi-
culties in coordination among the various agencies responsible for project
implementation. This risk would be minimized by implementation through well-
established institutions and the provision of coordinating mechanisms. Even
if implementation and benefits were delayed by two years, the economic rate of
return would be about 20%. The East Nusa Tenggara marketing support and pilot
coastal aquaculture components are also somewhat risky due to their innovative
nature, but the risk has been limited by keeping these components smalL (4% of
project cost). In addition, there is a risk related to the price of shrimp.
Should the past trend toward gradually increasing real prices for shrimp be
reversed, which is not considered likely, project benefits would be
affected. However, sensitivity analysis shows that even if shrimp prices
should decline by 38% below projected levels, the project economic rate of
return would remain above 10%.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
