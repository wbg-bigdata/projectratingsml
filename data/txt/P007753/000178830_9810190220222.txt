REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
FOR AN EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit from the Association in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to US$20.0 million to the Republic of Nicaragua.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "The Effects of the December 23, 1972
Earthquake Upon the Economic Position and Prospects of Nicaragua" is being
distributed to the Executive Directors simultaneously with this report.
The memorandum, the conclusions of which are summarized below, is based
upon a mission to Managua in February. The last regular economic report
on Nicaragua was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1971.
An economic mission visited Nicaragua in July 1972, but the distribution
of its report has been delayed in order to take into account the impact
of the earthquake upon the medium-term economic outlook. A country data
sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        The earthquake which struck Nicaragua's capital city last Dec-
ember killed between 6,000 and 8,000 persons and injured some 20,000
people. It destroyed or rendered unusable practically all of the central
zone of the city including most Government offices, the important finan-
cial and commercial sections and perhaps 2,500 shops engaged in small-
scale manufacturing. About 32,000 housing units, i.e., about 45 percent
of the housing in the Managua area, were destroyed. The cost of replacing
the physical assets destroyed by the earthquake is estimated at $300 mil-
lion. This estimate assumes that the destroyed facilities will be re-
built in or near their previous location so that the infrastructure faci-
lities relatively undamaged by the earthquake will not have to be re-
placed. This estimated replacement cost is equivalent to about one-third
of 1972 GNP and about 10 percent of the nation's capital stock. Given the
magnitude of the damages relative to the size of the Nicaraguan economy, the
task of reconstruction will need to be spread over many years. Major factcrs
affecting the pace of reconstruction will be the extent to whic' th-
capacity of the construction industry can be expanded and the extent to
which activities elsewhere in the country are postponed in favor of re-
building the capital city. Of the $300 million which must be spent to
replace the destroyed physical assets, about $100 million represent re-
placement of equipment, furnishing and inventories,while the other $200
million represent construction costs. The latter figure compares with
estimates of $20 million per year for the gross value of construction
activity in Managua. Thus, even a five-year rebuilding program would
require doubling the 1971 level of construction activity in Managua.
4.        The impact of the earthquake upon levels of output and employ-
ment is, fortunately, less than might have been expected given the mag-
nitude of the destruction of capital assets. Large scale manufacturing
activities were located almost entirely on the edges of the city and thus
were outside the zone of greatest destruction. In terms of employment
and output the major impact is upon the large stores and the small shops



-2-
which had been located in the central zone. Reconstruction activities
will partially offset the loss in employment in these areas. Govern-
ment offices and financial activities continue in temporary quarters
outside the seriously damaged area and in some cases in surrounding
towns. Thus levels of production that sank drastically immediately
after the earthquake are recovering rapidly even though the task of re-
placing lost physical assets will spread over several years. For the
12-month period of 19733 it is expected that output in Managua including
reconstruction activities, will be about 15 percent below the 1972 level
and in 1974 it is expected to recover close to the 1972 level. For the
country as a whole, GDP in 1973 may be about 9 percent below 1972 or
about 15 percent below the level it probably would have reached in 1973
without the earthquake.
5.        Public sector finances have been seriously affected by the
earthquake.  For 1973 and 1974 together, the loss in receipts is esti-
mated at $61 million, or about 18 percent of what otherwise might have
been expected. Additional reconstruction expenditure in the two-year period
are estimated at $29 million, raising the net budgetary impact to about $90
million. However, emergency tax measures introduced by the Government
(taxes on traditional exports and on civil servant salaries) will pro-
vide about $46 million and disbursements of earthquake reconstruction
loans should provide another $24 million.   It should be possible to
finance the remaining $20 million from dom6stic borrowing without unduly
inflating domestic demand and creating balance of payments problems.
6.        Nicaragua has a comfortable balance of payments position as a
consequence of a number of favorable factors - international reserves are
high, the prices of traditional exports are favorable and substantial
amounts of reconstruction assistance are being mobilized. Emergency im-
port requirements - foodstuffs, medicines, tents - have been met by grant
assistance. Exports will hardly be affected by the earthquake; last
year's widespread drought had a more important effect, but even so export
earnings in 1973 should be only slightly lower than last year. With prices
for coffee and beef remaining firm, cotton product;ion back to normal, and
manufacturing industry largely recovering its sales to other CACM coun-
tries, export earnings in 197L should be well above the 1972 level. Im-
ports are expected to rise even more, however, because of the requirements
of reconstruction. For 1973-74 together, a current account deficit of
$138 million is anticipated, compared to $44 million for 1971-72. However,
in the 1973-74 period Nicaragua's normal public capital account receipts
of $78 million will be supplemented by about $75 million in insurance pay-
ments and disbursements from reconstruction loans. This should be suffi-
cient to finance the projected higher current account deficit.
7.        Nicaragua's real per capita income increased considerably in
the post World-War II period to a level of $430 in 1970 and prior to the
earthquake was somewhat above the level for IDA eligibility. As a result



- 3 -
of the earthquake, per capita GNP in 1973 is expected to drop to about
$390 (calculated in comparable 1970 dollars, using the World Bank Atlas
method). Gross domestic product increased at an average annual rate of
about 6.4 percent (real terms) in the period 1946-71 while population
grew at 2.9 percent per year, resulting in annual per capita product
growth of about 3.4 percent.   The main determinant of growth was produc-
tion for export, particularly of cotton and coffee.   In common with many
other developing economies, Nicaragua experiences sharp swings in econo-
mic activity because of vagaries of the weather and drastic changes in
world prices for primary product exports. However, this characteristic
is gradually changing with the recent development of new exports, such
as simple manufactured goods and meat. Spurred by the rapid growth of
domestic incomes, the establishmentof the Central American Common Market
(CACM) and the Government's industrial incentives policy, manufacturing
increased its share in GDP from 12 percent in 1950-52 to 21 percent in
1969-71.  Preliminary estimates show real GDP growth of about 5 percent
in 1972.
8.        A reasonable investment effort was another important factor
contributing to the high growth rates over the last two decades. Gross
domestic investment increased from about 12 percent of GDP in the early
fifties to a peak of 21 percent in the mid-sixties and now stands at
about 18 percent of GDP, which is roughly comparable to average invest-
ment levels elsewhere in Central America. National savings financed a
substantial share of investment, but as a proportion of GDP declined
over the last two decades; hence external capital, mainly public and
publicly-guaranteed medium- and long-term loans, has become important,
accounting for about one-third of the financing of investment in recent
years.
9.        In spite of the rapid growth and the marked shift in the com-
position of output, transformation of the structure of the economy is
still at an early stage. This is reflected in the low productivity of
a large share of the labor force engaged in subsistence agriculture and
petty services, and by the continuing vulnerability of the economy to
events in the cotton sector. The core of the subsistence sector con-
sists of 50,000 farms of up to 7 hectares in size, covering roughly 3.5
percent of the farm area and supporting about one-third of the rural
population. A comparatively small number of farmers have benefitted
from a special credit program (Cr6dito Rural) operated by Banco Nacional
de Nicaragua (BNN), a publicly owned commercial bank. The Government is
exploring other ways to broaden the scope of the financial and technical
assistance to small and medium farmers.
10.       The benefits of Nicaragua's substantial economic growth have
been unevenly distributed.   Control of the economy remains in the hands
of a limited number of people.  The largest 1.5 percent of farms - equiva-
lent, probably, to an even smaller percentage of farmers - occupies about
14 percent of total farmland. In recent years, the Government started a
few programs aimed at improving rural living conditions. Foremost among
these are a USAID-financed rural electrification program through coopera-
tives,sponsored by the National Power Company (ENALUF), various land



- 4 -
titling and settlement schemes of the Agrarian Institute of Nicaragua
(IAN) and the construction of rural primary schools and health centers
with assistance from USAID. So far, the impact of these projects has
been small but they are clearly steps in the right direction.
11.       The public sector made a useful contribution to the diversi-
fication of the economy. In the early 1950's the Government, with
assistance from an IBRD economic mission, devised a comprehensive pro-
gram of policies and projects aimed at diversifying and strengthening
an economy which had just emerged from about 30 years of near-stagna-
tion. An increase in resources and a more active credit role of BNN,
the establishment of the National Development Institute (INFONAC), the
decision to join the CACM coupled with an aggressive industrial incen-
tives policy, and construction of roads, electric power and port facili-
ties stimulated private investment and output. The Government's devel-
opment effort also led to the creation of various new public institutions,
such as ENALUF in 1953, the Corinto Port Authority (CPA) in 1956, and
IAN in 1963.  W4hile ENALUF and CPA achieved high standards, the BNN,
INFONAC and the price support agency (INCEI) have encountered financial
problems because of inadequacies in both program planning and administra-
tion. A National Planning Office, which was established last year, still
has to be adequately staffed for the difficult job of judging sectoral
proposals in the context of national priorities and available resources.
12.       The creation of new public agencies, especially state enter-
prises such as the electric power company, resulted in considerable
expansion of the public sector's share in domestic production. The
fiscal performance of the Central Government, however, was character-
ized by a low level of tax revenues (9 percent of GDP in 1971), compara-
tively fast growth of current expenditures, and resulting periodic short-
ages of savings. Fiscal difficulties in 1970 were overcome by introduc-
tion of a general sales tax, which resulted in a substantial increase
in public revenues and savings.
External Financing
13.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided princi-
pally by USAID, the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Cen-
tral American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has made
loans for highways, agriculture, industry, rural electrification, hous-
ing, education and health. IDB is financing water and sewerage, higher
education, agriculture and transport. CABEI is financing projects with
a regional impact, principally in transport and industry and power inter-
connection. The past lending of these agencies is summarized below.
IDB is likely to continue to support the sectors which it financed in
the past, although somewhat more emphasis will 'be placed on transport, edu-
cation, power and telecommunications. AID expects to focus primarily on
project preparation in health, education and agriculture; new commitments
for project implementation will depend on the level of AID's funding by
the U.S. Government. CABEI's financing will follow closely the pattern
of the past, with lending concentrated in the transport and industrial
sectors.

14.       Loans from these agencies are usually on softer financial terms
than Bank loans. AID loans are for a term of 40 years with interest of
2 to 3 percent. IDB now plans to extend all of its loans to Nicaragua
from the Fund for Special Operations, such financing now carries a 2
percent interest rate and terms of up to 40 years with 10 years of grace.
The terms of CABEI loans - which often provide 100 percent financing of
local expenditures - vary in accordance with CABEI's sources of financing,
but generally contain a substantial concessionary element. USAID, which
held roughly one-third of the debt repayable in foreign currency at the
end of 1971, is Nicaragua's largest external creditor. Liabilities to
the Bank Group represented less than one-fifth of debt repayable in for-
eign currency.
15.       In financing its reconstruction program over the next several
years, Nicaragua must keep in mind the requirements of longer term debt
management. Nicaragua's publicly-guaranteed debt expanded considerably
in recent years. The outstanding balance of debt repayable in foreign
currency rose from $68 million at the end of 196L to $225 million at the
end of 1971, with a large part of commitments in this period accounted
for by foreign private banks and suppliers. Debt service payments in-
creased from about $7 million in 1965 to $31 million in 1971, the debt
service ratio rising from h.2 percent to 13.7 percent of export earnings.
Service payments fell slightly in absolute terms in 1972 and the service
ratio fell to 10.3 percent; this was partly due to a policy of lengthen-
ing the maturity structure of the debt. The additional borrowing re-
quired to finance reconstruction -- about $100 million spread over sev-
eral years -- will result in a substantial further increase in the out-
standing debt. If Nicaragua had to finance the reconstruction of Managua
on conventional terms in addition to its normal foreign financing require-
ments, its debt service ratio would climb to well over 20 percent by the
end of this decade. A major portion of the additional borrowing over
the next few years should therefore be on concessionary terms in order



- 6 -
to maintain Nicaragua's creditworthiness for further lending. Other
agencies are expected to provide most of the requested assistance on
concessionary terms and I recommend that the Bank Group participate
in this effort through the proposed IIA credit.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NICARAGUA
16.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of February 28, 1973, and notes on the execution
of on-going projects. Nicaragua has to date received 18 Bank loans and
one IDA credit totalling $104.8 million, net of cancellations. As of
February 28, 1973, a total of about $44.4 million remained to be disbursed
on four loans for education, water supply, power and ports. Consider-
able delays were initially encountered in the execution of the Educa-
tion Project, but progress is now satisfactory. The water supply
project was recently amended (R73-67) to meet the needs arising from
the earthquake; the most recent loans, for power and ports, became
effective only in March 1973.
17.       IFC made one investment in Nicaragua in 1967, in a new cotton
and synthetic fiber textile company (FABRITEX), consisting of a $1 mil-
lion loan (fully disbursed) and an equity participation of about $1.1
million equivalent. Marketing problems, partly associated with the dif-
ficulties in the operation of the Central American Common Market, resulted
in low sales, large inventories and a shortage of working capital. The
earthquake has further aggravated FABRITEX's financial situation. In
December 1972, IFC agreed to reschedule principal payments, and other
long-term lenders are considering similar action.
lo.       In the past, the Bank Group assisted Nicaragua in those areas
where it has special expertise and where finance on softer terms from
other external development agencies was unavailable. Thus, the Bank
lent for economic infrastructure such as power, ports and roads and,
to a lesser extent, for agriculture and social sectors such as water
supply and education. Bank lending was interrupted in 1969-71 because
of fiscal and balance of payments problems but, following a marked im-
provement in Central Government finances resulting from new sales taxes,
lending was resumed in 1972 as the country's development effort had
materially improved. Assuming a continued Nicaraguan effort to mobilize
public savings and considering the large reconstruction needs, we are
accelerating project preparation work.
19.       The Bank is considering several operat:ions in support of the
Government's export diversification policy. Two FAO missions which visited
Nicaragua in February 1972 identified projects for possible Bank assistance
in livestock and crop production. As a result, a Bank mission recently visited
Nicaragua in February 1973 to appraise a possible agricultural credit
project that I plan to submit to the Board in a few months. A UNDP/UN
mission is presently conducting groundwater investigations which may
result in Bank financing of tubewell development for irrigation in a
second agricultural credit loan in the mid-1970's. With respect to
industry, the Bank is considering channelling financing to Nicaragua
and the other Central American countries through the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). It is also planned to continue
assisting the development of physical and social infrastructure in
Nicaragua, including possible further reconstruction reauirements.

PART III - THE PROJECT
20.       The main features of the proposed reconstruction project are
summarized below. It was prepared and appraised in the field by various
Association missions during January/February 1973, which also assessed the
earthquake's effects on ongoing Bank projects in the water, power and
education sectors. In view of the complicated technical, economic and
political questions of how and where to reconstruct the capital city,
the Bank Group responded to the Nicaraguan Government's request and col-
laborated with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization
of American States by sponsoring an international panel of experts to
advise on these matters. The International Advisory Panel's report, a
copy of which is being distributed separately, was submitted to the
Nicaraguan Government on March 23, 1973.
21.        The purpose of the Panel was to assist the Government of
Nicaragua in reaching decisions as to the type, intensity and form of
reconstruction and future development to be permitted or fostered in
the Managua region. The Panel was also to review and analyze a draft
reconstruction plan which had been prepared by Mexican consultants,
financed by the Mexican Government. The report of the Panel concludes
that, with respect to the question of siting, no convincing alternative
locations had yet been identified where both the probability of future
earthquakes was significantly less than in Managua, and where the reduc-
tion in damage risks would be less than additional costs resulting from
relocation. Further studies might be able to identify such a location
and should be pursued. In the meantime, however, it was necessary to
move quickly in restoring essential services, and providing housing and
employment for displaced persons. Given these conditions, and the fact
that the large industrial establishments and most of the infrastructure
suffered little damage, the report recommends making continued use of
much of the existing site of Managua while reducing the population
density in the downtown area, and decentralizing the city by encouraging
the development of secondary towns and cities where refugees from Managua
have relocated.
22.       Specifically, the Panel recommended that:
- studies should continue urgently on locating less earthquake
prone site-s_sin ce rebo'nstruction would continue over several years and
location emphasis could be changed at a later stage.
- there should be greater dispersal both within the Managua
region and between Managua and other towns to reduce the danger of a
large part of the country's economic and administrative structure being
severely damaged by a single earthquake event;
- as much use as possible should be made of the buildings,
industry and infrastructure remaining in the Managua region while pro-
moting dispersal to other towns of new buildings, industries and serv-
ice activities which can be relocated without high economic cost;



-8-
- spatial planning of Managua should concentrate on much lower
densities in the central area with no high buildings apart from important
public buildings, before further sub-soil studies are available;
- better local building materials should be developed and cer-
tain structural design improvements introduced;
- new building codes and construction standards should be dev-
eloped as quickly as possible and emphasis put on their implementation.
23.       The report of the Panel and that of the Mexican team are cur-
rently being actively considered by the Nicaraguan authorities. Clear-
ance of the devastated area will not be completed until the end of 1973
and by that time the Nicaraguan Government will prepare a more compre-
hensive basic plan for the reconstruction and redevelopment of the
Managua region and its relation to fostering growth in other urban cen-
ters. An interim report as well as the final plan will be submitted for
review by an international advisory panel. Sub-soil testing in the
Managua area will be rapidly instituted to provide a basis for design
standards, particularly in the central area; proposals for standard
building codes and their implementation will be completed before June 30,
1973. The Government will consult with the Association on the results
of all these studies. Further, no new permanent structures of a nature
that would foreclose the options to which the plan will be addressed
will be licensed in the central area before the basic plan for redevel-
opment has been completed. Such structures include administrative build-
ings, markets and commercial centers and, more generally, high-rise or
high-density developments. This timetable for the planning effort thus
appears realistic both in terms of constraints and opportunities.
Project Description
24.       The proposed credit is part of a more comprehensive under-
taking of various national and international agencies to support the
Government of Nicaragua in its reconstruction efforts. It particularly
complements the activities of the IDB and USAID and takes full account of
the recommendation of the International Advisory Panel described above. Speci-
fically, the credit would help finance five sub-projects which are high priority
items in the Government's earthquake reconstruction program, including:
(i) sites and services, to accommodate 6,4OO low to middle-income fami-
lies displaced by the earthquake, about half of which will settle in
secondary cities and the remainder in the outskirts of Managua; (ii)
industrial credit, to help restore the output of the small and medium-
size industrial sectors and to generate new employment opportunities in
the secondary cities; (iii) education, to provide new facilities in
Managua at the secondary level, where almost all school buildings suf-
fered irreparable damage , and to establish a post-secondary technical
institute; (iv) water supply and (v) power, both to help restore and
repair existing installations and to extend the respective distribution



-9-
networks to take into account shifts of population and service areas.
The latter two sub-projects would at the same time help alleviate the
financial burden on the Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) and
on the Empresa Aguadora de Managua (AGUADORA), two Bank borrowers whose
revenues have been sharply reduced and who must make heavy expenditures
on repairs as a result of the earthquake.
Project Financing
25.       The total cost of the five sub-projects is estimated to be
$30.3 million, including a foreign exchange component of $16.6 million.
The cost of the individual sub-projects would be as follows:
($ millions)

TOTAL         30.3      13.7      16.6       20.0
The counterpart contribution of $10.3 million would be financed 60 percent
by the Central Government, 18 percent by the relevant public sector agenc-
ies and 12 percent by beneficiaries of the industrial credit
sub-project. Retroactive financing of up to $1.85 million is included to
cover expenditures incurred since January 1, 1973 for the power and water
supply sub-projects and since March 1, 1973 for the education sub-project.
Sites and Services
26.       $8.0 million of the proposed credit would be used to provide
housing for families displaced by the earthquake. The sub-project
includes: (i) 2,750 residential sites in the outskirts of Managua;
3,250 sites for families settling in four secondary cities; and 0oo
sites the location of which will be determined after a further review
of the refugee situation; (ii) community facilities (primary schools,
health centers, community centers, recreational space and markets) for
all sites; (iii) a building materials fund for self-help housing con-
struction; and (iv) technical assistance, engineering design and con-
struction supervision.
27.       The four secondary cities, which received the bulk of the
refugees and in which some 75,000 refugees still remain, are also the
cities on which the industrial credit financing would focus, thereby
generating 1,200 - 1,500 new industrial jobs for those taking up perma-
nent residence. The sub-project would provide housing for about one-
third of refugee families who have thus far indicated their intention
to stay in the secondary cities. The 2,750 service sites in the out-
skirts of Managua would accommodate some 15 percent of the 100,000 refu-
gees who have now returned to the city. Most of the remaining 85 per-
cent are being given provisional wooden shelters under a US$3.0 million
USAID grant.



- 1C -
28.       Each serviced lot would be 7.5 x 14 m, clustered into 14 units
around a small open space. A fundamental principle adopted in design-
ing the layouts was the need to integrate the sites selected into the
existing urban areas. Schematic site plans indicating transportation
lines, cluster arrangements and community facilities were prepared and
sketch designs of infrastructure were drafted and reviewed with repre-
sentatives of the National Housing Bank and the water supply and power
authorities in Nicaragua. Given the still fluid refugee situation, site
plans were prepared so that development could be staged in units of 250
lots each.
29.       Careful analysis of the special circumstances in Nicaragua
indicated a need to modify the usual sites and services approach. Al-
though considerable building has been done in the past in Nicaragua by
self-help methods, the particular techniques and building materials
employed were largely reponsible for the extensive damage to housing
during the recent earthquake, as were the construction techniques and
poor quality materials used by the construction industry. Therefore,
5,500 of the lots would include a 20 m2 earthquake resistent shelter
and sanitary core unit. Construction of the core unit by contract
would permit early occupancy in a safe shelter, which could later be
enlarged by carefully supervised self-help methods. On the remaining
500 lots, the sanitary core would be provided, but the shelter would
be constructed by the owners themselves with intensive technical assist-
ance to assure that structural designs and building materials are earth-
quake resistant. This would serve as a pilot project to develop and
foster improved self-help construction techniques, which should have
widespread application elsewhere in Nicaragua.
30.        The total cost of the sub-project is estimated at $13 million,
of which the proposed credit would finance 61 percent. Government partici-
pation, in the form of land and inputs for infrastructure and community
facilities, would amount to $5.0 million. Land itself would constitute
nearly one-quarter of the Government's contribution, and land acquisi-
tion is already underway. The $5.0 million contribution from the pro-
posed credit would be used by the Government to establish a special low
income housing fund to be administered by the National Housing Bank
(BVN). BVN is an autonomous Government agency established in 1966 to con-
struct and finance housing units in both the public and private sectors.
This would be the first Bank Group operation with BVN, which is a soundly
managed institution with a healthy financial situation. BVN will em-
ploy additional staff, including a resident engineer, three foremen, two
inspectors and two social workers per 1,000 lots, all of whom will reside
on site. BVN would also employ with the approval of the Association a
senior architect, an engineer and a sociologist who would be exclusively
responsible for the implementation of the sites and services program;
their services would be financed under the proposed credit.



31.       Families would be offered mortgages at 20 years with 5 percent
interest, and ownership would be transferred to the family after the
first self-help room is built, inspected and approved by BVN. Monthly
payments would amount to about $10.90 for a lot in Managua and $10.10
in the secondary cities. Applicant families would qualify for lots
chronologically after satisfying two criteria:   (i) that they were dis-
placed by the earthquake and (ii) that they have monthly household incomes
not exceeding $155.  About 30 percent of the lots would be reserved for
families with monthly household incomes of less than $71.
32.      Mortgage payments from sites and service beneficiaries as well
as debt service payments, from ENALUF, AGUADORA and INFONAC, would be
channelled into the housing fund in order to enable BVN to carry on a
further low-income housing program. This represents a departure from
the Association's standard approach of not seeking to specify the use
to be made of IDA "counterpart funds" but I consider this justified in
view of the Government's desire to carry out a substantially larger and
continuing program in the field of sites and services work and other
low-cost housing.
33.       Disbursements for civil works contracts would be against an
agreed percentage of the contractors' periodic statements of work per-
formed, substantiated by invoices and certification by the engineer
in charge of construction supervision. Bids for civil works would be
invited for either individual contracts or one single contract, under
the Association's procedures for international competitive bidding. For
engineering consulting and technical assistance costs, disbursements
would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures.
Industrial Credit
34.       This sub-project is designed to complement the sites and
services program of the Government by providing an estimated 1,200 -
1,500 permanent new jobs for refugees in the secondary cities. It is
proposed that $2.5 million of the proposed credit be onlent by the
Government of Nicaragua to the National Development Bank (INFONAC) to
help finance sub-loans for (i) industrial sites and services in second-
ary cities; and (ii) plant, equipment and buildings for about 30 to 50
medium-sized industries, which have already been identified and which
are also located in the secondary cities.
35.       INFONAC was established as an autonomous Government agency in
1952, and in 1955 the Bank made two small loans totalling $2.0 million
to assist INFONAC in financing projects in the agricultural and power
sectors.  Although INFONAC has some institutional weaknesses, including
weak coordination and poor information records, it nevertheless has the basic
capacity to execute the industrial sub-loans satisfactorily, provided separate
accounts for the IA credit are maintained and carefully audited and
close supervision is provided by the Association. INFONAC is planning
to engage consultants to formulate a program to improve its internal
organization, operating procedures, research and development program
and accounting system, particularly to separate the accounting of its
industrial and agricultural portfolios.



- 12 -
36.       The Government would onlend to INFONAC at 6-3/4 percent for
12 years including a 3 year grace period, and sub-loans to enterprises
would be for up to 10 years at 8-3/h percent interest. The average size
sub-loan would be about $7b,000; sub-loans exceeding $100,000 would re-
quire prior Association approval. The Association would not finance
more than 50 percent of the total cost of any particular industrial
project; the minimum equity required would be 25 percent and an appro-
priate debt-equity ratio would be required for each project.
37.    With regard to procurement, INFONAC would not require formal inter-
national competitive bidding from its sub-borrowers, but would satisfy
itself that the equipment and machinery to be financed meet the techni-
cal requirements of the project and are competitive with goods of simi-
lar quality.
Education
38.       An estimated 85 percent of the secondary school capacity of
Managua was destroyed by the earthquake; practically the only public
schools left standing are two general secondary schools and the teacher
training college, all recently constructed under Loan No. 532-NI. It
is proposed that $2.0 million of the proposed credit be used to (i)
construct 100 prefabricated classrooms in four temporary schools in the
outskirts of Managua to accommodate 8,000 students in two shifts; (ii)
construct, furnish, and equip two permanent multilateral secondary schools
in Managua to accommodate 5,800 students in two shifts; and (iii) construct
and furnish a post-secondary technical institute with a capacity of ,oo
student places in technical fields and 100 in business education. Recon-
struction needs at the university and primary eclucation levels will be
met by the IDB and AID, respectively, except for those primary school
facilities which are part of the sites and services component of the
proposed credit.
39.        Item (i) would permit the Ministry of Education to open schools
in and around Managua in June 1973, resulting in only a 3-1/2 month loss
of time out of the normal academic year. The prefabricated classrooms
would be of the kind which can easily be disassembled and later relocated
inrural areas after the more permanent facilities are constructed. Suit-
able sites for the four schools have been selected and surveyed, bidding
and contract documents reviewed by the Association, and bids for procure-
ment and installation of the temporary facilities invited and evaluated
under direct supervision of the Association. In addition to permanently
restoring much of the secondary school capacity of Managua, the two new
multilateral schools under item (ii) would expand further into the edu-
cation system the diversified curriculum first introduced under Loan
No. 532-NI. -'This curriculum better relates secondary education to the
needs of the economy by including practical subjects such as industrial
arts and home economics and pre-vocational streams in electricity, mech-
anics and business education. The post-secondary technical institute
would train workers who would provide an urgently needed bridge between
University graduates and skilled workers. Suitable sites for items (ii)
and (iii) would be selected in consultation with the Association, taking
into account the recommendations of the International Advisory Panel.



- 13 -
40.       This part of the project will be executed by the project unit
of the Ministry of Education, which is implementing the first Bank-
financed education project (NI-532); UNESCO's school building center in
Mexico (mONESCAL) will assist the project unit in implementing this pro-
ject. To this end, during the first twelve months of the project execu-
tion it will second an architect to the Ministry of Education.
41.       The total cost of the education sub-project is estimated at
$2.9 million, of which the Association would finance 69 percent.
Retroactive financing of $150,000 is included to cover expenditures in-
curred since March 1, 1973 in connection with the prefabricated class-
rooms. To expedite project implementation, while assuring competitive
prices, bidding procedures for the prefabricated classrooms, estimated
to cost $0.5 million, have been simplified. The Government has already
advertised the procurement of the temporary facilities through announce-
ments in local newspapers and notices to foreign embassies; bidding and
contract documents have been reviewed by IDA and are now being finalized.
All contracts for civil works and equipment approved after loan signing
will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding follow-
ing the standard procedures specified in the Bank's guidelines.
Water Supply
42.       Managua's principal supplier of potable water is AGUADORA, a
public enterprise established in 1932, which served some 72 percent of
the city's population before the December earthquake. AGUADORA is a
well-run institution to which the Bank Group has made one credit and one
loan. The earthquake severely damaged pipelines, service connections,
reservoirs, pumping stations and AGUADORA's administration and warehouse
buildings, and is responsible for a loss of about 50 percent of AGUADORA's
former subscribers. $1.0 million of the proposed credit would be allo-
cated to cover 80 percent of local and foreign costs of selected civil
works and equipment and supplies for repair and rehabilitation. It is
further proposed that in order to help alleviate the financial burden
on AGUADORA resulting from the drop in revenues and the cost of repair
and rehabilitation work, $1.5 million of the proposed credit be allocated
to cover 80 percent of the local cost of civil works being performed
under Loan No. 808-NI. The Government has already agreed to make AGUADORA
a loan to finance the remainder of its cash flow deficit, estimated to
total $3.2 million during the period 1973-75.
43.       The Association's funds would be onlent by the Government of
Nicaragua to AGUADORA at a term of 20 years, including six years of grace.
In view of AGUADORA's present financial situation, no interest would be
charged during the grace period. However, interest would be payable at
7-1/4 percent from the seventh year onward.
44.                      Civil works contracts related to service reser-
voirs and the unstable embankment at Lake Asososca, and the procurement
of selected equipment and supplies, have already been negotiated because
of their emergency nature. An amount of $800,000 of retroactive financ-
ing is included to finance such expenditures incurred since January 1,
1973. All other works and equipment would be procured by international
competitive bidding.



- 14 -
45.       In order to help meet the needs of the refugees who fled to
neighboring suburban areas and to improve living conditions mainly in
low-income residential areas hitherto unserved or underserved with pot-
able water,   the project being financed under Loan No. 808-NI has al-
ready been amended (see Memorandum from the President R73- 67, April 10, 1973).
Power
46.        Practically all public electric service in Nicaragua is pro-
vided by ENALUF, a well-managed autonomous public corporation established in
1954. The Bank has made eight loans for power since 1953, aggregating
$66.3 million, which have assisted in financing practically all of the
expansion of ENALUF's generation and transmission facilities. The earth-
quake caused some damage to ENALUF's thermal plant on the south shore of
Lake Managua, to adjoining substations and to Managua's distribution net-
work; the repair of these installations is estimated to cost about $1.7
million. Extension of the distribution network and expansion of some
substations to accommodate that part of the population and small industry
and commercial enterprises which have moved to areas surrounding Managua
will cost an additional $1.4 million. The earthquake has also caused a
large cash flow deficit, estimated at $7.6 million for 1973/74, resulting
from a loss of about 30,000 customers and increasing operating costs due
to higher fuel consumption.
47.       In addition to the $3.1 million of repair and rehabilitation
and extension expenditures described above, ENALUF now requires assist-
ance in carrying out some of its ordinary construction activities which
were not included in the last Bank Loan (840-NI of June 28, 1972) since
at that time it was expected to be able to cover these expenditures out
of its own resources. Adding $3.6 million for that purpose, ENALUF's
new financing requirements for its construction program come to $6.7
million. It is proposed to cover 75 percent of these costs, or $5 mil-
lion, out of the reconstruction credit; the remainder will be financed
through local borrowing.
h8.       The $5.0 million would be relent by the Government to ENALUF
for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years that would
be interest free because of ENALUF's difficult financial situation.
Interest would be payable at 7-1/h percent interest from the sixth year
forward.
49.       Existing contracts relating to Lake Managua thermal plant
and associated substations have been extended to include emergency re-
pair work. These contracts have been reviewed by the Association and
$900,000 is included in the proposed credit to finance retroactively
repair work undertaken since January 1, 1973. All new equipment con-
tracts approved after credit signing would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding and contracting of consultants' serv-
ices would follow normal Bank Group procedures. Disbursements for civil
works contracts would be made against 40 percent of the total works per-
formed. Disbursements for equipment and materials would be for 100 per-
cent of c.i.f. costs (if imported) or 95 percent of the ex-factory cost
(if procured locally).

Procurement and Disbursement
50.       Procurement and disbursement procedures for each sub-project
have been described above. Whenever normal international competitive
bidding is employed for the procurement of goods, in accordance with the
Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Develop-
ment, Central American Common Market countries would receive a margin of
preference in bid evaluation of 50 percent of the applicable external
tariff or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever is the lower. Annex
III summarizes the disbursement schedule for each sub-project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Nicaragua and the Association, the draft Project Agreements between
the Association and Banco de la Vivienda, Empresa Aguadora de Managua,
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza, Instituto de Fomento Nacional, res-
pectively, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION                               P    2
Loan No.
532     Education Project:  US$4 million of April 19, 1968. Closing
Date: June 30, 1973.
The implementation of this project has been scheduled in three
phases. Five schools to be built during the first phase have
been completed and are in use except one. Of the six schools
to be built during the second phase, two have been completed
and the other four have been contracted. Construction of eight
schools during the third phase is scheduled to start in August-
September 1973. The project is expected to be completed by
December 1974, about two years behind the original schedule,
and the closing date will have to be extended from June 1973
by some 18 months. The delays in implementation are mainly
due to lack of expertise in the project unit, and financial
problems. Adequate budget allocations have now been made,
and the project unit is being strengthened. No cost over-
runs are foreseen.
808     Second Water Supply Project:  US$6.9 million of March 7, 1972.
Closing Date: September 30, 1975.
This loan became effective in April 1972; it has been amended
on April 20 in order to meet changed conditions in the service
area resulting from the earthquake of December 23, 1972 (Memo-
randum from the President, R73-67).
840     Eighth Power Project: US$24 million of June 28, 1972.    Closing
Date: March 31, 1977.
This loan became effective March 30, 1973.
879     Second Port Project:  US$11 million of February 2, 1973. Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
This loan became effective on March 23, 1973. In spite of some
diversion of effort from the port project due to the Managua
earthquake, project execution remains essentially on schedule
and the Borrower and Guarantor are proceeding satisfactorily
with other actions required by the Loan Documents. With ap-
proval of the Bank, stone for the coastal defense works will be
provided by a force-account operation instead of by contract,
since efforts to interest contractors in operating the quarry
were unsuccessful.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the un-
derstanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
