SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Somalia, one of the poorest countries in Africa with a per capita
income of only about US$50-60, has a very limited budget with a current
deficit.
ii.       A diversity of civil service procedures, school programs and
written languages results from combining former Italian and British terri-
tories. An urgent need is unification and improvement of the education
and training facilities. These are at an early stage of development be-
cause of lack of an agreed script for the Somali language, low population
density, difficulties in transportation, and scarcity of teachers, teaching
materials and school construction and equipment.
iii.      The present project is designed to improve quality, reduce wastage
and achieve economies by consolidating existing institutions and make the
system better geared to manpower needs. It would assist teacher training,
secondary education, technical education and agricultural training and
help major reforms, currently being carried out by the Somali government,
in all these fields. It would provide the additional facilities to meet
the minimum skilled manpower requirements of the monetary sector of the
country, including Somalization, by 1980.
iv.       The project would comprise one new secondary school; extensions
to the National Teacher Education Center, 10 secondary schools and two tech-
nical and commercial schools; and 8 agricultural mobile training units. It
would provide 1,690 student places.
V.        There would be an adequate supply of qualified students for the
project schools. Staff for the institutions included in the project will
be available or provided by technical assistance financed by multilateral
and/or bilateral sources.
vi.       Accommodation schedules and equipment lists have been reviewed
and are acceptable. Sites for all the institutions have been selected
and are satisfactory except for one school for which adequate land will
be acquired within six months from the signing of the Credit Agreement.
vii.      A project unit to be established within the Ministry of Education
would be responsible for the implementation of the project. Professional
services would be provided by technical assistance, financed as a part of
the project, to strengthen the project unit and the school building section
of the Ministry of Public Works.
viii.     Construction is expected to be completed within approximately 3
years from the signing of thte Credit Agreement. Contracts for construction
and for furniture and equipment would be grouped in appropriate bid packages
and awarded through international competitive bidding. It is unlikely that
foreign contractors will be interested in bidding for the civil works.
Domestic manufacturers of furniture would be awarded a margin of prefer-
ence equivalent to the existing custons duty applicable to competing im-
ports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.



- ii -
ix.       The project is suitable as a basis for a Development Credit of
US$3.3 million equivalent to Somalia. It would cover 90% of the total
estimated cost of the project, equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange
component and about 60% of local currency expenditure.



I. INTRODUICTION
Thie Request
1.01      In May, 1969, a Unesco mission reviewed Somalia's educational
objectives and identified priority projects. In April, 1970, with the
assistance of a Unesco project preparation mission, the government pre-
pared and presented to Bank/IDA a project for financial assistance.
1.02      The project was appraised in August-September, 1970, by a mis-
sion composed of Messrs. G. Pennisi (economist), J. Theodores (architect),
M. Krohn (technical educator, ILO), D. Martens (agricultural education,
FAO) and A. Cespedes (general educator, consultant). During appraisal,
the proposed project was revised, in agreement with the government, to
reduce capital and recurrent costs.
1.03      The proposed project, estimated to cost US$3.7 million, is
designed to improve the quality of Somalia's education and training, to
achieve economies in recurrent expenditure, to consolidate existing insti-
tutions and to make the system better geared to the manpower needs of the
country. It would assist major reforms in teacher training, secondary edu-
cation, technical and vocational education and agricultural training. It
would consist of:
(i) the construction and equipping of:
(a) an extension to the National Teacher Education
Center to accommodate elementary and intermediate
teacher training;
(b) one new secondary sclhool;
(c) extensions to 10 secondary schools to provide
laboratories, workshops, special rooms and libraries;
(d)  extensions to two technical and commercial schools to
add new courses and introduce new teaching methods.
(ii) eight mobile units for agricultural training; and
(iii) technical assistance for project implementation and for
launching the new teacher training program.
Socio-economic Background
1.04      Somalia is at an early stage of economic and social development.
The population is estimated at 2.8 million; some 60% is nomadic. The per
capita income is estimated to be US$50-60. More than 40% of the population
is below 14 years of age. The people are largely homogeneous in race, cul-
ture and religion, and the Somali language is almost universally spoken but
does not have an agreed script. Hence, foreign languages (Arabic, Italian
and English) are being used in instruction.



1.05      The economy is largely based on subsistence farming and animal
husbandry. Apart from providing a living for about 80% of the population,
livestock represents some 50% of the export earnings of Somalia. Bananas
and sugar cane are the most important commercial crops. Diversification
of agricultural production is slowly taking place, with grapefruit, rice,
grain-crops and cotton having reasonably good prospects for expansion.
For this diversification to develop and for better animal production to be
achieved, improvement of the agricultural extension service and of the
expertise of the agricultural labor force is needed.
1.06      The small monetary sector of the economy suffers from lack of
entrepreneurial ability and qualified manpower. Although employment op-
portunities are growing at a very slow rate, the existing labor force
needs retraining and upgrading. Agriculture, fishery and animal husbandry
are to be the focus of development. Mining prospects appear now to be
promising. Manufacturing needs to improve its efficiency. In all these
areas and in services and public administration, efficiency and productiv-
ity can increase and the use of foreign and domestic resources improve only
if the country has a better supply of trained manpower.
1.07      The prospects for future economic development in Somalia depend
largely on the success with which the government can concentrate local and
external resources on the most promising areas of the economy. In recent
years, the administration has made significant progress toward eliminating
its recurrent deficit and it seems possible that the recurrent budget could
be balanced within the next few years. This would allow all external as-
sistance to be used for development purposes.
II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
2.01      In spite of government efforts to expand education since inde-
pendence, growth has been slow, mainly due to the lack of an agreed script
for the Somali language, regional differences in systems of instruction, a
high rate of nomadism and difficulties in transportation. The amalgamation
of the Italian and British systems is not yet complete. The improvement of
the system is further hindered by scarcity of financial resources, qualified
teachers and teaching materials and equipment. Hence, enrollment ratios, as
percentages of the relevant age groups, are among the lowest in Africa (Annex
1).
2.02      Most school buildings are primitive and inadequate for modern in-
struction. Maintenance is lacking; furniture and equipment are poor and in-
appropriate. Some elementary schools have only chalkboards and a few books.
Most of the intermediate and secondary schools were built without laboratories,
science being taught only by lectures.
2.03      Curricula are highly academic at all levels of education.  Recent-
ly, a major curriculum reform was initiated, whereby elementary and inter-
mediate education would become two cycles of primary education and secondary
education would offer a diversified curriculum with practical subjects.



- 3 -
2.04      These changes form part of the "Proposed Educational Development
Plan", prepared with Unesco assistance and under active consideration by
the government. This plan envisages: (i) expansion of elementary and inter-
mediate education; (ii) improvement of secondary education; (iii) reform of
the training methods of technical education; (iv) reorganization of adminis-
tration; and (v) application of cost savings techniques to make the growth
of the education system within the financial capability of the government.
Enrollment targets for 1980-81 would be: 49,400 for elementary education;
26,000 for intermediate education; 10,500 for secondary, including technical,
education. These quantitative targets approximate the supply the education
system should produce to meet the manpower demand. The proposed project
would assist the implementation of the plan.
2.05      The structure of education has three levels:  elernentary, inter-
mediate and secondary, each of four years (Charts 1 & 2). Arabic is the
language of instruction at the elementary level and English is slowly re-
placing Italian at the intermediate and secondary levels. There are three
public technical schools, with 3 and 4-year courses, after intermediate edu-
cation. A secondary agricultural school is being built and is expected to
be in full operation by 1974. The National Teacher Education Center (NTEC)
which trains secondary teachers and the National University are the only post-
secondary institutions in the country.
2.06      Administration, highly centralized in the Ministry of Education,
lacks efficiency. The present organization allows duplication of functions
and overlapping of responsibilities but a major reorganization of the Minis-
try is in progress as indicated by the new organization chart included in
the "Proposed Educational Development Plan" (Chart 3).   The planning de-
partment requires substantial improvements in staffing for better utiliza-
tion of Unesco long-term assistance. The school inspectorate and the regional
offices of education need better definition of functions and responsibilities
in order to carry out effective supervision. In-service courses should be
arranged at NTEC.
2.07      An improved administration could have a major impact in making
good a general problem affecting the whole education system:  the low use of
staff and facilities. The expected increase in enrollments will by itself
require a more intensive use of facilities. The average number of students
per teacher should be increased. Currently, the average student/teacher
ratios are 35:1 at the elementary level, 24:1 at the intermediate level and
20:1 at the secondary. In comparable African countries these ratios are
about 45:1 at the elementary level and 30:1 at the secondary level. The
limited number of qualified teachers will probably require the ratio of
students per teacher to increase. The government is studying how to im-
prove the utilization of staff.
2.08      Elementary education enrollment increased by 53% in the last
decade while doubling in most African countries. In 1969-70 about 29,300
pupils, or approximately 8% of the relevant age group, attended elementary



- 4 -
schools 1/ (Annexes 2 & 3). Growth has been sluggish, not only for the
reasons given in para 2.01, but mainly because of the government policy,
from 1965 to 1969, of controlling elementary enrollment in order to ex-
pand intermediate and secondary education. The government now intends to
devote more attention to the quantitative and qualitative growth of ele-
mentary education.
2.09      Intermediate education has grown rapidly, with enrollment increas-
ing from 2,800 in 1960/61 to 14,300 in 1969/70, equivalent to 5% of the re-
levant age group. Although retention rates are good, the quality of in-
struction requires improvement. A high percentage of teachers is unqualified
and most of the teachers qualified by government standards need retraining
in English, the new language of instruction.
2.10      General secondary education enrollment is still equivalent to less
than 2% of the relevant age group as compared to:
Ethiopia        Tanzania         Uganda        Kenya         Zambia
1970            1970            1969          1968         1968
3.4%            2.4%             5%            8%         10.5%
It has increased from 750 in 1960/61 to 3,900 in 1970 and is expected to
reach 9,000 in 1980/81.  The quality of instruction is unsatisfactory.
45% of the teachers are expatriate, provided mostly under bilateral aid,
and about 50% of the remainder are unqualified by government standards.
The curriculum has been unsuited to the country's needs, being mainly aca-
demic and geared toward post-secondary education abroad. A new curriculum
is being introduced. Its major feature is the inclusion of options in agri-
culture, industrial arts, commerce and home economics.
2.11      Teacher training for secondary teachers is carried out at NTEC
(para. 2.05). In 1969/70, enrollment was 180 of which 60 were in a one-year
program for intermediate school teaching. Regular pre-service elementary
and intermediate teacher training was discontinued in 1967 due to lack of
financial resources and physical facilities. Intermediate and secondary
school graduates, without training in teaching techniques, are employed
directly as elementary teachers. Although about 120 unqualified elementary
teachers per year receive in-service training, the lack of pre-service
training reduces the quality of elementary and intermediate education.
The extensions to NTEC, included in the proposed project, would provide
permanent facilities for pre-service elementary and intermediate teacher
training.
2.12      Technical education is given in three public technical schools,
with a total of 400 students. The Mogadishu school provides 4-year courses
1/   This compares, for 1969-70, with:  Ethiopia 12.5%; Tanzania 35%; Uganda
45%; Kenya 65%.



- 5 -
in mechanical and electrical engineering. The Technical Institutes offer
3-year courses at the post-intermediate level in general and automotive
mechanics and electricity (in Burao) and in carpentry (in Hargeisa). Ex-
cept in the Technical Institute in Burao, which was established with bila-
teral aid from the Federal Republic of Germany, equipment and facilities
are old and inadequate. Curricula are outmoded and over 50% of the teachers
are expatriates. Workshop instructors are insufficiently qualified. An
Italian private school trains quantity surveyors in a 4-year course (grades
9-12).
2.13      Commercial education is given in three schools with a total enroll-
ment of about 200. The public Clerical Training Center (CTC) at Hargeisa
provides a two year course (grades 9 and 10) for clerks and typists. The
government intends to upgrade the course to a four year program. Courses
in accounting are given in a private secondary school (grades 9-12) and in
the Somali Institute of Public Administration.
2.14      The National University, established in 1969, has an enrollment
of more than 1,000 students, mostly part-time. Full-time attendance in
the two existing schools, Law and Economics, is estimated at 220. The
National University plans to open Schools of Agriculture, Veterinary Science,
Engineering, in the seventies to accommodate 2,000 students. Some 1,500
Somalis are on post-secondary fellowships abroad, mainly in Italy and in
Eastern European countries.
2.15      In summary, Somalia is improving her educational system by focus-
s-~'ng her educational planning for a qualitative and quantitative advance at
all levels of education (para 2.04), but requires to upgrade the adminis-
tration and inspection functions of the Ministry and raise the quality of
teaching. The present project would assist in achieving the goals of the
plan by (i) eliminating a major bottleneck in teacher training; (ii) pro-
viding adequate facilities for the implementation of a diversified second-
ary school curriculum; (iii) permitting a more practical technicians' and
skilled workers' training; and (iv) expanding farmers' training. The
schools improved under the project would cater for all elementary and
intermediate teacher training and for about 80% of the enrollments in sec-
ondary, technical and commercial education.
III. MANPOWER NEEDS AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Quantitative Aspect
3.01      A limited manpower survey in 1968, covering about 48,000 wage
earners (Annex 4), estimated the total labor force at about 900,000 with
80% engaged in animal husbandry, agriculture and fishery. Total wage
employment in medium and large size establishments in 1968 was estimated
at about 65,000 or 7% of the labor force, with some 58,000 in public and
private civilian employment and 7,000 in military employment. Projections
of wage employment in medium large units based on the 1968 stock must be



considered only as a minimum requirement since thtey exclude smaller units
and self-employment.  The compositioii of civili ha  wage employment in 1968
and 1980 is given in Anniex 5 aind suumiarized below:

Middle level                  6                            9.700 (12%)
2. Technicians (agriculture, transport,
telecommunications, etc.)             4,200 ( 7%)      3.8         6,600 ( 8%)
3. Clerical and sales workers            3,200 ( 5%)       3.3        4,700 ( 6%)
4. Craftsmen and skilled workers        11,700 (20%)       2.4        15,500 (19%)
5. Semi-skilled and unskilled
workers                              32,000 (56%)       1.9       40,000 (50%)

I as a % of II                       6                            7
The projection to 1980 was made on the basis of past trends, future short
trends and on a long term conservative extrapolation.
3.02      Two major inter-related problems are highlighted by the first (1963)
and second (1968) manpower surveys and by other studies: (i) the unemployment
in major towns: and (ii) the low educational qualifications at all levels of
employment. Unemployment data indicate that job seekers are as much as 30%
of the labor force in Mogadishu and more than 35% in Kisimayo. Most are
semi-skilled and unskilled workers, coming from the traditional sector of
the economy. The absence of sufficient employment opportunities in the
monetary sector poses economic and social problems. A series of low cost
public works programs, mainly in agriculture and road construction and main-
tenance, initiated by the government in November 1969, created some 2,500
new productive jobs by the spring of 1970. However, these are only stop-gap
measures and the only long-term effect on unemployment will derive from im-
proving production, efficiency and the basic infrastructure, including edu-
cation and training, in rural areas.



3.03      In urban wage employment only 570, including 360 Somalis, of the
professional, technical and related workers, had a university education.
Some 30% of the groups often requiring secondary education (categories 1-3
in para. 3.01) were estimated to have completed grade 12. About 1,500 of
the stock of middle level technicians had received some pre-service train-
ing. Most skilled workers did not have any formal training. There is,
therefore, an urgent need to upgrade the educational background of the
Somali high and middle level manpower.
3.04      It is estimated that the future minimum additional requirements
of the labor market and the needs of the next level of education should be:
Output educational level            Period 1968 - 1975       Period 1975 - 1980
(aggregate)             (aggregate)
1. Degree or equivalent                                 4,800
2. Completed secondary education             4,500                    7,000
(grade 12)
3. Completed intermediate education         21,000                   21,000
(grade 8)
4. Completed primary education              31,000                   53,000
(grade 4)
To achieve these output targets, enrollment targets should be as shown in
Annex 6, which agrees with the proposed long-term educational plan of the
Somali government (paras. 2.04 and 2.14). However, the government's element-
ary education target (49,000 by 1981) should be revised and expanded to
63,400 in order to provide in the long run sufficient intake for secondary
education. The government has already indicated its intention to give more
emphasis to elementary schools (para. 2.04). Other needs exist in the areas
of teacher training, secondary, technical, commercial and agricultural edu-
cation.
3.05      Teacher Training.  Of the 1,300 elementary and intermediate
teachers, only about 750 are qualified. In-service elementary teacher
training is being conducted with Unicef assistance but there are no faci-
lities for pre-service training for teachers in elementary and intermediate
schools. To staff these schools with qualified teachers, pre-service train-
ing requirements amount to about 1,500 by 1981 (Annex 7) and an extension
to the National Teacher Education Center to provide an annual output of
120 elementary and 65 intermediate teachers is therefore needed. At the
secondary level, full Somalization of the teaching staff is expected by
1977/78 since NTEC would provide an output of 40-50 secondary teachers
per year (Annex 8). The project would assist gradual Somalization of teach-
ers at all levels to be completed by the end of the decade.



-8-
3.06      Secondary Education.  Existing secondary schools and those being
built under self-help schemes or with EEC assistance 1/, will be sufficient
to cater for the projected enrollment expansion in the seventies, if the
average class size is gradually raised to 35 pupils. Only one new second-
ary school, in Mogadishu, is included in the project. This would accomo-
date enrollments now in facilities that would revert to use as primary
schools. In addition, 10 existing secondary schools need laboratories,
workshops and special rooms to implement a diversified curriculum that
would include practical subjects (paras. 2.03, 2.10, 2.15). These addi-
tions would provide only a very moderate expansion in terms of student
places. They would, however, improve the regional distribution of educa-
tional opportunities and reduce the need for boarding. It is estimated that
in 1975, 16% of the secondary students would be boarders as opposed to 25%
in 1969. This would result in an 8-10% reduction in unit recurrent costs,
at constant prices, for secondary students. In 1978, only 12% of the sec-
ondary school students would be boarders.
3.07      Technical and Commercial Education.  Expanded telecommunication
facilities will create a need for about 15-20 telecommunication technicians
per year. Building construction and civil engineering technicians are in
great demand in the government and in the private sector; information on
the Short-Term Development Plan indicates that in the government and para-
statal organizations alone some 150 construction technicians are needed by
1974 and a long-term private and public demand can be conservatively quan-
tified at 30-40 per year. Mechanical and electrical engineering technicians
are also in demand as indicated by the good employment records of the grad-
uates of Mogadishu technical school. Training for automotive technicians is
necessitated by the gradual mechanization of transportation. Qualified ac-
countants and secretaries are in short supply in all the sectors of the
economy.
3.08      To raise efficiency and productivity in industry, the training
profile of the skilled workers requires improvement. Initial government
proposals were for the establishment of a National Vocational Training
Center. On cost effectiveness grounds, these proposals were revised to
provide short courses for upgrading skilled workers in the technical schools
of Mogadishu and Hargeisa during afternoons and vacations (when school
classes are not held); establishment of trade tests; and setting up of a
"tracer" system to follow up the employment of those trained in the schools.
A "tracer" system would assist the schools in determining courses for which
the needs are greatest. Some 800-1,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers
per year could be upgraded and/or retrained.
1/   The European Economic Community (EEC) is building and equipping 8
schools (intermediate, secondary and agricultural) for a total of
about So. Sh. 27 million. The project is expected to be completed
in 1972.



3.09      Agricultural Education.  Somalia's continu:ing development depends
chiefly upon agricultural and livestock production. Currently, the exten-
sion service, including some 160 extension agents and 390 vaccinators,
mostly untrained, can reach only a small percentage of the farming and pas-
toral population. In the mid-seventies, the EEC-financed agricultural sec-
ondary school is expected to provide an adequate supply (60 a year) of ex-
tension workers whose effectiveness would depend on the strengthening of
present extension and farmers' training methods. The Bonka Farmers' Training
Center - the only one now operating in the country - caters for about 250
farmers per year. A mobile unit, used experimentally in 1966-67 by USAID -
Wyoming University Team had very encouraging results. Therefore, there is
a need to revitalize and systematize mobile training within the present
managerial capability of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Qualitative Aspect
3.10      To meet the demand of the labor market, quality improvements are
necessary in all fields of education. The first need of elementary and
intermediate education is for an adequate supply of properly qualified
teachers. Their training should include teaching practice in schools both
in rural and urban areas. The extension of the National Teacher Education
Center at Afgoi, included in the project, has, in this respect, an important
feature since teaching practices could be arranged in schools in Mogadishu
and in the rural communities surrounding Afgoi. In addition, audio-visual
teaching aids should be developed from local materials in order to improve
the supply of these aids without relying only on foreign grants and imports;
this can be done with the provision of a workshop where elementary and inter-
mediate student/teachers would develop prototypes. Further, the curricula
should become better geared to Somalia's environment and this needs an
improved curriculum development unit, for which physical facilities and
technical assistance are required.
3.11      At the secondary level of education, quality can be improved only
if a new diversified curriculum emerges from the amalgamation of the former
Italian and British systems. The new curriculum should offer terminal edu-
cation, with pre-vocational content, to the growing number of grade 12
leavers who do not follow post-secondary courses. The curriculum outline,
already approved by the Somali government (para. 2.10), stems from this
urgent need. Its implementation requires the modernization of the physical
facilities of many schools (paras. 2.02 and 3.06) and a supply of teachers
of practical subjects. Since these last would be needed only in very small
numbers, it would be inappropriate to establish a special teacher training
institute; instead, short-term courses in teaching techniques should be
arranged for the graduates of institutions already existing or being built,
such as the technical, commercial and agricultural schools.
3.12      The priority need in technical education is an improvement of
the existing facilities to give more practical training. The technical
school at Hargeisa should also become a full-fledged secondary technical
school like that at Mogadishu for producing middle level technicians; the
carpentry course at Hargeisa should be discontinued and replaced with courses



- 10 -
in building construction and civil engineering. New courses in automotive
trades and telecommunications should be started at Mogadishu. The training
program should put more emphasis on workshop activities and, to this end,
capital investment should be accompanied by technical assistance to improve
the qualification of workshop instructors. Cooperation with employers
should be enhanced through the establishment of a Technical Vocational
Training Council.
3.13      Quality improvements in commercial education can be achieved by
upgrading the Clerical Training Center at Hargeisa (para. 2.13) into a 4-
year commercial course for accountants and secretarial personnel with an
annual output of 50. This would need only minor investment in building
alterations, furniture and equipment.
IV. EDUCATION FINANCE
4.01      Education financing is undergoing a process of integration and
differences still exist in financial procedures, tuition and boarding fees
between the North and the South. The "Proposed Educational Development
Plan 1970-1973" provides for the unification of fees at the post-elementary
level (Annex 9) and for maintaining free elementary education and assist-
ance for the pre-elementary Koranic schools.
4.02      Public expenditure.  There are no estimates of private expenditure
on education. Public expenditure is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Education, accounting for some 90% of government recurrent spending on
education. Since independence, the budget of this Ministry has been about
7% of central government expenditure.
(in million So Sh.)
1961     1963     1965      1967     1969
1. Central Government Budget       172.3    189.2    203.1    272.1    301.5
2. Budget of the Ministry of
Education                      12.6      12.2     13.4      18.9     20.4
2 as a % of 1                     7.3       6.7      6.5       6.9      6.7
This ratio is substantially lower than those in neighboring countries
mainly because of the low enrollment numbers and participation rates, and
the high level of foreign assistance for recurrent expenditure as indicated
by the large number of expatriate teachers.



- 11 -
4.03      Average unit recurrent costs, excluding boarding, are shown below
(in US$ equivalent):
Somalia    Ethiopia    Kenya    Uganda    Rwanda

Intermediate                   62  )
)       80         182      180        120
Secondary                     125  )
The high cost of the elementary level is chiefly due to the over-generous
teacher/student ratio. This factor should diminish as the school population
increases and better use of staff is made (para. 2.07). A recent review in
civil service salaries is expected to produce a 10%-15% reduction in unit
recurrent costs.
4.04      In the sixties, capital expenditure on education reached high
levels. External assistance to school building and to launching new edu-
cational programs - granted mostly by Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany,
the United States, the European Common Market and the USSR - w a about
So.Shs. 100 million from 1961 to 1970. The "self-help" scheme, i.e., low
cost school building financed by the Central Government, the communities,
the Army and the Police, provided the entire expansion of elementary schools,
most of the increase of intermediate schools and a substantial part of
secondary education growth. From 1965 to 1970, 300 classrooms were built
under self-help for some So. Shs. 1.5-2 million.
4.05      Future expenditure.  On the basis of the enrollment targets
(Annex 6, para. 3.04) necessary to sustain Somalia's economic development
(para. 3.01), future recurrent expenditure of the Ministry of Education
has been projected as shown below and in Annex 10:
(So. Shillings in Thousands)
1970         1975           1980
Administration                            1,816         2,142          2,560

Secondary Education                       5,575         7,410         13,294
(general and technical)

Other                                        158           535            610
Total                  23,564        32,239         57,929
Annual rate of increase (compounded)              6.4%          12.3%



- 12 -
The projection assumes that, as a result of better utilization of staff
(para. 2.07) and of reduction of boarding (para. 3.06), unit recurrent costs
will decrease until 1975 and that increases thereafter will be controlled
so as not to exceed those in per capita income. A gradual decrease in for-
eign aid for recurrent expenditure is also assumed. In 1975, recurrent ex-
penditure on education is expected to be slightly less than 10% of the gov-
ernment recurrent budget. The projected rate of increase in enrollment
beyond 1975 can be adjusted to fit financial circumstances without detri-
mental effect on the project. However, the 1980 figures are in accordance
with projected minimum manpower needs and would only require that educa-
tional expenditure absorb 14% of the recurrent budget, a ratio already
reached and often surpassed in neighboring African countries. 1/ The an-
nual rate of increase in expenditure would be about 9%. In order to facil-
itate this increase, the government is planning a series of actions such as
a transfer of part of educational expenditure to local authorities, unifica-
tion of tuition fees and an increase in boarding fees (Annex 9).
4.06      Additional annual recurrent expenditure generated by the project is
estimated at about So. Sh. 3.4 million; this would be equivalent to some
8% of the recurrent budget of the Ministry of Education in 1977.
4.07      Future levels of capital expenditure can be estimated, mainly on
the basis of foreign aid commitments and additional self-help programs. In
addition to the present EEC school building programs (para. 3.06), the fol-
lowing capital expenditure would be needed during the period 1970-1980 to
meet the government's programs in education:

5.01      The proposed project would assist reforms in teacher training and
secondary, technical and agricultural education (paras. 2.04, 2.14 and 3.09)
and would consist of the following items:

5.02      Schedules of accommodation have been revised to provide facilities
whichl are functional and economical. Utilization factors are estimated at
85% for classrooms and 70% for laboratories, workshops and special rooms.
The curricula for teacher training, secondary, technical and commercial edu-
cation are being revised and their new outlines have been approved by the
government. During negotiations assurances were given by the government
that the new curricula will be finalized and forwarded to the Association
for comment within one year from the signing of the Credit Agreement.



- 14 -
5.03      Teacher Training.  The extension to the National Teacher Education
Center (NTEC) at Afgoi, about 20km from Mogadishu, would provi(le permanent
facilities for elementary (250 student places) and intermediate (150 student
places) teacher training (Annex 8).  The 2-year course would follow grade
10 for elementary teacher training and grade 12 for intermediate teacher
training. Short in-service courses would be provided for existing elemen-
tary and intermediate teachers and for professional training in teaching
methods for secondary teachers of practical subjects. The NTEC, when ex-
tended, would include a curriculum development unit and a workshop to develop
auidio-visual teaching sets from local materials. New teaching methods would
be introduced and research projects would be carried out with the aim of
making elementary and intermediate education more relevant to rural areas
and developing the content of courses in science and practical subjects for
secondary education. Further, research on the development of a script for
the Somali language would be conducted. Practice teaching would be provided
in Mogadishu and Afgoi schools.
5.04      Additional boarding facilities are required since students would
come from all parts of Somalia. The project would add 260 new boarding
places to the existing 300. About 20% of the student body would commute
and buses would be included in the proposed project. These buses would be
used also for students' transportation to the schools for teaching prac-
tice. The project would include five additional staff houses that, to-
gether with the 22 already existing, would provide on-campus accommodation
for about two thirds of the teachers required by NTEC at full operation.
The inclusion of the additional houses is necessitated by the housing short-
age in the Mogadishu area.
5.05      NTEC has 27 teachers most of whom are Somalis.  Technical assis-
tance was provided by USAID - Eastern Michigan University until early in
1970. The government has requested comprehensive technical assistance,
including 20 man-years of expert services and 10 fellowships of 9 months
each, from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This UNDP
project would include curriculum development and the training of Somali
teachers. Since UNDP assistance is not certain, a minimum requirement of
7 man-years of technical assistance is included in the proposed project
(Annex 11).
5.06      Secondary Education.  The project would provide one new secondary
school, extensions for nine and the re-equipping only of one. The schools
improved under the project would cater for two-thirds of the student-places
available in 1974, the remaining being either in existing adequate facili-
ties or in new EEC schools. The extensions would add science laboratories,
workshiops, commercial and home economics rooms and libraries to accommodate
the new diversified secondary school curriculum now being developed.
5.07      Full Somalization of the secondary schools teaching staff is fore-
seen by 1977/78 (para. 3.05). For proper operation of the project schools,
teaching requirements can be summarized as follows:



- 15 -
Practical Subjects
General Subjects  Science  Home Economics  Agriculture  Commerce  Ind. Arts
160           13            4               7           10         6
The teachers of general subjects and of science would be trained in the
regular NTEC program. The teachers of home economics and practical suab-
jects would be recruited among the graduates of the agricultural, technical
and commercial schools and in the home economics center at Mogadishu and
would receive training in teaching techniques at NTEC according to a scheme
already outlined by the government. During negotiations, assurances were
given by the Government that this scheme will be finalized and sent to the
Association for comment within one year from the signing of the Credit Agree-
ment.
5.08      Technical Education.  The two secondary technical schools includ-
ed in the project would be re-equipped, extended and improved to accommodate
4-year courses in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, automotive
trades, and telecommunications at the Mogadishu school, and building con-
struction and civil engineering at the Hargeisa school. Entrants would have
completed intermediate education. The curriculum would be practically
oriented with technical subjects and laboratories and workshop practice
accounting for about two-thirds of the weekly timetable. The output would
satisfy manpower needs (para. 3.07) and would be:
Output             Output
Mogadishu                         1970               1975
General Mechanics                  13                 15
Electricity                         9                 15

Civil Engineering                   -                 15
Total                        62                  90
5.09      The two schools now have 29 teachers, of whom 14 are Somalis.
Some 35 teachers in total would be needed when the schools are at full op-
eration. Additional teachers would be trained on fellowships abroad and
as counterparts to technical experts. The government has requested as-
sistance, including 20 man-years of expert services and 12 fellowships
of 6 months each, from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
5.10      The two schools would be used during vacations and afternoons for
short-term upgrading courses for skilled workers to be arranged in coopera-
tion with industry and government services. To this effect, a Technical
Vocational Training Council (TVTC) would be established for coordinating



- 16 -
activities among the training institutions, the employers and the various
Ministries concerned. In addition, trade standards and tests and a "tracer"
system to follow the employment of technicians and skilled workers would be
developed. During negotiations assurances were given by the government that
a detailed plan of action for (i) skilled worker training, (ii) establish-
ment of the TVTC and (iii) development of trade standards and tests and of
the "tracer" system to follow up employment of the graduates (para. 3.08)
will be submitted to the Association within two years from the signing of
the Credit Agreement.
5.11      Commercial Education.  The Clerical Training Center at Hargeisa
would be re-equipped and upgraded to become a 4-year commercial section of
the Hargeisa Technical-Commercial School. Its curriculum would include a
2-year common course in general subjects to be followed by specialization
in accounting and secretarial work. The existing staff would be strengthened
with technical assistance to be provided by bilateral schemes.
5.12      Agricultural Education.  The project would provide eight mobile
training units, to be located in the four most promising agricultural re-
gions of the country (Annex 12). Under the supervision of the Extension
Service Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and the direction of the
Regional Directors of Agriculture, the units, two per location, would
arrange visits to districts and villages and run short courses, using audio-
visual programs on crop and animal production practices, farm mechanic
skills, fertilization, etc. Each mobile unit would include farm equipment
and audio-visual aids and would be staffed with a qualified extension agent,
as instructor, and a driver.
5.13      During negotiations, assurances were given by the government that,
within one year from the effective date of the Credit Agreement, it will
provide the Association with its plan for implementing that part of the
project pertaining to the mobile units.
Cost of the proiect
5.14      The conistruction cost estimates have been derived from recent
school building costs in Somalia and adjusted to accommodate improvements
in design and construction. The estimated average unit cost for the exten-
sions to the secondary schools is about US$98 per m2 which compares favor-
ably to cost factors in other East African countries where unit costs per
m2, at 1970 prices, range from about US$ 85 in Kenya to about US$ 120 in
Sudan. Furniture and equipment estimates were revised for all schools and
are reasonable.  Costs for these categories have been included in the cost
of each school. Detailed lists would be compiled during the desigr stage
and reviewed by IDA before procurement.
5.15      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at So. Sh. 25.67
million or US$3.67 million, net of import duties and other taxes. It has
been the Government's practice to exempt contractors from customs duties
and other import taxes on materials and equipment procured for its projects.
The Government intends to follow the same practice for the present project.
The project cost breakdown given in Annex 13 is summarized below:

5.16      Contingency allowances are shown in detail in Annex 14.  For un-
foreseen factors, 6% is added to the cost estimates of site development and
of construction and 5% to the estimated equipment costs. Price increases,
estimated at 4% per annum, amount to 11.9% of the total estimated project
cost. Overall, the contingency allowances are equivalent to 15.8% of the
estimated project cost excluding contingencies and to 13.6% of the estimated
project cost including contingencies. The estimated foreign exchange compo-
nent of project costs is 20% for site development; 60% for building; 80%

for furniture; 90% for equipment; 80% for technical assistance; and 10% for
project administration. Overall, the foreign exchange component amounts to
US$2.62 million, or 71.4% of the total estimated cost.
5.17      Only one new school is included in the project.  The cost per
student place for this secondary school is estimated at US$454. This fig-
ure compares with estimated unit costs for similar schools in Ethiopia
(US$488) and Tanzania (US$683).
Execution of the Project (Annex 15)
5.18      A Project Unit would be established within the Ministry of Educa-
tion for (a) supervision of project implementation; (b) coordination with
other Government services; and (c) liaison with the Association. The Unit
would include (a) a project director; (b) a deputy project director; (c) an
architect; (d) a procurement officer; and (e) an accountant and adequate
supporting staff. The deputy project director and the project architect
would be full-time and, together with the project director, mutually accept-
able to the Government and the Association. The establishment of the Proj-
ect Unit and the appointment of its director, deputy director and its archi-
tect would be a condition for effectiveness for the Credit Agreement. The
cost of the Project Unit would be financed as a part of the project.
5.19      Design and supervision of construction would be carried out by a
School Design Unit to be instituted and operated in the Ministry of Public
Works. Project implementation requires professional manpower and expertise
beyond the existing capacity of the Ministries of Education and Public Works.
Therefore, 10 man-years of technical assistance are included in the project
to provide: (a) an educator/administrator as adviser to the project director;
and (b) an architect and a quantity surveyor to strengthen the Ministry of
nUbic Wor1ks School Design Unit. All the technical experts recruited under
the Credit would be mutually acceptable to the Government and the Association
and provided with qualified counterparts. The construction industry in
Somalia is capable of executing the project.
5.20      Sites for the new school and for the extensions included in the
project have been inspected and found acceptable except for the liodan school
in Mogadishu. For the extension to this school, a suitable site, acceptable
to the Association, will be selected and acquired within six months from
the signing of the Credit Agreement.
5.21      All contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment and for
construction would be awarded under international competitive bidding. All
items would be grouped to the extent practicable to encourage competition.
Except for equipment, all of whicih is imported, it is unlikely that the
project would attract foreign bidders. Domestic manufacturers would be
accorded a margin of preference which would be the existing rate of customs
duty applicable to competing imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever
is the lower. Customs tariffs are under revision but, at present, most of
the rates of the duties applicable to project related imports are higher
than 15%. Since the effective operation of the teacher training and of the



- 20 -
technical and commercial education programs depends on the availability of
technical assistance, the government gave assurances during negotiations
that before the award of contracts for the extension of NTEC or of the
technical and commercial schools included in the project, it will furnish
the Association with satisfactory evidence that these educational institu-
tions will be provided with techinical assistance.
5.22      The proposed credit would finance $3.3 million equivalent.  This
is estimated to cover the foreign exchange component and about 60% of local
currency costs. The credit would be disbursed to meet:
(a) the c.i.f. cost of imported furniture and equipment;
(b) 100% of technical assistance and project administration
costs; and
(c)  85% of the ront nf constra,t4n .dn    f an.e1y pzvU
furniture and equipment.
These percentages would be adjusted so that withdrawals from the credit will
not exceed US$3.3 million equivalent or 90% of the project cost whichever is
lower. The funds would be disbursed over a four year period; construction
would be completed in about 3 years (Annex 16). Undisbursed funds would be
available for cancellation.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) the new curricula for elementary and intermediate teacher
training, secondary, technical and commercial education,
and the scheme for training teachers of practical subjects
(paras. 5.02 and 5.07);
(b) the plan of action for the training of skilled workers,
the establishment of a Technical Vocational Training
Council, the development of training standards, trade
tests and "tracer" system, and the plan for implementing
the agricultural mobile training units (paras. 5.10 and
5.13);
(c) the provision of technical assistance for the project imple-
mentation and for the project schools (paras. 5.19 and 5.21);
and
(d) the selection and acquisition of sites for all project schools
(para. 5.20).



- 21 -
6.02      A condition for effectiveness of the credit would be the establish-
ment of the Project Unit and the appointment of the project director, deputy
director and architect, all to be mutually acceptable to the government
and the Association (para. 5.18).
6.03      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Development
Credit of US$3.3 million equivalent to the Somali Democratic Republic for
a term of 50 years including a 10 year grace period.

Source: Estimates on the basis of first and second manpower surveys, 1964 and 1969
and draft Short-Term Development Plan
The projections for 1968-75 and 1975-80 have been made on the basis of past trends in wage employment in major towns, on clearly discernible short trends as evidenced by the 1969-1975 estimates
of the second manpower murvey and on a lmng tem conservative extrapolatimon   It was assumed that the past rate of growth in employment in major towns, about 4% from 1963 to 1968, will decrease to about
2.8% because of  (i) improvement in labor productivity; (ii) substitution of capital intensive facilities for labor intensive water mupply and port schemes in Hogadishu; and (iii) better control of                          In
government's recurrent expenditure resulting in limiting civil service expansion. It was further aa9umed that the educational level of the three groups mentioned in para. 3.01 should be approximately
as follows in 1980:
Professional, technical execatlve       30% university degree or equlvaent               Techniclans           50% completed technical ecl8 catio            Clerical and sales              20% completed grade 12
