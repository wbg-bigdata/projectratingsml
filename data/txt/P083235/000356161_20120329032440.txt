3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary as the volume of civil works and
consultancy services is higher than originally estimated due to increased quantities of
radioactive tailings having to be relocated from Tailings Management Facility (TMF) 03.
The current proposed reallocation contains a small deviation from the request from the
Ministry of Finance in order to match the revised amounts in the land and property and


                                             3
incremental operating costs categories with the amounts actually disbursed. This
deviation has been approved by Ministry of Finance on March 20, 2012.

4.       The Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project, implemented by the Ministry of
Emergency Situations, aims to (i) minimize and reduce the exposure of humans,
livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned
uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area; (ii) improve the
effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national
authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the potential loss
of life and property in key landslide areas of the country.

5.       These objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed
to: isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from
disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and
dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; create a disaster
management and response system; and develop a system to detect and warn against
active landslide movements in key hazard areas. The Project consists of the following
components: Component 1: Uranium mining wastes isolation and protection; Component
2: Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring; and Component 3: Project Management.

6.      Good progress has been made under Component 1 with reducing the potential risk
of exposure to uranium and other radioactive substances for human and livestock
populations and ecosystems in Mailuu Suu. About 65% of the remaining radioactive
waste rock at Waste Dump 01 (WD 01) has been relocated to the safely-engineered dump
site at WD 02. These materials include additional quantities that were discovered at
WD01 during construction for which AF was approved in 2011. The relocation works are
expected to be finalized on schedule by May 2012.

7.      Since works started in spring 2011, about 80% of radioactive tailings stored at
Tailings Management Facility (TMF) 03 (which is at significant landslide risk) have been
relocated to a safe repository built on the footprint of the existing TMF 06. Today the
entire originally estimated volume of 130,000 m3 of tailings has been relocated from
TMF 03 to TMF 06. However, in 2011 it was discovered that the total quantity of tailings
stored at TMF 03 is larger than was estimated at feasibility and design stage by about
38,000 m3. The imprecision of the original estimate appears to result from an unforeseen
morphology of the original ground surface, and an unanticipated construction method
with a higher than usual amount of tailings used for raising the embankment dam. The
radiological protection measures and health and safety requirements applicable to the
relocation of the tailings materials are functioning well and monitoring results show
acceptable and safe radiation levels.

8.       Sufficient funding exists within the existing project budget to finance the
relocation and safe installation of the additional quantities of radioactive tailings from
TMF03 to TMF06. However, there is a need to extend the current Closing Date by 6
months from March 31, 2012 to September 30, 2012 to enable completion of these
activities for the reasons explained below.

9.    Over the course of the project, adverse weather conditions during the winter
months (November through March) have limited relocation activities to the timeframe
                                              4
between April and October. The harsh 2011-2012 winter is delaying the start of this
year’s working season. As a result, less than anticipated progress has been made.
Additionally, between April and June 2010 political events and unrest in southern parts of
Kyrgyzstan severely disrupted the works as well as the PMU’s ability to oversee and
monitor implementation. Moreover, there were local protests in Mailuu Suu against the
relocation of the radio-active materials, and works could only recommence after
resolution of the issues in November 2010 after intense public consultations involving
scientists and international radiation specialists. As a result, most of the 2010
construction season was lost and only 10% of the planned tailings materials to be
relocated during 2010 could take place.

10.     Progress with relocation activities was further hampered by unusually heavy
spring floods in April 2010 which damaged a project-financed haul road along the right
bank of the Mailuu-Suu River. The road which was originally designed to be a temporary
one had to be rehabilitated and strengthened, funding for which was provided by a Grant
(Additional Financing) approved on June 9, 2011.

11.     This would be the second extension of the Closing Date and is expected that
completion of the works, including the relocation of the additional 38,000 m3 of
radioactive tailings will take place during the extension period. An action plan covering
completion of project activities, including preparation of the final tailings repository
(TMF06) has been agreed between the Implementing Agency and the Association that
will cover the final months of the project lifetime and provide a framework schedule for
the finalization of the construction works for relocation and preparation of the final
tailings repository (TMF 06). It is recognized that completion of all remaining works is
highly dependent on external factors, foremost the weather conditions in Mailuu Suu, and
the proposed extended closing date includes appropriate contingency to cover further
complications and delays. The project objectives continue to be achievable and the
performance of the recipient and other implementing agencies is satisfactory. This will be
the second extension of the Project’s Closing Date.

12.     In preparation for the finalization of the physical works a concept for a
sustainable closure, stabilization, covering, and recultivation of the site is being prepared
by the construction supervisor, which includes the definition of allowable, safe, residual
radiation levels on the site and the installation of long term stable cover systems.

13.    Component 2 (Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring) has suffered severe
setbacks, as the landslide monitoring systems financed and installed by the project have
become dysfunctional due to vandalism and theft. Within the remaining project period, a
low-cost, low-tech approach for landslide monitoring and early warning system will be
conceptualized and - given full community support and ownership - designed, installed
and handed over to the communities for operation and maintenance.

14.      During project implementation, the Kyrgyz Government has implemented
institutional reforms and development in the radiation safety sector: in June 2010, a
“National Agency for Atomic and Radiation Security? was established under the Ministry
of Emergency Situations with the following mandate and responsibilities: (i)
development of new legislation on radiation safety, (ii) main regulatory body for

                                              5
radiation safety, (iii) responsibility for national implementation of IAEA guidelines, (iv)
and development of project proposals for external funding.
