LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
1. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The project would support the agricultural development goals of
the first credit (Cr. 760-LA), by: (a) establishment of a National Seed
State Farm to provide farmers with better quality and improved seed;
(b) development of a 3,000 ha Feedgrain State Farm as the nucleus for
promoting feedgrain production; and (c) intensification of rice and feedgrain
production on farmers' fields through development of a pilot agricultural
extension service and through the supply of agricultural chemicals and
equipment to farmers.
Agriculture Sector
1.02      The great majority of the rural population, who account for about
90% of the total population, depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
However, production is largely at a subsistence level. Agriculture, including
forestry, directly accounts for more than 60% of GDP, and in recent years
agriculture has generated about 60% of the country's export earnings, which
are estimated to total about $12 million in 1978. Export commodities are
mainly coffee and timber. There bas, however, been little growth in export
earnings over the past five years.  By contrast, imports of agricultural
products, mainly rice, (60,000-80,000 tons annually) have been increasing in
1976 and 1977.
1.03      About 400,000 families are directly involved in agricultural pro-
duction, and the average farm area is about 2 ha. Cropping intensity is
low, most of the land being cultivated with rainfed glutinous rice for only
4 to 5 months of the year. Despite government efforts to promote agricultural
production, including home garden production, enormous scope exists for
improvement, as evidenced by the low average yields obtained for all major
crops. About 40% of the rice area is cultivated under upland conditions where
yields are very low. There is little controlled irrigation even in the
lowland areas and excessive flooding, interspersed with periodic drought,
results in widely fluctuating rice yields from year to year.
1.04      The 1977 paddy harvest, for example, fell sharply below the plan
target due to a disastrous drought, which in some provinces wiped out nearly
half of the crop. Rice availability for human consumption in 1978 was
therefore down to an estimated 290,000 tons (or less than 90 kg/capita).
Large-scale famine was averted as international assistance brought in nearly
120,000 tons of rice and cereals, and the Governnent mounted a successful mass
campaign to plant substitute food crops. However, rice availability, including
imports in 1978 (estimated at about 120 kg/capita), is considerably below the
average requirements of 160-170 kg/capita. Although reliable data are
lacking, the general impression is that the daily food intake in Lao PDR is
less than the normal daily caloric requirement. Production from the 1978
crop was also not favorable due to major flooding. International food aid
will again be necessary to avert hunger in 1979.



1.05      With population growing at about 2.5% p.a., nearly 80,000 additional
people would have to be fed every year, implying additional paddy production
of about 26,000 tons a year. By 1980, about 1.2 million tons of paddy will be
required to meet human consumption demand at 160-170 kg/capita of rice. This
means an increase of about 50% over the level of production in a normal year.
Agricultural Production
1.06      Glutinous rice, the staple food, accounts for 72% of the area under
cultivation each year, or about 680,000 ha. On about 430,000 ha (63%), the
rice is grown under lowland conditions and on the remaining upland soils,
often under slash-and-burn cultivation. Rice production in a normal crop
year is about 470,000 tons, compared with annual consumption requirements of
about 580,000 tons.
1.07      Maize, the most important feed crop, is grown on only about
25,000 ha and in widely dispersed parts of the country. National production
is of the order of 30,000 tons, but only about 1,000 tons pass through
official government channels for the production of animal feed at the Thong
Toun feed mill.  The balance is eaten or fed to backyard livestock.  The
Government recognizes the urgency of increasing feed crop production, and the
development of the Veune Kham state feedgrain farm under the proposed project
forms an important thrust of its development strategy. A modern feed mill
is under construction in Tha Ngone with French and German assistance and
should be completed by mid-1979. The inadequate price incentive has been an
important constraint to increasing maize production. In 1977, the official
farm-gate price of maize on the cob was increased from 17 Kip/kg to 22
Kip/kg. On 1iarch 21, 1979, the price was further raised to 30 Kip/kg together
with official price rises in a number of other commodities.
1.08      Coffee and rubber were first introduced to Laos during the colonial
period. Before the war, 6,000 ha were planted to coffee and about 600 ha
to rubber. Nearly two thirds of the coffee was subsequently abandoned or
destroyed while almost all the rubber was destroyed. Rubber is no longer pro-
duced in the Lao PDR, but many of the coffee plantations are being rehabili-
tated.  Coffee yields are currently less than 1 ton/ha, as many of the plants
are overage or have not been pruned correctly. In 1977, coffee (primarily
Robusta) production was about 3,100 tons, of which about 1,500 tons were
exported at a value of $3.7 million. To encourage replanting, the authorities
increased the average procurement price of Robusta coffee in 1976 from
120 Kip/kg to 200 Kip/kg. Another increase is under consideration. In
addition, price differentials linked to a grading system need to be introduced
to improve the quality of coffee for export. The Bank has been requested by
Government to study the possibility of providing assistance for rehabilitation
of the country's coffee industry.

1.09      Forests are one of the Lao PDR's main sources of wealth.  Although
it is estimated that forests cover 40-50% of the country's total area, it is
difficult to estimate forest potential in the absence of an accurate national
forest inventory of the species and exploitable area. Timber production
and wood export (logs and sawn timber) earnings have declined steadily since
1974, dropping from 350,000 cu m to 80,000 cu m and from around $13 million to
$1.5 million respectively in 1977, due primarily to the lack of equipment and
fuel, inadequate price incentives, weak management of wood processing industries,
internal marketing difficulties and border problems with Thailand. In 1977
only half of the saw mills were operational and capacity utilization was less
than 40%. Both the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and SIDA, the Swedish Aid
Agency, are assisting the Government in the rehabilitation of its forest
industries.
1.10      Livestock.  Apart from rice, there is a major shortage in meat
production. National estimates of livestock numbers suggest that on average
each farm family has only 1 or 2 pigs or cattle and less than 10 poultry.
There are no large-scale pig or poultry production units in the country.
Livestock weaning rates are generally low due to low genetic potential, poor
quality of feed, and widespread occurrence of debilitating diseases. In
addition, thousands of head of livestock, buffalo in particular, were des-
troyed during the war. Pig production is far below the level required to
meet demand for pork (a favorite in the local diet), particularly in the
urban areas. The nutrition situation is poor in the Lao PDR, and the project
would seek to improve overall food production from crops and to provide
feedgrain for meat production.
1.11      Development of the country's livestock subsector is seriously
constrained by a shortage of breeding stock and feed. The first IDA-
assisted project for the Lao PDR aims at establishing pig multiplication
units, with an annual output at full production (after 6 years) of 14,400
piglets per year. The proposed second IDA project would therefore constitute
an essential, complementary step in the development of the Lao PDR livestock
subsector.
Production Constraints
1.12      Fertilizer use is very limited, the amount used in 1978 being
less than 350 tons. Application is generally confined to rice nurseries,
vegetables, tobacco, and a small area of irrigated dry season rice (about
9,000 ha) located mainly in Vientiane Plain. There is almost no mechanical
crop cultivation and in many areas draft animals are in very short supply.
Most provinces have a small staff of technicians who work with farmers,
but their function is to provide census and statistical data, and limited
technical assistance to provincial authorities. Although presently
untrained, the provincial technicians could form the basis for a modest
agricultural extension force. Also, the country's three agricultural research
stations should, with the support of the first IDA credit, develop the
capability to formulate simple technology packages for extension to farmers.

1.13      Apart from the technical constraints to increased agricultural
production, however, major difficulties confront Government in providing
the institutional support necessary for the implementation of relatively
large development programs. The development priority adopted by Government
has been to extend the irrigation network as rapidly as possible through
rehabilitation and construction of small pump and gravity irrigation schemes
to cover about 300 ha perimeters. Some 70% of the first IDA credit was
allocated for assisting irrigation development and the Government has received
additional bilateral aid for irrigation development. While further expansion
of the irrigation network is still needed, particularly outside Vientiane
Province, the country's technical capacity to undertake additional schemes at
this time is limited.
1.14   Even with the shortage of trained manpower, however, considerable
scope exists for improving production through increased low-level technical
support to farmers and through arrangements for distributing seeds, fertilizers
and pesticides. Likewise with regard to livestock production, efforts so far
have been directed towards improving and expanding the breeding stock. Little
attention has been given to the mechanisms for distributing stock to farmers,
or to the promotion of feedgrain production and provision of livestock
technical services to farmers.
Experience With Past Lending
1.15      The first IDA credit to the Lao PDR was signed on January 5,
1978, and became effective April 5, 1978. Both the first and the proposed
second project are directed towards assisting the '1inistry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Irrigation. In the year that has elapsed since effectiveness of
the first project, disbursements have amounted to $0.1 million. However, the
initial delays resulted mainly from the Borrower's unfamiliarity with the
Bank's procedures and from the late arrival of specialists. The pace of
project implementation is now improving and an invitation to bid should be
issued in June 1979 for equipment estimated to cost around $1.5 million. The
proposed second project would deal mainly with the l4inistry's Department of
Agriculture and would not contain much additional work for the Department of
Irrigation which is responsible for implementing the largest element of the
first project. The implementation of the proposed project should be greatly
facilitated by the fact that several applications for each of the technical
specialists positions provided under the UqDP-financed portion of the project
have been received, evaluated by FAO and suitable candidates submitted to
Government for approval. A short-term consultant has already taken up duties
in the Lao PDR to assist in preparing work programs and in procurement of
start-up equipment.



2. PROJECT AREA
Location - Vientiane Province
2.01      The project would be located in Vientiane Province and would center
on the development of two large state farms (paras. 2.10-2.13), as well as on
the provision of pilot technical services and agricultural inputs to farmers
throughout the Vientiane Plain. Vientiane Province, the most densely
populated of the country's 13 provinces, is the location of the nation's
capital and seat of Government in Vientiane City. Trade exchanges between the
Lao PDR and Thailand are carried out through the port of Tha Deua, some 20 km
south of Vientiane City, and through Nong Khai on the Thai side of the Mekong.
The province is about 26,000 sq km in size and stretches about 160 km from north
to south and 300 km from east to west (see Map IBRD 13979).
2.02      The population of the province is about 540,000, of which 20%
(110,000) live in Vientiane City. The province (khoueng) is organized into
14 districts (muong), 106 subdistricts (tasseng) and 665 villages (ban).
Over 50% of the country's manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in the
Vientiane Plain, for which the availability of power from the Nam Ngum dam
provides a favorable basis for industrial expansion and concentration of
population.
2.03      Agricultural Production.  Lowland rice covers about 100,000 ha of
the province, while upland rice is grown on about 17,000 ha. Traditionally
food and particularly rice production have been insufficient to meet local
demand. Even in a good crop year rice production amounts to only about
92,000 tons, or 85% of consumption.  Only very small amounts of maize, ground-
nuts and soybeans are grown. Mostly the staple glutinous rice diet of the
people is supplemented with vegetables, and small quantities of pork, poultry,
fish and fruit. Government food programs for the province are chiefly aimed
at increasing rice output through irrigation and flood control works, and at
increasing pork production through a pig multiplication program. The first
IDA-assisted project for the Lao PDR directly assisted both of these programs.
As an additional step in achieving food self-sufficiency, the proposed project
would concentrate on the production of maize and grain legumes for feed
production and on the provision of improved technical services, seed and
other agricultural inputs for farmers.
2.04      Soils and Climate.  Lowland soils are alluvial and mainly cultivated
with glutinous paddy.  The higher elevation soils are of low fertility and
are generally red yellow podzolics. Parts of these upland areas are still
under forest, while considerable areas are cropped with upland rice under a
shifting cultivation system (slash and burn) which is wasteful of forest,
soil and water resources. The land resources inventory of Vientiane Plain is
illustrated in Map IBRD 13478 (see Annex 7).



- 6 -
2.05      High temperatures, humidity and rainfall characterize the climate.
Ilean temperatures range between about 21 C in December/January and 29 C in
April. Rainfall is governed by the monsoon which generally commences in May
and ceases in October.  Although annual average rainfall is about 1,800 mm/
year, it is irregular both in onset at the start of the wet season and in
distribution throughout the wet season (80% of rainfall occurs in the five-
month wet season) (see Annex 7).
2.06      Land Tenure.  Host of the land in Vientiane Province is farmed by
individual family units that have customary settler and cultivation rights.
Data on farm and family size, agricultural practices, and crop and livestock
production are limited, but the average farm family in the Vientiane Plain is
estimated to have approximately 5-7 persons with 1.5 to 2 ha of lowland rice
land and a rather smaller area of upland soil. Farmers grow rice, a few
coconuts and fruit trees around the house. They may rear one or two buffalo,
a few pigs and poultry.
2.07      The Government's long-term objective in the rural sector is to
establish large-scale farm units for agricultural production.  Cooperatives
are expected to become the principal form of organization for agricultural
production, although state farms are also planned for the production of
industrial crops and livestock.  The authorities envisage three stages in the
development of cooperatives.  In the first stage, the principles of joint
farming are promoted through the establishment of "farmers' associations" or
work brigades designed to facilitate the exchange of labor and the sharing of
tools and draft power. In the second stage, arrangements are made to
cultivate the land collectively and to share the crops in proportion to the
days worked by each farmer.  The final stage is to convert these farmers'
groups into formal agricultural cooperatives operating as collective farms.
This may occur in two phases, with some of the land being "rented" from
members initially, but eventually most of the land is to be comnunally owned.
Membership of cooperatives, however, will be on a voluntary basis and members
may retain part of their land and some animals for thenselves.
2.08      Rural Infrastructure.  The majority of the villages in the Vientiane
Province lack modern public infrastructure, although transport infrastructure
between the larger villages is adequate for current traffic needs. The
tracks leading to the smaller villages are frequently impassable to freight
and passenger vehicles for 2-3 months in the wet season, although still
passable to farm carts and bicycles.
Subproject Areas
2.09      While the agricultural extension services to be developed under
the project would be spread throughout the Vientiane Province, two specific
locations would be developed as state-managed farms. These would be at Na
Phok for seed production and at Veune Kham for feedgrain production, as
described below.



2.10      Na Phok Seed Farm /1 would be located about 30 km northeast of
Vientiane City on the right bank of the Nam Ngum River. Although the total
area of the government-owned farm covers about 1,200 ha, half of the land is
under forest cover.  Soils on the farm are recent alluvials with quite high
fertility and good drainage characteristics. In 1968 some 500 ha of the farm
were cleared and levelled with aid from the Japanese Government. At that
time, an extensive road network was also developed and plans laid for fully
irrigating the area. Due to the war these plans were not developed further
and the area was settled with about 200 refugee families. About half of
these families have now been relocated or have returned to their former
homelands. The remaining families provide the general labor force for the
surrounding area and cultivate portions of the farm.
2.11      The Ministry of Agriculture controls the area and now wishes to
resume development of the farm by fully irrigating some 500 ha for the
production of rice and feedgrain seeds. The labor force would be provided by
the refugee families now living around the perimeter of the farm and would
also come from the neighboring township of Tha Ngone.  At full development
(after 4 years), the farm would produce about 2,000 tons of seed each year,
thereby meeting a critical need for improved seed in the country. In addition,
the seed farn would maintain stocks of seed for distribution following times
of crisis, e.g. drought or flood, when replanting is feasible but is constrained
by lack of seed. (This has been a common experience throughout the country.)
2.12      Veune Kham Feedgrain Farm would be located about 5 km west of Tha
Ngone and about 30 km from Vientiane City. The total farm area is around
6,160 ha but the project would develop only 3,000 ha as Phase I of the
development program.  About 300 ha of the farm are presently clear of forest,
although decades of shifting cultivation have reduced the vegetation to an
open forest type cover, requiring clearing costs of only around $400/ha.
Much of the recent clearing has been done by employees of the Ministry of
Agriculture, many of whom live on the farm.  Under the project some additional
2,700 ha of the farm would be cleared for feedgrain production. Extensive
soil surveys, cropping pattern studies and farm development plans have
recently been completed by a team of Vietnamese advisers.  The area to be
developed under the project is generally free from flooding, and the soil
texture and fertility are suited to feedgrain production.
2.13      There are 4 small villages with approximately 340 families
located within the perimeter of the proposed state farms.  However, these
villagers would not need to be relocated, since most of them are fishermen and
small rice farmers who generally farm the low, swampy areas of the state farm
that would not otherwise be used.  Shifting cultivation in the area is
limited to a very few families now. The project would create a large amount
of seasonal employment for the villagers living in the area.  Most of the
permanent labor for the farm would come mainly from the existing 670 state
farm employees.
/1 Na Phok Seed Farm is officially known as the "National Seed Production
Center" but is referred to in this report by its location at Na Phok to be
consistent with references to the feedgrain state farm at Veune Kham.

3. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The design of the proposed project builds on the experience gained
during implementation of the first project. Key aspects of the design
include a simple management structure familiar to Lao PDR authorities and
concentration on three major development objectives. Firstly, the project
would aim at eliminating the country's dependence on imported seed and would
greatly expand the availability of improved rice, feedgrain and vegetable
seeds to farmers on a regular basis and in times of crisis. Secondly, the
project would concentrate on the production of feedgrains (maize, sorghum,
soybean and groundnuts), which are currently in very short supply and on
which the livestock multiplication component of the first project depends
heavily. A third objective of the project would be to tackle some of the
more fundamental constraints regarding the availability of technical services
and the supply and distribution of agricultural inputs. A small staff of
agricultural advisory technicians would be trained and mobilized to provide
the link between the Ministry of Agriculture and provincial staff as the
first step in promoting improvements in production and marketing of food and
feedgrains.
3.02      The seed production component of the project would comprise the
setting up of quite a large farm at Na Phok. Likewise, the production and
marketing of feedgrains, which is presently at a very low level, would be
developed around a large state feedgrain farm in order to: (a) establish the
pricing and marketing process; (b) ensure sufficient supplies to keep the
newly constructed feed mill operating; and (c) provide an applied research
and training station for the technical service, which would promote crop and
livestock production by cooperatives and among individual farmers. The
equivalent of some 1,200 jobs would be provided from employment created by
development of the Na Phok seed farm and Veune Kham state farm. Seed produc-
tion at full development would be sufficient for planting some 100,000 ha/year
of rice and 50,000 ha/year of feedgrains throughout the country. The incre-
mental maize production would be sufficient for an estimated 14,000 tons of
compound animal feed annually.  About 6,000 tons of feed will be required for
the pig multiplication units to be developed under the first IDA-assisted
project (Cr. 760-LAO), while the balance would be used for livestock pro-
duction on farms.
Project Identification/Preparation
3.03      The project was identified by a Bank mission in November/December
1977. Originally there were two primary objectives: (a) flood control and
small-scale irrigation in the flood plain of the Se Bang Fai, a tributary of
the N¶ekong which separates the two central Lao provinces of Khammouane and
Savannakhet; and (b) seed and feedgrain production in the Vientiane Plain
to substitute for the growing import requirements. However, due to insuffi-
cient survey data for the Se Bang Fai component, the project was reform-
ulated to expand on the second of the objectives. The project was appraised
in November 1978.  In February 1979, a UNDP-funded technical assistance



- 9 -
project for the Se Bang Fai was signed by the Government with the Bank as
executing agency. That project will finance equipment and materials for
feasibility studies and pilot flood control and irrigation works in the Se
Bang Fai. The Bank, as executing agency, subcontracted the Mekong Secretariat
to provide the technical services. The technical assistance prGject will
prepare the way for a larger flood control and irrigation project.
Project Components
3.04      A summary of components to be included under the project is given
below.

Detailed Features
Seed Farm Development - Na Phok
3.05       In connection with the proposed IDA credit to assist in the develop-
ment of Na Phok, UNiDP, with FAO as executing agency, signed on April 14, 1979
a $1.3 million project with Government for the first phase of development of
the seed farm. The provisions of the UNDP project document (Lao/77/011/A/01/12)
have been included in the calculation of the proposed IDA project cost and are
identified in Table 3.1. The proposed phasing of civil works, seed crop
production and associated costs are shown in Annexes 1 and 2.

3.06      Civil Works
(a) Land Clearing. Already some 500 ha out of the 700 ha of the
Na Phok farm to be developed have been cleared of trees and levelled. The
farm is now mostly covered by short native grass which could easily be
cleared. About 50% to 60% of the cleared area is cropped during the wet
season by the 100 refugee families temporarily settled on the area
(para. 2.11).
(b)  Roads.  An adequate road network totaling about 15 km already
exists on a rectangular grid across the farm. Some $50,000 would be pro-
vided for repairing and resurfacing the 7 km of access road and the somewhat
overgrown internal road system.
(c)  Irrigation of 500 ha of the farm would be achieved by establishment
of one pumping station on the Nam Ngum river above flood level, and by
piping and open ditch distribution of water to the field. Maximum lift would
be 1.25 million cu m during the months of January and February. Details for
the irrigation network were developed by consultants funded under an ADB
project,/1 in conjunction with government staff. The total cost of the
irrigation and drainage works would be $1,260,000 or about $2,500/ha.
An assurance was obtained at negotiations that Government would ensure
that the irrigation works provided for Na Phok under the project would be
done in a timely manner and completed by April 30, 1982 (para. 8.01[a]).
(d) Buildings. The buildings to be constructed would be largely
wooden with cement bases. Total cost would amount to about $430,000, of
which about 14% would be for equipment shelter and workshop facilities, 16%
for processing and storage, and the balance of $300,000 (70%) for offices,
laboratory, housing and accommodation.
(e) Electricity. In order to operate the electrical processing equip-
ment, pump station and for lighting the farm buildings, some 8 km of 22 kv
power line would be constructed from the closest point of the existing electri-
city grid in Vientiane Province (Pk 18) to a receiving station to be constructed
at Na Phok. Because of maintenance considerations and the low cost of electri-
city in Vientiane Province (4.00 Kip/Kwh) relative to diesel fuel, extension
of the power line to Na Phok provides the least cost alternative for supplying
the seed farm with electricity. The total cost of installing the power line
and substation would be about $120,000.
3.07      Equipment
(a) Agricultural Equipment. The seed farm would be provided with agri-
cultural equipment ranging from tractors and implements for land preparation
and hauling, through to grain threshing and shelling machinery. The need to
mechanize the seed farm quite heavily results from the seasonal shortage of
labor both in the area and in general throughout the country. Agricultural

and Development Programming Technical Assistance Project in the Vientiane
Plain (in Two Volumes), July 1977.



- 12 -
machinery costs of about $460,000 would be provided.  At full development the
seed farm would require about 80 permanent employees.
(b)  Processing Equipment.  Drying equipment capable of handling
1,000 ton/cropping season of seed and processing equipment rated at 2.0 ton/hr
would be provided. The processing plant would have batch-type drying facilities
(forced heated air flow system), cleaning and grading, chemical treatment and
bagging facilities. Details of the processing plant and final design specif-
ications for tender documents would be prepared with the assistance of spe-
cialists provided under the project. Tender documents for the seed processing
plant should be completed by December 31, 1979. Laboratory equipment for
testing seed viability and purity would also be included. Generally accepted
international seed quality control measures would be adopted. Suitable seed
standards are included in the Project File (see Annex 7). Reject seed (about
20%) would be either sold to the Tha Ngone feed mill (see para. 1.07) or
distributed for food on the seed farm. Seed storage facilities with a
capacity of 500 tons would also be constructed. The Na Phok seed farm is
almost all above high flood level. The production and storage of adequate
stocks of seed is an urgent requirement in the Lao PDR, since floods and/or
drought occur frequently and often cause widespread crop losses. Seed
processing and storage costs would be about $235,000.
(c) Workshop and General Transport and Office Equipment. An important
constraint in the Lao PDR is the shortage of spare parts and workshop facil-
ities. A lesser, but still limiting constraint, is the availability of trained
mechanics. The project would provide workshop facilities and equipment for
both the Na Phok and Veune Kham farm.  The total cost of workshop equipment
would be about $135,000. Technical assistance for setting up the workshops
and for on-the-job training would also be provided (see para. 3.04[d]). Three
4-wheel drive vehicles would be provided for farm staff together with some
12 motorcycles and 8 trucks (total cost $150,000). About $15,000 would be
provided for general office equipment.
3.08      Seed Production.  At full development, i.e. from year four onwards,
there would be about 500 ha devoted to seed production in both the wet and
dry seasons and an additional 100 ha in the wet season. Cropping patterns
would be variable according to the country's needs, but would generally
follow the pattern described in Annex 2, Table 3, and shown in Table 3.2 at
full development.

/a  Approximately 20% of grain produced would not be suitable for seed and
would be used as food or feedgrain.
3.09      Although the yields assumed in Table 3.2 are not high, it would be
necessary to practice quite a high level of crop management including rotation
and fallow in order to maintain yields under the intense cropping system
proposed. In order to include fallow in the rotation, an additional 100 ha
have been provided for clearing. Chemical fertilizers and insecticides would
be applied at rates generally recommended internationally for soils and
climatic conditions similar to those in the project area. More specific
application rates would be established during project implementation through
research funded under the first IDA credit. Some $600,000 is provided
under the five-year project for this purpose. At full development, annual seed
production from the seed farm and the corresponding crop area that could be
planted are shown in Table 3.3. For rice, an area equivalent to 100,000 ha
could be planted each year. For feedgrain, seed production would be sufficient
for planting 50,000 ha annually. However, in order to ensure adequate seed
stocks in case of crop failure due to floods, drought, etc., some 200 tons of
rice and 100 tons of feedgrain seed would be kept in store at the seed farm.
Seed quality control would be the responsibility of the Department of Agricul-
ture. During the course of the project, "certified" seed would be produced
in the sense that minimum standards of quality would be maintained. The Na
Phok seed farm would have the basic equipment and facilities needed for
quality control.

/a Assumed planting rate of 60 kg/ha for groundnut, 35 kg/ha for paddy and
soybeans, 25 kg/ha for maize and 10 kg/ha for sorghum. The assumed fre-
quency of improved seed usage would be: for paddy, once every 3 years; for
maize, every second year; and for sorghum, soybean and groundnut, yearly.
3.10      For rice, the main varieties to be grown initially would be:  (a) the
glutinous IR 789, and to a smaller extent IR 253, IR 848 and IR 889, which have
been improved at the International Rice Research Institute (Philippines) from
local strains; (b) the glutinous Sanpatong and Denghom; and (c) the nongluti-
nous C463-1, IR 22 and IR 228.3. Rice crops grown from the improved seed
would not require new seed for three years after the initial planting. Maize
varieties grown would be mainly the synthetic selections HDK 1 and 2 (similar
to the Thai varieties PB Nos. 5 and 9) and composite HDK3 (similar to Thai
No. 1). Downy mildew resistant strains are currently being selected and
production of a strain showing 80% resistance (HDK3) is expected during the
wet season of 1979. Research into downy mildew resistance is an ongoing
program of the Hat Dok Keo research station, since generally resistance breaks
down after several crop seasons. The project would provide for the introduc-
tion of improved foundation seed for multiplication.
3.11      Technical Assistance.  The UNDP-financed portion of the project
would provide for three specialists to assist in development and operation of
Na Phok. FAO as excuting agency for the UNDP project would be responsible
for contracting the specialists. At negotiations an assurance was obtained
that Government would recruit the seed and feedgrain production specialists as
a condition of credit effectiveness and that the machinery and construction
specialists would be recruited by December 31, 1979 (paras. 8.01[b] and 8.02[a]).
The three specialists for Na Phok would be as follows:
(a) Seed Production and Processing Specialist. The specialist would be
contracted for a total of 36 man-months at an average cost of $5,300/month.
Of this amount, approximately 50% would be salary and the balance would be for
travel and administrative overhead. The specialist would need to have at



- 15 -
least five years' practical experience in seed production and processing and
be able to advise on the establishment and maintenance of acceptable seed
standards for the Lao PDR. The specialist would work closely with the
director ol the Na Phok seed farm and assist in the management of the farm
and in procurement of equipment and materials. Ile would also be responsible
for training counterpart staff in all aspects relating to seed production and
processing.
(b)  Agricultural Machinery Engineer.  The specialist would be contracted
for a total of 24 man-months at an average cost of $4,000/month. Of this
amount, approximately 50% would be salary and the balance would be for
travel and administrative overhead. The specialist would be required to have
wide experience in the operation and maintenance of agricultural equipment.
He would need to be familiar with types of equipment available from the
international community of machinery suppliers and distributors, and be able
to advise the farm directors of Na Phok and Veune Kham on technical aspects
of equipment being considered for procurement. The specialist would be
responsible for overseeing the setting up of workshops on both the Na Phok
and Veune Kham farms, and for training counterpart staff in the repair
and maintenance of machinery.
(c) Construction Engineer. This specialist would be contracted for a
total of 12 man-months at an average cost of $3,300/month. Of this amount,
approximately $500 would be salary and the balance for travel and adminis-
trative overhead. The specialists would be required to have practical exper-
ience in the installation and calibration of seed processing and storage
equipment and in the design and construction of suitable farm buildings. The
services of the construction engineer would also be used in the setting up of
the Veune Kham state farm as needed. The specialist would be responsible for
detailing technical specifications of materials and equipment needed, for
assistance in the drawing up of draft bid documents, and for training counter-
part staff.
(d)  Short-term Consultants.  Six man-months of short-term specialist
services, at an average cost of $5,800/month, would be provided to help
overcome technical constraints that may arise from time to time due to the
severe lack of technically trained personnel in the country. The funds would
be available for such specialized services as seed processing, feedgrain
milling and compounding, and procurement.
Feedgrain Farm Development - Veune Kham
3.12      Development of the Veune Kham farm would primarily be for the
purpose of supplying the nearby Tha Ngone and the Thong Toun feed mills.
Construction of the Tha Ngone feed mill began in 1977 and has been financed
through bilaterial aid from France and Germany. By 1980 the two mills will
be able to process about 17,000 tons of feed. Full capacity would be reached
by 1982 when feed production could be some 20,000 tons per year. Livestock



- 16 -
build-up in the Vientiane Province, based mainly on development objectives of
the first IDA project, indicate that by 1982, pigfeed requirements would be
around 6,000 tons or 30% of the capacity of the two feed mills.
3.13      However, despite the construction of the mill and the rapidly
growing demand for pigfeed, maize production in the Vientiane Province is
not sufficient to meet demand. Furthermore, production is unlikely to
increase through small farm development due to (a) the low fixed price for
maize and (b) the understandable priority given by farmers to food production,
mainly glutinous rice. Therefore in order to meet feedgrain demand, and in
accordance with the policy directives of Government, the Veune Kham State
Farm would be developed under the project to produce some 3,000 ha of rainfed
feedgrain, equivalent to about 5,500 tons per year at full development (of
which 4,500 tons would be maize). To meet the balance of maize requirements
by 1982, Government intends to promote additional feedgrain production
through farmer cooperatives. While policies relating to cooperative develop-
ment are quite firm, implementation details are still being worked out.
Arrangements for providing agricultural technical services to the cooperatives
are also unresolved. Development of the feedgrain state farm provides an
opportunity for establishing a sound technical base on which to promote
feedgrain production, as well as for meeting the urgent animal feed needs of
the country. Cost estimates for developing the first phase of the feedgrain
farm are given in Table 3.4 and necessarily include considerable infrastructure
and overhead costs, which will benefit the development of the remaining 3,000
ha of the state farm when the planned second phase development gets under
way. Details of the phasing of civil work, feedgrain production and associated
costs are given in Annexes 1 and 2.

3.14      Civil Works
(a)  Land Clearing.  Of the 3,000 ha of the farm to be developed for
feedgrain production, only about 300 ha have been cleared. The remainder is
largely open forest cover estimated to cost about $400/ha to clear by
bulldozer and windrowing.



- 17 -
(b) Roads and Bridge. An internal road network totaling about 40 km
would be provided in addition to the already existing 6 km. A 50-ton load
Bailey-type bridge would be constructed on the access dike road which would
be raised by 1 meter.  A total of some $570,000 would be provideA for the
roads and bridge under the project.
(c) Flood Control. Most of the 3,000 ha to be developed is above flood
level, but around 300 ha would need to be protected through the construction
of two small dams fitted with floodgates. Construction of the dams is in the
1979 work program of Government and will be executed with the help of the
M-ekong Secretariat.
(d) Buildings. The existing facilities at Veune Kham were initially
constructed for use as an agricultural training school, but the school was
later transferred to Na Bong (see para. 3.20). The main need for additional
buildings would be housing for farm management staff and employees and
expansion of general store, farm machinery and workshop buildings. About
$300,000 would be provided for buildings under the project.
(e) Electricity. The project would provide for the construction of
about 5 km of 22 kv powerline and of a substation on the state farm at a cost
of around $90,000.
3.15      Equipment
(a)  Agricultural Equipment.  In order to clear the land and develop
the 46 km of on-farm road network, the project would provide heavy equipment
totalling about $570,000. Lighter farm equipment, including tractors,
harvesters, shellers and threshers, would be provided at a cost of about
$1,175,000. At full development the project would require about 170
permanent employees. A more intensive use of manual labor would not be
feasible due to the relatively low population density around the subproject
area.
(b) Workshop and General Transport Equipment. The workshop facilities
to be provided at Veune Kham would be similar to those of Na Phok. The total
cost of equipment would be $160,000. The mechanical technical adviser to
be provided under the UNDP-financed portion of the project would be responsible
for advising on the setting up and function of both the Veune Kham and Na
Phok workshops. General farm vehicles and trucks for transporting grain to
the Tha Ngone feed mill would be provided at a cost of about $235,000.
3.16      Feedgrain Production.  Of the 3,000 ha of rainfed feedgrain to be
produced at full development, about 2,000 ha would be devoted to maize, 450 ha
to soybeans and 450 ha to groundnut. Seed for use on the Veune Kham farm would
be obtained from the Na Phok seed farm (see para. 3.08). Yields of most crops
are expected to be above average for the Lao PDR (Table 3.5). Chemical ferti-
lizers and insecticides would be used and are expected to cost about $495,000
annually at full development. Since development of such a farm would be a new



- 18 -
venture for the Lao PDR, and because of the country's shortage of foreign
exchange, fertilizer, insecticide and other recurrent foreign expenditure
costs during the five-year development period are included in the project cost
(Table 3.4).

3.17      Technical Assistance.  The UNDP-financed portion of the project
would provide for three specialists to assist in the development and operation
of Veune Kham. FAO as executing agency for the UNDP project would be respon-
sible for contracting the specialists. At negotiations an assurance was
obtained that Government would recruit the seed and feedgrain production
specialists as a condition of effectiveness and that the machinery and con-
struction specialists would be recruited by December 31, 1979 (para. 8.01[b]
and 8.02[a]). The three specialists for Veune Kham would be as follows:
(a) Feedgrain Production Specialist. The specialist to be hired would
be contracted for 36 man-months at an average cost of $5,300/man-month. Of
this amount, approximately 50% would be salary and the balance would be for
travel and administrative overhead. The specialist would be required to have
practical experience in the development, operation and management of a large-
scale grain farm. He would be required to train counterpart staff and work
closely with the locally appointed state farm director. He would advise on
agronomic, managerial and financial matters related to the running of the
farn. The specialist would also assist in the procurement of equipment and
materials by assisting in the preparation and evaluation of bid documents.
(b) Agricultural Miachinery Specialist. The specialist recruited
to assist on the Na Phok seed farm would also be required to advise on the
setting up and operation of the Veune Kham farm (see para. 3.11[b]).
(c) Construction Engineer. The specialist recruited to assist on
the Na Phok seed farm would also assist in the design and construction of
buildings for Veune Kham. It is expected, however, that most of this
specialist's time would be spent at Na Phok (see para. 3.11[c]).

Smallholder and Cooperative Farm Development
3.18      In accordance with the Lao PDR Government's objective of restructur-
ing the econ :iy along socialist lines, directives have been issued to provin-
cial authorities throughout the country to actively promote group farming and
state control over marketing of crops. At appraisal the directive was quite
recent and very few active cooperatives existed.  Membership of cooperatives
would be voluntary, and members would be provided with ready access to
credit, technical advice and use of cooperative machinery, and they would
have the opportunity of buying basic consumer items and other goods at
government-controlled stores. However, for some time to come, a large number
of farmers will continue to farm as individuals. The rate of development of
active cooperatives will be determined by the rate at which Government is
able to gain experience in the procedures for setting up and managing coopera-
tives.
3.19      The shortage of adequately trained technicians is a key constraint
in the Government's program to develop cooperatives and at the same time to
promote increased crop production. In Vientiane province there are only
about 80 agricultural technicians and at appraisal these were mainly involved
with the cooperative development program. In an attempt to rationalize
priorities in the development of technical services to farmers, Government
has greatly expanded its short-term rural training courses for provincial
technicians. However, there is a severe shortage of qualified technicians to
run these courses. Several small UNDP-financed projects have been directed
towards supporting agricultural training in the country and the first IDA-
assisted project also included funds for training.
3.20      Under the proposed project, training would be provided to complement
the basic training received by graduates of (a) the agricultural school at Na
Bong and (b) the agriculture machinery school at Dong Dok. Both of these
schools are already established and have received substantial bilateral aid
for the provision of facilities and equipment. Technical assistance has also
been provided through a UNDP project (LAO/74/014) and through bilateral aid.
Nevertheless, the schools are unable to turn out highly trained technicians,
both due to the lack of qualified teachers and teaching facilities, and because
of the urgent needs of the country to turn out technicians with even low
levels of expertise. The number of graduates from Na Bong rose sharply in the
past year from around 35 in 1975 to 130 in 1978. Training is for a period of
three years.  At Dong Dok on the other hand, technicians undergo a six-month
training course mainly in agricultural machinery operation and maintenance.
About 100 technicians are graduated annually from the program.
3.21      Once trained, technicians are generally assigned to provincial
authorities where they may be employed for a variety of purposes ranging from
organizing cooperatives to collection of census and statistical data. Apart
from the fact that they may lack training for the activities they perform,
there is no established mechanism whereby provincial technicians can receive
in-service training or back-up support from the Ministry of Agriculture.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture has only a very small staff of
trained agricultural technicians, most of whom are tied up with a combination
of research, planning and administrative matters, leaving little time for



- 20 -
training and supervision. Therefore, in designing an agricultural technical
support component for the proposed project, the objective has been to provide
the means of: (a) expanding the training program for agricultural technicians,
(b) establishing a small core of subject matter specialists to backstop
provincial technicians, and (c) establishing mechanisms for distributing
agricultural inputs to farmers. Cost estimates are shown in Table 3.6 and
the details of these proposed activities are given in the following paragraphs.

3.22      Training.  The training to be provided would be of three main types.
Firstly, some 200 technicians would be trained for six-week periods at a time
(total of 300 man-months) in order to upgrade the technical and practical
level of training of technicians being assigned to the Vientiane provincial
authorities. The technicians would receive training in practical agronomy,
basic extension methodology and cooperative formation. Secondly, about 80
technicians would be trained for six-month periods at a time (total of
480 man-months) in more specialized fields such as crop protection and rice and
feedgrain agronomy. These more highly trained technicians would form the core
of a staff of subject matter specialists who would backstop the provincial
technicians. The third level of training to be provided would allow for the
training abroad of some ten Ministry of Agriculture staff in the disciplines
of research, technical support and management. Such fellowships abroad are
expected to last from three to six months. More extensive support for higher
level training under the project cannot be justified at this time due to
manpower constraints. Further UNDP assistance for training may materialize
during project implementation, as UNDP and Government are working closely to
identify key training needs, both in the technical and administrative fields.
3.23      Most of the training would be done initially at either the Salakham
or Hat Dok Keo research stations, where modest training facilities have been
provided for under the first IDA credit and through UNDP financing. Some
additional training equipment costing about $40,000 would be provided to



- 21 -
complement the training needs. However, as the state farms at Veune Kham and
Na Phok are established, increasing use would be made of the facilities
available on the farm for the practical training of technicians. Technical-
assistance for the training component of the project would be given by the
rice production specialist provided under the first IDA credit and by the
feedgrain and seed production specialist to be provided under the proposed
project. The Director of the Department of Agriculture would take overall
responsibility for the training components of the project and for the organiz-
ation of the core of a staff of subject matter specialists to be developed.
3.24      Pilot Agricultural Technical Service.  This project design calls for
the establishment of only a very small core of trained subject matter specialists
who would provide the initial link between the research stations and policy
makers of the Ministry of Agriculture and the provincial technicians. The
subject matter specialists, once trained in their respective fields, would be
provided with motorcycles. The organizational arrangements by which subject
matter specialists would meet with provincial technicians would largely have
to be worked out during project implementation. The Director of the Agriculture
Department would be responsible for the formation and operation of the technical
service (see para. 6.05), and he would be assisted in this by the rice produc-
tion specialist provided under the first IDA credit. Details of the activities
of the proposed technical service should be prepared by June 30, 1980. Ini-
tially, however, the existing mechanism of weekly meetings between key personnel
of the provincial authorities and of the Ministry of Agriculture would be the
avenue for coordinating technical staff. These weekly meetings appear to work
reasonably well for resolving policy issues and for coordinating activities,
but more direct contact is needed between technicians to handle small day-to-day
problems. Also, the subject matter specialists to be trained under the project
would initially concentrate their attention on two or three cooperatives in an
effort to establish working models for replication throughout the country.
Supervision missions for the proposed project would give particular attention
to the organization and phasing of activities of the pilot technical service.
3.25      Provision of Agricultural Inputs.  About $0.9 million would be
provided under the project for the purchase of agricultural chemicals and
farm equipment for smallholder and cooperative farm development. A small
amount of credit is currently extended by the National Bank of Lao to coopera-
tives and to some individual farmers.  However, the system is still being
developed and is being assisted under the first IDA credit, whereby some
$0.2 million have been provided for establishment of a revolving fund for
production credit. The credit system would be further strengthened under the
proposed project by supervision missions that would include credit specialists,
but at the same time the proposed project would allow for interim measures
to be taken to distribute fertilizers, etc., while the credit system is being
developed. The interim procedures to be used would follow those already in
operation, whereby the Ministry of Agriculture arranges for the procurement
of materials and equipment, and then transfers or sells the purchase to the
Vientiane provincial authority. The agricultural inputs are then distributed
to individual farmers and cooperatives by the transport department of the
provincial authority, in accordance with requirements indicated by provincial
technicians. The provincial authority is reimbursed by farmers or cooperatives
at official prices, either by payment in kind or by cash.

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Cost Estimate
4.01      Total project costs are estimated at $14.4 million, of which
$11.6 million or 81% is foreign exchange. Unit prices for equipment, vehicles,
materials and supplies are based on end-1978 local prices. There would be no
taxes or duties on items imported for the project. Foreign exchange costs for
fertilizers, insecticides, fuel and spare parts during the five-year develop-
ment period for both state farms have been included in the project cost. The
financing of recurrent foreign exchange expenditures totalling $2.6 million
during the development phase of the project is justifiable because of the very
severe shortage of foreign exchange in the Lao PDR.
4.02      A physical contingency factor of 10% is applied to the components
for equipment, services and civil works. Costs due to expected price increases
over the implementation period account for about 16% of total project costs,
assuming the following annual inflation rates:
Annual inflation rate (%)
1979-84
Civil works                              8
Material, equipment & services            7
These inflation rates are appropriate for both foreign and local components of
the project. Salary levels and wages in the Lao PDR are government-controlled
and all local expenditures (20% of project costs) would be made through the
official marketing system.  Although Government practice has been to keep
local prices constant over the past two years, some upward price adjustments
can be expected. Details of the project cost estimates are presented in Annex 1
and are summarized in Table 4.1.

Financing
4.03      Total project costs would be fully financed by IDA ($10.4 million),
EECSAA ($2.7 million), and UNDP ($1.3 million). The proposed IDA credit of
$10.4 million would finance 72% of total project cost and cover about 90%
of foreign exchange expenditures. Parallel financing by UNDP would cover the
balance of foreign exchange costs and a small amount of local costs for
technical assistance and support equipment. Joint financing by EECSAA would
cover the balance of local costs of the project.

Procurement
4.04      Procurement would generally be on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. Where contracts are estimated to cost more than $100,000, the
Bank's prior approval would be required before invitations to bid are issued
and contracts awarded, with the following exceptions: civil works in conjunc-
tion with both the seed and feedgrain farms would amount to about $4.5 million
and involve a wide range of activities from land clearing to farm roads and
buildings construction. The works would not be suitable for international
competitive bidding in view of the small size and phasing of work, as well as
the high costs and difficulties involved in setting up workshops and hiring
of labor in the country. Instead the work would either be carried out by
force account or be contracted on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally among the small number of joint venture companies in the country.
Although all companies in the Lao PDR have been nationalized, a few continue
to operate with the permission of Government and are able to offer competitive
prices for work that would otherwise be done by the technical ministry
concerned. Equipment and material to be purchased under the project amounts
to about $11 million. Where equipment and materials (including fertilizers)
are needed in small quantities, such that individual units or orders do not
exceed $10,000 each or $500,000 in total, procurement would be in accordance
with prudent shopping practices involving at least three quotations. When
available and to permit flexibility in the procurement of specialized materials



- 25 -
and equipment and of items purchased in small quantities, such items costing
not more than $50,000, but not exceeding $1 million in total, could be
procured in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures acceptable
to the Bank. A growing number of international firms are ustablishing sales
representatives in the Lao PDR.
Disbursements
4.05       Disbursements of the IDA credit would be made at the rate of 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment; 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment; 75% of expenditures for imported
equipment and materials procured locally; 75%O of expenditures for civil works
and 50% of operation and maintenance costs during the implementation period.
Disbursements from the Special Action Credit would be made at the rate of 25%
of expenditures for civil works and 50% for operation and maintenance.
Disbursements for equipment, vehicles, construction materials, fertilizers,
insecticides and for works carried out by contractors would be supported by
normal documentation. Disbursements for force account work would be made
against statements of expenditure, certified by the Project Coordinator, with
the supporting documentation retained by the Borrower and held available for
inspection by IDA supervision missions. An estimated schedule of disbursements
is presented in Annex 3, together with a description of the accounting organi-
zations and procedures to be followed under the project. It is expected that
disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1984. Because of the country's
shortage of foreign exchange, and to ensure timely start-up of project activi-
ties immediately after credit effectiveness, an arrangement similar to that
provided under the first project would be made, whereby a revolving fund would
be set up in a special account of the Borrower from which foreign exchange
costs of small items of equipment and supplies could be financed during the
first six months of the project. On credit effectiveness, an initial disburse-
ment of $50,000 would be made from the credit account to the special account,
which could then be replenished up to a maximum of $50,000 upon request of
the Borrower, supported by documentation satisfactory to IDA. Total disburse-
ments from the credit account would not exceed $200,000.  An assurance was
obtained at negotiations that as a condition of credit effectiveness, Govern-
ment would open a special account in a banking institution acceptable to IDA
(para. 8.02b]J).
Accounts and Audit
4.06       Each implementing agency is subject to normal government control and
auditing procedures (Annex 3). Project accounts would be audited by the State
Auditors and supervision missions would work closely with the authorities to
improve the quality of audits, if necessary. IDA has furnished the Govern-
ment with auditing guidelines, proforma accounts and reporting requirements.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) separate accounts
would be maintained for each of the two government f aras and for the equipment
and materials procured under the "smallholder and cooperative development"
component of the project; and (b) audited project accounts would be sent to
the Association within four rnonths of the close of each financial year
(January 1 to December 31)(para. 8.01[c]J).



- 26 -
Environmental Effects
4.07       To the extent that the project promotes improved farming practices,
particularly in rainfed lands where soil conservation and fertility level
maintenance are critical, it is expected that the project would promote
considerable and lasting improvements on the environment.
Role of Women
4.08       Farming in the Lao PDR traditionally relies on women to provide the
main labor force during transplanting and harvesting of rice. It is expected
that a considerable proportion of the field labor force required for the
project would be women (see Table 6.1).
5. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
Incremental Production
5.01       Seeds.  The targeted yearly production at full development of the
project (i.e. after about 4 years) would be sufficient for some 100,000 ha
of paddy, or about 15% of the country's total paddy land, and 50,000 ha of feed-
grain, or 140% of the country's total present feedgrain land (Annex 4). Scope
would exist within the project for expanding the vegetable seed production as
required.
5.02      Feedgrains.  The incremental yearly production of feedgrain expected
from Veune Kham state farm (about 5,350 tons) would help meet urgent livestock
feeding requirements. The grain produced would be processed into compound
feed at Tha Ngone and Thong Toun government feed mills./L In addition, an
incremental annual production of about 1,000 tons of maize is expected from
some 2,400 farmers to be assisted under the project (Annex 4). The total
incremental feedgrain production would thus reach 6,550 tons (5,500 tons
maize), or about 70% of the Tha Ngone and Thong Toun feed mill total capacity),
and substitute for about $2.3 million in imports annually.
5.03      Rice.  As shown in Annex 4, an incremental yearly production of
about 3,700 tons of paddy, representing 12.5% of Vientiane Province's normal
yearly deficit, would be expected from about 3,600 ha of rice fields belonging
to some 2,400 farmers who would receive fertilizers and other technical
support under the project. Another 40,000 farmers would benefit from the
dissemination of improved seed produced under the project. Incremental
production from the use of improved seed would be 10,000 tons annually at
full development and would result from the introduction of improved lodging
resistant varieties of rice, as well as from the ability to plant additional
crop areas following crop failures due to drought or flood.
/1 Since no oil mill (for soybeans and groundnut) exists in the country, the
compound feed formula chosen by the Directorate of Livestock does not
include any soybean or groundnut mill cakes.



- 27 -
Organization of Production and Marketing
5.04       In accordance with its objective of restructuring the economy along
socialist lines, the Government has enacted legislation for group farming and
for state control of marketing of food and export crops. Farmers are encouraged
to sell their land and livestock to production cooperatives while keeping a
residual garden plot. Production, credit, and marketing decisions are to be
made as a group and the net returns would be shared among members, including
landless laborers, according to their contribution to the cooperative's
assets and the work points earned. Few cooperatives were operating at the
time of appraisal, although a large number were planned and attempts were
being made to activate them.
5.05      The project would assist the Government by establishing a pilot
technical service in the Ministry of Agriculture and by focussing the attention
of the technical service on two or three cooperatives. The initial objective
would be to develop a working model for cooperatives in the Lao situation, and
to establish the necessary technical and marketing linkages between the
cooperatives and the appropriate government authority.
Organization of Marketing and Prices
5.06      Legislation requires all sales of major crops to be made to the
State Purchasing Agency, a department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce,
although minor crops may be traded locally. Officially determined prices are
supposed to prevail in all transactions. In return, the state provides a
network of stores for the sale of farm inputs and basic consumer goods.
During the transitional period to full socialist group organization of
production and consumption, problems of price control have arisen due to the
following reasons: (a) the proposed system is new to the Lao farmer, for
whom traditional economic activity centered on private small farms and
village markets. Such basic changes are therefore initially accompanied by
uncertainty; (b) the implementation capacity of the state is limited and
details of the system are evolving with experience; (c) cooperatives increase
the state's ability to tax. Since farm taxes are new, farmers tend to be
evasive and alert to the implications of cooperative control; and (d) the
goods in the state stores are restricted to only a few items and often are
insufficient in quantity. Therefore, for many farmers there is little
advantage in selling to the state at low prices, if the state cannot supply
sufficient basic consumer items at consistent price levels.
5.07      The project would help Government focus on key price policy issues,
but at the same time, care has been taken to ensure that project implementation
can proceed without full resolution of issues concerning price levels and poli-
cies. At the time of appraisal, the prices for basic agricultural commodities
were based on the official price of rice, which bore no apparent relationship
with the import parity price of rice, either at the official or shadow exchange
rate. For corn, therefore, prices prevailing at appraisal would not provide
sufficient incentive for farmers to grow the crop, particularly since most
sales would have to pass through the Government feed mill at officially
controlled prices.



- 28 -
5.08      Since the time of appraisal, discussions have been under way between
the Bank and Government on general price levels and the role of incentive
pricing vs. administratively controlled prices in the Lao economy. Government
recognizes the problem and an assurance was obtained at negotiations that
Government would set and maintain farm-gate prices at levels that would
(a) provide state farms with a rate of return acceptable to Government and the
Association, and (b) provide individual farmers and cooperatives with sufficient
incentive to promote the use of improved seed, the acceptance of an improved
technology package and the production of feedgrains (para. 8.011d]).
5.09      While it will be important in the longer term for Lao PDR authorities
to develop the means for promoting corn and feedgrain production by individual
farmers and cooperatives, the production of feedgrain from the proposed Veune
Kham state farm would be sufficient for the needs of the country during the
first four years of the project. This should allow Government sufficient time
to resolve major price policy issues and to determine ways of stimulating
crop production.
Farm Budgets
5.10      The farm budget analysis conducted at project appraisal would serve
as a basis for discussions between the Bank and Government on ways of ration-
alizing the present price system. Budgets for the state farms and for
individual or cooperative farms are given in Annex 5. The main price policy
implications are given below.
5.11      Government Farms:  Na Phok and Veune Kham.  At official prices existing
at at the time of appraisal, the farms would operate at a loss, thereby requiring
considerable government subsidies in order to operate effectively. If a price
shift were to be made towards border prices, the farms would be financially
viable. However, because of the significant external benefits resulting from
the provision of animal feed and improved seed at prices that encourage their
adoption, subsidized state farm operations may be justified, at least in the
medium term.
5.12      Individual and Cooperative Farns.  Under the project, improved
seed would be distributed to farmers at a cost equivalent to paddy in order
to promote seed adoption. However, the project does include a small amount
($900,000) for purchase of fertilizers and farm equipment by individual
farmers and cooperatives (see para. 3.25), which could not be paid for in
full from sales of rice at existing official price levels. Adoption of
improved technology would therefore be unlikely without additional government
subsidies on agricultural inputs, or without changing farm-gate prices as
indicated in Table 5.1. Government and supervision missions would focus on
this problem during project implementation.
5.13      Another price issue reflected in the data in Table 5.1 relates to
the return to labor for rainfed farmers in the LAO PDR.  If farm outputs are
sold at official prices, the imputed wage rates of about 170-180 Kip/day are
less than the minimum daily wage rates paid to government emplovees of
200 Kip/day. Government proposals to increase the minimum wage rates to about
400 Kip/day in order to meet basic needs would further widen the disparity



- 29 -
between equivalent wage rates for rural and urban workers. This again high-
lights the need for adjustments in the present price policies, which are to be
pursued during project implementation.

6. PROJECT IMIPLEMENTATION
Implementing Agencies
6.01      Ministry of Agriculture.  Responsibility for implementing the
project would lie with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
The 9'Iinistry has seven line departments or directorates, i.e. (a) Agriculture,
(b) Irrigation, (c) Livestock and Animal Health Protection, (d) Planning,
Statistics and Finance, (e) Forestry, (f) Meteorology and Hydrology, and
(g) Personnel (see Chart 19912). All but the Forestry, Mleteorology and
Personnel Directorates would be concerned with the project, as outlined below
and as shown in Annex 3.
(a)  Agriculture Directorate.  Responsible for the acricultural develop-
ment and operation of the Na Phok and Veune Kham state farms and
the distribution of seeds produced at Na Phok. Responsible also for
the training of agriculture technicians provided for under the
proiect.

(b)  Irrigation Directorate.  Responsible for development of the
irrigation system on the Na Phok seed farm. (The Irrigation
Directorate has the responsibility for implementing the largest
portion of the first IDA project.)
(c) Livestock Directorate. Responsible for the operation of the Thong
Toun and Tha Ngone feed mills and therefore the recipient of the
output from the Veune Kham feedgrain farm.  Policy issues raised by
the project in relation to feed-rain and pork prices would be
of prime concern to the Livestock Department (see para. 5.10).
(d) State Farm Directorate. Responsible for the operation of state
farms. This is a new directorate established initially to handle
the operations of the Veune Kham state farm.
(e) Planning Statistics and Finance Directorate. Responsible for
coordinating the various components of the proposed project as well
as those of the ongoing IDA-assisted project. The main functions
requiring coordination would be procurement, project accounts and
monitoring and evaluation of the project. A procurement coordinator
and accounts coordinator would be appointed from within the
Directorate of Planning to assist in these matters. Monitoring and
evaluation would be handled by the unit of the Planning Directorate
to be established in accordance with Section 3.08 of the Credit
Agreement 760-LA. The Director of the Planning Directorate would
have overall responsibility for coordinating the project.
6.02      Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  The role of the 14inistry of
Industry and Commerce is of importance to the project in the procurement
process. Ali procurement by Government is handled by the Import-Export
organization, a "department" of the Industry and Commerce Ministry. Details
of the procurement process are shown in Annex 3.
Organization and Management
6.03      Government Farms.  The MIinistry of Agriculture has appointed Project
Directors for both the Na Phok and the Veune Kham farms. The farm directors
are fully responsible for day-to-day operations on their respective farms,
and administratively responsible to the Directorate of Agriculture in the
case of Na Phok and to the State Farm Directorate in the case of Veune
Kham. The farm directors would be assisted by one deputy director for
administration and one senior field supervisor. Annual work programs and
other planning matters would be determined by a committee of these three
people in accordance with normal government procedures. The director
of Na Phok would work closely with the seed processing specialist recruited
for the project (see para. 3.11[a]), while the director of Veune Kham would
work closely with the feedgrain production specialist. Both farm directors
would utilize the services of the agricultural farm machinery specialist, and
the directors would be responsible for coordinating thie work of their respective
machine workshops so as to make maximum use of the facilities provided under
the project.

6.04      For the Na Phok seed farm, a staff of at least 82 would be employed,
while for Veune Kham, the minimum staffing would be 169 in accordance with
the staffing pattern shown in Table 6.1. Field labor requirements would be as
much as 940 workers for Veune Kham and 350 workers for Na Phok at full develop-
ment. Details on the seasonality of field labor requirements are given in
Annex 7 (Annex 2, Table 14 and Annex 3, Table 9 of the Project File). Each
government farm would be responsible for keeping separate accounts for its
respective subproject and for preparing annual work programs. The Directorate
of Planning would be responsible for coordinating subproject accounts and for
submitting work programs to IDA by January 31 of each year. An assurance to
this effect was obtained at negotiations (para. 8.01[c]). For procurement
under the project, each government farm would be responsible for drawing up
detailed specifications for equipment and materials required. The procurement
coordinator in the Directorate of Planning would be responsible for arranging
and following up procurement by the Import-Export organization, as indicated
in the flow chart for procurement procedures (Annex 3, Chart 19167).
6.05      Training and Pilot Agricultural Technical Services.  The Directorate
of Agriculture would have responsibility for the training of agricultural
technicians and for organizing the pilot staff of agricultural technicians
under the project. Technicians for training under the project would primarily
be graduates from the agricultural school at Na Bong. Training would be
conducted mainly at the Salakham and Hat Dok Keo research stations (supported
under the first IDA credit) or at the Veune Kham and Na Phok state farms as
they are developed under the proposed project. The rice production specialist
appointed under the first project (Credit 760-LA) and the feedgrain production
specialist to be appointed under the proposed project would be primarily
responsible for advising counterpart staff in the organization and content of
training courses. The Director of the Directorate of Agriculture would have
overall responsibility for the implementation of the training and agricultural
extension activities proposed under the project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.06      The project would utilize the monitoring and evaluation unit
and procedures being established under the first IDA credit. In accordance
with the first Credit Agreement, a unit would be set up comprising a
civil engineer, an agriculturalist and a financial analyst. It has been
agreed that the unit would be established within the Directorate of Planning
of the Ministry of Agriculture (see Annex 3, Chart 19911) and would be
responsible for coordinating and evaluating progress reports from the various
directorates concerned with implementing the first and the proposed second
IDA credit. Supervision missions would continue to assist in the setting up
of the unit, which at appraisal of the second proposed credit was still not
functioning.

7.  BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
7.01      The major benefit of the project would be the incremental crop yields
obtained by farmers through use of the project's improved seeds. Assuming no
change in existing cultural practices or in the level of other farm inputs,
the use of improved seed from the project is estimated to result in annual
yield increases averaging 166 kg/ha for paddy, 250 kg/ha for maize, 100 kg/ha
for soybean, 75 kg/ha for groundnut and 150 kg/ha for sorghum. Annual yield
increases from use of the fertilizers and pesticides provided under the project
are calculated at 800 kg/ha for wet season paddy, 1,200 kg/ha for dry season
paddy and 900 kg/ha for maize (Annex 6, Table 1).
7.02      At full development, the annual incremental production of commer-
cial grain and other crops generated by use of the project seeds is esti-
mated to be 7,500 tons of paddy, 10,000 tons of maize, 240 tons of sorghum,
428 tons of soybeans and 124 tons of groundnuts. The incremental value of
these crops, calculated at border prices for commodities traded internationally
and at farm-gate prices for those that are not, would be about $6.3 million
per year. This incremental value would be partially offset by incremental
annual costs associated with seed production and processing, as well as
incremental costs incurred by farmers using project seed. Total incremental
costs are expected to be $1.4 million, giving a net incremental value of
production of $4.9 million/year.
7.03      An important constraint in the Lao PDR is the weakness of the
agricultural support services. This is aggravated by poorly developed
distribution systems for both inputs and outputs. Without improvements in
linkages between farms, markets and support services, the present substantial
undercapacity utilization of agricultural resources will remain. The seed
farm and smallholder cooperative development components of the proposed
project are designed to tackle this problem by providing direct institution
building through training and strengthening of technical services, and by
providing practical experience in the production and distribution of new
and improved seeds through all stages, i.e. from the experimental farms to
the farmers. Similarly, the feedgrain component would develop production
experience and marketing channels from the farm through the feed mill and
piggeries to the final consumer.
7.04      The impact of this extra production on prices is uncertain
but is not expected to be large, since most of the project output would be
marketed through official channels at fixed prices.  These prices would,
however, be partly determined by supply. Price effects would be greatest on
unofficial transactions. These are only likely to reach significant propor-
tions for rice marketing, but the project's incremental rice production is
estimated at only about 2% of the national production.
7.05      Seed from the seed farm would be sufficient to supply a steady
stream of improved varieties to farmers, but equally important, sufficient
seed would be stored to rapidly facilitate replanting after crop disasters



- 35 -
such as the floods and droughts that plague the Lao agriculture sector (see
para. 1.04). The ready availability of seed would decrease output fluctuations
due to shortages of seed and delays in seed dissemination. Use of the
non-lodging rice varieties would lessen the impact of heavy rains, wind and
flooding on food availability. The feedgrain component of the project would
provide feed for pigs produced in the multiplication units to be developed
under the first IDA project in the Lao PDR.
7.06      Beneficiaries of the seed component of the project would be mainly
some 40,000 small farmers who are among the poorest group in the Lao PDR.
Losses from lodging of paddy will be reduced by using the lodging resistant
varieties to be produced by the project. An increase in farm production by
about 10% would be expected from using the improved seed, while production
increases of about 40% would result from the use of seed with fertilizer,
pesticides and appropriate technology. The effects on farm incomes would
be in line with production increases, but much would depend on price adjust-
ments discussed in paras. 5.10 to 5.13.  The immediate beneficiaries of the
feedgrain component would be urban pork consumers and farmers selling grain
to the feed mill complex which would be made operational by the large supplies
of grain from the Veune Kham feedgrain farm.
7.07      Employment resulting from the seed farm would be about 80 full-
time jobs and some 75,000 man-days of field labor per year, equivalent to
about 300 full-time positions. The feedgrain farm would employ 170 people on
a full-time basis and provide an extra 170,000 man-days of field work per
year equivalent to 680 full-time jobs. Extra labor requirements on small
farms are insignificant.
Justification
7.08      The economic rate of return under the assumptions shown in
Annex 6 is quite satisfactory at 61% for the combined project. Given the
experience with the first project, some implementation delays can be expected.
With a two-year delay in achieving the benefits, combined with a 20% cost
increase, the rate of return is 24%. A benefit shortfall of 50% combined
with a 20% cost overrun will give a 14% rate of return. Considering all
aspects, the rate of return is likely to be at least 24% and remains satis-
factory under a wide range of assumptions.
7.09      The component rates of return are also satisfactory.  The benefits
of the seed farm are the on-farm production gains, which give an economic
rate of return of 121%. Even with a 50% benefit decline combined with a
50% cost overrun, the rate is still quite good at 28%. The alternative of
importing improved seeds was considered, but major seed suppliers report that
internationally traded seed of corn and sorghum is not suitable for use in
the Lao PDR without substantial field testing. Similarly, suitable paddy
lines are area specific and depend on improvement of local strains.



- 36 -
7.10      The economic rate of return for the feedgrain component is 14%.
The investments costed against this component include some infrastructural
items needed for the second phase of the feedgrain farm in which an additional
3,000 ha of crops will be developed. A minimum additional area of 600 ha
(20%) of rainfed maize, soybeans and groundnuts commencing in year 10 raises
the economic rate of return from 11% to 14% when allowance is made for the
extra costs and returns involved. The results for the feedgrain component
are more sensitive than those for seed production, with a cost overrun of 20%
reducing the rate of return to 7%, and a one-year delay in achieving benefits
after the initial costs have been made reducing the rate to 10%.
7.11      The methodology used for computing the economic rate of return
is to value of traded goods at the US$ border price, times the official
exchange rate. Domestic figures are used for nontraded items, such as
unskilled labor, root crops and vegetables. Details are given in Annex 6.
Risks
7.12      The major project risk is that the implementation capacity of the
executing agencies will not be sufficient to enable works to proceed as
planned.   Experience with the first project indicates difficulties in
(a) coordination of agencies; (b) procurement of necessary items in a timely
manner; and (c) a general unfamiliarity with management of large enterprises.
Safeguards to reduce these risks have been designed into the project in the
form of simplifications of project design and technical assistance. However,
supervision will need to be frequent. Another project risk is that the
pricing structure adopted will not provide the necessary incentive to entice
small farmers to grow feedgrains or to adopt improved technology. If
demand for the improved seed is less than expected because of inappropriate
incentives, or because the project management has difficulty in managing the
complex seed production, processing and marketing components, then seed may
be consumed as grain and much of the potential benefit lost. Safeguards have
been taken in project design to base investments on conservative demand
estimates and by emphasizing training. However, since the production of
feedgrain from the proposed Veune Kham state farm would be sufficient for the
needs of the country during the first four years of the project, there should
be sufficient time for Government to resolve major price policy issues and to
determine ways of stimulating crop production, without limiting the impact of
the proposed project.

8. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreement was reached at negotiations on the following main points:
(a)  Government would ensure that the irrigation works provided for Na
Phok under the project would be done in a timely manner and com-
pleted by April 30, 1982 (para. 3.06[c]);
(b)  Government would recruit specialists in machinery and construction
acceptable to IDA by December 31, 1979 (paras. 3.11 and 3.17);
(c) Government would maintain separate accounts and prepare annual work
programs for each of the two farms and for the equipment and
materials procured in conjunction with training and the provision
of technical services and inputs. Audited project accounts would
be sent to the Association within four months of the close of each
financial year, while work programs would be submitted by January 31
of each year (paras. 4.06 and 6.04); and
(d)  Government would set and maintain farm-gate prices at levels that
would (i) provide state farms with a rate of return acceptable to
the Government and the Association, and (ii) provide individual
farmers and cooperatives with sufficient incentive to promote the
use of improved seed, the acceptance of an improved technology
package and the production of feedgrains (para. 5.08).
8.02      Agreement was also obtained at negotiations that as conditions of
credit effectiveness: (a) specialists acceptable to IDA in seed pror>-pssing and
feedgrain production would be recruited (paras. 3.11 and 3.17) and (b) Govern-
ment would open a special account in a banking institution acceptable to
IDA (para. 4.05).
8.03      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA credit of $10.4 million and an EEC Special Action Credit of $2.7 million
on standard IDA terms. The Borrower would be the Lao People's Democratic
Republic.

2.        Accounting Procedures.  The key agency responsible for coordinating
the physical implementation of the project and for keeping records and
accounts of the project would be the Directorate of Planning Statistics and
Finance (Chart 19911). Under the first IDA Credit (Cr. 760-LA), a Project
Evaluation and Monitoring Unit was established within the Planning Directorate.
Section 3.08 of the Credit Agreement 760-LA requires that this unit be
staffed with an agriculturalist, an economist and a financial analyst.

ANNEX 3
Page 2
3.        The Evaluation and Monitoring Unit would be responsible under
both the first and proposed second IDA credits for coordinating procurement,
ensuring proper maintenance of project accounts, submitting credit with-
drawal applications via the Ministry of Finance, and for reporting on the
performance of the various project components. Although these activities are
consistent with the general mandate of the Directorate of Planning, Statistics
and Finance, both the first and proposed second IDA projects would seek to
strengthen the Directorate's capability. At the time of appraisal of second
project, the required staffing of the Directorate had not been achieved.
However, positive steps had been taken (i) to designate an experienced
procurement officer to coordinate procurement and keep the accounts and
(ii) to designate an officer responsible for coordinating work programs. The
complex manner in which all procurement is handled in the Lao-PDR (see Chart
19167) was discussed with Government during preparation of the proposed
project, but changes were not feasible for the second project.
4.        The accounts for all Ministries in the Lao-PDR are audited annually
by the Government's audit office, and the auditors' independent report
is submitted to the Prime Minister's office. Close attention will be needed
by supervision missions to the procurement and accounting procedures being
followed in connection with the IDA projects, and periodic involvement of
staff from the controller's department on supervision missions will be
necessary.

AGRICULTURE REIHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Economic Analysis
Components
1.        The economic benefit to Laos resulting from the seeds component will
be the incremental grain production on farms. For this reason, the standard
practice of combining the costs incurred on the seed farm with the benefits
realized on family farms has been followed. The output of the seed farm has
been separated into three parts. The first is the 20% that is not suitable
for seed. This is valued at grain prices. The second is seed that is distri-
buted to farmers together with other components of improved cultural practices
such as fertilizer and pesticides. The use of this seed is calculated to
yield increases according to the parameters shown in Table 1. The final
incremental production is then valued at grain prices and extra on-farm
costs are included. The third part of the seed farm output is that seed
distributed to farms without accompanying inputs. Here the yield increase
will come solely through resistance to lodging. This seed is estimated to
give yield increases according to the parameters shown in Table 1. For this
amount, no incremental on-farm costs are incurred. The rate of return for this
component is 121% under the basic assumptions shown. In the extreme event of
costs rising 50% and benefits falling by half, the economic rate of return is
still acceptable at 28%.
2.         The question remains as to whether these same benefits could be
realized at less cost by importing improved seeds. International seed sup-
pliers report that hybrids and varieties of the relevant seeds are area
specific and none of those traded internationally are readily suitable for
use in Laos without extensive yield testing. However, to get an idea of the
magnitude involved, varieties that are commonly traded would cost some US$1,200/
ton for corn as seed, whereas the price of corn as grain is some US$140/ton.
Similar relationships are involved for the other seed crops produced. Use
of these prices to value the seed farm output results in a rate of return for
the farm of over 100%. This method is not suggested on theoretical and empiri-
cal grounds.
3.        The feedgrain farm component is the first of a two-stage development
of 6,000 ha of farmland and will involve 3,000 ha of rainfed land. The second
stage is anticipated to extend the farmed land by including the final 3,000 ha
as irrigated land. For this reason, the ultimate benefits will be greater
than those directly attributable to this present project. Similarly, on the
cost side the project includes some items such as a bridge and roads, part of
which is attributable to the second phase. It is assumed that at least 20%
of the spare 3,000 ha will commence to be cropped as rainfed farm starting
in year 10. The incremental costs and benefits of this additional area are
added to the component costs and benefits including the full cost of all
infrastructure. The rate of return under these assumptions is 14%. For the
total project the rate of return is 61% (Table 2).

Methodology
4.        Standard cost-benefit analysis is used with a project life of 25
years. Traded goods are valued at prices at the border converted at the offi-
cial exchange rates into kips, nontraded items except labor are valued in
kip at official farm-gate prices.  The pricing of labor presents some problems
because of Government intervention in the labor market. The State sets prices
and quantities of labor independently of each other. Two adjustments were
made to correct the resultant distortion. First, because the minimum wage
of 200 kip/man-day is based on the distorted paddy price of 25 kip/kg, the
wage was revalued at 800 kip/man-day since the border price of paddy derived
from the rice price is approximately four times its domestic price. This keeps
the price ratio between labor and paddy constant in border and domestic prices.
Second, because state farms are involved in other activities than direct agri-
cultural production, there is an excess of labor over that technically required
to produce a given output. An arbitrary adjustment factor of 0.5 was applied
to the 800 kip/man-day to arrive at an economic wage rate of 400 kip/man-day.
For the project as a whole, the high rate of return allows a wide range of
values for the shadow wage rate to be used without becoming unacceptable.
5.        Commodities produced have been valued at prices based on the Bank's
world market commodity price forecast adjusted for transport to Vientiane.
Similar procedures are used to cost fertilizers and other recurrent inputs.
Investment items were priced in terms of their 1979 values (Table 3).
Sensitivity
6.        The basic rate of return of the total project is 61% with an NPV at
12% of US$22.2 million. As shown below, benefits could be halved and
combined with a cost increase of 20% before the project would be unacceptable.
Based on the experience with the first project and the characteristics of the
sector, it seems that a delay in project implementation and a slow rate of
farmer participation are the problems most likely to be encountered. With a
three-year delay (lag) in realization of on-farm benefits after investments
were incurred, the rate of return would still be acceptable at 23%.
