INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The ERTIC Program and the Medium Term Service
Contracts are financed by the IDA of the World Bank.
Locally, the program is technically coordinated by the
Program Coordination Unit (UCP) of the Ministry of
Electricity and Alternative Energies of the GOB. The
World Bank has provided technical support promoted
capacity building and will coordinate the payments of
output-based subsidies.

OUTCOMES
In 2005, 14 MSCs were successfully bid out to private
service providers to minimize the subsidies paid against
an ambitious set of provider obligations. The tender
resulted in a 25-percent gain in number of new users.
After an initial delay, implementation started in July
2006, and more than 1,000 SHS were installed by
December.
