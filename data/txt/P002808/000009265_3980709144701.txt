Credit 2291-TA
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Urban Sector
Engineering Project in Tanzania, for which Credit 2291-TA in the amount of 8.6 million
SDR (US$ 11.2 million equivalent) was approved on July 30, 1991, and made effective
on February 26, 1992.
The Credit for the project closed on December 31, 1996, compared to an original
closing date of December 31, 1995. IDA disbursed a total of US$ 10.95 million
equivalent and canceled US$ 1.33 million equivalent at the request of the Borrower. The
disbursed and canceled amounts add to US$ 12.28 million equivalent, which is higher
than the original amount in US$ 11.2 million equivalent due to a devaluation of the US$
relative to the SDR during the project period. The final disbursement on the Credit took
place on June 9, 1997. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)
provided co-financing for the project.
T'he ICR was prepared by Solomon Alemu (AFTUI) and Matthew Mitchel
(Consultant), and reviewed by Jeffrey S. Racki (Sector Manager AFTU1) and James
W.Adams (Country Director, Tanzania). The preparation of the ICR was based on
material in the project file. There was no special completion mission for the ICR because
the project performance was highly satisfactory, the implementing agency of the
Borrower produced a substantive project evaluation, and IDA missions for the follow-up
Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project (USRP) gathered the necessary information needed
to prepare IDA's parts of the ICR. Even though an ICR mission did not take place, IDA
discussed ICR preparation with the Borrower during one of USRP's supervision missions
and provided guidelines for ICR preparation. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR through its independent evaluation attached as Annex 1 and the
provision of data necessary to complete Part II.

URBAN SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT

Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Urban Sector Engineering Project (USEP), was a response to Tanzania's
problem of a rapidly growing urban population, increasing pressure on already
deteriorating basic urban services. It supported the infrastructure rehabilitation
component of the country's Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP). Previously,
IDA had been involved with two urban projects covering national sites and services but
these projects only had limited success due to local resource constraints (Part II, Table 2).
USEP, the first engineering and technical assistance project in Tanzania's urban sector,
was designed to address these constraints.
Project Objectives and Components
ii.   The main project objective was to create an effective institutional and financial
framework for the urban sector and prepare a sustainable urban infrastructure investment
and maintenance program. The basis for this new framework was to be the establishment
of efficient financial management systems along with the introduction of Financial
Performance Improvement Plans (FPIPs) designed to help make local urban governments
become self-sufficient in resource generation and management. The project was to cover
the capital city of Dar es Salaamn and nine urban towns (Part I, para. 2). The components
of the project, detailed in Part I, para. 2, were diverse, covering: the evaluation of
institutional, financial and physical condition of the urban sector; the preparation of
financial performance improvement plans; and the design of investment components.
Project Implementation Experience and Results
iM.   The project was approved by IDA's Board on July 30, 1991 and became effective
on February 26, 1992. Total project costs amounted to about US$ 17 million, in line with
the appraisal estimate. Out of an original Development Credit amount of US$ 11.2
million equivalent, IDA disbursed about US$ 10.95 million and canceled the remaining
US$ 1.33 million equivalent at the request of the Borrower. NORAD co-financed the
project, providing US$ 5.9 million equivalent, which was higher that the appraisal
estimate (US$5.0 million) due to an extension of the technical assistance to cover both
urban mapping and institutional strengthening (Part I, para. 18).



v
iv.   The project substantially achieved its objectives by preparing the necessary
engineering work for a follow-up rehabilitation project based on a realistic assessment of
what could be achieved in policy and institutional development. Supervision reports
rated the project as highly satisfactory in meeting its objectives noting that the project
was well-managed by the Borrower. Part I, paras. 9-16, discuss the specific achievements
based on the categories and ratings in Part II, Table 1, Summary of Assessments.
v.    The major factor affecting the project was a clearer picture of the institutional and
financial constraints that emerged during implementation, which required scaling down
the investment program originally envisaged at the outset of the project (Part I, para. 21).
Also, from the Borrower's perspective there was some discontinuity in the project due to
IDA staff changes; however, these changes did not adversely affect the overall outcome
of the project.
Project Outcome, Sustainability and Future Operations
vi.   The ICR rates the project's outcome as highly satisfactory, based on the
substantial achievement of objectives under capacity constraints and the favorable
evaluations in supervision reports (Part II, Table 1). The sustainability of the project's
achievements is likely (Part It, Table 1) given that the follow-up USRP, financed by
IDA, is already underway and is progressing well. This project is implementing the
investment components designed by USEP and is continuing to make further
improvements in the policy and institutional framework. USRP reflects the key points of
the operational plan for USEP (Attachment 2) which: (a) highlights parts of IDA's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzania, serving as the overall framework for
future operations; and (b) outlines objectives and project components necessary to
promote the CAS in the urban sector. The main themes of the CAS are: the upgrading
and expansion of basic infrastructure and urban services; capacity building; improved
public sector management; private sector development; and environmentally sustainable
investments.
Key Lessons Learned
vii.  The principal lesson learned in project design is that the severe deterioration of
urban infrastructure and the need for fundamental changes in institutional and policy
mechanisms is likely to require a series of projects-- instead of a single technical
assistance project and a follow-up investment vehicle-- to comprehensively address sector
needs in light of local capacity constraints. This is especially true in a country, such as
Tanzania, which historically has had a high degree of centralization. With hindsight, a
more appropriate vehicle probably would have been an adaptable program lending
operation, a recent funding mechanism that was not an option when IDA appraised USRP
(Part I, para. 27 ). This type of operation could have resulted in a larger rehabilitation
project but with disbursements in tranches, based on progress in policy and institutional
measures, allowing a faster response to changing sector needs. Other lessons, noted in



vi
Part I, paras. 28-29, are the important contribution non-governmental organizations can
make in building local capacity and the need for IDA staff to be more attentive to the
need of the Borrower's project management staff for coaching and encouragement in the
project implementation process, especially in new types of operations.

PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    When IDA appraised the Urban Sector Engineering Project (USEP), (1990)
Tanzania's urban population was growing rapidly and basic services were deteriorating.
The urban population, though only 15 percent of total population of 24.8 million, had
been increasing at a rate of between 6 and 10 percent annually, more than double the
overall population growth rate of 3 percent. This rapid population growth has put
pressure on the supply of basic community services and infrastructure such as water,
sanitation services, and roads. Investment resources, improved institutional structures,
and detailed engineering plans were needed to support the Economic and Social Action
Program (ESAP), established by the Government of the Republic of Tanzania (GOT) . A
key component of this program was the rehabilitation of the country's physical
infrastructure. USEP was an important part of this program because it was to spearhead
policy reform and identify urban infrastructure rehabilitation needs and assist in the
preparation of a follow-up investment project. Previously, IDA had been involved with
two urban projects covering national sites and services but these projects only had limited
success due to local resource constraints (Part II, Table 2). USEP was the first
engineering and technical assistance project in Tanzania's urban sector.
B. STATEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
2.    The main project objective was to create an effective institutional and financial
framework, along with engineering design, for a sustainable urban infrastructure
investment and maintenance program. The basis for this new framework was to be the
establishment of efficient financial management systems along with the introduction of
Financial Performance Improvement Plans (FPIPs) designed to help make local urban
governments self sufficient in resource generation and management. To assist in the
achievement of the above the project was to initiate rationalization of responsibilities
between central and urban local governments and utilities; and modification of internal
administrative structures, staffing patterns, and payment polices of each local authority.
The project was to cover the capital city of Dar es Salaam and the following towns --



Arusha, Iringa, Mbeya, Morogoro, Moshi, Mwanza, Tabora, and Tanga. In each of these
areas, the project consisted of the following components, for key urban infrastructure:
(a) detailed assessment of needs and the design of manpower development and training
programs;
(b) the preparation of financial performance improvement plans (FPIPs) to increase the
capability of local government in financial management and revenue generation;
(c) preparation of a property valuation and rating exercise for Dar es Salaam and the
completion of valuation rolls and rating structures for the other towns;
(d) development of basic maps to assist in planning, management and maintenance; and
(e) preparation of feasibility studies followed by preliminary and detailed engineering
designs.
C. EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
3.    The need to put in place a viable instrument to make efficient use of investment
funds for the rehabilitation of urban areas was an important objective recognized by IDA
and the Borrower. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) outlined the major policy and
institutional issues that had to be resolved to firmly establish local capacity. However,
the project did not foresee the magnitude of the investment required and the time it would
take to install an adequate local capacity. The main institutional problems were the lack
of clarity in the delegation of responsibility between central and local government; the
high dependence of the local urban councils on the central government for resources
(because of policies limiting their ability to raise and effectively manage their own
funds); inadequate skill levels of personnel to manage and maintain infrastructure; and
that reforms were slow to be accepted and implemented.
4.    The project supported IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to: create the
capacity to manage urban sector assets; establish effective local revenue centers; promote
an investment program targeted at the urban poor; and improve the urban sector's overall
financial and operational viability of the sector. IDA involvement was important to help
ensure: sufficient complementarity between the urban sector investments and the ESAP,
the efficient implementation of investments; confidence in sector performance to attract
the necessary co-financing from the international community for the subsequent
rehabilitation and investment program; and sufficient consideration of environmental and
social aspects. Also, the project was to contribute to the reduction of the government's
Water supply and sewerage, road and drainage works, and solid waste management.
2



budget deficit by improving financial management for local revenue generation, and
decentralization to municipalities.
5.    The SAR concluded the project could be implemented by the Borrower, given the
fulfillment of three conditions of effectiveness: the establishment of a Steering
2
Committee for overall project guidance; the assignment of qualified full-time local staff
to provide coordination support for the SC; and the recruitment of qualified consultants
for the institutional and financial working groups to be established under the project. The
GOT also had made progress in the development of supportive policies to strengthen the
financial independence and viability of the urban councils, in decentralizing
responsibility to local authorities for the supply operation and maintenance of
infrastructure and services, in determining the appropriate structures for enhancing
efficiency; in substituting local for central government funding by introducing local
property tax bases, and in creating effective capabilities for cost recovery.
6.    The main project risk which the SAR identified was that GOT would not
implement all of the recommendations of the engineering credit, especially the actions
necessary to restructure the institutional framework and generate tax revenues for the
local government. However, GOT's strong commitment to strengthening urban
municipalities seemed sufficient to mitigate this risk.
7.    There were some project changes in response to the limited capability of local
urban authorities to manage large rehabilitation program identified. IDA and the
Borrower worked together to prepare a priority investment program consistent with local
capacity, including an affordability study.
ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Overall Assessment
8.    The project substantially achieved its objectives -- preparing the necessary
engineering work for the follow-up rehabilitation project given what was possible to
achieve in policy and institutional development under USEP and the Urban Sector
Rehabilitation Project (USRP). Supervision reports rated the project as highly
satisfactory in meeting its objectives noting that the project was well-managed by the
Borrower. The following sections discuss the specific achievements according to the
categories in Part II, Table 1, Summary of Assessments.
2
The committee was to be chaired by the Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government and
consist of representative from the Office of the Prime Minister and the ministries covering land,
water, public works, education, heal and planning.
3



Macroeconomic and Sector Policy
9.    The project led to the development of the "General Policy Framework for Urban
Management Service Delivery and Infrastructure Investment" along with an
implementation strategy. It also paved the way for the GOT to prepare a Letter of Sector
Policy by conducting an urban policy workshop which resulted in a draft policy
framework for urban services and was the culmination of the activities financed under
USEP. In addition the work under the project to increase the revenue generation of local
authorities should eventually reduce the burden on the central government budget.
Institutional and Public Sector Development
10.   During implementation the project found that the constraints on institutional
development were greater than originally envisaged. In particular, the relationship
between the central and local government needed more attention, mainly improved laws
and practices to facilitate the ability of authorities to recover the costs. Deficiencies in
these areas had led to shortfalls in both the supply and quality of infrastructure. Despite
some progress in administrative decentralization, fiscal decentralization remains weak
and the findings of the project indicated that improvements will take time. To enhance
progress in capacity building, the project resulted in a detailed set of actions to:
rationalize central and local government responsibilities; restructure the organization of
the urban councils; strengthen fiancial planning and control; and more closely integrate
the coordination of the institutional and financial working groups. Perhaps the most
important contribution of the project was the establishment of the principle that
investments in infrastructure should be made only when the users and municipalities can
afford to pay the operation and maintenance costs of the investments. This is the basic
premise of the follow-up USRP.
Physical Objectives
11.   The project produced maps for each of the towns included in the project to be
used for planning, infrastructure investment programming, maintenance management,
and the property valuation. The mapping work, financed by NORAD, covered 1000
3
square kilometers, producing 832 aerial photos. During the course of the project,
NORAD extended its assistance to cover the strengthening of the Survey and Mapping
Division of the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlements Development.
Financial Objectives
12.   The project prepared FPIPs for the eight project towns and Dar es Salaam. The
preparation of these plans, which the PMU initiated, took place with the assistance of
consultants working in close collaboration with municipal officials. Although a

4



decentralized system is now in place, the central government is still contributing a
substantial amount to local authorities -- about two thirds of the resources and almost
100 percent of capital expenditures. This financial protection provided by the central
government has reduced incentives for improved efficiency. In particular, because funds
available for staff remuneration are more forthcoming than those for goods and services,
municipalities tend to rely on the use of force account for construction and operations
instead of contracting work to the private sector. Nevertheless, through the preparation of
FPIPs and property tax assessment, the project has helped to establish a base for local
revenue generation to reduce the drain on central government resources, thus contributing
toward the reduction of the budget deficit.
13.   The GOT has developed a strategy of raising additional revenue through
improvements in tax system efficiency and administrative capacity, including better
expenditure planning and control, based on standardized budgeting and accounting
systems. USEP helped GOT implement this policy through: a property valuation and tax
update and the establishment of an improved standardized accounting system in the Local
Authorities Accounting Manual (LAAM). GOT tested the LAAM, financed by USEP, in
two of the eight towns covered by the project and in Dar es Salaam. Encouraged by the
successful results, GOT decided to install it in the six remaining towns. As a result of
fmancial improvement actions during the project's implementation period, property tax
collection increased progressively on average from 14 percent in 1992 to 48 percent in
1995. In Dar es Salaam the rate has increased overall but has fluctuated on an annual
basis. Data indicate a large increase of 124 percent in 1993, a decline by 14 percent in
1994, and an increase of 64 percent in 1995 . Computerized accounting systems are
operating in most of the towns and there is evidence that self-generated income is
increasing.
Private Sector Development
14.   The SAR for USEP did not specify any private sector objectives. However, as a
result of limited local government capacity identified under USEP, the follow up USRP
includes provisions for private sector participation in rehabilitation and maintenance
work.
Environmental Improvement
15.   The project's SAR did not set specific environmental objectives, although concern
for the environment was taken into account in the design and evaluation work for USRP,
which includes an environmental impact assessment. For example, during the course of
USEP, it became apparent that five of the eastern towns required the identification of new
sites for waste disposal. As a result, a team of consultants from various agencies of GOT
4

TA.
5



conducted an environmental assessment of the identified sites. The fmal designs of the
technical working group for the towns identified and incorporated most of the
recommended mitigation measures.
Poverty Reduction, and other Social Objectives
16.   USEP did not specify direct poverty reduction and social objectives. However,
improvement in the condition of the urban poor was implicit in project design and USRP
specifies sustainable economic development and urban poverty alleviation as key
objectives.
D. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS
AFFECTING THE PROJECT
17.   The project was approved by the Board on July 30, 1991 and the Development
Credit Agreement was signed on October 31, 1991. The Credit became effective on
February 26, 1992. According to the original implementation plan, the project was to be
completed by December 31, 1995. However, IDA granted a one-year extension to
complete the remaining financial studies necessary to define the follow-up investment
program and install the necessary accounting and revenue systems in the project towns.
18.   Total project costs amounted to about US$ 17 million, in line with the appraisal
estimate. Out of an original Credit amount of US$ 11.2 million equivalent, IDA
disbursed about US$ 10.95 million and canceled the remaining US$ 1.33 million
5
equivalent. NORAD co-financed the project, providing US$ 5.9 million equivalent,
which was higher that the appraisal estimate (US$ 5.0 million) due to an extension of the
technical assistance to cover both mapping and institutional strengthening.
19.   The project's implementation took place mainly through three working groups
reporting to a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the Office of the Prime Minister
(PMO). These groups consisted of: an Institutional Working Group (IWG); a Financial
Working Group (FWG); and a Technical Working Group (TWG). The IWG focused on
institutional strengthening through restructuring , manpower development and training. It
prepared a thorough assessment of institutional problems and recommended actions
which GOT began to implement under USEP and will continue to implement under
USRP. The FWG focused on evaluating the need to improve the financial management,
planning and control in the local governments. Based on available and potential
5
The disbursed and canceled amnounts add to US$12.3 million equivalent. This amount is higher than the
US$ equivalent of the original Credit, which amounted to 8.6 million SDR due to the devaluation of
the US dollar relative to the SDR during the project implementation period.
6



resources, the group prepared FPIPs for each project town under the project, to define the
follow-up program of urban infrastructure investments.
20.   The TWG produced two studies: (a) a survey and diagnostic analysis (SDA) of
existing infrastructure and a strategic integrated infrastructure development program
(SIIDP) for Dar es Salaam and eight towns. Originally, the studies indicated that over a
ten year period, the country would need a rehabilitation program of US$ 650 million and
proposed an initial five-year investment program amounting to US$ 250 million to be
financed under USRP. However, due to the limited institutional capacity determined by
the IWG, and the financial constraints reported by the FWG, the Borrower and IDA
scaled down the amount of the initial rehabilitation project to about US$ 140 million
equivalent.
21.   The major factors affecting the project's implementation were the institutional and
financial constraints that emerged during the project. These constraints required a
reassessment of the rehabilitation needs and the size of the follow-up investment project,
according to a set of investment priorities which included: the expected economic rate of
return, the capacity of the town for effective operation and maintenance of assets, and
poverty alleviation issues. The Borrower, in its evaluation also indicates that the change
in the composition of IDA staff responsible for the project, caused some discontinuity in
the project. The responsibility for the project changed in the middle of the supervision
period due to internal administrative changes in IDA.
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
22.  IDA performance in identifying the project was satisfactory given the conditions
prevailing in the urban sector and past experience with investment projects that were not
filly satisfactory because of inability to manage the investment effectively. The appraisal
of the project overall was satisfactory, though in hindsight, it might have been useful to
explore ways to supplement limited local government capacity through ventures with
non-governmental organizations. Also, given that the project was a new type of
operation for GOT and had diverse components, IDA originally may have under-
estimated the complexity of the project for the Borrower. However, it appears that once
the extent of these problems was known, IDA responded by allocating significant
resources to supervision in support of the technical assistance working groups, especially
in prioritizing investments.
23.   The Borrower, in its assessment of the project (Annex 1), noted that overall IDA
made a valuable contribution to the project in terms of advice and guidance. At the same
time, the Borrower also suggested that IDA supervision missions were perhaps not long
enough given the project's complexity. However, by IDA standards, the missions were
fairly long and substantially staffed. Most of the major supervision missions consisted of
five to seven members, including institutional, technical and financial specialists, for
periods of 18 to 30 days, as project supervision was combined with the preparation of the
follow-up project. Also, as stated earlier, the Borrower noted that changes in mission
7



composition disturbed the continuity of supervision. Finally, the Borrower made
comments which indicated that there were some significant misunderstandings at times
between the Borrower's staff and mission members. During ICR preparation, IDA
sought an explanation from the Borrower of the circumstances that led to these comments
but IDA did not receive a reply.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.   The Borrower for the project was GOT, and the PMO, through the PMU, was the
project's implementing agency. The Borrower, with IDA assistance, prepared the project
over a period of five months and the preparation of the project was satisfactory, given the
urgency of the rehabilitation needs in the urban sector. Project implementation overall
was satisfactory. IDA project supervision reports indicated that the PMU managed the
project well displaying a good grasp of IDA procedures and guidelines for putting
resources into place. The Borrower showed considerable interest in the project; provided
a substantial independent evaluation of it; and readily supplied data necessary to complete
IDA's contributions to the ICR. Generally, compliance with project covenants was
satisfactory, although there was delayed compliance with covenants for the transmittal of
project audit reports and the completion of infrastructure investment plans, and the
property valuation work.
G. PROJECT OUTCOME, SUSTAINAB1LITY AND FUTURE OPERATIONS
25.   The overall outcome of the project was satisfactory (Part II, Table 1) based on the
ratings of the project's supervision reports which recognize that the project was the first
of its kind in Tanzania's urban sector and it substantially achieved its objectives despite
capacity constraints. The sustainability of the project's achievements is likely ( Part II,
Table 1) given that the follow-up USRP is underway. That project is implementing the
investment components designed by USEP and is continuing to make further
improvements in the policy and institutional framework. Future urban sector operations
related to developments under USEP are based on an operational plan (Annex 2) which:
(a) notes the highlights of IDA's CAS, serving as the overall framework for the project;
and (b) outlines USRP's objectives and components which will promote the CAS in the
urban sector during its implementation. The main themes of the CAS, which are
reflected in the project are: the upgrading and expansion of basic infrastructure and urban
services; capacity building; improved public sector management; private sector
development; and environmentally sustainable investments.
H. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   The main lesson learned in project design is that the severe deterioration of
infrastructure combined with a need for fundamental changes in institutional and policy
changes to support required investments, are likely to require a series of projects rather
than a single technical assistance project, in order to firmly establish the local government
8



capacity to handle a large investment program. This is especially true in Tanzania which
began a process of centralization of authority in the 1970s. Local governments were
restored in 1982 but, in practice, representatives of central government at regional level
have the lead decision-making role, rendering the local authorities institutionally weak.
Although the SAR for USEP identified the main policy and institutional constraints, it
was only during the implementation of the project that IDA and the Borrower realized the
full scope of the constraints. To maintain the concept of supporting only sustainable
investment, the project had to down-scale the originally proposed investment based on a
set of agreed priorities.
27.   With hindsight, a more appropriate vehicle for large sector investments probably
would have been an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) operation, a recent funding
mechanism that was not an option when IDA appraised USRP. This type of operation
could have resulted in a larger project covering the total investment program identified,
with disbursements in tranches based on progress made in related policy and institutional
development measures. The advantage of this type of operation is that it allows a faster
response to pressing sector needs and saving the additional time required to process a
number of small projects instead.
28.   The second lesson in design is the importance of considering ways that non-
govermmental entities can contribute to the operation and maintenance of urban
infrastructure, especially in cases of extreme need for infrastructure improvement and
severe limitations to government capacity. One of USRP's key objectives is to encourage
private sector and community participation in urban service delivery and maintenance.
Specifically, under USRP, the private sector is supposed to be involved initially in
project implementation and later through maintenance contracts for roads and drainage as
well as the delivery of services in sanitation and waste management. In addition, the
project includes a "demand driven" community infrastructure upgrading program for
selected infrastructure-deficient settlements in Dar es Salaam. The criterion proposed for
the selection of the sub-components for financing is the existence of a community based
organization willing to make a capital contribution of about 20 percent, with the
capability for sustaining full operation and maintenance costs.
29.   There are also two main lessons learned in project implementation and
supervision. First, despite the successful completion of USEP and the satisfactory
performance of the Borrower noted by the Bank, it is evident from the Borrower's
contribution that: the Borrower at some point felt that the project was complex both in
the number of urban sub sectors covered and geographical content; coordination between
the central and local governments was difficult; and that substantial effort was required
by the Borrower to cope with the project. Ultimately the Borrower performed well and
the project achieved its objectives. However, in the future it is important to make sure
that supervision missions provide some coaching of the Borrower and show more
appreciation for the Borrower's constraints. This is especially important when there is a
turnover in IDA project staff handling the project. Concerning the central/local
govermment coordination, the central government still has primary responsibility for the
9



project, but the inclusion of project support units in each of the eight project towns should
improve the coordination with the PMU in the central govemment. The second lesson is
the importance of a reliable auditing capacity and timely submission of audits for project
accounts, since there were some significant delays in the submission of audit reports. To
ensure improved performance of account management, USRP provides for accounting
consultants in the Project Support Units (PSUs) and the appointment of a full-time
project accountant was a condition of that project's effectiveness.
30.   Additional lessons learned in the preparation of the follow-up project include: (i)
needs assessment approach creates expectations that may conflict with conditionalities of
prioritizing or tranching; (ii) it takes time for institutional reforms to take place; and (iii)
the predetermination of all scope of work delayed USRP and constrained it too much.

URBAN SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT: CR NO. 2291 - TA
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
1.0  INTRODUCTION
This report outlines achievements made and problems encountered in the
implementation of activities financed from the engineering credit. The
performance, in particular of the government, and key lessons learnt have also
been highlighted.
2.0   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the project were:
(i) establish through a consultative process, overall Government Policy Positions
on Urban Management, Service Delivery and Infrastructure Investment;
(ii) establish appropriate institutional arrangement for the efficient and affordable
delivery of urban services;
(iii) establishment of financial framework for operating a sustainable urban
structure investment and maintenance program;
(iv) identification and design of candidate projects for IDA support.
3.0   STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING OBJECTIVES
Strategies employed included:
3.1   holding of a multi-sectoral workshop during which officials from the Central
Government, Urban Local Councils, representatives from Private Sector and
selected residents from the municipalities and the City of Dar es Salaam were
invited to contribute. The output of this workshop formed the basis for the
Government's Letter of Sector Policy communicated to the IDA, in partial
fulfillment of conditions for negotiations for the Urban Sector Rehabilitation
Project.
3.2   establishing of three working groups made up of expert consultants,
which addressed specific areas. These working groups were:
Financial Working Group (FWG)
Institutional Working Group (IWG)
Technical Working Group (TWG)
While the workshop addressed the first objective, the three working groups dealt with the
other objectives. The output from the activities of these groups are discussed below.
21



4.0 PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
4.1  General
The project has generally achieved its main objectives. A sound platform has been
prepared for the project towns for creating an effective institutional and financial
environment for the sustainability of the proposed infrastructure investment program. The
project towns revenue base have been expanded through property valuation and rating
initiatives. The project has also established a national mapping capacity, through the
strengthening of the Survey and Mapping Division of the Ministry of Lands and Human
Settlements Development. The infrastructure rehabilitation program has been carefully
prepared taking into account the following important factors; demand, affordability, level
of depravation and sustainability requirements, both nationally and at the project level, in
terms of operation and maintenance.
4.2 Sectoral Policy Reform (SPR)
The SPR addressed six major areas covering; Institutional Relationship between Central
Government and Local Authorities, Institutional Capacity Building; Local Government
Finance; Improvement of Urban Authorities revenue Base, Land Management and
Human Resettlement Issues and the role of Private Sector in Service Delivery. A major
shortcoming of the SPR was lack of attention to infrastructure management. However,
during the course of the project, key policy guidelines were defined for the road sub-
sector. It is the intention of Government, to further develop this into a comprehensive
infrastructure management policy.
4.3 Institutional Working Group (IWG)
The IWG studies focused on the following: institutional strengthening, restructuring
organization of urban councils and manpower development and training needs
assessments.
Institutional shortcomings have been identified and a statement of problems and analysis
prepared in which alternative options for resolving same were recommended to the
government for decision. The government has already taken certain decision to that
effect, while others require further analysis before appropriate decisions are taken.
The restructuring of urban authorities has been addressed. A generic scheme for
municipal organization has been prepared for government consideration. A detailed
examination of the administrative set up of the Dar es Salaam City Council was carried
out resulting in specific recommendations for its restructuring. The various
recommendations made by the IWG are selectively being actioned by the government
either directly or through nationally initiated local government reforms.
22



4.4 Financial Yorking Group (FWG)
The FWG studies centered on the improvement of urban local government financial
management, planning and control. Under financial management strengthening, the
group examined and assessed the existing revenue base, explored available untapped
resource potential in each of the project towns. On the basis of the available and potential
resources the group prepared Financial Performnance Improvement Plans (FPIPs) for the
project towns. The respective FPIPs formed the basis upon which the individual town
investment size was made.
A significant element of the FPIP was the Valuation and Rating Component. During the
course of the project, significant advances were made. Revenue from property rate in Dar
es Salaam increased from Tshs 60 million in 1995 to Tsh 559 million in 1996. In the
remaining eight project towns, assessed properties increased from 53,000 to 73,000 with
corresponding increase in annual revenue from Tshs 145 million to Tsh 427 million in
1996.
In terms of Financial Planning and Control, the group prepared a Local Authorities
Accounting Manual (LAAM) which formed the basis for the installation of new
Accounting and Revenue Systems in the towns. They also reviewed and updated the
existing Urban Councils Financial Memorandum which is to be used along with the new
Local Authorities Accounting Manual.
4.4.1 Management Improvement Plans (MIPs)
At the town level, each authority has prepared a Management Improvement Plan. The
MlPs have been prepared with the aim of bringing systematic improvement of the
councils performance in termns of general management, financial management and
technical areas. Through the MIPS, the respective project towns performance
improvements will be annually monitored and assessed, the results of which will
determine the council's ability to sustain the investments.
4.5 Technical Working Group (TWG)
4.5.1 General
Two main studies were undertaken commencing February 1992. The first is TWG 1
comprising (i) survey and diagnostic analysis (SDA) of the existing physical
infrastructure; (ii) preparation of a strategic integrated infrastructure development
programme (SIIDP) covering a ten year period.
The second set of studies, TWG 2, covered preparation of detailed designs for activities
identified under TWG 1, in the following areas: Roads and Drainage, Water Supply and
Sewerage, Sanitation and Solid Wastes Management and Depot improvement.
23



4.5.2 Outline of TWG 1
Outputs from the SDA study gave information on:
(a)   Location and physical characteristics, population, socio-economic conditions,
relevant studies and projects;
(b)   Land use pattern; involving baseline data, major land development constraints and
general development trends;
(c)   Roads and traffic; involving existing network, existing operation and
maintenance, summary of deficiencies, traffic volumes, traffic flow conditions and traffic
management.
(d)   Storm water drainage; involving existing facilities, existing operation and
maintenance, summary of deficiencies
(e)   Water supply; involving current supply and demand, existing operation and
maintenance and summary of deficiencies
(f)   Sanitation and industrial waste water; involving existing facilities, current
operating and maintenance, summary of deficiencies.
(g)   Solid waste; involving existing system, summary of main deficiencies.
(h)   Municipal services;
(i)   Environmental status in each of the towns.
Outputs from the SIIDP gave information on:
(a) land use concepts;
(b) strategic plan comprising needs for basic improvements, options for development,
options for implementation stages;
(c) proposed investment plan (1994 - 2002) involving financial basis, physical
infrastructure, co-ordination of infrastructure services, and summary of investment cots.
4.5.3 Outline of TWG 2
Detailed designs for investment identified under TWG 1 were undertaken in two groups
by separate consultants, M/s COWICONSULT and HOWARD HUMPHREYS AND
PARTNERS. The Client experienced major delays with the latter consultant and the
assignment was still uncompleted at the time the Credit came to a close.
4.5.4 Supervision of TWG 1 & 2 Studies
To review outputs from the studies and make comments on the technical quality and
feasibility of proposals including designs, the government appointed a technical
committee made up of Office of the Prime Minister; Ministry of Works; Ministry of
Water, the Planning Commission; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Lands, Housing &
Urban Development; Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism; the University of Dar
es Salaam; Project Towns and the Project Management Unit. The work of the committee
has been invaluable to the PMU in managing these consultancy contracts.
24



4.5.5 Community Infrastructure Project (CIP)
The credit also financed various activities leading to the formulation of a community
infrastructure project for selected areas in Dar es Salaam. This is a "demand-driven"
community infrastructure upgrading program targeted at two selected infrastructure
deficient settlements, building upon the lessons of the pilot project carried out in one
settlement of the city (Hanna Nassif, under the UNDP /HABITAT supported Sustainable
Dar Project (DSP).
4.5.6 Environmental Impact Assessment
Although most of the recommended investments involve the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure, conditions in the five eastern towns necessitated the identification of new
sites for disposal of solid wastes. A team of Consultants drawn from various agencies of
Government were commissioned to undertaken a full environmental impact assessment of
the identified sites. Most of the recommended mitigation measures were incorporated in
the final designs of TWG 2 (eastern towns).
5.0 PROJECT COST/ ACTUAL EXPENDITURE
The project was estimated to cost US $ 17.0 million financed as follows: IDA 11.20 mil.,
NORAD 5.00 mil., and GoT 0.80 million. Actual expenditure amounted to US $ 17.45
million, contributed as follows: IDA 10.95 mil., NORAD 5.90 mil., and GoT 0.60
million. At the time of closing the IDA portion of the credit, an amount of approximately
US $1.33 million remained undisbursed, and was therefore canceled. During the course
of the project, the NORAD extended the original facility, to cover the strengthening of
the Survey and Mapping Division of the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlements
Development.
6.0 BANK PERFORMANCE
It was observed that the variable nature of the composition of Bank Supervision Mission
staff, particularly the leadership, affected continuity in the overall project progress
review. In particular, there were constant changes, to previously agreed courses of action.
It was noted that lack of clarity and understanding, by some mission members on the
conceptual framework of the project in general, and TORs in particular, caused
misunderstanding between the Bank and the Government.
A huge supervision input was required because (i) the credit was the first of its kind in the
sector; (ii) the project was over ambitious in its scope; (iii) the spread of the project made
communication with all parties difficult; and (iv) the level of expertise in the urban local
councils was low.
25



However, Government officials and PMU recognized the value of a disciplined
framework of regular progress reviews, accompanied by short-term action plan and task
lists. On a number of occasions, however, the Bank staff seemed to disregard the large
amount of work put in by Government officials, blaming them for inaction on the part of
local council officers in project towns. There was lack of respect in the Bank's approach
in this regard.
During the short mission periods, it was often not possible for all relevant government
staff to be involved, attempts were made to address too many issues simultaneously
giving rise to communication problems. The apparent understandings contained in
lengthy and linguistically complex mission Aide Memoires were not fully comprehended
by all involved.
From discussions with Bank staff, it was obvious that they had a very heavy workload,
and traveling through different African countries on one circuit made things even more
demanding. It is likely frustrations from one project were carried on to another project,
not to mention the harsh traveling conditions. A means of spreading missions more
evenly should be considered and, if possible, have competent staff in the Resident
Mission follow up on most of issues outlined in Aide Memoires.
Government officials had to put in considerable effort over changes in scope of work, and
had a hard time convincing urban local council officials, to re- prioritize civil works
identified under the engineering studies. Perhaps proposed budgets for future projects
could be defined with more certainty.
The Government wishes to commend the valuable contribution by the Bank in terms of
advice and guidance provided during project implementation.
7.0 BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
Being the first sector program of its kind for the country, implementation was both
complex and demanding, and required co-ordination of inputs from several key players
including central ministries, relevant institutions and the urban authorities.
Despite the complexity, the objectives of the project were satisfactorily achieved. The
Steering Committee which was made up of Principal Secretaries from relevant ministries
closely managed the project. A Technical Advisory Committee made up of senior
technical experts from key ministries, institutions and project towns effectively advised
the Steering Committee on the development of the project. However, where there is
success shortfalls are inevitable. On the part of IWG work, particularly in terms of
institutional strengthening aspects, the study outputs have not been quite elaborate and
specific to assist the government to take timely necessary action. For example, the
restructuring of the municipalities as well as the central government/local authorities
relationships have not been cohesively and adequately addressed. The government felt
26



this shortcoming is associated with the design of the Terms of Reference for the studies
which were by and large broad and non specific in many areas. The other constraint
faced by the project during the last phase of the implementation was lack of counterpart
funds in meeting contractual obligations on the part of government.
8.0 LESSONS LEARNED
8.1  The project was over-amnbitious in terms of sectoral and geographical coverage.
This has been demonstrated by:
(i) the nature of output from some consultants in the technical working group -
Consultants by nature tend to specialize in one discipline or the other. And to require one
consultant to undertake tasks defined under the TOR for the TWG 2 is asking too much.
Moreover, clear and objective TOR does not only result in appropriate recommendations,
but also enhances timely completion and effective monitoring of studies;
(ii) the wide gap between cost of identified investments and actual investments donors
were able to finance - considering the deprivation in the project towns, an attempt to fix
all deficiencies in nine or eight towns under one project is ambitious indeed;
(iii) the lack of interest shown by other co-financiers - other co-financiers indicated that
they are willing to take a few towns and concentrate in only one sector;
(iv) level of competence achieved by the IWG and FWG in the urban local councils -
most urban local council officials were untrainable, and the wide geographical spread
resulted in a tendency to neglect this critical area needing intervention.
8.2 The issue of ownership addressed through the early involvement of beneficiaries
has been demonstrated fully. Even though a centralized project administration was
adopted, regular consultations with town officials and other beneficiaries has created
considerable awareness and sense of ownership among the targeted population, to the
extent that, delays in seeing physical works start, in the towns, have become an issue of
great concern.
8.3 There has been considerable time lapse between preparation of the TWG2 designs
and the proposed date for implementation of follow up project. This would require
detailed assessment of proposals prior to Tender, at an extra cost.
8.4 Opinion of current experts working in the urban local councils suggest that it was
ambitious to achieve sound financial and institutional competence under one project;
perhaps the traditional approach of a small credit to approach the problem in one town;
with the possibility of successes being replicated in other towns could have been more
feasible.
27



8.5  Counterpart fund availability, particularly in the latter stages of the project gives a
clear warning for planning of future projects.
8.6  Procurement of appropriate expertise is a key determinant to the success of project
implementation.
9.0 CONCLUSION
It is evident from the foregoing that the project required more capacity than was readily
available for its implementation. The extensive investment in Technical Assistance, at the
initial stages, were not fully effective, because roles of consultants were not properly
defined and outputs were not monitored against agreed plans. This gives an indication
that future projects should be formulated to be modest in scope, and implementation
requirements clearly determined prior to inception. In spite of these shortcomings, the
Project has made a tremendous leap forward in the Tanzania Urban Sector. A clear policy
position has been established, a financial framework has been put in place, and a process
set in motion to improve skills, and reduce waste of human resources.
Interventions in the technical areas have helped to compile data for planning, exposed
deficiencies in infrastructure, identified candidate activities for implementation under
subsequent projects, made an effort to establish a maintenance culture and above all
developed the awareness of Municipal Engineers regarding training requirements and
their obligation to the community they serve.
It is the view of the Government, that the application of the credit has provided good
value for money, and armed with these tools, look forward to better results for subsequent
projects.

OPERATIONAL PLAN
Country Assistance Strategy
1.    The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzania provides the overall
framework for the operational plan to sustain the objectives of USEP. The CAS was
discussed by the Executive Directors in March 1994, and highlights the following
strategic elements governing IDA assistance to Tanzania: (a) poverty alleviation through
policy reform and economic growth; (b) targeted interventions to improve urban services
for the poor; and (c) upgrading and expansion of basic infrastructure and urban services.
Also the strategy includes three main themes for the for financial support of investment
projects: capacity building and improved public sector management; private sector
development; and environmentally sustainable investments.
The Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project (USRP)
1.    The policy, institutional development and design work under USEP have led to
the development of the Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project. (USRP) The objective of
USEP was to create an effective institutional and financial framework for urban sector
investment and prepare the related detailed engineering work. The key concepts in the
design of the program are: (a) the promotion of self sufficiency in urban local
governments; and (b) the development of a program of infrastructure rehabilitation and
expansion that is consistent with the financial capacities of urban councils and focused on
meeting the needs of the manufacturing sector and low-income sections of the population.
Based on the work completed under USEP, the Government of Tanzania, with the
assistance of the IDA, prepared USRP, which the Bank's Board of Directors approved
on.May 23, 1996. The overall objectives of this project are the promotion of sustainable
economic development and the alleviation of poverty through a program consisting of:
high priority infrastructure rehabilitation; improved local government management and
financing; and the involvement of the private sector and the local community in urban
sector operations and maintenance.
2.    USRP consists of four components covering eight project towns, plus Dodoma
and Dar es Salaam. These components consist of: (a) the rehabilitation and selected
expansion of infrastructure services in eight project towns and Dodoma; (b) community
based upgrading of infrastructure and rehabilitation of water supply of Dar es Salaam; (c)
institutional strengthening consisting of technical assistance training and equipment for
improving the organizational and financial management capacity in the municipal
councils of urban water and sewerage departments of the eight project towns, Dar es

Salaam and Dodoma; and (d) the preparation of future projects in the urban sector. The
total cost of the project is US$ 141.3 million equivalent, with the following financing
plan: IDA, US$ 105 million equivalent; the governments of Germany, Ireland and the
Netherlands, US$ 21.7 million equivalent; and the Government of Tanzania, US$ 14.6
million equivalent.
