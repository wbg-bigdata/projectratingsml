A. 
Program Purpose and Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
Pastoral 
Community 
Development 
Program 
seeks 
to 
sustainably 
improve 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
pastoralists 
living 
in 
the 
arid 
and semi-arid 
Ethiopian 
lowlands. 
A 
"livelihood" 
is 
a 
people-centered 
concept 
comprising 
four 
key 
elements 
related 
to 
the 
well-being 
of 
individuals 
and 
families 
-- 
(i) 
growth 
and stability 
of 
income; 
(ii) 
access 
to social 
and 
public 
services, 
(iii) 
the 
social relations, institutions, 
and 
natural 
environment that 
facilitate 
or 
constrain 
standards 
of 
living; 
and 
(iv) 
reduction 
of 
vulnerability 
to 
disaster. 
Over a fifteen-year period, 
the 
Program's 
interventions 
are 
designed 
to 
empower communities and 
district 
(weredu) 
and 
Regional 
governments 
to 
better 
manage 
local 
development 
in 
pastoral 
areas, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
increasing, 
stabilizing, 
and 
diversifying 
incomes, 
improving 
infrastructure, 
and 
increasing 
access 
to 
public 
services. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
through a community-based 
development 
planning 
process 
linked 
to 
a 
community 
investment 
fund 
which 
flows 
through 
local 
government. 
The 
Program 
will 
also support 
a 
participatory 
disaster management 
program 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
pastoral communities 
to 
drought 
and 
other 
natural 
threats 
to 
livelihoods. 
These 
efforts 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
policy 
reform, 
investment 
in 
health, education, 
and 
veterinary 
services, 
and 
applied 
research 
into 
dryland 
agriculture 
and 
natural 
resource management. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
central 
role 
that 
animal 
production 
plays 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
play 
in 
pastoral 
life, 
the 
PCDP 
would 
not 
place exclusive 
emphasis 
on 
increasing 
incomes and 
productivity 
from 
livestock. 
Rather, 
the 
Program 
would 
also 
identify 
and develop alternative livelihoods, 
including 
sedentary 
agriculture 
and 
non-farm 
income 
generation, 
with 
a 
view 
to better 
integration 
of 
pastoral communities 
into 
the 
national 
economy. 
The 
Program 
will 
be 
multi-phased, 
using 
the 
Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
(APL) 
instrument. 
Early 
in 
the 
Program, emphasis 
will 
be 
placed 
on 
capacity-building 
and 
policy 
development. 
Models 
of 
participatory 
development 
and 
local level 
planning 
will 
be 
tested 
over 
the 
first 
two 
to 
three 
years, 
where communities 
and 
local 
governments 
work 
together, supported 
by 
the 
Program-financed staff. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
Program 
will 
support 
further 
definition 
of 
the pastoral development 
strategy, 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
communities and 
other stakeholders. 
Increasingly 
over 
time, 
depending 
on 
the 
success 
of 
earlier 
efforts, 
greater 
responsibility 
for 
implementation 
will 
shift 
from 
Program-financed 
staff 
to 
Regional 
and 
local 
governments. 
In 
addition, the 
geographic 
scale 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
expand 
to 
cover 
additional 
areas. 
Ultimately, 
the 
Program 
is 
intended 
to 
support 
widespread ownership 
of 
local 
development 
by 
Regional 
States, 
weredus, 
and communities, enabling 
them 
to 
lead 
the 
development 
work 
in 
close partnership. 
2. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the Pastoral 
Community 
Development 
Project 
(PCDP), 
which 
is 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Program 
(and 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
Project Appraisal 
Document) 
is, 
for 
a 
selected 
set 
of 
weredus, 
to 
provide capacity-building and 
establish 
effective 
models 
of 
public 
service 
delivery, 
investment, 
and 
disaster 
management 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
that 
address 
communities' 
priority 
needs 
and 
reduce 
their vulnerability. 
If 
achievement 
of 
this 
development 
objective 
is 
likely 
(according 
to 
performance 
triggers), 
a 
new 
phase 
will 
be 
prepared. 
Subsequent phases 
will 
expand 
the 
program 
geographically 
to 
a larger 
set 
of 
weredas 
(see 
below) 
to 
provide 
access 
of 
all 
pastoral communities 
to 
the 
program's 
benefits, 
and 
deepen 
the 
Program's effectiveness 
with 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms.

Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
.... 
of 
Program 
purpose: 
Attainment 
in 
sustainable 
livelihoods 
may 
be 
measured 
through 
(i) 
increases 
in 
the level, 
diversity, 
and 
stability 
of 
household 
income 
and 
assets 
from 
both 
agricultural 
and 
non-agricultural 
sources; 
(ii) 
the 
productivity 
of 
crops and 
livestock; 
(iii) 
access 
and 
use 
of 
health 
and 
education 
services; 
(iv) 
a 
set 
of 
indicators related 
to 
the 
condition, 
diversity 
and 
use 
of 
the 
natural 
resource 
base; 
(v) 
the 
degree 
to 
which

initiatives. 
.... 
of 
Project 
development 
objective: 
In 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Program, 
performance 
indicators 
relate 
primarily 
to institutional 
development. 
The 
Project 
will 
be 
successful 
if, 
in 
targetted communities 
and 
weredas, 
(i) 
at least 
80 
percent 
of 
funds 
allocated 
to 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
were 
used 
for 
approved 
community 
micro-projects 
and 
inter-community 
sub-projects; 
(ii) 
at 
least 
80 
percent 
of 
funds 
allocated 
to 
the 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and Contingency 
Fund 
were 
used 
for 
approved 
sub-projects; 
(iii) 
at 
least 
75 
percent 
of 
community 
subprojects 
requiring 
government support 
receive 
it 
in 
a 
timely 
and 
adequate 
fashion, 
as 
measured 
by 
beneficiary 
assessments; 
and 
(iv) 
at 
least 75 
percent 
of 
results 
of 
participatory 
M&E 
meetings 
are 
used 
in 
decision-making 
for 
community 
investments, 
pastoral 
risk 
management plans, 
and 
other 
Project 
activities, 
as 
measured 
by 
M&E 
reports. 
Higher 
order indicators, 
such 
as 
poverty 
impact 
of 
micro-projects 
and 
contingency 
plans, 
will 
also 
be 
measured. 
B. 
Strategic 
Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
25591-ET 
The 
current 
CAS 
is 
based 
on 
the 
recent 
PRSP. 
It 
outlines 
several 
structural 
features 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
economy 
that constrain development: 
(i) 
lack 
of 
employment 
opportunities 
in 
agriculture 
and 
the 
modem 
economy; 
(ii) 
limited 
human 
capital; 
(iii) 
vulnerability to 
disaster, 
particularly 
drought; 
and 
(iv) 
weak 
capacity 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
limited 
involvement 
of 
communities 
in 
the 
decisions 
that 
determine 
their 
own 
development. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
address 
each 
of 
these 
constraints 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
by 
(a) 
promoting 
income-generating 
activities 
in 
livestock, agriculture, and 
non-farm productive 
sectors, 
(b) 
investing 
in 
health 
and 
education 
where 
it 
is 
a 
priority 
for 
communities, 
(c) 
developing early warning 
systems, 
drought 
preparedness 
plans, 
and 
mitigation 
strategies; 
and 
(d) 
supporting 
weredas 
in 
meeting 
the 
needs 
of 
their

This 
section 
summarizes 
portions 
of 
this 
document. 
Main 
Sector Issues 
In 
Ethiopia, 
pastoralism 
is 
extensively practiced 
in 
the 
Somali and 
Afar 
national 
Regional 
states 
(Regions), 
in 
the 
Borana 
zone 
of 
the 
Oromia 
national Regional 
state, 
and 
in 
the 
South 
Om0 
zone 
of 
the 
Southern 
Nations, 
Nationalities 
and 
Peoples 
(SNNPR) 
national 
Regional 
state. 
Pastoralists 
are 
also 
found 
in 
areas 
of 
Tigray, 
Benshangule 
and Gambella 
Regions. These 
lowlands 
encompass 
almost 
seven 
million 
people, 
in 
excess 
of 
500,000 
h’(6 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
area 
of 
Ethiopia) 
and over eleven 
million 
animals. 
People 
living 
in 
the 
lowland 
areas 
of 
Ethiopia 
comprise 
both 
the 
comparatively wealthy 
who 
hold 
-4- 
Page  11
substantial 
assets 
in 
the 
form 
of 
livestock, a larger 
number 
of 
poor 
people 
who 
have 
small 
herds 
and 
flocks, and 
those who, 
to 
a 
greater 
or 
lesser 
extent, 
depend 
upon 
cropping 
or 
sale 
of 
their 
labour 
("agropastoralists"). 
Although 
the 
climatic 
conditions 
and hardships 
are 
similar 
for 
most pastoral 
areas, 
the people 
inhabiting 
these 
areas 
differ 
in 
their 
social 
structure, 
herd 
composition, 
coping 
strategies and 
in 
the 
extent 
of 
their 
integration 
in 
the 
market 
economy. 
The 
following 
sector 
issues 
dominate: 
(a) 
Good 
governance 
and 
community 
participation 
are 
preconditions 
for 
sustainable development 
anywhere, 
and pastoral 
areas 
are 
no 
exception. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
National 
Regional 
States 
with 
their 
underlying 
wereda 
(district) 
and 
local 
kebele 
(sub-district) 
administrations 
has 
improved 
the 
opportunity 
for 
more participatory 
development. However, 
civil 
society, 
in 
its 
broader 
sense 
beyond clan 
loyalties, 
is 
embryonic 
in 
lowland 
Ethiopia. 
The 
governance 
process, 
despite 
its 
devolution, lacks 
transparency, 
suffers 
from 
heavily 
bureaucratic 
administrative 
procedures, 
is 
dominated 
by 
local 
elites 
where women's 
rights 
are 
poorly 
represented, 
and 
lacks 
an 
enabling 
environment 
for 
private 
investment; 
(b) 
Periodic 
drought 
has 
always 
been 
central 
challenge 
to 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
people 
living 
in 
Ethiopia's 
lowland 
pastoral 
production 
systems. 
However, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
increasing 
human and 
livestock 
population 
pressure 
and an 
apparent 
increasing frequency 
of 
drought, 
the 
capacity 
to 
cope 
with 
drought 
has 
declined 
to 
the 
point 
where 
there 
is 
a 
growing 
threat 
to 
the 
survival 
of 
viable 
pastoral 
production 
systems. 
Government 
has 
established 
a 
disaster 
prevention 
and 
preparedness 
system 
through 
its 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Prevention Commission 
(DPPC) and 
Regional 
Bureaus (DPPBs). 
However, 
its 
primary 
focus 
is 
on 
upland 
agricultural 
systems, 
with 
lowland 
ahnistration 
lacking 
both 
the 
resources 
and 
knowledge 
to 
effectively 
protect 
pastoralist 
livelihoods; 
(c) 
Ethiopia 
as 
evidenced 
by 
soil 
loss, 
encroachment 
of 
bush, 
reduced 
bio-diversity, 
and deforestation 
close 
to 
urban 
and 
refugee concentrations. 
Traditional 
range 
management 
systems, 
based 
on 
indigenous 
knowledge, 
mobility, reciprocity 
agreements, 
fluid 
boundaries 
and 
traditional 
law 
are 
facing 
new 
pressures, 
which 
require 
different 
institutions, 
technologies 
and 
systems 
for 
their 
redress; 
Rangeland 
degradation, 
driven 
by 
rising 
human and 
livestock 
populations, 
is 
increasing 
in 
(d) 
pastoralists, whose 
customary 
grazing 
lands 
extend 
into 
Somalia, 
Kenya, 
Sudan 
and Eritrea, 
have 
traditionally 
engaged 
in 
cross-border 
livestock 
trade, 
mostly 
directed 
at 
Kenyan 
and 
Gulf 
markets. Recent 
restrictions 
to 
both 
these 
markets, 
primarily 
due 
to 
sanitary 
and 
phytosanitary 
concerns, caused 
prices 
to 
plummet, 
and 
have 
greatly 
curbed, 
but 
not 
eliminated 
trade 
to 
the 
Gulf 
states. 
Key 
constraints 
are 
(i) 
weak 
sanitary 
control 
systems, 
resulting 
in 
import 
bans 
from 
several countries; 
(ii) 
deficient 
market 
and 
transport 
infrastructure, 
leading 
to 
high 
marketing 
costs 
and 
widespread 
contraband; 
(iii) 
cumbersome 
documentation 
needs, 
which 
are 
in 
particular significant 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a perishable products 
such 
as 
meat; 
and (iv) insufficient 
banking 
systems. 
In 
the 
hides 
and 
skins 
sub-sector, 
quality 
is 
the 
key 
constraint, 
caused 
by 
disease, 
flaying, 
and processing problems. 
Livestock 
marketing 
continues 
to 
constrain 
the 
economic 
potential 
of 
the lowlands. 
Ethiopian 
(e) 
on 
disease 
incidence and 
risk, 
essential 
to 
high 
value export 
markets, 
is 
not 
systematically 
available. 
Drug 
supply, 
now 
privatized, 
has 
improved 
in 
recent 
years. 
However, 
the 
problem 
of 
drug 
quality, 
including 
dilution 
and 
unregistered 
imports 
remains. 
Government 
recognizes 
these 
issues 
and 
is 
presently 
investing 
in 
veterinary 
laboratories, 
quarantine 
centers 
and 
border 
control points 
in 
the 
lowland 
areas. 
It 
is 
also 
progressively 
privatizing 
veterinary 
services 
and 
has 
integrated 
the 
use 
of 
Community 
Animal 
Health 
Workers 
(CAHWs) 
into 
the 
national animal health 
delivery 
system. 
These 
steps 
provide 
a 
sound 
platform 
for 
investment 
in 
a 
comprehensive 
animal health 
service 
for 
pastoral communities; 
Animal 
health 
services 
rarely 
extend 
beyond 
lowland 
wereda 
town 
boundaries 
and

pastoral 
areas 
and 
is 
about 
to 
commence 
a training-of-trainers 
program 
for 
pastoral 
region 
health 
specialists. 
Further 
investment 
in 
capacity 
building 
and 
in 
community-based pastoral 
health 
and 
posts 
is 
required 
to 
institutionalize 
these 
services. 
HIV/AIDS 
is 
a 
major 
health 
concern 
in 
Ethiopia 
since 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
seriously 
affected 
countries 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
2001 
estimate 
of 
HIV 
prevalence 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
6.6 
percent. 
Urban 
HIV 
prevalence 
rates 
is 
13.7, 
while 
that 
of 
rural 
is 
about 3.7 percent. 
The 
highest 
prevalence 
of 
HIV 
is 
in 
the 
group 
15 
to 
24 
years 
of 
age. 
Given 
that 
this 
age 
group 
encompasses 
the 
most economically 
productive 
segment 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
epidemic 
is 
negatively 
impacting 
labour 
productivity. 
Unfortunately, 
little 
is 
known 
outside 
of 
anecdotal evidence 
on 
the 
degree 
of 
HIV 
infection 
in 
pastoral 
populations; 
Human 
health 
services 
are 
undergoing a 
similar 
transition. Government 
has 
developed 
curricula 
(g) 
Education 
services 
reach 
less 
than 
one-fifth 
of 
pastoralists, 
severely 
limiting 
opportunities 
for 
livelihood 
diversification. 
Government 
has 
recognized 
this 
constraint and 
is 
about 
to 
launch 
a pastoralist 
education 
initiative 
focused 
on 
mobile 
primary 
education 
services. 
The 
Somali Region 
has, 
with 
NGO 
support, 
already developed and 
legislated 
such 
a 
curriculum, 
which 
it 
is 
implementing 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis. 
The need 
for 
further 
investment 
in 
teacher 
training 
facilities 
and capacity 
and community 
schools 
is 
indicated. 
In 
the 
longer 
term, 
higher 
education 
services 
will 
also 
be required 
close 
to 
pastoral 
communities; 
(h) 
Agricultural 
advisory 
services 
are 
virtually 
non-existent 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
and 
market 
information 
services 
are 
inadequate. 
Government's 
new 
thrust 
to 
decentralize 
to 
wereda 
levels 
for political 
and 
economic 
decision-making 
will 
see 
a 
progressive increase 
in 
staffing 
at 
this 
level. 
However, 
serious 
skill 
and technology 
gaps 
will 
remain, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
support 
for 
agro-pastoralism. Government 
is 
investing 
in 
lowland 
research centers 
to 
help 
redress 
this 
balance, 
yet 
further 
investment 
in 
staff 
capacity, 
socio-economic analysis 
and 
participatory applied 
research 
and extension 
is 
required before 
any 
significant improvement 
in 
lowland 
agriculture 
can 
be 
realized; 
(i) 
rangelands 
are 
difficult to 
justify 
according 
to 
normal 
assessments 
of 
economic 
viability, often 
the 
most 
tangible 
economic 
and social 
benefit 
these 
areas 
have 
experienced 
has 
resulted 
from 
road 
development. 
Stock routes 
and 
watering points 
for 
livestock off-take 
are 
either nonexistent 
or 
poorly 
planned 
with 
resultant 
weak 
ownership and 
maintenance. 
Voice 
communication 
systems 
are 
equally 
weak, 
isolating 
pastoralists, traders 
and 
the 
supporting government 
agencies 
from 
the 
national 
mainstream. 
Rural 
infrastructure 
in 
Ethiopia's pastoral 
areas 
is 
notoriously 
inadequate.

Land

issues: 
Ethiopia 
has 
seen 
a 
steady increase 
in 
its 
farming population 
and 
area 
under 
cultivation, 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
the 
remaining 
pastoral communities, 
who 
are 
losing 
their 
dry 
season 
grazing 
areas. 
Customary 
law 
and 
natural 
resource management 
practices 
are 
giving 
way to 
population 
pressure 
and 
landlessness. 
Conflicts 
between farmers and pastoralists 
are 
common 
and 
widespread, and 
claim 
many 
lives. 
Land 
use 
security 
also 
constitutes a 
major 
factor 
for 
achieving 
increased 
investment 
and 
productivity, 
while providing 
relief 
for, 
among 
other 
things, 
land 
degradation and 
poor 
management 
of 
water 
resources.

e) 
agriculture 
and 
some 
irrigated 
agriculture 
has 
produced increasing 
numbers 
of 
“agropastoralists”. 
While 
rainfed farming 
is 
equally 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
drought 
as 
is 
livestock, 
it 
provides 
some 
diversity 
of 
income 
sources 
and 
synergies 
with 
livestock 
systems. 
Many 
in 
Government 
believe 
in 
accelerating 
this 
trend 
by 
promoting 
sedentary 
livelihoods 
for 
pastoralists. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
promote crop 
production 
and 
non-farm 
sources 
of 
income 
in 
response 
to 
demands 
from 
communities.

Government Strategy 
The 
strategy 
for 
development 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
is 
contained 
in 
several documents, 
including 
the 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP), 
the 
Rural 
Development 
Strategy, 
and 
the 
Food 
Security 
Strategy. 
Elements 
of 
these 
documents have 
been 
summarized, 
for 
the purposes 
of 
supporting 
the 
PCDP, 
in 
the 
Government’s 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy (MOFA, 
2003), 
which 
appears 
in 
Annex 
12 
of 
this 
document. 
The 
PRSP 
states 
that 
“the 
problem 
of 
food 
security and 
apcultural 
growth 
in 
the 
nomadic 
areas 
is 
being 
conceived 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
pastoral economy 
in 
its 
entirety.’’ 
The 
PCDP 
corresponds 
with 
the 
central 
features 
of 
the 
Government’s 
rural 
development 
strategy 
for 
pastoral 
areas 
by 
promoting 
an 
integrated 
and 
holistic 
approach 
that 
focuses 
on 
people, 
not 
merely 
their 
animals 
or 
the 
rangeland 
which 
they 
inhabit. 
The 
Project 
will 
also 
pursue 
several 
of 
the 
recommendations 
proposed 
in 
the 
Food 
Security 
Strategy, such 
as 
those 
pertaining to 
animal 
health, 
marketing, water 
supply, 
agropastoralism, 
and early 
warning 
systems. 
Decentralization 
is 
now 
a 
well 
established 
policy 
of 
the 
Government, 
which 
has 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
the 
highlands. 
Such progress, however, 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
felt 
in 
the 
lowlands, 
where 
this 
Project 
will 
operate. 
To 
promote 
and 
accelerate 
this 
process, 
the Federal Government 
is 
committed 
to 
ensuring 
that 
this 
Project 
would 
rest 
firmly 
with 
the 
Regions, 
which 
would 
receive 
substantial 
capacity-building 
efforts 
from 
the 
Project. 
The 
PCDP 
would 
also support 
the 
PRSP emphasis 
on 
community 
empowerment, 
by 
enabling communities 
to 
identify 
their 
own 
priorities, 
propose 
modest development 
plans, 
and 
gain 
access 
to 
the 
financial 
resources 
and 
training 
necessary 
for 
their 
implementation. 
Government 
also proposes 
to 
deconcentrate 
service 
delivery 
and 
channel 
more 
resources 
directly to 
wereda 
administrations 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
chain 
of 
technical 
and 
regulatory authority 
from 
national 
to 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
level. 
These 
reforms 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
for 
building 
pastoral 
advocacy 
at 
the 
national 
level, 
strengthening 
technical 
service 
delivery, and 
improving 
community participation 
in 
resource 
allocations 
at 
the 
wereda 
level. 
Land 
use 
policy 
is 
a 
politically-charged 
issue 
in 
Ethiopia. 
The 
fundamental 
principle 
behind 
land 
ownership 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
provided 
in 
the Constitution, 
which 
stipulates 
that 
land 
is 
owned 
by 
the 
State 
with 
the 
underlying 
assumption that 
it 
is 
to 
be 
administered 
by 
the Regions 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
local 
communities. 
While 
power to 
regulate 
on 
land 
allocation, 
management, 
and 
tenure 
has 
been 
devolved 
the Regions, 
those 
with 
pastoral 
populations 
have 
not 
passed 
relevant laws. 
Currently 
the 
1997 
proclamation 
of 
the 
Federal 
Rural 
Land 
Administration 
provides 
that “demarcation 
of 
land 
for 
house 
building, 
grazing, forests, 
social 
services and such other 
communal 
use, 
shall be carried out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
particular conditions 
of 
the 
locality 
and 
through communal participation.“ 
There 
appears 
to 
be 
growing 
consensus 
within 
Government 
with 
respect 
to 
recommending communitylclan 
certification 
of 
rural 
land 
to 
ensure 
access, 
subject 
to 
concurrence 
from 
the 
Regional 
governments. 
0 
mandate 
for 
emerging 
Regions, 
openly 
promotes 
settlement 
of 
pastoralists, 
while 
recognizing 
that 
this 
Settlement 
of 
pastoralists 
is 
another 
sensitive 
issue. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs, 
which 
has 
a 
-7- 
Page  14
must 
be 
voluntary 
and 
implemented 
over 
a 
long 
time 
period. 
The 
PRSP acknowledges 
the 
right 
of 
pastoral 
groups 
not 
to 
be 
coerced 
into 
any 
form 
of 
resettlement, 
just 
as 
the 
1994 
Constitution 
provides 
for 
pastoralists 
“not 
to 
be 
displaced 
without 
their 
wish”. 
Government 
has 
a 
policy 
of 
budget 
offsetting, 
whereby 
Project 
resources 
for 
particular 
Regions entail 
a 
corresponding 
reduction 
in 
the 
block 
grant 
allocation 
from 
the Federal 
budget. 
However, 
exceptions 
to 
this 
policy 
are 
made 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
food 
security 
andor 
capacity-building 
interventions. 
IDA 
has 
received 
notification 
(on 
March 
1 
1,2003) 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs 
that 
the 
PCDP 
funds 
would 
not 
substitute 
for 
block 
grants 
on 
the 
grounds that 
the 
the 
Project 
constitutes 
food 
security 
support. 
Government 
has 
recently revised 
its 
institutional 
framework 
for 
rural 
development 
in 
general and 
pastoral development 
in 
particular. 
This 
has 
involved 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
Minister 
of 
Rural 
Development, 
who 
is 
also 
the 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister. 
The 
Minister 
has 
overarching responsibility 
for 
agricultural 
and 
rural 
development. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs (MoFA) 
has 
been 
delegated 
to 
address 
the 
governance 
and 
administrative 
needs 
of 
“emerging 
regions” 
which 
comprise, 
among 
others, 
the larger pastoral 
areas 
of 
Afar 
and Somali 
Regions. 
MoFA 
also 
chairs 
a 
new 
“Federal 
Interministerial 
Board” 
(FIB) 
which 
has 
a mandate 
that includes 
lowland 
development. Because 
of 
this 
mandate, and 
the 
multi-sectoral 
nature 
of 
the PCDP, 
this 
ministry 
will 
provide 
the 
high-level institutional 
support 
to 
the 
PCDP 
as 
required. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
Project 
will 
address 
all 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
sector issues. 
The 
proposed 
Project 
will 
thus 
include 
three components 
to: 
achieve 
sustainable livelihoods 
through 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
investments 
owned 
and 
managed 
by 
communities and 
local 
governments. 
Activities 
underpinning 
this 
outcome 
will 
include 
capacity 
building 
in 
community 
leadership; 
participatory 
development 
to 
include women and 
youth; 
local 
development 
planning; 
resources 
to 
finance 
such 
plans; 
the 
development 
of 
community-based 
health, education, 
agricultural 
production, and veterinary 
services; 
and 
participatory 
research and 
technology 
transfer programs. 
The 
Project 
could 
support 
small 
business 
development 
through 
training 
and 
access 
to 
credit 
where 
available. 
This 
component 
will 
also 
improve 
public 
service 
delivery 
by 
strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
weredas 
and 
Regions 
to 
play 
a transparent 
and 
accountable 
role 
in 
the 
development 
of 
their 
constituent communities. 
reduce 
risk 
through 
improved 
knowledge 
of 
pastoralist 
economies, the 
natural 
resource 
base 
and 
traditional coping 
mechanisms; 
early warning 
systems 
designed 
to 
protect 
livelihoods 
as 
well 
as 
lives; 
community-based 
disaster preparedness 
and 
contingency planning; 
improved 
rural 
infrastructure 
to 
deliver 
services 
and 
diversify 
and 
broaden the 
scope 
of 
economic opportunities, 
and 
limited 
rapid 
response 
in 
the 
event 
of 
disaster. 
strengthen 
policies 
which 
promote 
pastoral 
area 
development covering, 
inter 
alia, 
pastoralists’ 
land 
use 
rights 
and settlement, 
Regional 
trade 
and 
water 
use 
agreements, 
community-based 
health, 
education 
and 
veterinary 
service 
delivery, 
rural 
infrastructure 
policy, 
and 
the 
role 
of 
traditional 
law 
and 
institutions. 
Within 
these 
components, 
and 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRSP 
and 
the 
new 
rural 
development 
strategy, 
Government and the 
Project preparation 
team 
have made several 
strategic 
choices 
with 
respect 
to 
addressing constraints 
and 
opportunities 
in 
pastoral 
areas. 
-8- 
Page  15
The 
development 
approach 
will 
be 
holistic, 
embracing infrastructure, social 
services, 
agriculture 
and 
income diversification, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
traditional livestock 
and rangeland 
dimensions 
of 
previous 
pastoral 
development programs; 
The 
Project 
will 
focus 
on 
community-based 
approaches 
to 
natural 
resource 
management, 
building 
on 
traditional 
law 
and institutions, 
so 
that 
all 
local 
stakeholders 
participate 
in 
and 
benefit 
from 
the 
sustainable 
environmental 
management. 
With 
respect 
to 
land, 
the 
Project 
will 
not 
dwell 
on 
the 
respective 
merits 
of 
public 
versus 
private 
ownership, 
but 
will 
instead 
focus 
on 
ascertaining 
land 
access 
for 
pastoral 
groups 
with 
a 
view 
to 
securing 
their 
livelihoods. 
The 
Project 
will 
provide 
an 
institutional 
base 
for 
discussion 
of 
land 
policy 
in 
pastoralist 
areas, 
and 
at 
the 
more 
local 
level, 
rely 
on 
traditional 
conflict-resolution 
mechanisms 
and 
arrangements that 
will 
allow 
locally-elected 
government 
officers 
to 
serve 
as 
honest 
brokers. 
A 
community-driven 
development 
(CDD) 
approach 
will 
be 
used 
to 
articulate 
local 
priorities 
and 
allocate development 
resources. 
This 
would 
help 
ensure 
local 
ownership 
and 
sustainability 
of 
Project 
interventions. 
As 
well 
as 
the management 
of 
their 
own 
investment 
funds, 
communities 
will 
participate 
directly 
in 
disaster preparedness 
planning 
and 
the 
development 
of 
support 
services 
at 
wereda 
levels; 
Project 
management 
will 
be 
devolved 
to 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
levels 
with 
a central 
Project 
coordination 
unit 
limited 
to 
responsibility 
for policy 
reform, 
pastoral advocacy and 
program 
coordination; 
The 
Project 
will 
support 
a long-term, 
phased approach 
to pastoral 
community 
development 
consistent 
with 
the 
Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
(APL) 
approach 
of 
the 
World 
Bank, 
with 
successive phases 
based 
on 
realizable 
outcomes 
programmed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
experience 
of 
preceding 
phases 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
the 
necessary 
fiscal, 
institutional 
and human 
resources. 
4. 
Program 
description 
and 
performance 
triggers 
for 
subsequent loans: 
Three five-year 
phases 
are 
foreseen 
for 
the 
PCDP. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
APL's flexible 
approach, the 
"horizontal" 
form 
is 
chosen, 
i.e. 
each 
new 
phase 
will 
comprise a 
set 
of 
new 
weredas 
approximately 
every 
four 
years 
or 
so, 
while 
maintaining 
the 
previous 
communities' 
access 
to 
the 
program's 
community 
investment 
fund 
(CIF). 
As 
such, 
two 
phases 
may 
run 
concurrently. 
Grant 
financing 
from 
IDA 
is 
not 
guaranteed 
beyond 
the 
first 
phase. 
If 
performance 
triggers 
described 
below 
are 
not 
met, 
subsequent 
phases 
may not 
take place. 
Aside 
from 
geographic expansion, 
subsequent 
phases are 
expected 
to reflect 
increased emphasis 
on 
fiscal 
management 
by 
weredas. 
Early 
in 
the 
Project, 
community 
investment 
funds 
will 
be 
earmarked 
for 
release 
through a 
process 
that requires 
community 
groups, 
rather than 
the 
local 
governments, 
to 
decide 
on 
how 
the 
funds 
should 
be 
used, 
with 
financial 
and 
administrative 
oversight 
resting largely 
in 
the 
Regional 
Project Coordination 
Units 
(RPCUs). 
Over 
time, 
as 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
governments 
increases, 
they 
will 
be 
able 
to 
assume 
greater 
fiduciary 
responsibility 
including 
auditing 
and 
financial 
oversight. 
Phase 
1: 
Introduction 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
PCDP 
will 
target 
approximately one-third 
of 
pastoral 
weredas 
in 
four 
Regions 
of 
Ethiopia 
(i.e. 
Afar, 
Somali, Oromia, and 
SNNPR). 
Implementation 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
Project-financed 
RPCUs, 
located 
in 
the 
respective pastoral development 
offices. 
The 
basic 
approach 
will 
focus 
on 
-9- 
Page  16
community 
empowerment and demand-driven micro-investments, 
while 
simultaneously 
providing 
support 
for 
local 
governance 
at 
the 
Regional 
and 
weredu 
in 
terms 
of 
capacity-building 
in 
participatory 
planning, 
and 
fiscal 
and 
administrative 
management. 
Mobile 
Support 
Teams, 
who 
will 
be 
contracted 
by 
the 
Project 
to 
provide 
community capacity-building 
and 
facilitation, 
will 
start 
with 
a 
few 
weredus 
and 
expand 
to 
cover 
the 
larger 
target 
area. 
A 
matching 
grant 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
for 
micro-investment 
and 
intercommunity 
sub-projects. 
In 
addition, support 
to 
line 
ministries 
providing 
sectoral 
packages 
tailored to 
pastoralists' 
needs 
will 
be 
phased 
in. 
Technical 
training 
and 
participatory 
research 
will 
complement 
these 
packages. 
The 
Project 
will 
also 
make available 
to 
Regions 
and 
weredus 
funding 
dedicated 
to 
larger 
infrastructure 
investment 
aimed 
at 
reducing 
the 
impact 
of 
disasters, 
particularly 
drought. 
During 
this 
time, 
the 
Project 
will 
continue 
to 
coordinate 
with 
active 
NGOs 
and 
donors, 
thus 
reinforcing 
and 
expanding a 
network 
of 
agencies 
working 
in 
pastoral 
area 
development. 
This 
network 
will 
meet 
on 
a regular 
basis 
in 
a pastoral 
forum 
to 
compare methods 
and 
experience 
and to 
encourage 
harmonization 
of 
approaches. 
A 
participatory 
M&E 
system, 
based 
on 
community 
input, 
will 
also 
be 
tested 
and 
consolidated 
at 
this 
time. 
At 
the 
mid-term 
review, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
evaluate 
participating 
Regional 
and 
local 
governments 
with 
a 
view 
to 
shifting 
increased 
responsibility 
for 
fiscal 
management 
and development planning. 
This 
evaluation 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
following 
criteria: 
(i) 
demonstrated 
ability 
in 
transparent 
and 
effective fiscal 
management 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
resources and 
a 
financial 
management 
system, 
as 
measured 
by 
an 
independent 
reviewer 
approved 
by 
the 
Auditor 
General's 
office; 
(ii) 
dedication 
to 
participatory 
approaches 
to 
guiding 
local 
development, 
as 
indicated 
by 
beneficiary 
assessments; 
and 
(iii) 
existence 
of 
an 
overarching pastoral 
area 
development strategy, 
which 
has 
been 
validated 
at 
Regional 
levels 
with 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
stakeholders. 
Triggers 
for 
moving 
to 
u 
second 
Project 
Moving 
from 
phase 
1 
to 
phase 
2 
will 
depend 
on 
achieving certain 
performance 
triggers 
related 
to 
the 
satisfactory 
implementation 
of 
the 
PCDP's 
activities 
and 
the 
readiness 
of 
the 
Project 
and 
national 
capacity 
to 
expand geographically. 
These 
triggers 
are 
the 
following: 
Beneficiary 
assessments 
indicate 
that 
eighty 
percent 
of 
communities and 
local 
stakeholders 
are 
satisfied 
with 
the 
PCDP 
and 
wish 
it 
to 
continue. 
At 
least one 
half 
of 
communities 
in 
weredus 
targetted 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
have 
received 
capacity-building 
support 
and 
have 
formally 
articulated 
their 
local 
development 
plans; 
At 
least 
two-thirds 
of 
weredus 
have 
submitted 
approved 
disaster preparedness plans; 
At 
least 
one-half 
of 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
has 
disbursed 
for 
micro-projects 
which 
were 
approved 
and 
successhlly 
implemented; 
At 
least 
one-half 
of 
the 
Disaster 
Preparedeness 
and 
Contingency 
Fund 
has 
disbursed 
for 
sub-projects 
which 
were 
approved and successfully 
implemented; 
The 
Pastoral development 
network 
is 
active and operational and 
has 
made substantial progress 
towards 
harmonization 
of 
decentralized development 
approaches; 
Government, 
through 
its 
reforms 
and support 
to 
phase 
1, 
continues 
to 
demonstrate 
strong 
support 
for 
decentralization and community-based development 
in 
pastoral 
areas, 
and 
has 
produced a pastoral 
area 
development strategy 
that 
has 
been 
validated 
at 
the 
Regional 
and 
local 
level 
through 
consultation 
with 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
stakeholders. 
-10- 
Page  17
Phase 
2 
: 
Expansion 
If 
it 
occurs, phase 
2 
will 
build 
on 
successful 
models 
of 
local 
development and 
risk 
management 
tested 
in 
the 
first 
phase. 
Based 
on 
satisfactory 
results 
in 
strategic 
planning and 
fiscal 
management 
by 
the 
Regions, 
this 
phase 
will 
expand 
the 
PCDP 
geographically 
to 
approximately 
two 
thirds 
of 
pastoral 
communities, 
respectively, 
by 
annexing 
new 
wevedas, 
and 
spreading 
to 
Regions 
with 
smaller pastoral populations. 
Such 
expansion 
would 
be 
done 
directly 
through PCDP 
financing, 
but 
also 
in 
partnership 
with 
other 
donors 
who 
use 
a 
similar 
approach. 
Weredas 
involved 
in 
phase 
1 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
Project 
in 
phase 
2, 
and 
thus 
communities 
in 
phase 
1 
who 
have 
satisfactory performance 
will 
continue to 
have 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
at 
their 
disposal, 
although 
it 
will 
require 
an increasingly 
larger 
contribution 
to 
be 
accessible. 
During 
this 
phase, 
income-generating 
activities 
would 
be 
financed 
by 
savings-based 
credit 
and 
village banking 
services, 
in 
support 
of 
the 
emerging 
rural 
financial 
sector. 
The 
network 
of 
PCDP 
partners 
would 
be 
expanded. 
Communities and 
weredas 
would 
play 
an increasingly 
leading 
role 
in 
initiating 
and 
overseeing 
the 
process 
of 
local 
development, 
including 
the 
contracting 
of 
service 
providers 
for 
facilitation 
and approval 
of 
local 
development plans. Research 
findings 
from 
the 
first 
phase 
which 
are 
tested 
and 
accepted 
by 
pastoralists 
would 
be 
scaled 
up 
in 
this 
expansion 
phase 
via 
line 
ministries 
and farmer-to-farmer and 
pastoralist-to-pastoralist 
exchanges. 
Disaster 
preparedness and 
contingency plans 
would 
be 
fine-tuned according 
to 
their 
effectiveness 
in 
mitigating 
drought that 
would 
likely 
occur 
in 
the 
first 
phase. 
Triggers 
from 
phase 
2 
to 
3 
would 
be 
similar 
to 
those 
presented 
above, 
but 
based 
on 
the 
larger 
target 
area. 
Phase 
3: 
Consolidation 
The 
final 
phase 
would 
complete 
geographic 
expansion to 
100 
percent 
of 
Ethiopian 
pastoral communities 
and 
would 
aim 
at 
ensuring that 
the 
institutional 
framework 
and capacity 
is 
in 
place 
to 
ensure 
sustainability 
of 
program 
impact. 
At 
this 
point, 
most 
Phase 
1 
and 
2 
communities 
would 
no 
longer 
require 
the 
support services 
provided 
initially 
to provide 
intensive capacity-building. 
They 
would 
also 
be 
strongly 
linked 
to 
support 
agencies 
and 
service 
providers 
in 
the 
public, 
private, 
and 
NGO 
sector. 
Similarly, 
most 
weredas 
would 
have 
the 
necessary 
capacity 
to 
facilitate 
local 
development. 
Moreover, 
Regional 
governments 
and 
weveda 
administrations 
would 
assign 
the 
required 
budget 
to 
ensure 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Project. 
Drought 
preparedness 
and 
contingency plans developed 
by 
the 
PCDP 
would 
have achieved 
widespread 
support 
by 
donors 
and 
relief 
agencies 
in 
averting and 
coping 
with 
disaster. 
C. 
Program and Project Description Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed 
description and Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
Component 
1. 
Sustainable Livelihoods 
This 
component 
will 
establish decentralized and 
participatory 
planning 
procedures 
at 
the 
community/ 
kebele 
and 
weveda 
levels, 
operating 
within 
the 
Regional 
government 
structure. 
Women 
and 
men 
in 
pastoral communities 
will 
identify, 
prioritize, 
design, 
and 
implement micro-projects 
that 
reflect 
their 
development 
priorities. 
Under 
the 
Capacity 
Building 
sub-component, 
Regions 
and 
communities 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
Project-financed 
Mobile 
Support Teams 
(MSTs) consisting 
of 
a 
Team 
Leader 
(specialized 
- 
11 
- 
Page  18
in 
Pastoral 
Community 
Development), a 
Training, Communication 
and 
Facilitation 
Specialist, 
and a 
Gender 
and Small-scale 
Enterprise 
Specialist, 
who 
will 
work 
with 
wereda 
administrations and 
their 
technical and 
social 
services 
support offices. The 
MSTs 
will 
employ participatory learning 
and 
action 
(PLA) 
tools 
to 
facilitate participatory situation 
analysis and 
to 
help 
communities develop 
modest, 
local 
development 
projects. 
The 
experience 
in 
planning, 
implementing 
and 
evaluating 
these 
micro-projects 
will 
gradually 
build 
up 
local 
capacities 
to 
develop integrated 
community 
development plans 
(CDPs). 
Using 
simple 
micro-project application 
forms, 
communities 
will 
clearly define 
their 
objectives, propose 
activities 
and budgets, 
while 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
environmental 
implications 
of 
their 
projects. 
Proposed 
community 
investments 
will 
be 
forwarded 
to 
weredas 
for 
funding 
through 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF) 
sub-component. 
A 
Vereda 
Development 
Committee (WDC), comprising 
representatives 
of 
the 
wereda 
administration, 
civil 
society and the 
private 
sector, 
will 
appraise 
the 
CIF 
requests 
and make 
funding 
recommendations 
to 
the 
wereda 
administrator. 
In 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
multi-sectoral 
nature 
of 
the 
Project 
and 
to 
respect 
the 
diverse 
priorities 
of 
the pastoral 
communities, 
giving 
particular attention 
to 
poorer 
subgroups 
and 
to 
women, investments 
covered 
under 
the 
CIF 
will 
not 
be 
limited 
to 
specific 
sectors. 
This 
component 
could 
finance 
micro-projects related 
to 
livestock, 
crops, 
water 
supply, 
micro-scale 
irrigation, health 
care, 
education, 
rangeland 
management, etc. 
-- 
a 
choice 
constrained 
only 
by 
a 
short 
negative 
list. 
Approval 
of 
CIF 
proposals 
will 
be 
judged 
at 
the 
wereda 
level 
against transparent 
criteria 
known 
in 
advance 
to 
all 
stakeholders, 
and 
evaluated 
according 
to 
technical 
standards 
from line 
ministries. 
The 
development 
plans, 
which 
will 
require 
at 
least 
a 
20 
percent 
community 
cash 
or 
in-kind 
contribution to 
demonstrate 
commitment, 
will 
be 
implemented 
directly 
by 
communities to 
build 
capacity, 
ensure 
correspondence 
of 
investments 
to 
needs, 
and 
guarantee 
accountability 
to 
the 
community. 
The 
Support 
Services 
sub-component 
will 
finance 
strategic 
infrastructure 
investments 
and 
strengthen 
public 
service 
delivery 
at 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
levels 
as 
well 
as 
supporting targeted 
research 
into 
rainfed 
and 
irrigated 
cropping, 
range management, 
livestock 
production 
and 
non-agricultural 
issues 
relevant 
for 
pastoral 
livelihoods. 
Wereda 
technical 
specialists 
covering non-formal 
education 
(literacy and 
numeracy), 
primary 
health 
care 
(first 
aid, hygiene, sanitation, 
midwifery 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
awareness), 
livestock production 
(husbandry 
and 
veterinary), 
crops 
(irrigated 
and 
rainfed), 
land 
use, 
and 
natural 
resource 
and 
range management 
will 
be 
transferred 
by 
Regions 
to 
weredas 
according 
to 
local 
demand 
and 
staff 
availability. 
There, 
they 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
multi-disciplinary 
wereda 
Mobile 
Outreach 
Teams 
(MOTs) 
to function 
at 
kebele 
and 
community 
level, 
initially 
with 
the 
support 
of 
MSTs. 
Once 
fully 
trained, 
MOTs 
will 
provide 
ongoing technical 
support 
to 
pastoral communities 
in 
formulating 
CDPs 
for 
funding. 
They 
will 
also 
provide 
technical backstopping 
and 
training 
to 
government 
staff 
appointed 
to 
Kebele 
Development 
Stations 
(Nursing 
Assistant, 
Education 
Assistant and 
Polyvalent 
Development 
Agent) 
and 
- 
to 
the 
extent that 
these 
services 
are 
prioritized 
by 
the 
pastoral communities 
- 
to 
Community-Based 
Workers (CBW), 
namely, 
Community 
Animal 
Health Worker (CAHW), Traditional 
Birth 
Attendant (TBA), 
Community Health 
Assistant (CHA),  Pastoral 
Community 
Teacher (PCT) and 
Contact 
Farmers 
(CFs). 
As 
(agro)pastoral 
women 
play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
human 
and 
animal health 
care 
and 
in 
crop 
farming 
in 
the 
Project 
areas, 
the 
Project 
will 
strongly 
encourage 
the 
building 
of 
women’s 
capacities 
as 
CBWs. 
Wereda 
technical 
staff 
will 
provide 
the 
link 
between 
the 
public 
sector 
wereda 
administration, pastoral communities 
and 
community-supported 
CBWs. Participatory 
research 
in 
the 
pastoral 
milieu 
will 
be 
supported 
with 
a 
view 
to 
generating 
innovations 
appropriate 
for 
improved 
natural 
resource 
management, 
livestock 
husbandry, 
and 
rainfed 
and 
irrigated cropping 
in 
semi-arid 
and 
arid 
environments.

Component 
2. 
Pastoral Risk 
Management 
This 
component includes 
a 
community-based 
early 
warning 
system 
which 
will 
build 
upon 
ongoing 
efforts 
by 
the 
DPPC 
and 
NGOs 
to 
establish 
at 
the 
weredu 
level 
the 
collection 
and 
analysis 
of 
basic 
household 
welfare 
data 
using 
a survey 
instrument 
designed 
for 
pastoral 
production 
systems. 
Using 
part-time 
data 
monitors 
at 
community 
levels, 
weredus 
will 
be 
able 
to 
compile 
and 
analyze trends 
in 
household, 
and 
environmental, economic and social 
(including conflict) 
conditions 
in 
discrete 
areas. 
The 
DPPBs 
(the 
Regional 
bureaus 
of 
the 
DPPC) 
will 
then 
receive 
these, 
initially 
quarterly, 
reports, 
which 
will 
assist 
in 
planning 
and 
ultimately 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
better 
system 
of 
targeting 
early 
reaction 
to 
declines 
in 
the 
welfare 
of 
pastoralist communities. 
The 
component 
will 
begin 
in 
year 
one 
in 
the 
focus 
Project 
weredus, 
but 
as 
the 
early 
warning 
system 
should 
be 
Region 
wide 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
it 
may 
be 
able 
to 
scale 
up 
to 
most, 
pastoral 
weredus 
in 
the 
four 
Regions. 
The 
early 
warning 
system 
will 
provide 
the 
information to 
assign each 
participating 
weredu 
to 
one 
of 
five 
"warning 
stages", 
with 
appropriate 
responses 
corresponding 
to 
each 
stage. 
In 
the 
Disaster 
Contingency 
Planning 
subcomponent, 
the 
Project 
will 
invest 
in 
capacity 
building 
at 
in 
weredu 
and 
Regional 
levels 
to 
prepare 
contingency plans 
including both 
disaster 
mitigation 
and 
rapid 
response 
activities, 
monitor 
local 
disaster 
indicators, 
and manage 
funds 
made 
available 
for 
drought 
and 
other 
disaster 
response, 
primarily 
from 
other donors 
and 
government, 
but 
also 
with 
modest amounts made 
available under 
the 
Project. 
Rapid 
response 
activities 
will 
be 
prepared 
in 
advance 
and 
held 
as 
'shelf 
plans' 
for 
timely 
implementation 
at 
the 
appropriate 
warning 
stage. 
This 
should 
result 
in 
improved 
response 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
appropriate 
disaster 
and 
drought mitigation, 
management, 
and 
recovery 
activities. 
As 
this 
process 
is 
intensive 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
capacity, 
the 
Project 
will 
only 
aim 
to 
produce 
functioning 
disaster 
contingency plans 
for 
the 
initial 
focus 
weredus. 
Finally, 
the 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Contingency 
Fund 
(DPCF) 
will 
provide 
the 
initial 
thirty 
weredus 
and others 
with 
development 
grants 
to 
finance 
activities 
identified 
in 
their 
contingency 
plans. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
weredu 
level 
disaster 
contingency plans 
will 
include 
both 
investments to 
better 
mitigate 
drought, such 
as 
small 
feeder roads, 
improved 
water management, 
fodder 
banks, 
and 
range 
improvement, 
as 
well 
as 
funds 
set 
aside 
for rapid 
response, 
such 
as 
destocking, 
water 
tankering, 
response 
to 
human 
and 
animal 
disease 
outbreaks, 
and 
the 
like. 
An 
acceptable 
contingency plan, 
including 
documentation 
of 
the 
participatory 
process 
and environmental 
assessment, 
if 
applicable, 
will 
be 
a 
condition for 
release 
of 
fund 
resources. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
other 
government 
and 
donor 
resources 
will 
be 
the 
prime 
source 
of 
funds 
for 
major 
infrastructure 
investments. 
Investments 
could 
include 
roads, 
livestock 
water 
points, 
flood 
control 
structures, 
grain 
stores 
and electronic 
communication 
systems. 
Local 
labor 
will 
be 
employed 
and 
paid, 
providing 
an 
injection 
of 
cash 
into 
the 
local 
economy. 
Component 
3. 
Project 
support 
andpolicy 
reform 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
operational 
support 
and 
training 
resources 
to 
the 
federal 
Project 
coordination 
unit 
(FPCU) 
in 
Addis 
Ababa and 
Regional 
project 
coordination 
units 
(RPCUs) 
in 
the 
four 
Regions. 
The 
Project 
support and 
coordination 
subcomponent 
will 
ensure 
that 
these 
units 
will 
effectively 
perform 
the 
following 
functions: 
(i) 
fiduciary 
obligations; 
(ii) 
policy 
analysis 
and 
liaison 
with 
stakeholder 
groups; 
(iii) 
multisectoral coordination 
at 
the 
federal and 
Regional 
levels; (iv) 
Project 
communication; 
(v) 
Project 
monitoring; 
and 
(vi) 
mobilization 
of 
technical 
backstopping. 
The 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
subcomponent 
will 
finance the 
information 
management 
system 
and Project 
liaison 
activities. 
This 
will 
comprise 
(i) 
an aggregate-level 
Management 
Information 
System; 
and 
(ii) 
a 
local-level 
system 
that 
combines 
community-derived impact 
assessment 
of 
micro-projects 
with 
an 
- 
13- 
Page  20
information 
base 
that tracks pastoral 
livelihoods 
at 
the 
wereda 
and 
Regional level. 
The 
M&E 
will 
be 
able 
to 
provide 
timely 
feedback 
to 
program 
management 
on 
how 
effectively 
interventions 
are 
reaching 
the 
intended 
beneficiaries 
and 
how well 
Project 
resources 
are 
being 
used, 
in 
order 
that 
rapid 
corrective action 
can 
be 
taken 
if 
necessary. 
The 
communication 
program 
includes 
development 
and 
dissemination 
of 
information 
concerning 
program 
activities, 
approaches 
and results, 
using 
a 
variety 
of 
media. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
extensive 
use 
of 
radio 
networks 
will 
be 
made 
for 
public 
awareness 
creation, 
for 
the 
transmission 
of 
technical 
messages, 
and 
for 
the 
sharing 
of 
experiences. 
The 
policy 
analyses 
and 
reform 
sub-component 
will 
address 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
strengthen 
pastoral 
livelihoods 
and 
reduce 
risk, 
and 
will 
consist 
mainly 
on 
targetted 
studies, 
training, and outreach 
activities. 
Resources 
will 
be 
earmarked 
for 
strategic 
policy 
work 
and 
programming 
at 
the 
Regional 
and federal 
levels.

2. 
Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
proposed 
Project 
must 
explicitly 
support 
and 
be 
firmly 
rooted 
in 
Government's 
efforts 
to 
promote 
pastoral 
area 
development 
via 
a 
holistic, 
people-centered approach. 
The 
PCDP 
may 
be 
used 
to 
realize 
some 
of 
the 
institutional 
reforms 
already 
addressed 
in 
Government 
strategy. 
Decentralization 
is 
a 
prominent 
feature 
of 
Government 
policy. 
The 
primary 
thrust 
of 
Government 
activity 
in 
this 
respect 
involved 
the 
demarcation and 
federalization 
of 
the 
Regional 
states. 
This 
has 
now 
been 
accomplished, 
although 
the 
restructuring 
of 
government 
institutions, 
the 
adoption 
of 
appropriate 
micro 
and 
macro 
economic 
policies, devolution 
of 
power 
to 
local 
governments, 
and 
capacity 
building 
of 
communities remains 
largelly 
incomplete. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
support 
Regional 
Governments 
in 
the 
latter 
by 
financing 
at 
wereda 
levels 
the 
some 
infrastructure 
and 
provision 
of 
equipment 
and 
transport, thereby 
facilitating 
the 
transfer 
of 
key 
support service staff. 
The 
Project 
is 
also expected 
to 
generate greater demand 
for 
public 
services 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
micro-projects 
financed 
by 
the 
CIF 
and 
DPCF. 
Similarly, 
with 
respect 
to 
livestock 
trade 
and 
marketing, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
assist 
government 
to 
review 
and 
revise 
its 
livestock 
sanitary 
and 
phytosanitary and export 
policies 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing 
more 
efficient 
and 
transparent trade. 
These 
actions 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
Bank's 
current 
work for 
the 
Diagnostic 
Trade 
Integration 
Study 
(DTIS) 
on 
the 
Ethiopian livestock 
and 
meat 
sub-sector 
and 
a 
study 
on 
the 
cost-of-compliance 
impact 
of 
the 
import 
ban 
on 
different 
classes 
of 
producers, 
traders, 
processors, 
government and 
consumers. 
It 
will 
also estimate the cost 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
sanitary requirements 
in 
disease 
surveillance, 
quarantine 
(in 
particular 
the 
establishment 
of 
disease-free 
zones) 
and 
control 
and 
their 
benefits. 
To 
address 
land 
rights 
issues, 
Government 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to 
formally 
recognize 
sustainable 
pastoral 
land-use 
as 
a 
land 
management 
practice 
analogous 
to 
sustainable 
cultivation 
and 
move to 
ensure 
the 
land 
use 
rights 
of 
pastoralists, 
if 
necessary 
through 
the 
specific zoning 
of 
pastoral 
lands, 
pending 
the 
negotiation 
of 
a 
longer-term 
solution. 
The 
Project 
will 
assist 
Government and pastoralist 
-14- 
Page  21
and 
agropastoralist 
communities 
to 
integrate 
these 
concepts 
into 
new 
and 
innovative 
strategies 
for 
the 
peaceful, 
efficient 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
rangelands. 
Under 
the 
policy 
reform 
component, 
the 
Project 
could 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
formal 
panel 
to 
hold 
consultative meetings 
leading 
to 
legal 
and 
policy 
reforms and harmonization 
of 
Regional 
legal 
frameworks 
for land 
security 
issues 
in 
the 
overall 
context 
of 
conflictinglcomplementary 
rights 
of 
sedentary 
and nomadic communities over 
rural 
land. 
Riparian 
water rights 
in 
the 
east, 
southeast, 
and southern 
lowlands 
are 
crucial 
for 
sustainable 
rural 
development. 
Limited 
opportunities 
are 
available 
for 
income 
generation, 
rural 
enterprise 
diversification, 
household 
food 
security, 
improved 
human 
health 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
in 
isolation 
of 
exploiting 
perennial 
rivers 
which 
flow 
across 
international 
borders. 
Command 
area 
development 
for 
micro- 
and 
small-scale 
irrigation 
is 
crucial 
for 
improved 
community 
livelihoods 
in 
areas 
where 
major 
water resources 
are 
available. 
The 
Project 
would 
sensitize 
development planners 
to 
benefits 
arising 
from 
irrigated 
crop 
production 
on environmentally 
friendly 
schemes 
in 
selected 
areas, 
and 
assist 
government 
in 
initiating 
dialogue 
with 
and 
reaching 
agreements 
on 
riparian 
rights. 
Rangeland 
management 
issues 
are 
paramount where 
government 
policy 
can 
impact negatively 
on 
carefully planned 
development 
and environmental protection. 
The 
encroachment 
of 
bush 
is 
a 
major 
problem 
in 
large 
areas 
of 
the 
rangeland, 
transforming 
open 
grassland 
to 
inpenetratable 
bushland, 
with 
invasive 
species 
which 
are 
noxious, 
thorny 
and 
unsuitable 
for 
browsing. 
Together 
with 
overgrazing, 
Government regulations 
outlawing 
the 
traditional 
method 
of 
control 
over the 
past 
20 
years (Le. 
recurrent 
and 
controlled 
burning) 
have 
permitted 
the 
invasion 
to 
move onto 
the 
more 
fertile 
lands and 
destroy 
the 
productive 
pastures. 
Given 
that 
economic 
considerations 
are 
considered fundamental 
to 
sustainable 
programs 
of 
clearing 
bushland and 
maintaining 
rejuvenated 
pasture, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
support 
revisiting 
government 
policy 
in 
view 
of 
developing 
coherent 
and 
environmentally 
sensitive 
strategies 
for 
reclaiming 
prime 
rangeland 
areas. 
The 
Project 
will 
also 
finance community-managed 
action 
research 
to 
identify 
methodologies 
-- 
mechanical, 
manual 
and 
chemical 
-- 
and 
assist 
local 
governments 
in 
formulating 
and 
promoting 
community-based 
self 
regulation 
and 
management 
of 
reclaimed 
rangelands. 
A 
land 
use 
planning 
process 
has 
been 
bypassed 
in 
the conversion 
from 
pastoral 
to 
ago-pastoral and 
mixed 
farming 
production 
systems. 
Apart 
from 
blocking 
access 
to 
traditional 
stock 
watering points 
and 
to 
migratory 
transhumance routes, 
unregulated 
land 
grabbing 
is 
a 
prime 
cause 
of 
ethnic 
conflict 
and 
poorly 
planned 
farming 
systems 
are 
an 
underlying 
cause 
of 
environmental degradation 
(water 
and 
wind 
erosion). 
The 
Project 
would 
assist 
govemment 
in 
formulating 
policy 
related 
to 
land 
use 
planning 
and 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
local 
government 
and communities 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
community 
development 
plans. 
Development 
partners, 
specifically 
local 
and 
international 
NGOs, 
have 
been 
at 
the vanguard 
of 
formulating 
strategies 
and 
approaches 
for 
sustainable 
rural 
development 
in 
the 
pastoral lowlands, 
operationalizing methods 
for 
social 
service 
and agricultural 
extension 
delivery, 
and generating 
technologies 
to 
address 
local 
production 
constraints. Government, nonetheless, 
has 
viewed 
this 
development 
with 
an 
element 
of 
suspicion 
and 
has 
occasionally 
curtailed 
NGO 
activity 
in 
the 
rangelands, 
particularly 
in 
border 
areas. 
The 
PCDP's emphasis 
on 
community-driven 
development 
will 
be 
difficult for 
government 
agencies 
to 
implement 
without 
the 
backstopping 
of 
experienced 
NGOs. 
The 
Project, 
with 
Government 
and 
Bank 
support, 
will 
assist 
partner 
NGOs 
to 
identify 
additional 
support 
from 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
donors 
as 
well 
as 
their 
parent 
organizations, 
such 
that 
their 
involvement 
will 
complement 
PCDP 
investments 
rather than 
being 
dependent 
on 
them.

Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
PCDP 
for 
pastoral 
areas 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
as 
follows: 
* 
Improved 
living 
conditions: 
Increased 
access 
to 
key 
social and economic 
services 
and infrastructure 
will 
improve 
levels 
of 
health, education, 
and 
food 
security, 
which 
will 
in 
turn 
improve 
the 
productivity 
of 
community 
members; 
Reduced 
risk 
The development 
of 
better 
early 
warning 
systems 
and 
participatory 
drought 
preparedness 
plans 
will 
substantially 
reduce 
risk 
at 
the 
household 
level 
and 
above. 
The 
Project 
will 
also encourage 
alternatives 
to 
livestock 
raising 
and 
thus 
decrease 
the 
pressure 
on 
rangelands and 
strengthen 
the 
ability 
of 
households 
to 
cope 
with 
disaster; 
Employment and 
income 
generation: 
Increased 
income 
is 
expected 
from 
many 
categories 
of 
micro-projects, either 
directly 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
livestock fattening 
centre 
or 
handicraft 
production), 
or 
indirectly 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
soil 
conserved 
or 
pasture recovered); 
Natural 
resource 
management: 
The 
Project 
aims 
at 
establishment 
of 
efficient 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
rangelands 
combined 
with 
disaster 
mitigation 
programs. Such a strategy 
should improve 
soil 
fertility, 
reduce erosion, 
contain 
bush 
encroachment, 
and 
increase vegetative 
cover and 
bio-diversity. 
Improved 
technical and 
social 
services: 
The 
Project 
will 
strengthen 
technical 
and 
social 
service 
delivery 
at 
Regional and 
wereda 
levels 
by, 
first, 
facilitating 
the 
transfer 
of 
staff, 
provision 
of 
equipment 
(agricultural 
extension, elementary education, 
and 
first 
aid) 
and, second, 
improving 
service outreach 
capability. 
When 
appropriate, 
the 
Project’s 
strategy 
for 
the 
effective delivery 
of 
extension 
support 
will 
be 
underpinned 
by 
providing 
mobility 
so 
that 
technical 
and 
social 
service 
staff 
accompany 
pastoralists and 
their 
herds 
during 
trans-migration. 
Community empowerment: 
In 
order 
for 
the 
Project’s 
impact 
to 
be 
sustainable, 
sufficient 
capacity 
must 
be 
built 
at 
the 
local 
level 
to 
enable 
communities 
to 
execute 
and 
evaluate 
local 
development 
plans, 
improve 
their 
management 
capabilities, and 
engage 
in 
securing, 
planning 
and management 
of 
financial 
resources. 
While 
this 
capacity 
is 
a 
means 
to 
achieve other 
benefits, 
the 
empowerment 
of 
communities 
created 
in 
the 
process 
may 
be 
seen 
as 
a 
benefit 
in 
itself. 
. 
Regional and wereda 
institutional 
capacity: 
The 
Project 
aims 
to 
improve 
local 
governance 
through 
institutional 
reform 
that 
will 
establish and 
strengthen 
multi-disciplinary 
teams at 
the 
wereda 
level, 
improve 
vertical 
linkages 
in 
decision-making between 
wereda 
and 
Regional 
governments, 
and 
build 
capacity 
in 
participatory 
needs 
assessment, 
development 
planning 
and 
program 
implementation. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
it 
will 
take considerable 
time 
and investment 
to 
shift 
administrative culture 
from 
top-down 
to 
participatory, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
both 
an essential 
and 
achievable 
objective 
within 
the 
long-term 
programmatic 
approach. 
Advocacy and 
access 
to 
policy 
makers: 
A 
crucial PCDP innovation 
will 
be 
to 
provide 
the 
platform 
for 
advocacy 
in 
support 
and 
promotion 
of 
issues 
which 
affect 
pastoral communities, 
such 
as 
public 
service 
delivery 
and 
land 
access. 
In 
addition, 
strengthening 
and 
training 
of 
wereda 
administrations 
will 
encourage 
accountability 
to 
their 
constituents 
through 
capacity 
building, 
local 
planning 
and 
provision 
of 
CFs. 
These 
efforts 
will 
encourage 
pastoralists 
to 
propose 
and 
follow-up 
on 
issues 
of 
local 
importance 
with 
policy 
makers and legislators at 
wereda, 
Regional 
and federal 
levels. 
The 
primary 
target 
population 
for 
PCDP 
is 
about 
450,000 
rural 
households 
making 
up 
poor 
pastoral and 
agropastoral 
communities 
in 
30 
weredas 
of 
the 
Afar, 
Somali, 
Southern 
Nations, and 
Oromia 
Regions, 
- 
16- 
Page  23
while 
acknowledging 
that 
there 
are 
pastoral 
peoples 
living 
in 
other 
Regions. 
The 
beneficiaries 
derive 
most 
of 
their 
livelihoods 
from 
the transhumant husbandry 
of 
livestock 
on 
natural 
pastures. 
They 
also 
supplement 
household 
incomes 
by 
engaging 
in 
opportunistic 
crop 
farming, trading, handicrafts, 
salt 
excavation, 
and labour migration. 
The 
average 
household 
consists 
of 
five to 
twelve 
people 
with 
per 
capita 
income 
estimated 
at 
USD 
110 
equivalent. 
Thus, 
the 
majority 
of 
beneficiaries 
live 
significantly 
below 
the 
internationally 
recognized 
poverty 
threshold 
of 
less 
than 
one 
dollar 
a 
day. 
Project 
beneficiaries 
include 
female-headed households (about 
20 
percent) and 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
destitute 
refugees 
dependent 
on 
food 
aid, 
especially 
where 
traditional 
social 
safety 
net 
mechanisms have 
failed. 
The 
reason 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
these 
four 
Regions 
is 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
they 
contain 
the 
greatest 
numbers 
of 
pastoral 
weredas 
and 
people; 
(ii) 
implementing 
the 
Project 
through 
all 
Regions 
with 
pastoralists 
will 
initially 
overstretch 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Project; and 
(iii) 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
Project 
will 
expand 
to 
include 
these 
other Regions. 
Other, 
smaller 
concentrations 
of 
pastoralists 
in 
locations 
such 
as 
Gambella 
and Benshangul-Gumz Regions 
will 
be 
engaged 
in 
the 
later 
phases 
of 
Program 
implementation. 
Ultimately, 
the 
Program 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
income 
and 
well-being 
of 
what 
could 
potentially 
be 
several 
million 
people 
living 
throughout 
the 
rangelands 
of 
Ethiopia. 
Secondary target 
groups 
will 
include 
community 
associations 
and 
local 
and 
Regional 
governments. 
As 
an 
initial 
five-year 
phase 
of 
the 
longer 
Program, 
the 
Project 
proposes 
worlung 
in 
approximately 
one-third 
of 
pastoral and 
ago-pastoral 
weredas 
in 
the 
four 
Regions. 
Criteria 
to 
select 
these 
weredas were 
discussed 
at 
the 
Regional 
level 
and include: 
(i) 
equitable selection 
across 
different 
zones; 
(ii) 
a 
minimum 
level 
of 
capacity 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
resources, 
communications, 
and 
road 
access; 
(iii) 
a 
combination 
of 
pastoral 
and 
agro-pastoral 
weredas; 
(iv) 
adequate 
security conditions, and 
(v) 
the 
need 
to avoid 
weredas 
where 
other donors 
are 
already 
highly 
active. 
The 
following 
preliminary 
list 
was 
established 
by 
the 
Regions 
after 
appraisal. 
In 
Somali 
Region, 
the 
14 
weredas 
are 
Shinelle, Gode, 
West 
Imi, 
Kelafo, 
Kebri 
Dahar, 
Fiq, 
Deghabur, 
DihdHamero, 
Chereti, 
Aysha, 
Kebribeyah, 
Dolo 
Odo, 
Warder, and Jijiga. 
In 
Afar 
Region, 
the 
9 
weredas 
are 
Koneba, 
Dubti, 
Afambo, Gulina, 
Awra, 
Artuma, 
Telalak, 
Gewane, 
and 
Argoba 
Special 
Wereda. 
In 
Southern 
Region, 
there 
are 
two 
weredas: 
Benetsemay 
and Hamer. 
Finally, 
in 
Oromia 
Region 
the 
five 
weredas are 
Areero, 
Dire, 
Raytu, Seweina 
and 
Fentale. 
4. 
Institutional and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Communities 
Community-driven 
development 
is 
central 
to 
the 
proposed 
program 
and communities 
themselves 
constitute 
the 
true 
implementing 
agencies 
for 
the 
PCDP. 
As 
such, 
they 
will 
identify, 
appraise, 
implement, 
monitor, 
and 
evaluate 
micro-projects 
which 
are 
financed through 
the 
first 
component 
of 
the Project. 
They 
will 
also 
be 
closely 
involved, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
their 
respective 
weredas, 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
disaster preparedness plans 
through 
the 
second 
component 
of 
the Project. 
In 
addition, 
they 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
local 
development 
through 
the 
third 
component. 
The 
PCDP 
design 
is 
based 
on 
the 
assumption that pastoral 
livelihoods 
can 
be 
improved 
by 
strengthening 
the 
self-management capacities 
of 
indigenous 
institutions 
found 
within 
communities. 
Successful 
introduction 
of 
CDD 
principles 
will 
require 
a 
substantive change 
in 
attitude 
and 
way 
of 
operating 
within 
government 
services. 
This 
means 
greater 
vertical integration 
of 
information 
flow 
and 
decision-making 
within 
government 
agencies. 
At 
the interface 
with 
the 
community, a 
multi-disciplinary 
team 
(the 
Mobile 
Support 
Team, 
MST) 
will 
share 
responsibility 
with 
communities 
and facilitate technical backstopping 
as 
required.

The 
success 
of 
the 
Project‘s core programs 
depends 
on 
strong community-based 
organizations. 
The 
Project 
will 
pay 
particular attention 
to 
existing 
social-territorial 
organization, 
so 
that 
this 
knowledge 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
groupings and 
forms 
of 
organization that can 
carry 
the 
development 
process. 
No 
community-based interventions 
will 
proceed 
without 
a 
thorough, 
participatory 
analysis 
of 
local 
and 
overlapping 
socio-economic structures 
in 
a 
Project 
area. 
It 
is 
intended 
that a 
coalition 
of 
community 
groups, 
including 
traditional 
organizations 
and 
groups 
representing 
specific 
interests 
(women, youth, 
environment, culture, 
etc) 
will 
work 
together 
to 
set 
community 
development 
priorities 
and, 
together 
with 
interested 
NGOs, 
to 
manage 
their 
implementation. 
A 
community’s commitment to 
this 
process and 
its 
subsequent 
management 
of 
Project 
resources 
will 
be 
closely 
monitored 
with 
persistently 
delinquent communities 
forfeiting 
their 
rights 
to 
Project participation. 
The 
definition 
of 
”community” 
varies 
from 
Region 
to 
Region 
and also 
within 
Regions. 
This 
calls 
for 
a 
flexible 
approach 
to 
identifying 
social groupings 
with 
which 
the 
Project 
can 
work. 
Among 
the 
Somali, 
a 
“qoys 
” 
is 
a nuclear 
family 
composed 
of 
a 
man 
and 
his 
wife 
or 
wives 
and 
their 
dependent 
children. 
A 
“reer 
” 
is 
composed 
of 
several 
qoys 
of 
a 
senior 
male 
family 
head 
and a 
few 
close 
kin 
or 
dependents, 
usually 
younger 
brothers 
and/or 
married 
sons. 
The 
reer 
is 
the 
smallest 
social 
unit 
in 
Somali 
society that 
might 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
“community”. 
Depending 
on 
the 
location 
within 
the 
Somali 
Region, the 
Project 
may 
work 
with 
a 
reer 
or 
several 
of 
these 
living 
together 
(“reero“) 
or 
a 
‘“do“ 
(a 
somewhat 
larger 
grouping 
in 
a village). 
Afar 
people 
identify 
in 
different 
contexts 
and 
for 
different 
purposes 
with 
different 
social 
units 
based 
on 
shared 
kinship, 
descent 
and 
shared 
residence. 
The 
Project 
would 
most 
likely 
interact 
with 
the 
cooperative 
group 
known 
as 
“ganta”, 
which 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
nuclear 
(“burra”) 
and 
extended 
(“ 
dahla”) 
families 
that 
travel 
and 
camp together 
or 
form 
a 
hamlet 
of 
only 
a 
handful 
of 
households 
or 
as 
many 
as 
60. 
The 
Project 
may 
also sometimes 
work 
with 
a lineage 
(“gulub”) 
or 
clan 
(“kidoh”, 
“ked0 
”), 
still 
larger groupings 
of 
related 
people 
who 
may 
be 
living 
and 
moving 
together. 
These 
groupings 
may 
subdivide 
or 
reform 
in 
a 
different 
constellation 
depending 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
socio-political, 
economic 
or 
environmental 
factors. 
Among 
the 
Boran 
in 
southern Oromia, the smallest 
unit 
that 
would 
be 
considered a “community” 
would 
be 
the 
“olla”, 
an 
encampment 
or 
hamlet 
with 
usually 
15-30 
households 
that 
cooperate 
in 
herding 
and 
watering 
animals 
and 
may include people 
from 
several 
different 
clans. Several 
ollas 
may 
use 
common 
grazing 
resources 
in 
an 
“ardha” 
(neighbourhood 
or 
locality). 
This 
unit 
is, 
in 
turn, 
nested 
within 
larger 
territorial 
or 
social 
units 
such 
as 
the 
“dedha” 
(grazing 
area 
used 
by 
several 
ardha) 
or 
“ 
madda” 
(a 
term 
now 
often 
used 
interchangeably 
with 
kebele 
or 
PA). 
In 
South 
Omo 
Zone 
of 
the 
SNNF’RS, 
there 
are 
13 
distinct 
pastoral 
groups 
with 
different 
languages 
and 
cultures. 
Their 
forms 
of 
social organization 
also 
differ 
and 
are 
in 
a 
state 
of 
flux. 
Compared 
to 
the 
larger 
pastoral groups 
in 
the other Regions, 
these 
groups 
are 
more 
confined 
in 
herd 
movements. 
In 
recent 
years, 
small-scale 
cultivation 
has 
become 
more 
widespread around 
more 
or 
less 
temporary 
hamlets 
that 
may 
include 
women, 
children and older 
men 
from 
several clans. 
These 
hamlets 
will 
be 
the 
initial 
entry 
points 
for 
the 
community 
development support 
by 
the 
MSTs, 
after 
agreement 
with 
the 
traditional male and 
female leaders 
of 
the ethnic 
group 
concerned. 
Not 
only 
in 
South 
Omo 
but 
even 
in 
different 
parts 
of 
the 
Somali, 
Afar 
and 
Borana 
areas, 
the 
local 
institutions 
and 
social groupings 
may 
take 
different 
forms 
and 
name. Therefore, 
at 
each 
location, 
the 
MSTs 
will 
have 
to 
learn 
about 
the 
existing 
social organization, then approach 
the 
people 
through 
their 
traditional 
leadership 
and 
relate 
to 
the 
most appropriate 
community 
groupings. 
More 
details 
on 
the 
structure 
and 
dynamics 
of 
the 
pastoral communities 
are 
given 
in 
Annex 
4.

Regional and 
wereda 
administration 
To 
the 
extent possible, 
no new 
institutions 
will 
be 
created 
to 
implement 
the 
Project. 
Instead, 
the 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
strengthening 
existing 
structures 
at 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
levels. 
Most 
rural 
development 
activities 
in 
Ethiopia 
are 
now 
implemented 
by 
National 
Regional 
State 
administrations. Throughout 
preparation, 
broad 
consensus was 
achieved 
in 
establishing 
that 
the 
PCDP 
will 
be 
implemented 
at 
the 
Regional level. 
Multi-sectoral 
bodies 
already 
exist 
in 
each 
Region 
to 
administer 
the 
Project, 
i.e. 
the 
Pastoral 
Development Commission 
(Oromia); 
the 
Pastoral 
Development 
Coordination 
Office 
(Somali), 
the 
Pastoral 
and 
Rural 
Development 
Bureau 
(Afar),  and 
the 
Food 
Security and Pastoral Development 
Office 
(Southern 
Nations). 
The 
Project 
will 
establish 
Regional Project Coordination Offices 
(RPCUs) 
within 
these 
offices 
to 
coordinate 
each 
Regional 
program. 
However, 
even 
Regions 
are 
too 
distant 
from 
most pastoral communities 
to effectively 
implement 
CDD. 
The 
PRSP 
views 
the 
wereda 
as 
"a suitable 
point 
of 
merger 
between 
political 
empowerment 
and 
economic 
development 
at 
the 
grass 
root 
level." 
A 
process 
of 
establishing 
multi-disciplinary 
teams at 
the 
wereda 
level 
has 
already 
been 
initiated 
in 
all 
rangeland 
zones 
and 
will 
be 
expanded 
and 
strengthened 
by 
the 
Project and 
coached 
to 
work 
in 
a 
more 
mobile 
manner. 
Sufficient 
numbers 
of 
staff 
are 
already assigned 
to 
most 
of 
these 
agencies, 
however, a 
substantial investment 
in 
capacity 
building 
and 
equipment 
is 
required 
before 
these 
entities 
could 
become 
effective 
program 
management 
units. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that experienced 
national 
consultants 
employed 
on 
fixed-term 
contracts 
will 
be 
required 
to 
strengthen 
these 
agencies 
in 
the 
initial 
years 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
following 
and 
operational 
modalities 
were 
established 
during 
preparation: 
0 
Each Region 
will 
establish 
a 
Regional Project Coordination 
Unit 
(RPCU) 
within 
the 
existing 
pastoral/rural 
development 
office. 
The 
role 
of 
the RPCUs 
will 
be 
to 
(i) 
manage 
Project 
fund 
flows, 
report 
and 
liaise 
with 
relevant Bureaus 
and 
the 
Federal 
level, 
and coordinate 
Project 
annual 
planning; 
(ii) 
introduce 
an 
interactive learning 
process 
between government 
institutions and 
civil 
society; 
(iii) 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
the Pastoral 
Risk 
Management 
Component; 
and 
(iv) 
facilitate 
capacity-building activities 
at the 
community, 
kebele, 
and 
wereda 
levels 
to 
improve planning 
and 
provision 
of 
support 
services. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
(a) 
a 
Regional Project 
Coordinator; 
(b) 
a 
communications/training 
specialist; 
(c) 
an Accountant; 
(d) 
a 
Procurement 
Officer, 
(e) 
a 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
specialist, 
and 
(0 
and 
support 
staff. 
The 
RPCUs 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
Project-financed 
Mobile 
Support 
Teams 
(MSTs) operating 
within 
selected 
weredas. 
MSTs 
provide 
capacity-building 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
filling 
existing 
capacity 
gaps 
at 
the 
local level to 
both 
communities and 
local 
governments. 
They 
are 
accountable 
to 
the Regions, 
will 
operate 
within 
the 
existing 
Government 
structure, 
and 
will 
be 
partners 
with 
Government 
staff. 
Once 
capacity 
has 
been 
built, 
they 
will 
cease 
to 
be 
necessary 
and 
be 
phased 
out, 
moving 
their 
expertise 
to 
new 
weredas. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
MSTs 
will 
be 
to 
(i) 
provide 
initial 
orientation 
and 
training 
using 
a 
"learning-by-doing"  approach and 
to 
introduce 
weredas 
and 
communities 
to 
the 
Project; 
(ii) 
facilitate communication 
between 
communities and 
formal 
government 
structures and 
(iii) 
assist 
weredas 
to 
develop 
criteria 
for 
analysing 
and 
approving 
community micro-proj 
ects; 
and 
(iv) 
assist 
with 
wereda 
funding 
mechanisms. 
The 
MST 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
three 
core 
members: 
(a) 
a 
Team 
Leader; 
(b) 
a 
training 
officer; 
(c) 
a 
Gender/Small 
business development specialist; and 
(d) 
support 
staff 
such 
as 
drivers 
and 
a 
Camp 
Leader. 
They 
will 
likely 
have 
technical 
qualifications 
(in 
veterinary, 
range, 
education, 
water andlor health) 
but 
will 
be 
primarily 
experienced 
communicators, 
and 
would 
draw upon 
technical 
staff 
at 
Regional and zonal 
bureaus 
for 
training 
and 
technical 
backstopping 
as 
required.

Federal 
Project 
coordination 
and 
policy 
formulation 
A 
lean Federal 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
(FPCU) 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
Addis 
to 
perform 
the 
following 
functions: 
(i) 
fiduciary 
obligations; 
(ii) 
policy 
analysis 
and 
liaison 
with 
stakeholder 
groups; 
(iii) 
multisectoral coordination 
at 
the 
federal level; (iv) 
Project 
communication; 
(v) 
aggregate 
Project 
monitoring; 
and 
(vi) 
mobilization 
of 
technical 
backstopping. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
(a) 
a 
Project 
coordinator; 
(b) 
a 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
specialist; 
(c) 
a 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist; 
and 
(d) 
a 
Procurement 
Specialist, 
(e) 
a 
Pastoral 
Policy 
and 
Research 
Advisor,  and 
(0 
appropriate 
support 
staff. 
Substantial 
Project 
management experience 
will 
be 
required 
for 
professional 
staff. 
Terms 
of 
reference 
for 
these 
posts 
will 
be 
appended 
to 
the 
Project Implementation Manual. 
The 
Coordinator 
of 
the 
FPCU 
will 
report 
to 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Pastoral Development Department 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs 
and 
the 
new 
Federal 
Interministerial 
Board 
(FIB), 
which 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Federal 
Affairs. 
This 
Board 
is 
composed 
of 
the 
Ministers 
of 
Rural 
Development, Water, 
Health, Education, Water, 
Agriculture, 
Infrastructure, 
and 
also 
the 
Livestock 
Marketing 
Authority. 
As 
such, 
it 
will 
help 
ensure 
that 
the 
PCDP 
is 
able 
to 
implement 
a 
multi-sectoral 
approach 
and receive 
high-level 
support 
and 
technical 
back-stopping 
when 
necessary. 
The 
FIB 
will 
receive backstopping 
from 
a 
multi-ministerial 
Technical 
Committee, 
which 
has 
representation 
from 
several 
line 
ministries 
who 
have 
sectoral specialists 
in 
pastoral 
development. 
Project 
oversight 
Oversight and advice 
for 
the 
Project 
will 
come 
from 
the 
Parliamentary Standing 
Committee 
on 
Pastoral 
Development, 
which 
is 
composed 
of 
nine 
Members 
of 
Parliament, 
the 
majority 
of 
whom 
are 
representatives 
from 
pastoral 
consituencies. 
This 
Committee 
has 
been 
closely 
involved 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
PCDP 
and remains 
highly 
interested 
in 
continued 
support 
to 
and 
from 
the 
PCDP. 
Link 
with 
other 
IDA-.nancedprojects 
As 
a 
multi-sectoral project, 
coordination 
with 
other 
operations 
is 
critical. 
The 
preparation 
of 
this 
Project 
coincides 
with 
other 
initiatives 
-- 
the 
Food 
Security Project 
(FSP) 
and 
the 
Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program (Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(PSCAP)). 
The 
Food 
Security 
Project 
(FSP), 
which 
is 
aimed 
at drought-prone 
weredas 
in 
the highlands, 
provided 
many 
ofthe 
design elements 
for 
the 
PCDP, 
given 
that 
both 
aim 
at 
channelling 
fungible 
resources 
to 
communities 
via 
block 
grants 
at 
the 
wereda 
level. 
Geographic 
coverage 
of 
the 
two 
projects 
will 
be 
mutually 
exclusive, 
even 
though 
both 
will 
work 
in 
Oromia 
and 
Southern 
Regions. 
The 
Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program's (PSCAP) emphasis 
on 
decentralized 
service 
delivery 
performance 
through 
capacity 
building 
directly 
complements 
the 
PCDP 
(and 
Food 
Security 
Project 
(FSP)) 
although 
it 
will 
not 
probably 
work 
in 
lowland 
weredas. 
The Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(PSCAP) 
will 
focus 
on 
reforms, 
policy, 
and 
administrative and 
financial 
management 
at 
the 
wereda 
level, 
while 
the 
PCDP 
concentrates 
on 
micro-proj 
ects, 
participation, 
and 
community-local 
government linkages. The 
Multisectoral 
HIV/AIDS 
Project (MAP), 
signed 
on 
October 
12,2000 (Credit 
# 
3416-ET), 
is 
another 
important project 
with 
an 
overall 
objective 
of 
increasing 
access 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention, 
care, 
and 
treatment programs, 
with 
emphasis 
on 
vulnerable 
groups 
(such 
as 
youth, 
women 
of 
childbearing 
age, 
and 
other groups 
of 
high 
risk). 
It 
also 
emphasizes 
the 
utilization 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
services 
and 
activities 
provided 
by 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
entities, 
the 
NGOs 
and Community-Based 
Organizations. 
The 
Medicinal 
Plants 
project, 
although 
located 
in 
the 
highlands, 
is 
expected 
to provide 
valuable 
lessons 
on 
traditional 
methods 
to 
improve 
human 
and 
livestock 
health. 
The 
Information 
and 
Communication

Technology 
Capacity 
Building 
(ICTCB) 
project 
has 
as 
one 
of 
its 
objectives 
communication 
outreach 
for 
improved 
service 
delivery 
in 
rural 
areas 
in 
the 
form 
of 
pilots. 
Such 
pilots may 
be 
implemented 
in 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
pastoral 
Regions, 
building 
upon 
the 
institutional 
base 
provided 
by 
the PCDP. 
Finally, 
the 
Emergency 
Drought 
and 
Rehabilitation 
Project, 
which 
was 
recently 
prepared, 
has 
the objective 
of: 
(i) 
maintaining 
the 
availability 
of 
critical 
economic 
inputs 
(particularly 
those needed 
in 
rural 
areas) 
and 
support the 
economic 
recovery 
process; 
(ii) 
rehabilitating 
and creating 
communal 
assets 
using 
community labor 
within 
the 
affected population, and 
(iii) 
providing 
income 
supplements, 
and 
protect 
private 
assets 
of 
affected population. 
Links 
with 
donors and 
research 
organizations 
Current donor 
activity 
in 
pastoral 
area 
development 
is 
very 
low 
but 
this 
will 
soon change (several 
NGOs 
are 
present 
but 
covering 
a 
limited 
geographical 
area 
-- 
these 
are 
described 
in 
annex 
13). 
The 
PCDP 
proposes 
a 
phased 
national 
approach 
to 
pastoral 
area 
development that 
invites 
participation 
of 
a 
range 
of 
donors 
funding 
integrated 
or 
geographically 
distinct 
components 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
International 
Fund 
for 
Agricultural 
Development 
(IFAD) 
is 
co-financing 
the 
Project 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
has 
participated 
fully 
from 
identification 
through 
to 
appraisal. 
FA0 
has 
also 
played an important 
role 
throughout preparation 
using 
FAO/CP 
resources. 
The 
Project 
will 
collaborate 
with 
the 
FAO-led 
"Horn 
of 
Africa'' 
initiative 
in 
the 
Region 
and 
FA0 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Program 
funding 
will 
support 
parallel 
wereda 
investment 
programs 
in 
Afar 
(Chifra) 
and 
Somali 
(Harshin). 
The 
DFID-financed 
"Pastoral 
Communication 
Initiative", 
which 
is 
implemented 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Sussex, 
is 
co-financing 
pilot 
operations 
and 
has 
proved to 
be 
an 
important 
partner 
during 
preparation, 
particularly 
in 
its 
ability 
to 
promote 
and 
facilitate 
dialogue 
among 
pastoral 
Parliamentarians 
and other 
stakeholders. 
The 
African 
Development 
Bank 
(AfDB) 
has 
committed 
grant 
funds 
for 
a 
major 
pastoral 
area 
study 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
two 
pastoralist 
development 
projects 
for 
2005. 
AfDB 
has 
been 
closely 
consulted 
during 
preparation 
and 
their 
findings 
are 
expected 
to provide 
a valuable 
information 
base 
upon 
which 
the 
PCDP 
and other 
operations can 
build. 
USAID 
is 
planning 
investment 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
under 
its 
"Southern 
Tier 
Initiative". 
Finally, 
the 
European 
Union 
completed 
in 
2002 
their 
own 
assessment 
of 
opportunities 
for 
pastoral 
area 
development 
and 
are 
expected 
to 
development 
project 
proposals 
that 
share 
the 
PCDP's approach. 
The 
International 
Livestock 
Research 
Institute 
(ILRI) 
has 
been 
closely consulted 
during 
preparation and 
will 
be 
a valuable 
partner 
with 
respect 
to 
developing 
disseminating 
new 
technologies, 
drought 
preparedness strategies 
and 
data, 
and 
information 
on 
pastoral 
development. 
Possibilities 
will 
be explored 
to 
collaborate 
with 
ILRI's 
new 
research 
theme 
II 
(Enabling Innovation) 
so 
as 
to 
enhance 
learning 
from 
pastoral-led 
innovation 
and 
experimentation 
processes 
support 
by 
the 
PCDP. 
Similarly, 
the 
Ethiopian 
Agricultural 
Research 
Organization 
(EARO) 
is 
has 
been 
transforming 
its 
research agenda 
from 
highland cropping to 
more 
of 
an 
emphasis 
on 
agro-pastoral 
and 
livestock 
systems. 
Both 
ILRI 
and 
EARO 
are 
likely 
candidates 
to 
undertake targetted 
applied 
research 
under 
the 
Support Services subcomponent. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
APL 
vs. 
SIL: 
The 
rationale 
for 
using 
a 
flexible, 
long-term, 
lending 
instrument 
is 
that 
decentralization, 
capacity-building, 
and 
ambitious geographical 
coverage 
are 
long-term 
processes, 
many 
of 
which would 
not 
bear 
fruit 
within 
the 
time 
span 
of 
a 
SIL 
(Specific Investment Loan). 
The 
criteria 
for 
using 
an 
APL 
are 
largely 
satisfied, 
i.e. 
(i) 
a 
long 
term 
strategy 
and development 
program 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
GoE; 
(ii) 
the 
livelihoods 
emphasis 
in 
the statement 
of 
program 
purpose 
presents 
a 
realistic and 
desirable 
vision 
for 
the 
future 
of 
pastoral 
areas; 
(iii) 
the 
end 
of 
program indicators 
are 
meaningful; 
(iv) 
the 
phasing 
leads 
to 
achievement 
of 
the 
program 
purpose; 
(v) 
the 
development 
objective 
is 
feasible 
considering 
the 
time 
and 
resource constraints; 
(vi) 
a 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
has 
been 
drafted; 
and 
(vii) 
bilaterals, 
MDBs, 
-21 
- 
Page  28
and 
NGOs 
active 
in 
pastoral 
area 
development have 
been 
brought 
into 
the dialogue 
and/or have 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
proposed 
program. 
Sectoral 
vs. 
holistic 
focus: 
Past 
Bank 
interventions 
in 
Ethiopia's 
rangelands have 
been 
sectoral, 
focussing 
on 
livestock 
health, 
natural 
resource management 
and 
rural 
infrastructure. 
While 
successful 
in 
providing 
services 
in 
the 
short-term, 
the 
lack 
of 
community 
participation 
in 
the management 
of 
these 
programs 
seriously 
compromised 
their 
sustainability. Government 
policy 
now 
favors 
more 
holistic 
and 
participatory 
approaches 
to 
pastoral 
development 
and 
recent 
NGO 
experience 
confirms 
the 
efficacy 
of 
this 
approach. 
Centralized 
vs. 
decentralized implementation: 
Past 
rangeland 
projects 
have 
been 
centrally 
managed, 
but 
this 
Project 
proposes the 
devolution 
of 
most 
management decisions 
to 
Regional, 
woreda 
and 
particularly 
community levels 
with 
the 
federal government 
assuming 
coordination, 
advocacy 
and 
policy reform 
responsibilities. 
Decentralized implementation 
supports Government's recent 
decision 
to 
strengthen the 
role 
of 
woredas 
in 
development 
planning 
and implementation 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
community 
empowerment 
with 
participatory 
development. 
IDA 
grant 
vs. 
IDA 
credit: 
Five 
criteria 
have 
been 
set 
out 
by 
IDA 
donors 
as 
part 
of 
the 
IDA 
13 
replenishment 
framework: 
(i) 
HnT/AIDS, 
(ii) 
natural 
disaster, 
(iii) 
post-conflict, 
(iv) poorest 
IDA-only 
country, 
or 
(v) 
particularly 
debt-vulnerable 
poorest 
IDA-only 
country. 
Ethiopia 
qualifies 
under 
the 
fifth 
criterion. 
As 
such, 
the 
PCDP 
has 
been 
allocated 
100% 
grant 
financing 
from 
IDA. 
Financing 
of 
Income-generating 
Activities: 
Financing 
of 
income-generating 
activities 
(IGAs) 
should 
normally 
be carried out 
by 
rural 
finance 
institutions. 
However, 
these are 
largely 
absent 
from 
pastoral 
areas. 
Pending the 
establishment 
of 
rural 
and 
micro-finance institutions 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
joint 
IFAD/AfDB 
funded 
Rural 
Financial Intermediary Program 
and 
the 
need 
to 
encourage 
livelihoods 
outside 
of 
pastoralism, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
support 
IGAs 
with 
its 
Community 
Investment 
Fund. 
It 
will 
do 
so 
on 
the 
following 
basis 
(i) 
evidence 
is 
provided 
that 
the 
IGA 
is 
a 
community 
choice; 
(ii) 
the 
beneficiary 
contribution 
is 
in 
cash; 
(iii) 
individuals 
do 
not 
receive 
the 
CIF; 
(iv) 
women 
and 
vulnerable 
groups 
are 
favoured; 
and 
(v) 
there 
must 
be no 
functioning 
micro-credit 
service 
providers 
otherwise available. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
this 
stop-gap measure 
will 
be 
reassessed 
during 
the 
Mid-Term 
Review.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
A 
series 
of 
rangeland 
and 
livestock 
projects 
since 
the 
1960s 
- 
most 
of 
them 
involving 
the 
World 
Bank 
- 
have 
received 
widespread 
criticism. 
Some 
of 
this 
criticism 
is 
justified. 
Past 
interventions 
were 
top-down 
and 
largely 
failed to provide 
sustainable technical, 
institutional 
and 
financial 
support. 
On 
the 
other hand, 
they 
made 
considerable 
progress 
in 
water development and 
disease 
control 
and 
in 
accumulating a 
wealth 
of 
knowledge 
on 
pastoral society and 
economy. 
Nor 
did 
the 
projects 
attempt 
the 
folly 
of 
introducing 
large-scale 
ranches, 
ill-suited 
exotic 
breeds, 
or 
untenable 
efforts 
to 
change 
pastoralist institutions. 
Success 
or 
failure 
of 
past 
investments 
must 
also 
be 
viewed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
several constraints, 
including 
the 
almost 
total lack 
of 
social and 
economic 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
rangelands, massive 
shifts 
in 
the 
political 
climate, 
the 
absence 
of 
NGO 
support, and 
insecurity 
from 
civil 
conflict 
and 
war. 
While 
perhaps 
more positive 
in 
their 
impact 
than 
they 
are 
credited 
for, 
the 
past 
interventions 
in 
Ethiopia's 
rangelands nonetheless 
had 
a 
number 
of 
serious shortcomings. 
These 
included: 
A 
primary 
focus 
on 
the 
development 
and 
delivery 
of 
infrastructure 
and 
services 
with 
too 
little 
and 
too 
late consideration 
of 
their 
maintenance 
or 
sustainability; 
Insufficient consultation 
with 
pastoralist communities 
or 
organizations, 
with 
little 
attempt 
to 
(i) 
specifically 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
women 
or 
the 
disadvantaged, 
(ii) 
to 
shift 
the 
culture 
of 
the 
implementing 
agency 
from 
top-down 
to 
participatory 
or 
(iii) 
to 
engage 
local 
administrations 
or 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture staff 
in 
program 
planning or 
implementation; 
No 
attention 
paid 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
agro-pastoralism 
and 
agriculture 
as 
major 
activities 
in 
the 
project 
areas; 
Weak 
engineering 
services, 
particularly soil 
testing, 
leading 
to 
a 
high 
failure 
rate 
in 
project-funded 
surface water 
storage, 
and 
persistence 
with 
programs 
(ranching, 
livestock 
marketing 
and 
some 
forage 
introductions) 
when 
their 
technical, 
social and 
financial 
underpinning 
was 
known 
to 
be 
erroneous; 
Insufficient 
attention 
to 
drought 
early 
warning 
systems, 
risk 
identification 
and 
disaster 
mitigation 
strategies; 
Insufficient 
attention 
to 
the 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
infrastructure 
development, 
livestock 
marketing 
and 
lowland-highland agricultural 
linkages; 
Failure 
to 
recognize 
the 
adverse 
impact 
of 
local 
and 
regional 
conflict 
and 
to 
propose 
ways 
for 
its 
mitigation. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
recipient commitment 
and 
ownership 
The welfare 
of 
people 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
is 
a 
top 
priority for 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government. 
The 
project 
stems 
from 
a 
request 
from 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
for 
advice and support 
for 
pastoral 
area 
development. 
The 
resulting 
pastoralism 
issues 
paper 
and 
project 
proposal 
have 
been read 
by 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
Government 
in 
Ethiopia 
and helped 
bring 
forward 
the 
agenda 
for 
pastoral community 
development, 
including 
the current Project. 
The 
PCDP 
corresponds 
with 
the 
central 
features 
of 
the Government's 
new 
strategy 
for 
pastoral 
areas 
by 
promoting 
an 
integrated and 
holistic 
approach 
that 
focuses 
on 
people, 
not 
merely 
their 
animals. 
It 
would 
also 
pursue 
several 
of 
the 
recommendations 
proposed 
in 
the 
Food 
Security 
Strategy, such 
as 
those 
- 
24 
- 
Page  31
pertaining 
to animal 
health, 
marketing, water 
supply, 
agropastoralism, 
and early 
waming 
systems. 
The 
Project 
also 
fits 
closely 
with 
Government’s 
PRSP, 
which 
states 
that 
“the 
problem 
of 
food 
security and 
agricultural 
growth 
in 
the 
nomadic 
areas 
is 
being 
conceived 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
pastoral 
economy 
in 
its 
entirety” 
and 
would 
support the PRSP’s 
emphasis 
on 
community 
empowerment. 
The 
Project 
proposals 
are 
based 
on 
extensive discussions 
with 
pastoral communities 
in 
all 
main 
pastoral 
areas 
and 
have 
been 
formulated 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Economic 
Development, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs, 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister. 
The 
Regional 
administrations, 
in 
particular, 
have expressed 
overwhelming 
support 
for 
the 
Project’s approach. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Dialogue 
on poverty 
reduction 
policy: 
With 
support 
to 
the 
PRSP, 
IDA 
is 
well 
positioned 
to 
push 
forward 
discussion 
on 
how 
to 
coordinate 
and strengthen Government’s 
commitment 
to poverty 
reduction. 
However, 
this 
will 
have 
to involve 
all 
other 
major 
development partners. Together 
with 
IFAD, 
IDA 
collaboration 
is 
expected 
to 
make 
a 
significant 
contribution to 
the goals 
of 
the 
PRSP, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
community-driven 
initiatives 
and 
the 
decentralization 
of 
service 
delivery 
to 
the 
wereda. 
The 
close 
collaboration 
between 
the 
IDA 
and 
IFAD 
specialists 
and the 
senior 
Government 
officials 
responsible 
for 
Project implementation 
has 
already 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
a strong 
consensus 
on 
Project 
design 
and 
approach. 
Scaling 
up 
CDD 
efforts: 
IDA 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
mobilize 
sufficient 
funding 
to 
undertake 
such 
an 
ambitious 
national 
program. 
With 
the 
wide 
range 
and 
large 
scale 
of 
many 
of 
its 
operations, 
IDA 
is 
well 
positioned 
to 
link 
the 
PCDP 
goals 
with 
the 
national reforms 
and 
financing 
mechanisms 
required 
to 
support them. 
The 
involvement 
of 
IDA 
in 
the 
Project 
also 
provides 
a 
framework, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
IFAD’s 
and 
FAO’s 
involvement, 
within which 
other 
donors 
and 
NGOs 
can complement 
IDA’s 
support, 
ensuring 
the 
linkages between and 
within 
on-going 
and planned 
programs. 
International 
experience: 
IDA 
brings 
intemational 
experience 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
social 
funds, 
decentralization, 
and demand-driven 
rural 
investment 
funds. 
Aside 
from 
experience 
in 
Ethiopia 
listed 
above, 
IDA 
now 
has 
many similar 
operations 
ongoing 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
the 
PCDP may 
draw 
from 
the 
positive 
and negative 
lessons 
of 
this 
experience. 
Examples 
include 
the 
many 
West 
African 
CDD 
projects, 
the 
Kenya 
Arid 
Lands 
Project, 
the 
Mongolia 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
project, 
and 
the 
many 
examples 
of 
social 
funds. 
In 
addition, 
the 
growing 
focus 
and 
debate 
in 
the 
World 
Bank 
on 
community-driven 
development 
will 
help to 
consolidate 
lessons 
and 
experience 
which 
the 
PCDP 
can 
use 
to 
its 
advantage. 
Sectoral 
experience: 
IDA 
has 
projects 
in 
every 
sector, 
which 
can 
contribute technical 
solutions 
and 
facilitate 
institutional 
linkages 
with 
line 
ministries. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
ESRDF 
in 
terms 
of 
community 
participation 
and 
implementation 
of 
micro-projects. 
The 
sector 
investment programs 
in 
health, education, 
and 
transport 
will 
help 
in 
coordinating 
and 
ensure 
technical 
standards 
when 
pastoral communities and 
weredaschoose 
investment 
in 
these sectors. 
Limitations 
of 
Bank 
support: 
While 
recognizing 
IDA’s 
comparative 
advantage, 
it 
is 
equally important 
to 
acknowledge that 
we 
are 
relatively 
weak 
in 
several 
areas, 
particularly 
conceming 
on-the-ground 
experience 
in 
community-driven 
approaches 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
and 
in 
working 
with 
NGOs. 
In 
this 
respect, 
it 
will 
be 
vitally 
important 
for 
the 
PCDP to 
collaborate 
with 
development 
partners 
who 
possess 
diverse 
strengths 
and 
considerable 
operational 
experience.

P 
The 
Bank's 
Concept 
Review 
for 
this 
Project 
concluded 
that, 
given 
the 
demand-driven 
nature 
of 
the 
micro-investments 
under 
this 
Project, conventional calculations 
of 
net 
present 
values 
and economic 
rates 
of 
return 
would 
have 
little 
meaning. 
This 
type 
of 
project 
does 
not 
easily 
lend 
itself 
to 
economic 
evaluation 
for 
various 
reasons. 
First, 
benefits 
of 
the 
capacity-building 
components (support 
to 
communities 
and 
local 
governance) cannot 
easily 
be 
quantified 
in 
monetary 
terms. 
Second, 
the 
investment 
component 
cannot 
be 
known 
ex 
ante, 
since 
it 
is 
demand-driven 
and 
defined 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Project. 
Third, 
many 
of 
the 
benefits 
from 
anticipated 
investments 
(such 
as 
in 
natural 
resource 
management, education, health, 
etc.) 
similarly 
defy 
quantification. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
rationale 
for not 
carrying 
out 
conventional 
economic analysis 
on 
the 
CDD 
dimension 
of 
the 
Project 
also 
holds 
for 
financial 
analysis. 
The 
assessment 
of 
financial 
management 
systems 
in 
the 
PCDP 
may 
be 
found 
in 
Annex 
6. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
There 
are 
several 
dimensions 
to 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
this 
Project. 
First, 
because 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
Project 
financing 
is 
an 
IDA 
grant, 
the 
debt 
burden 
imposed 
by 
the 
Project 
is 
significantly 
reduced. 
Second, 
since 
the 
Project 
would 
be working mainly 
through existing institutions, 
the 
fiscal 
burden 
of 
creating 
costly 
new 
ones 
would 
be 
minimized. 
Third, 
given 
that micro-investments 
under 
the 
first 
component 
are 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
sustainable 
livelihoods, 
and that 
the 
sustainability 
of 
investments 
is 
a 
major 
criterion 
for 
approving community 
proposals, 
government 
assistance 
to 
these 
communities 
could 
be 
reduced 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
Finally, 
and 
probably 
most significantly, 
the 
expected 
impact 
of 
the 
risk 
management 
component 
would 
reduce the 
need 
for 
and 
dependency 
of 
pastoral 
communities 
for 
government-financed 
relief 
in 
times 
of 
crisis. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
following 
issues 
are 
likely 
to 
feature 
importantly 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PCDP, 
particularly 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Support 
Services sub-component. 
The 
specific 
types 
of 
technical 
innovations that 
will 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
Project 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
interests and 
needs 
identified 
by 
the 
pastoral communities 
and 
weredas. 
0 
Rainfed 
farming 
in 
semi-arid regions 
has 
received 
scant 
resources 
from 
past 
national 
research 
programs, 
although 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
change 
(through 
EARO, 
for 
example). 
The 
PRSP 
states 
that 
"the 
acquisition 
and 
adoption 
of 
suitable 
technological 
packages 
to 
moisture-deficit 
drought prone 
areas 
merges 
with 
the 
overall 
effort 
to 
address 
the 
country's 
food 
security 
problem 
at 
the 
rural 
- 
26 
- 
Page  33
household level, 
which 
remains 
as 
an 
outstanding 
task 
for 
the 
coming 
years”. 
The potential 
for 
improved productivity 
and opportunities 
for 
investment 
in 
the 
rainfed 
farming 
sector 
is 
apparent 
to 
most 
observers. 
The 
generation 
of 
dryland 
farming 
technologies 
supporting 
rainfed farming 
system 
packages 
would 
focus 
on 
three facets 
of 
the 
production 
system. 
The 
first 
facet 
is 
cultural 
practices, 
with 
research 
into 
(i) 
crop 
rotations, 
crop 
water 
use 
efficiency, 
field 
sanitation, 
soil 
fertility 
maintenance; 
(ii) 
fallow 
periods; 
(iii) 
soil 
and water conservation 
measures; 
(iv) 
fallow 
efficiency; 
(iv) 
fallow 
maintenance 
methodology; 
and (v) 
crop 
management. 
The 
second 
aspect 
is 
land 
husbandry 
and tillage 
techniques, 
covering: 
(i) 
tyned 
implement 
and 
share 
selection 
(ii) 
timing 
of 
field 
operations 
(iii) 
the 
application 
of 
zero/minimum tillage 
and 
deep 
ripping 
practices; 
and 
(iv) 
adapting tractor 
drawn 
implements 
to 
suit 
local 
conditions. 
The 
final 
aspect 
concems 
devising 
crop 
packages 
with 
crop 
calendars 
indicating 
(i) 
timeliness 
of 
operations; 
(ii) 
recommended 
drought-tolerant 
varieties; 
and 
(iii) 
crop 
suitability 
for 
specific 
environments, 
for 
example, resistance 
to 
pests 
such 
as 
the 
quela 
bird. 
Irrigated 
farming, 
linked 
to 
voluntary 
pastoralist 
sedentarization, 
is 
an 
important long-term 
government strategy 
and 
offers potential 
for 
pastoralists’ 
food 
security, 
however, a 
number 
of 
constraints 
require 
further 
investigation. 
High 
river 
banks 
along many 
lowland 
rivers 
limit 
opportunities 
for 
run-of-river 
schemes, 
frequently 
necessitating 
pumped 
irrigation, although 
water 
spreading technology, 
primarily 
for 
fodder 
production, 
also 
offers opportunity. 
The 
cost 
of 
pumped 
irrigation 
must 
be 
carefully 
evaluated 
when 
used 
for 
necessary, 
but 
low 
value, 
food or 
fodder 
production. Reliable 
water 
supply 
can also 
be 
a 
constraint. 
In 
the 
South Eastern 
rangelands 
rivers 
are 
few 
and 
highly 
seasonal, 
carrying 
the 
risk 
that water 
supply 
fails 
in 
drought 
years 
when most 
is 
expected 
of 
it. 
Successful 
irrigation, 
when 
combined 
with 
ill-defined individual land 
use, 
rights 
also 
carries 
the 
risk 
of 
elite 
capture and/or 
lack 
of 
ownership and 
maintenance. These 
difficulties 
must 
be 
recognized and 
integrated 
into 
a 
holistic 
food 
security and 
rural 
development 
policy, 
of 
which 
irrigation 
will 
be 
an important 
element. 
Further 
study 
is 
required 
on 
catchment 
and water 
management, 
crop 
and 
forage husbandry 
and market opportunities, supported 
by 
financial 
and 
economic analysis. 
Animal 
health 
is 
of 
primary 
concem 
to 
pastoralists. 
Effective 
interventions 
in 
this 
sub-sector 
are 
dependent 
upon 
a sound understanding 
of 
disease 
epidemiology, 
particularly 
when related 
to 
disaster-based 
interventions. 
Although 
Ethiopia 
has 
epidemiological 
capabilities, 
these 
have 
been 
severely 
constrained 
by 
on-going ethnic 
conflicts, 
poor 
border 
security, inadequate resourcing, 
poor 
technical 
service outreach, 
and 
lack 
of 
community-based 
disease 
surveillance 
capability. 
Consequently, 
impact 
has 
been 
minimal 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
for 
well 
over a 
decade. 
Poor 
coverage 
of 
lowland 
herds 
(an 
average 
of 
50-80 
percent) 
during 
transhumance 
and the 
unregulated 
cross-border 
movement of 
livestock 
continuously thwart 
the 
impact 
of 
vaccination 
campaigns. 
The 
Project 
would 
fund 
an 
integrated 
approach 
to 
animal health 
services 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
through 
support 
to 
(i) 
training 
of 
community-based 
“paravets“ 
in 
traditional 
ethno-veterinary 
and 
clinical 
procedures, 
and 
as 
front-line 
disease 
surveillance 
scouts 
at 
community 
level; 
(ii) 
promoting private 
veterinary practices 
in 
weredas; 
(iii) 
consolidating 
public 
sector 
epidemiological,  diagnostic 
and regulatory 
services; 
(iv) 
establishing linkages between central 
public 
sector 
support 
services 
and 
private 
sector 
wereda- 
and 
community-based 
practitioners 
and; 
(v) 
strengthening 
the 
policy 
and 
legal framework 
of 
the 
sub-sector. 
Forage 
supply 
is 
central 
to 
livestock 
performance, 
yet 
pastoralists 
have 
not 
accepted 
or 
have 
been 
slow to 
adopt 
innovations 
such 
as 
the 
expanded 
use 
of 
indigenous 
fodders, 
establishing 
set-aside 
pasture 
areas 
for 
range 
rehabilitation 
and 
drought 
reserves, 
pasture 
rejuvenation 
and drought 
proofing, 
use 
of 
exotic 
fodder 
species, 
strategic 
feeding 
strategies 
for 
immature and lactating 
females, 
and the 
benefits 
of 
intensive 
fodder 
production 
and 
conservation. Conversely, 
some 
forage 
introductions, 
notably 
Prosopis 
juliflora 
(Afar) 
and 
Opuntia 
spp 
(Somali), 
are

environmental 
degradation 
in 
the 
most 
fertile 
soils 
of 
the rangelands. 
The 
Project’s 
participatory 
research 
program 
would 
attempt 
to 
identify 
the 
underlying 
constraints 
to 
community rejection 
of 
these 
strategies 
and 
develop 
technological 
packages 
that 
are 
culturally 
acceptable 
and 
capable 
of 
spontaneous 
adoption. 
Natural 
resource 
management. 
Two 
inter-dependent 
components 
of 
the 
traditional 
form 
of 
rangeland 
management 
which 
have 
maintained 
a 
sustainable 
pastoral 
production 
system 
are 
(i) 
controlling 
access 
to water 
resources, 
and 
(ii) 
the management 
of 
wet 
season 
and 
dry 
season 
pasture. 
For 
the 
most 
part, 
past 
interventions 
involving 
water 
resource 
exploitation 
have 
been 
relatively 
prudent 
with 
the 
rangelands 
having 
escaped 
the 
worst 
excesses 
of 
unfettered 
access. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
commercial ranching 
interventions 
involving 
rangeland 
enclosures 
with 
fencing 
have 
proven 
unsuccessful 
for 
pasture management, 
and 
have 
been 
made 
without 
watershed mangement 
plans 
or 
environmental 
assessments. 
Water 
and 
pasture management 
are 
also essential 
elements 
for 
effective 
disaster preparedness. Remote 
sensing 
and 
the 
participatory 
planning 
processes 
at 
wereda 
and 
community 
levels 
to 
be instigated 
by 
the 
PCDP 
will 
facilitate 
and make 
affordable 
the 
preparation 
of 
such 
assessments 
which 
in 
turn 
will 
permit 
water and 
pasture resources 
across 
the 
rangeland 
to 
be 
more 
effectively 
managed. 
Livestock and 
animal 
product 
marketing 
are 
central 
to 
consolidating 
improvements 
to 
pastoralists 
livelihoods, 
implementing 
environmentally 
sound 
NRM 
practices, 
and 
formulating 
plans 
for 
disaster 
preparedness. 
Timely 
herd 
offtake 
and 
easy 
access 
to 
markets 
are 
essential elements 
of 
drought 
preparedness 
planning 
and capitalise 
upon 
indicators 
generated 
by 
the 
Project’s 
early warning 
system. 
Despite popular perception 
that 
livestock 
traders 
in 
pastoral 
areas are 
exploitive, 
marketing 
and 
risk 
analyses 
studies 
generally 
show 
modest 
margins 
relative 
to 
the 
risk 
involved. 
A 
certain 
degree 
of 
myth 
surrounds 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
livestock 
trading 
and 
warm 
milk 
sales 
impacts 
on 
community 
livelihoods. 
The 
Project 
will 
facilitate 
the 
incorporation 
of 
pastoralist 
production 
systems 
in 
the 
national 
economy 
through financing 
studies 
into 
the 
requirements 
of 
regional 
markets 
(carcass 
quality, 
export specifications, 
sanitary requirements); 
improved 
marketing 
services 
(price 
broadcasting, 
regulatory 
meat 
inspection 
and quarantine); 
and 
will 
encourage 
herding 
communities 
to 
develop 
more 
efficient 
and 
culturally 
acceptable strategies 
for 
de-stocking 
in 
the 
event 
of 
drought, 
and 
for 
re-stocking 
during 
the 
drought recovery 
phase. 
The PDCP 
will 
also 
address 
issues 
of 
technology generation 
to improve 
women’s 
labour 
efficiency 
in 
the 
processing 
of 
milk 
and 
meat 
products. 
Bush 
encroachment 
is 
now 
considered 
by 
many 
as 
the 
most 
critical 
problem 
in 
rangeland 
management 
with 
invasive 
species 
advancing 
onto 
the 
highly 
fertile 
riverine 
soils 
of 
the 
Awash 
Valley 
(Afar) 
and 
into 
the 
more productive valley bottoms 
(Borena). Studies 
have shown 
over 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
southern 
lowlands 
in 
general, 
and 
83 
percent 
of 
former native 
pastures 
in 
Borena 
valley 
bottoms 
have 
been 
invaded. 
Limited 
scientific knowledge 
exists 
in-country 
on 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
ecological 
shift 
or 
the 
means 
of 
regulation. 
While 
manual, 
chemical, and mechanized 
packages 
have 
been 
successfully 
employed 
elsewhere 
for 
bush 
control, 
the 
government 
policy 
on 
bush 
burning, 
tree 
felling 
and 
charcoal 
making 
has 
constrained 
control 
investigations. 
Although 
pastoralists 
are 
adapting 
to 
their 
changing environment 
through 
shifts 
in 
the 
mix 
of 
species 
in 
herds, 
the 
accelerated 
rate 
of 
bush 
encroachment 
now 
seriously 
threatens 
the 
sustainability 
of 
pastoral 
systems. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
support 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
role 
of 
fire, 
rangeland 
set-aside 
procedures, 
and 
various 
forms 
of 
clearing, and 
will 
provide 
advocacy 
in 
policy reform 
where 
required. 
e 
Micro-project 
plans 
involving 
simple 
infrastructure 
would 
require careful 
planning 
prior 
to 
presentation 
for 
financing 
approval 
from 
the 
CIF. 
The 
plans 
would 
be 
assessed 
according 
to 
technical, 
financial, environmental, 
operation and 
maintenance, 
and sustainability 
criteria. 
This 
- 
28 
- 
Page  35
would 
require 
communities 
complying to 
guidelines 
related 
to 
procurement 
and 
the contracting 
of 
local 
artisans and entrepreneurs. 
Communities 
would 
be 
required 
to 
accept 
and 
conform to 
PCDP 
pre-conditions 
before 
micro-projects 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
approval. 
The 
capacity 
of 
communities 
to 
finance, 
expedite repairs 
and 
carry 
out 
maintenance 
would 
be 
carefully 
assessed 
thereby 
ensuring 
recurrent 
demands 
are 
not 
made 
on 
future 
public 
sector 
budgets. 
Criteria, 
guidelines, 
and 
standards 
of 
a 
technical 
and 
environmental 
nature 
will 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
Project Implementation Manual. 
As 
ministries 
such 
as 
health, 
public 
works, education, roads, 
environment and 
agriculture 
would 
be 
involved, protocols 
would 
be 
drawn 
up 
to 
formalise 
collaborative 
guidelines. 
Wereda-based 
technical 
staff, 
as 
required, 
will 
be 
closely 
associated 
with 
the 
entire 
process 
providing 
support 
- 
from initial 
planning 
and 
design 
stage, 
to 
implementation 
and 
commissioning, 
and 
finally 
to 
on-going 
management 
of 
micro-projects. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
As 
described 
in 
section 
C 
above, 
the 
principal 
executing 
agencies 
for 
the 
PCDP 
are 
the 
pastoral 
communities 
themselves. 
They 
will 
articulate, 
implement, 
and 
monitor 
micro-projects 
under 
the 
first 
component, 
and 
to 
some 
extent under the 
second. 
Implementation 
would 
also 
involve 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committees, 
and 
Regional 
Pastoral 
Development 
Boards, 
which 
comprise 
several 
line 
ministries. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project coordination 
and 
central 
financial 
management 
will 
be carried out 
by 
the 
Federal 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(FPCU), 
which 
will 
be 
housed 
in 
the 
Pastoral 
Area 
Development Department 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs. 
The 
FPCU's functions 
will 
be 
fiduciary 
obligations, 
policy 
analysis, 
liaison 
with 
central 
stakeholder groups, 
Project 
communication, 
aggregate 
Project monitoring, and 
mobilization 
of 
technical 
backstopping. 
Given 
the 
decentralized structure 
of 
the 
PCDP, 
true Project 
management 
will 
occur 
at 
the 
Regional 
level 
and 
wereda levels. 
At 
Regional 
levels, 
the 
Pastoral Bureaus 
will 
house 
the 
Regional Project Coordination 
Units 
(RPCUs), 
with 
chief 
responsibility 
for 
PCDP 
management 
and 
who 
will 
coordinate 
Project activities 
and the 
Mobile 
Support 
Teams 
(MSTs), 
which 
provide 
Project 
outreach 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Capacity 
constraints 
constitute 
the 
main 
procurement 
issue. 
The 
MOFA 
is 
a 
new 
Ministry, 
with no 
prior 
experience 
of 
managing 
projects 
for 
international 
financial 
institutions. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
address 
this 
issue 
by 
recruiting 
an 
experienced 
national 
procurement 
specialist 
to 
manage 
the 
procurement 
program 
and 
through 
refresher 
training 
for 
the 
procurement specialist and procurement 
awareness 
training 
for 
the 
Project 
Coordinators. 
A 
substantial 
proportion 
of 
the 
procurement 
will 
be 
made 
in 
isolated 
wereda 
where 
there 
will 
be 
little 
competition 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
services. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
employ 
an 
experienced 
government 
procurement 
officer 
who 
will 
monitor 
Regional and 
wereda procurement activities, 
aggregating wereda 
level 
procurement 
contracts 
wherever possible 
with 
a 
view 
to 
attracting 
wider 
competition. 
The 
RPCU 
procurement 
officers 
will 
train 
wereda 
PDO 
staff 
in 
local 
procurement 
management and 
receive refresher 
training 
at 
the 
national level. 
Late 
payment 
of 
import 
taxes 
and 
duties 
by 
Government 
frequently 
delays 
delivery 
of 
goods, 
particularly 
now 
that most 
goods are 
imported 
through 
Djibouti, 
a 
foreign 
port. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
prepare 
detailed 
annual 
estimates 
of 
Program tax 
and 
duty 
liabilities 
and present 
them 
to 
MoFA 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
to 
ensure 
their 
inclusion 
in 
the 
annual 
government 
budget.

4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
Project 
will 
need 
to 
ensure 
that 
(i) 
an 
accounting and 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
carefully 
planned, 
keeping 
in 
mind 
that 
much 
of 
the 
Project implementation 
will 
take 
place 
at 
the 
weredu 
level 
and 
below; 
(ii) 
procedures 
and capacity 
building 
programs 
are 
developed 
to 
support 
the accounting 
of 
community-based 
contracts 
under 
the 
CIF 
and 
at 
higher 
levels 
with 
the 
DPCF; 
(iii) 
the 
experience 
of 
other 
IDA-financed 
and other 
multilateral 
donor-funded 
projects 
is 
taken 
into 
account; 
(iv) 
the 
planned 
flow 
of 
funds 
is 
consistent 
with 
Government 
procedures; 
(v) 
the 
capacity 
of 
staff 
likely 
to 
handle 
Project 
finance 
is 
adequately appraised 
and 
skill 
gaps addressed; 
(vi) 
the 
accounts 
of 
the 
entities 
which 
shall 
implement 
the 
Project 
are 
current and 
have 
been 
duly 
audited; and 
(vii) 
arrangements 
for 
cost sharing, 
investment 
maintenance 
and 
any 
cost 
recovery 
are 
in 
place. 
Financial 
management 
issues 
are 
discussed 
in 
more detail 
in 
Annex 
6(b). 
The 
Project 
will 
be 
implemented 
with 
a 
new 
FPCU 
to 
be 
established 
before 
the 
project 
effectiveness. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this, 
the 
project 
will 
need to 
ensure 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
carefully 
planned 
and developed 
as 
is 
indicated 
in 
the 
action 
plan 
shown 
in 
annex 6B, 
keeping 
in 
mind 
that 
much 
of 
the 
project implementation 
will 
take 
place 
at 
the 
weredu 
level 
and 
below. 
To 
coordinate the 
project 
at the 
federal level, a Federal 
Project Coordinating 
Unit 
(FPCU) 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs. 
Its 
role 
in 
financial 
management 
will 
be 
to 
release 
funds 
against agreed plans, 
disburse 
funds 
to 
all 
implementing 
levels, 
and 
co-ordinate 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
project 
as 
a whole. 
In 
each 
Region, the Pastoral 
Development 
Office 
(PDO) 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
specialized 
staff 
dedicated 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
PDOs 
vary 
in 
staff 
numbers 
and 
capacity 
among 
the 
four 
Regions, and 
will 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
flows 
of 
funds 
to 
communities 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
the 
Weredu 
Development 
Committee 
(WDC), 
which 
includes 
officers 
of 
relevant 
bureaus 
(agriculture, 
health, 
labor 
and 
social 
affairs), 
and 
representatives 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
civil 
society. 
The 
weredu 
Finance 
Office 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
handling 
the 
financial 
transactions 
of 
the 
project 
at 
the 
weredu 
and 
kebele 
levels. 
An 
additional 
finance 
officer may 
be 
required 
for 
a 
wereda. 
IDA, 
IFAD, 
GOE 
and 
the 
communities 
will 
finance 
the 
project. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
open 
two 
Special 
Accounts 
(SAs) 
at 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Ethiopia, 
one 
for 
IDA 
and 
the 
other 
for 
IFAD. 
IDA 
and 
IFAD 
then, 
from 
the 
Credit 
Account, 
will 
transfer 
money 
to 
the 
SAs. 
The 
FPCU 
may 
effect 
payments 
directly 
to 
a 
supplierkontractor 
from 
the 
credit 
accounts. 
The 
government 
will 
transfer 
the 
counterpart 
portion 
to 
the 
local 
currency account 
maintained 
by 
the 
FPCU. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
transfer 
money 
to 
each 
of 
the 
Regional 
Pastoral 
Development 
Offices 
(PDOs), 
from 
which 
funds 
will 
flow 
to 
Weredu 
Administration 
Offices 
(WAOs) 
to 
cover 
eligible 
project 
expenditures. 
The 
transfer 
will 
be 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
annual 
project 
budget. 
On 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committee 
and 
with 
approval 
of 
the 
WAO, 
the 
weredu 
Finance 
Offices 
will 
transfer 
money 
to 
the 
Community 
Based Organizations 
having 
approved 
micro-projects. 
The 
Federal 
Auditor 
General 
will 
assign 
external 
auditors, acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
to 
conduct 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
project financial 
transactions. 
The 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements, 
along 
with 
the 
management 
letter, 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
not 
later than 
six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
Environmental 
issues 
associated 
with 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
PCDP 
have been 
identified 
by 
Environmental 
Category: 
B 
(Partial 
Assessment) 
- 
30 
- 
Page  37
the 
PHRD-financed Environmental 
Assessment 
and 
Management 
Framework 
(EAMF) 
undertaken 
during 
the 
pre-appraisal 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
assessment 
concluded 
that the 
Project 
is 
not 
anticipated 
to 
result 
in 
significant 
adverse 
impacts. 
The 
Executive 
Summary 
provided 
of 
the 
EAMF 
(see 
Annex 
11) 
briefly 
outlines 
the 
main 
environmental 
issues 
and 
the 
measures 
recommended 
to 
mitigate 
them. 
Of 
the 
three 
proposed 
components, 
the 
Sustainable Livelihoods 
component 
has 
the 
most 
positive 
environmental 
impacts 
as 
it 
aims 
to 
provide 
communities 
with 
support 
to 
articulate 
their 
priority 
needs 
in 
a 
local 
development 
planning 
process. 
Although 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
establish 
precisely 
what 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
these 
micro-projects 
will 
be 
at 
this 
stage, 
they 
are 
not 
anticipated 
to 
be 
negative 
as 
the 
projects 
will 
be 
small 
in 
scale 
and geographically 
dispersed. 
Moreover, 
a component 
of 
the 
EAMF 
is 
the 
provision 
of 
an 
environmental 
screening process 
which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate 
micro-projects 
as 
part 
of 
appraisal. 
The 
Pastoral 
Risk 
Management 
component 
includes 
a 
community-based 
early warning 
system, 
drought contingency planning, and 
a 
drought 
preparedness 
and 
contingency 
fund. 
The 
majority 
of 
fund 
resources 
would 
be 
dedicated 
to 
long-term 
preparedness 
interventions, 
with 
a 
small 
amount 
earmarked 
to 
jump-starting 
initial 
mitigation 
activities 
in 
the 
event 
of 
severe 
drought. 
As 
with 
the 
case 
of 
the 
CIF, 
there 
are 
potential 
minimal 
environmental 
risks 
associated 
with 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
DPFC. 
Hence, the 
proposed 
environmental 
screening 
and 
appraisal 
forms 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
these 
investments and 
to 
recommend 
mitigation 
measures. 
The 
Project 
Support 
and 
Policy 
Reform 
component 
will 
provide 
operational 
support and 
training 
resources 
to 
the 
FPCU 
and 
RPCUs. 
There 
are 
no 
negative 
environmental 
impacts 
associated 
with 
this 
component. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
this 
component 
will 
also support 
the 
environmental 
training 
and 
capacity 
building 
which 
has 
been recommended 
under 
the 
EAMF. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
A 
review 
process 
has 
been 
established 
to 
ensure screening 
of 
all 
micro-projects 
proposed 
under 
the 
CIF 
and 
risk 
management 
interventions, 
particularly 
under 
the 
Drought 
Preparedness 
and 
Contingency 
Fund. 
The 
process 
includes 
an environmental 
screening process 
which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
proposed subproject 
will 
result 
in 
negative 
environmental 
impacts 
and, 
if 
so, 
to what 
extent 
these 
impacts 
will 
impact 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
pastoralists. 
The 
choice 
of 
category 
and 
the 
need 
for 
mitigation 
measures 
is 
based 
on 
a 
checklist 
of 
environmental impacts 
which 
reflect 
World 
Bank 
and 
IFAD 
guidelines 
(including 
guidelines 
on 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
in 
social 
funds 
and 
CDD) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government’s 
own 
regulations 
(including 
guidelines 
for 
agricultural 
sector 
development 
projects). 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
screening 
process, 
an 
environmental 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
process 
has 
been 
designed 
for 
weveda 
and 
Regional 
supervision 
of 
microprojects. 
The 
Project 
will 
finance 
a 
training 
program 
for 
local 
government 
officials 
and other 
stakeholders 
on 
how 
to 
use 
the 
screening 
and 
monitoring 
process. 
Moreover, 
an 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(see 
Annex 
11) 
has 
been prepared 
to 
outline 
the 
training 
and 
capacity 
building 
measures 
needed 
to 
ensure 
that 
environmental 
concerns 
have 
been 
mainstreamed 
into 
Project 
design 
and 
has 
been 
fully 
costed. 
The 
Borrower 
is 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
the 
measures 
outlined 
in 
the 
EMP 
are 
implemented.

How 
have stakeholders 
been consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental 
impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan?  Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that 
were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were 
consulted? 
Stakeholder 
consultation 
was 
the 
primary 
means 
to 
achieve 
the 
EA 
objectives. 
An 
intensive 
schedule 
of 
interviews 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
and 
resource 
people 
was 
carried 
out. 
A 
typical 
agenda 
of 
a 
meeting 
would 
include 
a 
brief 
overview 
of 
the 
Project, 
views 
and comments 
of 
the 
participants, 
and 
specific 
questions 
from 
the 
EA 
team regarding 
the 
details 
of 
environmental 
and 
social sensitivities, people's 
interaction 
with 
the 
environment, and 
potential 
impacts 
of 
the 
Project. 
Key 
stakeholders 
consulted 
on 
the 
Project 
included 
(i) 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture's 
Pastoral 
Extension 
Team, 
and other federal 
government 
agencies; 
(ii) 
Regional 
bureaus; 
(iii) 
weredu 
and 
kebele 
administrations; 
(iv) 
pastoralists 
in 
Afar, 
Oromia 
(Borana 
zone), 
and 
Somali 
Regions; 
(v) 
environmental 
NGOs; 
(vi) 
research 
institutes; 
and 
(vii) 
international 
development 
agencies. 
The 
EA 
team 
included 
one 
trip 
in 
October 2002 and a 
second 
visit 
a 
month 
later, 
working 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
World 
BanWIFAD 
pre-appraisal 
mission.

What 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Monitoring 
of 
environmental 
issues 
will 
be 
undertaken 
using 
the 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
process 
provided 
in 
Annex 
5 
of 
the 
EAMF. 
This 
process has 
been 
designed 
for 
use 
at 
the 
weredu 
and 
Regional 
levels 
to 
ensure 
that 
micro-projects 
are 
being 
supervised 
at 
both 
levels, 
and that 
pertinent 
issues 
are 
reported 
to 
ensure 
that the appropriate technical 
input 
can 
be 
provided. 
6. 
Social: 
6. 
I 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's social 
development outcomes. 
Over 
the 
centuries, 
pastoral communities 
have 
devised 
coping 
mechanisms 
and 
strategies, 
including 
mobility 
of 
households 
and 
herds, 
that 
are 
best 
suited 
to 
the 
fluctuating climatic 
conditions 
in 
which 
they 
live, 
In 
this 
context, the 
Project 
is 
more 
likely to 
succeed 
if 
it 
respects 
and 
builds 
on 
these 
indigenous 
mechanisms and strategies, 
to 
the 
degree 
that 
they 
can 
still 
be 
practised. However, 
progress 
in 
decentralizing social 
and technical 
support services 
and 
in 
implementing 
pastoral 
community-driven 
development 
in 
an 
equitable 
and 
inclusive way 
will 
be 
impeded 
by 
several constraints. 
These 
include: 
conflicting 
traditional and 
modem 
systems 
for 
access 
to 
and 
tenure 
of 
natural 
resources; 
expansion 
of 
crop 
farming 
into key 
grazing-resource 
areas; 
reduced 
mobility 
and 
greater 
concentration 
of 
people 
and 
livestock 
around 
permanent waterpoints;  displacement 
of 
pastoral 
peoples; 
few 
opportunities 
for 
employment 
and 
income generation 
outside 
of 
agriculture; 
the 
weak 
economic 
position 
of 
women 
in 
pastoral 
society; 
erosion 
of 
traditional 
social 
safety 
nets; 
scarcity 
or 
absence 
of 
social 
and 
technical 
support 
facilities; 
low 
levels 
of 
formal 
education 
and 
literacy; 
the 
likelihood 
of 
a 
rising 
incidence 
of 
HIV/AIDS; 
poor 
access 
to 
market, 
financial 
services 
and 
information; 
and incidences 
of 
violent 
conflict, 
in 
part 
as 
a 
result 
of 
changes 
in 
resource-tenure 
policies. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Project 
must 
seek 
to 
redress the 
history 
of 
insufficient 
consultation 
with 
pastoral communities 
by 
authorities, 
low 
levels 
of 
participation 
by 
the 
communities 
in 
decisions 
that 
affect 
them, 
and 
the 
pastoralists' 
general 
lack 
of 
confidence 
in 
government bodies.

The 
Project 
is 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
following 
social 
development outcomes: 
(i) 
improved 
living 
conditions 
of 
pastoral communities, 
through 
diversifying 
and 
increasing 
production 
and income 
of 
pastoral 
households 
and increasing 
their 
access 
to 
social and 
technical 
services 
from 
both 
the 
government 
and 
the 
private 
sector; 
and 
(ii) 
increased 
capacity 
of 
the 
communities 
to 
manage 
their 
own 
development 
in 
an 
equitable and 
sustainable way, 
through 
promoting 
gender 
and poverty-sensitive decision-making 
and 
implementation 
of 
development-oriented 
activities 
under 
their 
ownership 
and 
governance. 
Under 
the 
PHRD 
grant, 
various social 
studies 
have 
been 
carried out 
to 
gain 
insight 
into 
the 
indigenous social 
structures 
and 
use 
of 
resources 
by 
communities 
in 
targeted 
areas, 
and 
into 
differences 
in 
socio-economic 
conditions and 
livelihood 
strategies 
of 
pastoral, agropastoral 
and 
destitute 
groups. These 
studies 
have 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
establishing indicators 
to 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
social development 
outcomes. 
Attention to 
women's 
issues 
will 
be 
an 
important 
feature 
of 
the 
PCDP. 
Women 
in 
pastoral 
societies have 
heavy 
physical 
tasks 
not only 
related 
to 
home-making 
(e.g. 
fetching 
water and 
fuel, 
building 
and 
dismantling 
huts) 
but 
also 
in 
caring 
for 
livestock, 
milking 
cattle 
and 
goats, 
and 
processing 
and 
selling 
milk 
products. 
Some 
agropastoral 
women 
are 
also 
involved 
in 
petty 
trading 
and 
other 
income-generating 
activities 
such 
as 
teashops, 
handicrafts and 
small-scale gardening. 
However, 
men 
control 
factors 
of 
production 
in 
livestock 
keeping 
and 
crop 
farming, and dominate decision-making 
in 
the 
traditional 
socio-political 
structures. 
The 
Project 
will 
seek 
ways 
to 
involve 
women 
in 
situation 
analysis 
and 
planning 
of 
development, 
so 
that 
community 
projects 
will 
address 
also women's 
needs. 
Separate 
meetings 
will 
be 
held 
with 
women's 
groups, 
and 
traditional 
and 
informal 
leaders 
among 
the 
women 
will 
be 
identified: 
these 
are 
often 
strong personalities 
who 
are 
past 
child-bearing 
age. 
They 
will 
be 
supported 
in 
facilitating 
women's 
organisation 
and 
in 
speaking 
for 
women 
in 
community-level 
management 
of 
development 
activities. 
The 
Project team 
will 
be 
trained 
and 
will 
train 
others 
in 
gender 
awareness, 
together 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Women's 
Affairs 
and 
NGOs. 
It 
will 
support 
relevant 
organisations, also 
at 
community 
level, 
to 
articulate 
women's concerns. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
Project 
will 
promote participatory 
planning, implementation, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
in 
five 
main 
ways: 
(i) 
institutionalising participation 
by 
building 
the 
capacities 
of 
communities 
and 
support services 
to 
engage 
in 
community-led 
planning 
based 
on 
indigenous knowledge, 
coping 
mechanisms, 
skills, 
social 
structures 
and 
riorities; 
(ii) 
use 
of 
Participatory 
Learning 
and 
Action 
(PLA) 
methods 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
members 
of 
the 
community 
(men, 
women, young, 
old, 
rich, 
poor) 
are 
provided 
the 
space 
to 
express 
their 
views 
and 
needs; 
(iii) 
strengthening 
local 
leadership 
to 
ensure 
that 
community 
leaders, 
both 
male 
and 
female, 
have 
the 
knowledge, 
contacts 
and 
eloquence 
to 
present 
their 
views 
confidently; 
(iv) 
enabling 
participation 
of 
all 
natural 
resource 
users, 
including 
the 
more 
mobile 
and 
the 
displaced 
groups 
that 
may 
use 
the 
resources 
on 
only 
a 
seasonal 
or 
temporary 
basis; 
and 
(v) 
use 
of 
community-based 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
methods 
that 
enable 
the 
communities 
to 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
Project activities 
on 
their 
lives 
and 
allow 
appropriate 
responses 
from 
outside 
support services. 
In 
order 
to 
institutionalise participation, 
the 
Project 
will 
invest 
in 
training 
in 
and 
support 
for 
participatory 
processes 
and 
enabling 
government 
procedures 
and 
policy 
change. 
A 
strategy 
for 
participatory 
planning, implementation, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
will 
be 
developed and 
will 
be 
the 
guiding 
operational 
framework 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Project 
is 
responsive 
to local priorities 
and 
needs. 
The 
strategy 
will 
define 
the 
mechanisms 
by 
which 
the 
Project 
design 
ensures 
that 
development 
activities 
are 
owned 
by 
the 
communities 
yet 
do not 
exclude 
women 
and 
vulnerable 
groups 
that 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to make substantial 
contributions 
to 
costs 
on 
their 
own. 
In 
close 
collaboration 
with 
pastoral communities, 
local 
administrations and 
local 
enterprises, 
the 
Project 
will 
invest substantially at 
the 
wereda 
level 
and 
below 
in 
training 
for 
community 
empowerment and 
leadership. 
The 
Wereda 
Development Committees (WDCs), 
comprising 
representatives 
of 
the 
weredu

Page  40
administration, 
civil 
society 
and 
the 
private 
sector, 
will 
meet 
at 
least 
twice 
yearly, 
according 
to 
their 
own 
schedule, 
to 
appraise 
CIF 
requests 
and 
to 
make 
funding 
recommendations 
to 
their 
respective 
wereda 
administrators. 
They 
will 
also 
monitor 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
activities 
funded. 
Consultations 
during 
preparation 
was 
undertaken 
in 
the 
Somali 
and 
Afar 
Regions, 
the 
Borana 
Zone 
of 
Oromia Region 
and 
South 
Om0 
in 
the 
Southem Region. 
Discussion 
has 
been 
initiated 
with 
NGOs, 
bilateral 
projects 
and 
indigenous organizations 
in 
each 
of 
these 
areas, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
federal 
and 
Regional 
government 
agencies. 
Initial 
proposals 
for 
the 
Project 
were 
reviewed 
and 
discussed 
during 
workshops 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
at 
preparation, pre-appraisal, 
and 
appraisal 
missions 
(records 
of 
these 
workshops 
are 
annexed 
to 
the respective 
mission 
Aides 
MCmoires). 
Further 
consultation 
is 
planned 
during 
Project 
preparation, 
including 
a 
series 
of 
NGO-facilitated 
meetings 
with 
community 
leaders 
in 
the 
proposed 
Project 
areas. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Government 
has 
traditionally 
been 
wary 
of 
NGO 
participation 
in 
publicly-funded 
projects. However, 
recent 
NGO 
participation 
in 
the 
Bank's 
HIVIAIDs, 
Women's 
Development and 
ESRDF 
projects 
has 
opened 
a 
new 
window 
of 
opportunity. 
The 
PCDP 
includes 
activities 
that 
would 
be 
difficult for 
government 
agencies 
to 
implement 
without 
the 
backstopping 
of 
NGOs 
with 
experience 
in 
the 
pastoral 
areas. 
In 
fact, 
it 
would 
be 
perilous 
to 
proceed 
with 
Project implementation 
without drawing 
on 
the 
accumulated 
knowledge 
of 
the 
non-governmental and 
bilateral 
development-support 
agencies 
already 
operating 
in 
the 
proposed 
Project 
areas. 
Partnerships 
with 
experienced and 
successful 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral 
projects 
will 
therefore 
be 
sought, 
and the 
PCDP 
will 
align 
its 
programs and 
resources 
with 
those already 
put 
in 
place 
by 
these 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral 
projects. 
The 
PCDP, 
with 
Govemment 
and 
Bank 
support, 
will 
encourage and assist 
partner 
agencies 
to 
identify 
additional 
support 
from 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
donors 
as 
well 
as 
their 
parent 
organisations, such 
that 
their 
involvement 
would 
complement 
PCDP 
investments 
rather than 
being 
dependent 
on 
them. 
For 
example, an 
application 
to 
the 
Japan 
Social 
Development 
Fund 
has 
been 
submitted 
to provide 
such 
funding 
for 
NGO 
involvement. 
During 
the 
pre-appraisal 
mission, 
the 
proposed 
Project 
and 
key 
issues 
arising 
were 
discussed 
in 
a 
half-day 
workshop 
with 
representatives 
from 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral 
projects. Discussions 
were 
deepened 
in 
subsequent 
meetings 
with 
individual NGOs 
operating 
in 
the proposed 
Project 
areas. 
Further 
consultation 
is 
planned, 
particularly to 
identify 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
NGOs 
can 
contribute 
to 
capacity 
building 
in 
the 
form 
of 
hosting 
persons 
from 
the 
Project 
staff 
and 
government 
support 
services 
to 
learn 
first-hand 
about 
the 
development approach 
of 
the 
NGOs, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
facilitating training 
courses 
and 
mentoring. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
Project 
institutional 
arrangements 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
several 
preparation 
studies. 
Project-supported 
empowerment 
of 
communities 
is 
expected 
to lead to 
a 
new 
dynamic 
in 
the 
relationship 
between 
communities 
and 
government administrations 
at 
kebele 
level 
(where 
community 
leaders 
are 
represented 
in 
many 
locations), 
wereda 
and 
Regional 
levels. 
The 
community 
empowerment 
process 
will 
also enable 
women 
and 
other disadvantaged groups 
to 
express 
their 
needs 
and 
be 
involved 
in 
planning, 
implementing, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
local 
development 
activities. 
A 
participatory 
approach 
to 
research, 
development 
and dissemination 
of 
innovations 
will 
enable 
communities 
to 
choose 
and 
adapt 
labour-saving, resource-conserving 
and 
income-generating technologies that 
suit 
their 
needs 
and 
circumstances. 
These 
institutional 
arrangements 
were elaborated 
by 
communities 
and 
Government 
during 
an 
iterative 
process 
of 
developing 
the 
PIM 
and 
were 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Project 
appraisal mission.

How will 
the project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
A 
IFAD-funded 
socio-economic 
and 
production 
systems 
study, 
a 
forthcoming AfDB-financed 
study 
of 
pastoralism 
in 
Ethiopia 
and 
a 
review 
of 
existing 
baseline 
studies 
will 
establish 
baseline 
social conditions 
in 
the 
Project 
areas.

Participatory 
M&E 
system

be 
established together 
with 
the 
beneficiaries 
will 
allow 
them 
to 
measure 
Project 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes. 
This 
system 
will 
use 
simple 
social 
and economic indicators 
to monitor 
natural 
resource 
utilisation, livestock 
and 
crop 
production, social 
impacts 
and 
equity, 
power 
and 
leadership, 
environmental 
impact, market 
information 
and 
other 
changes 
that 
the 
pastoralists 
may 
define 
as 
being 
of 
concern 
to 
them. 
This 
will 
enable 
male 
and 
female 
members 
of pastoral communities 
to 
measure 
the progress 
they 
are 
making 
towards 
planned 
objectives and 
outputs. 
7. 
Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
Environmental 
assessment: 
An 
Environmental 
Assessment 
and 
Management 
Framework 
was 
camed 
out, 
as 
described 
above, 
and 
provisions 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
are 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
1 
1. 
Natural 
habitats: 
Pastoral 
areas 
encompass some 
natural 
habitats 
which 
are 
protected 
by 
law, 
such 
as 
the 
Awash 
and 
Yangudi 
Rasa 
National 
Parks 
(Afar), 
Yabello 
Wildlife 
Sanctuary 
(Borana), 
and 
the 
Babille 
Wildlife 
Sanctuary (Somali). 
It 
is 
conceivable that the 
Project 
may 
operate 
in 
weredus 
that 
include 
or 
border 
upon 
these 
areas, 
or 
other 
areas 
that 
qualify 
as 
natural 
habitats 
under 
OP 
4.36. 
As 
a 
contingency, the 
EAMF 
has 
provided 
measures 
in 
the 
screening 
process 
to 
identify 
the 
potential 
for 
impacts 
on 
natural 
habitats. 
During 
early Project 
implementation, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
establish, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency, 
an 
working definition 
to 
identify 
natural 
habitats 
and 
thus 
ensure 
that 
the 
Project 
interventions 
will 
not 
impact 
them 
negatively 
Forestiy: 
Forests 
are 
not 
a 
common 
feature 
of 
lowland 
areas. 
As 
a contingency, 
the 
EAMF 
has 
provided 
measures 
in 
the 
screening process 
to 
identify 
the 
potential 
for 
impacts 
on 
forests 
(for 
example, 
the 
use 
of 
bush 
for 
charcoal 
or 
fuelwood) 
which would 
require 
a 
formal 
environmental 
review. 
Therefore 
this 
safeguard 
policy 
is 
not 
triggered. 
Pest management: 
Promotion 
of 
rainfed 
andor 
irrigated 
farming, where feasible 
and profitable, 
is 
part 
of 
promoting 
sustainable 
livelihoods, 
and 
may 
indirectly 
involve 
use 
of 
pesticides. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
conceivable 
that 
Project 
funds 
would 
be 
used 
for 
animal 
pesticides 
directly or indirectly 
(such 
as 
- 
35 
- 
Page  42
construction 
of 
livestock 
dips). 
Again, 
the 
EAMF 
has 
provided 
measures 
in 
the 
screening process 
to 
identify 
the 
potential 
for 
impacts 
and, 
if 
triggered, 
then 
an 
Integrated 
Pest 
Management 
Plan 
will 
be 
required 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank‘s 
policy. 
Culturalproperty: 
Unlike 
many 
areas 
in 
the the highlands, there 
are 
few 
areas 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
that 
consitute 
cultural property 
in 
the 
sense 
described 
in 
OP 
1 
1.03. 
Where 
they 
might 
occur, 
micro-projects 
would 
be 
unlikely 
to involve 
excavation 
or 
inundation. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Project 
activities 
will 
be 
carried out 
only 
in 
areas 
selected 
by 
the 
local 
citizens 
in 
the pastoral 
zones, 
who 
would 
give 
great 
importance 
to 
safeguarding 
their 
cultural 
property. 
Therefore, 
this 
safeguard 
policy 
is 
highly 
unlikely 
to 
be 
applicable. 
Indigenouspeoples: 
As 
an 
integrated 
set 
of 
Regional 
projects, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
and 
with 
the 
pastoral 
peoples 
that 
form 
the 
dominant society 
in 
the respective 
Project 
areas. 
They 
will 
be 
the 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
Project 
investment. Therefore, 
they 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
“indigenous 
peoples” 
in 
terms 
of 
OD 
4.20, 
i.e. 
social 
groups 
distinct 
from 
the 
dominant society that 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
being 
disadvantaged 
by 
the 
Project. Therefore, 
this 
safeguard 
policy 
is 
not 
applicable. 
Involuntary 
resettlement: 
The 
Project 
will 
not 
be 
causing 
or promoting involuntary 
resettlement. 
As 
a 
demand-driven 
project, 
decisions about 
movement 
or 
settlement 
will 
be 
made 
by 
the pastoral 
groups 
themselves, 
either 
as 
a 
normal 
part 
of 
the 
dynamics 
of 
pastoral 
households 
or 
as 
a 
decision 
of 
the 
clan or 
subclan 
in 
the 
process 
of 
their 
own 
development 
planning. 
Furthermore, 
given 
the 
vast 
amounts 
of 
land 
available 
to 
pastoralists 
and 
land’s 
low 
marginal 
cost, 
any 
small 
parcels 
acquired 
through 
the 
construction 
of 
micro-projects 
(such 
as 
a school 
or 
health 
post) 
are 
unlikely 
to 
impose a 
signficant 
cost 
to 
a pastoral community. 
Therefore, 
this 
safeguard 
policy 
is 
not 
applicable. 
Safety 
of 
dams: 
This 
Project 
will 
not 
finance 
large investments 
aimed 
at 
dam 
construction 
and 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
safeguard 
policy. 
Projects 
in 
international 
waters: 
This 
principle 
applies 
specifically 
to 
irrigation 
with 
water 
use 
from 
international 
waterways 
or 
which 
risks 
polluting 
them. 
The 
Project 
does 
not 
foresee extensive 
use 
of 
irrigation 
water 
or 
practices 
which would 
abstract 
significant 
amounts 
nor pollute 
water 
sources 
and 
therefore 
this 
policy 
is 
not 
triggered. 
However, 
notification 
of 
intended 
water 
use 
has 
been 
sent 
to 
Somalia and Kenya, 
in 
consideration 
of 
the 
rivers 
which 
flow 
out 
from 
Ethiopia 
to 
those countries. 
Projects 
in 
disputed 
areas: 
PCDP 
does 
not 
foresee 
any possible 
activities 
in 
disputed 
areas 
and 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
safeguard 
policy.

F. 
Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
First, 
institutional 
sustainability 
of 
the 
PCDP 
will 
depend 
primarily 
on 
capacity-building 
and 
community 
ownership. 
While 
PCDP 
development 
plans 
will 
be 
implemented 
with 
technical 
and 
financial 
assistance 
from 
some 
external 
sources, 
decisions 
on 
the 
content 
of 
such 
plans 
will 
rest 
ultimately 
with 
communities 
who 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
managing implementation. 
Once 
communities 
acquire 
the 
knowledge, 
awareness, 
and 
necessary 
skills 
to 
design 
and 
implement 
local 
development plans 
and 
micro-projects, 
sustainability 
of 
institutional 
objectives 
will 
be 
assured, 
provided 
that 
financing 
is 
available. 
It 
is 
also anticipated that 
government 
administration 
at 
all 
levels 
would 
become 
adherents 
to 
the 
participatory 
approach, 
although 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
take 
time 
and 
require 
considerable 
capacity-building 
and 
experiential 
learning. Government ownership 
of 
this 
approach, 
if 
linked 
to 
better 
vertical integration 
in 
administrative 
decision-making, 
would 
appreciably 
improve 
its 
overall 
effectiveness 
and 
sustainability. 
Second, 
fiscal 
sustainability 
will 
depend 
on 
whether 
revenues 
continue to 
flow 
through 
channels 
established 
via 
the 
PCDP. 
Financing 
for 
community 
development 
in 
Ethiopia, 
for 
the 
foreseeable future, 
will 
continue 
to 
rely 
on 
central and donor 
sources, 
since 
the 
level 
of 
poverty 
is 
such 
that 
substantial 
local 
revenue 
generation 
is 
impossible 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
communities. 
The 
PCDP's 
financing 
flows 
are 
intended 
to 
"prime 
the 
pump" 
of 
fiscal 
decentralization 
through 
weuedas. 
The 
potential 
for 
cost 
recovery 
will 
be 
exploited 
when 
possible 
to 
minimize 
dependence 
on 
intergovernmental 
transfers. 
In 
addition, 
effective early 
warning 
systems 
(EWS) 
and 
contingency 
plans 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
offset 
substantially 
the 
monetary 
costs 
of 
providing 
relief 
to 
drought-stricken 
areas. 
Third 
is 
the 
issue 
of 
environmental 
sustainability. 
The 
development 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
EWS, including 
remote-sensed 
and community-sourced 
information 
will 
significantly improve 
knowledge 
of 
the 
state 
of 
the range 
environment. 
The 
EWS 
will 
be 
linked 
to 
a 
disaster preparedness 
plans that 
will 
facilitate early 
and appropriate 
disaster 
responses, 
particularly 
de-stocking 
to 
relieve 
rangeland 
pressure. 
Integration 
of 
the 
implications 
of 
the 
ecological 
status 
of 
the 
rangeland 
into 
resource 
planning 
and 
research 
programs 
will 
provide 
range 
users 
and 
administrators 
with 
a better 
toolbox 
for 
the 
sustainable management 
of 
Ethiopia's 
range 
resources. 
The project 
will 
also 
develop 
environmentally 
safe 
and 
sustainable strategies 
for 
managing 
bush 
encroachment 
and 
reducing noxious 
plant 
invasion. 
Finally 
is 
the 
issue 
of 
operations 
and 
maintenance 
and 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
micro-projects. 
Capital 
investments 
will 
be 
identified 
by 
stakeholders 
and 
are 
likely 
to 
address 
high 
priority 
needs. 
While 
that 
alone 
should 
ensure 
their 
maintenance, 
this 
will 
be 
reinforced 
by 
conditions 
in 
the 
CIF 
and 
DPCF 
contracts 
committing 
communities 
to 
identify 
funding 
mechanisms 
and 
set 
aside 
funds 
for 
the 
future 
repair and 
maintenance 
of 
project financed capital 
investments. 
Technical innovation, 
both 
existing 
and 
anticipated 
under 
the 
participatory 
research 
and extension 
program 
will 
be 
relevant, 
low 
cost 
and, 
to 
the 
extent possible, dependent 
on 
locally 
available 
resources 
and 
skills. 
In 
sharp contrast 
to 
past 
livestock 
and rangeland focused 
investments, 
the 
PCDP 
will 
take 
a 
holistic 
approach 
to 
pastoral 
area 
development, 
including 
education and 
health 
services, 
dryland 
cropping, 
income diversification, 
risk 
identification 
and 
mitigation 
and 
disaster 
early 
warning 
and 
preparedness. 
This 
approach, 
underpinned 
by 
community 
participation, 
is 
expected 
to improve 
the 
financial 
and 
social 
impact 
of 
the 
investment 
and 
to 
appreciably 
enhance 
its 
sustainability.

Critical 
Risks 
(reflecting 
the 
failure 
of 
critical 
assumptions 
found 
in 
the 
fourth column 
of 
Annex 
1): 
Risk 
is 
inherent 
to 
any 
project 
implemented 
in 
remote 
arid 
and 
semi-arid 
regions. 
That 
risk 
is 
heightened 
in 
Ethiopia 
by 
the 
relatively poor 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
pastoral 
zones 
and 
by 
periodic 
insecurity. 
However, 
these 
risks 
have, 
in 
most 
instances, 
been managed 
and 
mitigated 
in 
past 
interventions 
in 
the 
pastoral 
zones. 
The 
PCDP's 
community-based 
development approach 
is 
expected 
to 
further 
mitigate 
risk 
by 
focussing 
on 
appropriate, 
demand-driven 
project 
interventions, 
largely owned 
and 
managed 
by 
communities. 
Key

and

the 
need 
to 
capitalize 
on 
NGO 
experience. 
In 
addition, 
supplemental 
funding 
to 
support 
NGOs 
has 
been 
sought. 
PCDP 
will 
work 
carehlly 
with 
government and 
communities 
to

expresses 
commitment

Detailed Project Description 
ETHIOPIA: Pastoral Community Development Project 
By 
Component: 
Project Component 
1 
- 
US$36.52 
million 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
The 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
Component 
will 
support 
decentralization 
by 
empowering 
weredas 
and 
rural 
communities, 
whereby 
Project 
beneficiaries 
are 
able 
to 
take charge 
of 
rural 
development 
in 
lowland 
pastoral 
areas. 
This 
component 
will 
initiate 
and 
strengthen 
a decentralized 
and 
participatory 
development 
process 
at 
the 
community 
and 
wereda 
levels, 
linked 
to 
the 
Regional 
Government 
framework. 
This 
will 
enable 
pastoral 
men 
and 
women 
to 
identify, 
design 
and 
implement 
community 
driven 
development 
(CDD) 
investments 
at 
multiple 
levels 
according 
to 
demand. 
Three 
subcomponents 
have 
been 
identified: 
(i) 
Capacity 
Building 
for 
Community 
Empowerment; 
(ii) 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund, 
and 
(iii) 
Support Services. 
(a) 
Capacity 
Building 
for 
Community 
Empowerment 
Capacity-building 
at 
the 
community 
and 
wereda 
levels 
will 
create 
the 
enabling 
environment 
for 
the 
introduction 
and 
promotion 
of 
participatory 
planning 
procedures, such 
that communities 
are 
able 
to 
identify, 
prioritize, 
design, 
implement 
and 
manage 
their 
own 
development. 
This 
will 
involve 
skills 
training 
in 
key 
areas 
such 
as 
basic 
literacy 
and 
numeracy, 
primary 
education, 
primary 
health, 
hygiene and 
sanitation, 
conflict 
resolution 
and 
management, 
natural 
resource management, 
environmental 
screening, 
and investment 
management. 
Needs 
assessment 
methods 
including 
participatory learning and action 
(PLA) 
tools, 
consensus-building 
techniques and 
constraint 
analyses 
will 
be 
used 
to 
formulate community 
investment 
plans, 
which 
will 
be 
amalgamated 
into 
wereda 
Development 
Plans. 
NGOs, 
Regional 
government 
officers 
and 
PCDP staff 
will 
be 
central 
to 
the 
delivery 
of 
this 
sub-component 
by 
providing 
training to 
beneficiaries. 
An 
initial 
capacity 
building 
process 
using 
PLA 
tools 
will 
facilitate 
dialogue between 
community 
groups 
and 
local 
government 
technical 
services 
in 
order 
to 
promote participatory interaction and 
consensus 
building 
and 
to train 
communities and 
government 
personnel 
in 
basic 
analysis 
and 
planning 
techniques. 
Individual 
communities 
will 
use 
simple 
micro-project application forms 
that make 
clear 
their 
objectives, 
proposed 
activities 
and 
budgets. These 
will 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
environmental implications 
of 
all 
activities. 
A 
micro-project 
will 
take the 
form 
of 
any 
activity 
that the 
community 
regards 
as 
a 
priority 
and 
will 
incorporate a 
15 
percent 
contribution 
of 
their 
own 
resources 
in 
cash 
or 
kind 
to 
ensure 
ownership 
of 
the 
process 
and 
the outcome. 
Communities 
will 
be 
able 
to directly 
implement 
their 
micro-projects 
themselves 
or 
will 
collaborate 
with 
a government 
department, 
an 
NGO 
or 
both, 
according 
to 
a 
written 
memorandum 
of 
understanding. 
Individual 
and 
joint 
community 
investment

(CIF) 
subprojects 
(see 
(B) 
below) 
will 
be 
appraised 
by 
communities to 
Wereda 
Development Committees 
(WDCs) 
made 
up 
of 
relevant 
line 
departments 
(typically: 
agriculture, 
water, health, 
education and 
cooperatives), 
representatives 
of 
local 
communities, 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
operating 
in 
the 
wereda. 
Procedures 
for 
assessing 
and 
approving 
each 
community 
sub-project 
and 
for 
disbursing 
funds 
and 
monitoring 
progress 
and 
quality 
are 
described 
in 
the 
Project Implementation 
Manual 
(PIM). 
Capacity-building 
will 
be delivered through 
the 
Project's 
institutional 
structure. 
The 
Regions 
have 
already established 
Pastoral Development 
Offices, 
which 
will 
manage 
Project-financed Regional Project 
-44- 
Page  51
Coordination 
Units 
(RPCUs). 
The 
role 
of 
the 
RPCU 
is 
to 
manage 
the 
Project 
at 
the 
Regional 
level 
including 
fund 
flows, 
reporting, 
monitoring 
and 
liaison 
with 
relevant 
Bureaus 
and 
with 
the 
Federal 
level 
FPCU. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
be 
the 
focal 
point for initiating 
the 
capacity-building 
process 
and 
will 
liaise 
with 
and 
contribute to 
the 
DPPB 
and 
emerging 
Regional 
risk 
management 
network. 
This 
will 
include 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
the 
community-based 
early 
warning 
system 
and 
the 
development 
and 
coordination 
of 
wereda 
level 
data 
collection, 
collation 
and 
interpretation activities and 
their 
links 
to 
the 
Region 
wide 
system. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
also 
facilitate communication 
between 
the 
community 
group 
level 
and the 
Regional 
level, 
identify 
staff 
skill 
gaps 
and coordinate specialized 
training 
in 
these 
areas (e.g. 
gender, 
conflict, 
environment). 
Each 
RPCU 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
a 
Regional 
Project Coordinator; 
an 
Environmental/ 
Training 
specialist; 
a 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
specialist,  an Accountant, 
and 
a

officer, 
together 
with 
appropriate support 
staff including 
1 
accounts 
assistant, 
2 
secretaries, 
and 
2 
dnvers. 
Given 
the distance 
between RPCUs 
and 
the 
large 
population 
they 
must 
serve, 
they 
will 
in 
turn 
manage 
one

The 
role 
of 
the 
MSTs 
will 
be: 
to provide

and 
training to 
the 
staff 
of 
selected 
weredas 
and

and, 
as 
such, 
will, 
in

(MOTS), 
engage 
in

and 
seek 
to understand the

their 
problems 
and

to 
explain 
the 
purpose 
and 
procedures 
of 
the 
Project and 
jointly 
develop 
action 
plans, 
priority

and 
explain 
the procedures 
of 
requesting 
CLF

committees 
to 
develop

and the 
mechanisms 
for 
requesting 
the 
wereda 
to 
disburse

to 
the Communities, and 
to 
assist 
communities and 
weredas 
to 
develop 
a 
community-based

The 
Mobile

Teams 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
three 
"core" 
members 
including 
a 
Team 
Leader, a 
training 
officer 
and 
a 
gendedsmall 
business

officer 
and appropriate 
support 
staff including 
a camp manager and a

The 
team 
members 
will 
have 
relevant 
technical qualifications 
(veterinary,  range, education, water 
and/or health), 
but 
will 
be 
primarily 
experienced communicators. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
be 
recruited 
and 
established 
in 
each 
RPCU 
Office. 
RPCU 
management 
will 
then 
be 
involved 
in 
recruiting 
the 
MST 
staff. 
The 
combined 
units 
will, 
together 
with 
heads 
of 
Bureaus 
at 
the 
Regional level, 
undergo 
orientation 
and 
debate 
as 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the Project, 
its 
principles 
and 
methods 
of 
working, 
including 
the 
need 
for 
close 
collaboration 
between 
key 
Bureaus 
and 
other 
Regional 
Institutions. 
The 
MSTs 
will 
undergo 
intense 
training 
together 
with 
Heads 
of 
the Pastoral Development 
Departments 
at 
wereda 
level 
from 
the 
targeted 
weredas. 
This 
will 
take 
the 
form 
of 
a 
3-phase 
Training 
of 
Trainers 
program 
spread 
over 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
Project and 
led 
by 
experienced 
facilitators. 
The 
three 
phases 
combined 
will 
cover, 
inter 
alia, 
group 
dynamics, 
leadership 
styles, 
PLA 
Tools, 
Log 
Frame tools, 
CAP 
planning, 
community and inter-community 
sub-project 
proposal 
writing, 
environmental 
screening,

risk 
management 
systems, 
weredu 
sub-project 
approval 
criteria 
and 
financial 
and 
administrative 
procedures. 
A 
consortium 
of 
Ethiopian Training 
Organizations 
combining 
both 
Government and 
NGO 
expertise 
will 
lead 
the 
training 
process. 
They 
will 
be 
initially 
contracted 
to review 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PCDP, 
to 
analyze 
the 
training 
needs 
and 
to 
design 
the 
training 
package. 
Each 
TOT 
session 
will 
last 
5-10 
days 
and 
will 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
Training 
of 
Community 
Leaders 
(TCL) 
course 
in 
the 
selected 
weredus 
led 
by 
the 
new 
trainers 
at 
the 
weredu 
level. 
A 
TCL 
training 
course 
is 
parallel 
in 
content 
to 
the 
TOT 
course, 
but 
introduces the 
Project 
and 
all 
its 
details 
to 
the 
kebele 
staff 
and 
community 
leaders. 
It 
thus 
provides 
experience 
for 
the 
TOT'S 
and 
new 
knowledge 
for 
the 
TCL's. Part 
of 
the 
TCL 
training 
will 
be 
carried out 
in 
the 
field 
and 
include direct 
contact 
with 
communities 
using 
the 
MST 
system, 
the 
identification 
of 
sub-project proposals 
and 
their 
submission 
to 
the 
weredu 
Development 
Office 
(WDO) 
for 
appraisal 
and 
recommendation 
to 
the 
wereda 
government 
for 
funding. 
Once 
a sub-project 
has 
been 
approved 
the 
weredu 
will 
be 
requested 
to 
release resources 
(cash, 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
- 
trainers, 
contractors) 
to 
the 
community 
concerned 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
Thus 
training 
in 
procedures 
and 
practice 
will 
be 
immediate, 
but 
small 
and 
focussed 
to 
allow 
stakeholders 
to 
become accustomed 
to 
the 
approach 
and 
its 
methods. 
This 
will 
also 
allow 
fine-tuning 
of 
the 
approach 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
the 
inevitable 
operational 
difficulties 
of 
doing 
something new. 
The 
MSTs 
will 
initially 
focus 
in 
one 
weredu. 
They 
will 
approach 
a 
particular 
community 
unit 
and 
request 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
camp 
in 
the 
area. 
Most 
community 
units 
(both 
encampments and 
herding 
units) 
usually 
come together 
in 
the 
evening's 
to 
discuss the 
days 
events 
and 
to 
pursue 
debates 
that 
have 
been 
ongoing 
for 
some 
time 
and 
to 
make 
decisions. 
A 
major 
topic 
will 
surround the 
coming 
of 
the 
MST, 
where 
these 
people 
came 
from, what 
they 
want 
and 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
are 
a 
threat. 
This 
will 
require 
discussion 
with 
the 
strangers 
and 
is 
the 
opportunity 
for 
the 
MST 
to 
engage 
in 
discussion 
and 
make 
it 
clear 
they 
are 
there 
as 
friends. 
Other more 
substantive 
debates 
will 
follow 
over 
time. 
A 
MST 
will 
circulate through 
several 
camps 
in 
the 
same 
local 
area 
over a six-week 
period 
then 
will 
take 
a 
two-week break (six 
weeks 
on 
two 
weeks 
out). 
They 
will 
then 
move 
to 
a 
different 
local 
area 
(another 
kebele 
) 
and 
repeat 
the 
process and 
then 
a 
third 
local 
area (a 
third 
kebele). 
Following 
the 
third 
kebele 
cycle 
they 
will 
return 
to 
the 
original 
(first 
kebele) 
community 
units 
to follow 
up 
on 
work 
done 
earlier. 
During 
this 
systematic movement, 
weredu 
and 
kebele 
technicians 
will join 
and 
leave 
the 
MST 
according 
to 
skill 
needs 
and 
physical 
location. 
During 
the 
wider 
cycle 
(between 
weredus 
A-B-C) micro-projects 
will 
be 
identified, 
processed 
and 
implemented, 
testing 
the 
administrative 
procedures 
and capacity 
to 
deliver. 
Over 
time, 
government 
technicians 
at 
weredu 
level 
and 
trained 
community 
leaders 
will 
come 
to 
understand 
the 
system 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
can 
involve 
other 
communities 
remotely 
from 
the 
MST 
and 
this 
will 
allow 
the 
MST 
to 
move 
on 
to 
other 
groups 
in 
the 
same 
three 
kebeles 
and 
ultimately 
to 
move to 
another 
weredu. 
@) 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF) 
is 
to 
make available 
rapid 
sources 
of 
counterpart 
funding 
to 
enable 
quick 
implementation 
of 
communityhnter-community 
prepared 
and 
WDC 
appraised 
subprojects 
according 
to 
agreed and tested 
criteria 
and procedures. 
During 
the start 
up 
phase, 
the 
priority 
issues 
will 
be 
to 
put 
in 
place 
an effective and 
acceptable 
fund 
delivery 
system 
that can cope 
with 
rapidly 
expanding 
demand 
from 
communities 
as 
awareness 
of 
the 
Project 
and 
improved planning 
and 
implementing 
skills 
of 
both 
communities 
and 
local 
government 
staff 
increase. 
While 
this 
is 
taking 
place, 
the 
Regions and 
weredus 
will 
need 
to 
design and 
test 
models 
of 
fund 
transfer 
to 
communities through 
approving 
the 
first 
subprojects 
and 
testing 
and 
improving 
methods 
of 
transfer, 
monitoring 
and 
accounting. 
This 
will 
require 
considerable 
support and backstopping 
from 
Regional and 
Federal 
Authorities 
to 
establish sound 
management 
systems 
so 
that 
expanded 
flows 
in 
the 
future 
will 
not 
be 
unnecessarily delayed.

Weveda 
Development Committees 
(WDCs) 
comprised 
of 
representatives 
from 
local 
administration, 
community 
interest 
groups, 
NGOs 
the 
private 
sector, 
will 
review 
community 
and 
inter-community 
development 
plans 
and recommend 
capital 
investments considered 
eligible 
for 
project 
financing. 
These 
investments 
will 
be 
prioritized 
and 
assessed 
against transparent 
criteria 
including 
nature and 
type, 
environmental 
screening 
and scoping 
guidelines 
(including 
mitigation 
of 
environmental 
impacts), 
future 
sustainability 
prospects, 
etc. 
prior 
to 
acceptance 
for 
financing 
from 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund. 
A 
15 
percent 
community 
cash 
contribution 
will 
be 
required 
to 
guarantee 
self-help, 
promote 
vested 
by 
communities and 
full 
beneficiary 
participation 
and 
accountability, thereby 
ensuring 
the 
needs 
of 
pastoralists 
are 
met. 
Beneficiary 
contributions 
will 
be 
levied 
on 
an 
increasing 
sliding 
scale 
- 
the 
initial 
investment 
being 
struck at 
15%, 
the second 
and 
third 
at 
40%. 
The 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
financing 
under 
the 
CIF 
will 
be kept 
as 
broad 
as 
possible 
to 
respect 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
poor. 
It 
may 
include 
investment 
in 
social infrastructure, 
such 
as 
revolving 
drug 
funds; 
community 
health 
workers, and 
community 
drug 
shops; 
TBA's 
and 
kits; 
a 
mobile 
school, 
a 
static 
school 
or 
hostel 
or 
part 
of 
one; 
a 
static 
health 
clinic or 
part 
of 
one; 
a 
domestic water 
point or 
part 
of 
one; 
small 
enterprise 
groups 
with 
revolving loan 
funds. 
It 
may involve 
funds 
for 
building 
capacity 
in 
government technical 
extension 
services 
and communities and includes 
exposure 
to 
both 
community 
and external technical 
innovation 
and 
practice. 
Through planning 
carried out 
in 
the 
second component, 
it 
may 
include 
measures 
for 
disaster 
preparedness, 
mitigation 
or 
recovery: 
such 
as 
drought 
grazing 
reserves; 
grazing 
rehabilitation; 
catchment 
protection or 
rehabilitation; livestock watering 
points; 
animal health 
posts; 
animal health 
certification 
posts; 
market 
centers 
and 
mobile 
irrigation 
schemes. 
Finally, 
it 
may 
include 
emergency response 
measures, 
such 
as 
vaccinations 
for 
humans 
and livestock; 
boosting 
revolving 
drug 
funds 
for 
humans 
and 
animals; 
rapid 
malnutrition monitoring 
in 
known 
severe 
situations; water 
tankering; 
fodder trucking; 
etc. 
While 
adhering 
to 
the 
demand-driven 
principle 
for 
access 
to 
the 
CIF, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
for 
the 
project 
staff to 
be trained 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
so 
that 
they 
can adequately 
engage 
with 
communities. 
Myths 
about 
disease 
transmission 
prevail, 
and communities 
may 
be 
reluctant 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
threat and 
discuss 
mitigation 
strategies 
for 
reasons 
of 
denial and 
fear. Several 
new 
projects, 
including 
the 
IDA-funding 
AIDS 
project, 
are 
already 
established 
to 
address 
the 
growing 
threat 
and 
may 
be 
contacted 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
PCDP. 
In 
addition, 
these 
projects 
may 
find 
it 
useful 
to 
capitalize 
on 
the 
PCDP's presence 
at 
the 
community 
level 
to 
get 
their 
message 
and 
resources out. 
For 
community 
units 
that 
are 
the 
size 
of 
a 
veer 
among 
the 
Somali, 
a 
ganta 
among 
the 
Afar, an 
olla 
among 
the 
Borana 
or 
a 
similar 
unit 
among 
each 
ethnic group 
in 
South 
Om0 
(units 
that 
are assumed, 
for 
budget 
planning 
purposes, 
to 
include 
about 
100 
persons), 
the 
amount 
of 
funds 
available 
per 
micro-project 
from 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF) 
will 
be 
up 
to 
about 
US$600, 
not 
counting 
the community's 
own 
contribution 
to 
project 
costs. 
For 
social 
units 
as 
large 
as 
a 
Tuulo, 
Kido, 
or 
Dedha 
(assumed 
to 
be 
up 
to 
up 
to 
500 
households), 
up 
to US$l5,000 
will 
be 
available. Several Dedhas 
or 
equivalent social 
units 
could 
negotiate 
plans 
for 
a 
project serving 
a 
still 
larger 
number 
of 
families 
and 
will 
have 
access 
to 
a 
correspondingly larger amount 
of 
funds. 
Community 
subprojects 
recommended 
by 
the 
WDC will 
be 
approved 
for 
funding 
by 
the 
wereda 
govemment. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
make available 
up 
to 
US$4,000,000 
of 
CIF 
resources 
for 
inter-community 
subprojects. 
These 
will 
be 
capped 
at 
US$75,000 
and 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
larger social 
infrastructure 
that 
cannot 
be 
afforded 
by 
individual 
or 
small 
groups 
of 
communities. 
Inter-community 
subprojects 
will 
be

Page  54
identified 
by 
male 
and female 
community 
leaders 
when 
they 
meet 
periodically 
at 
the 
wereda 
level to 
monitor 
and 
appraise 
Project activities 
and 
will 
require 
the 
same 
15 
percent 
community contribution 
as 
the 
smaller 
community 
level 
subprojects. 
MSTs 
and 
MOTS 
will 
assist 
participating 
communities to 
prepare 
inter-community 
subprojects 
for 
appraisal 
by 
WDCs. Inter-community 
subprojects recommended 
for 
funding 
by 
the 
WDC 
will 
be 
approved 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Council 
during 
its 
annual 
meeting. 
The 
decision-making 
process 
for 
clearance 
of 
sub-project investments 
will 
be 
as 
follows. 
When 
communities 
have 
designed 
their 
individual or 
inter-community 
subprojects, 
they 
will 
go 
with 
them 
to 
the 
wereda 
center 
they 
consider 
being 
their 
wereda 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
project 
and 
submit 
the proposal 
for 
consideration 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committees. 
The 
wereda 
's 
principal 
tasks 
vis 
a 
vis 
the 
Project 
are 
to 
plan 
the 
strategic development 
of 
the 
wereda, 
to monitor 
levels 
of 
risk 
and 
to 
approve 
CIF 
Projects 
submitted 
by 
communities, 
initially from 
the 
CIF, 
but 
ultimately 
from 
regular 
government 
funds. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
CIF, 
WDC's 
will 
review 
the 
basic 
sub-project 
criteria 
given 
in 
section 
7 
and adopt 
their 
own 
criteria 
for 
recommending projects 
for 
funding. 
They 
will 
also 
establish the 
mechanisms 
by 
which 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
to communities throughout 
the 
Project 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
RPCU 
and 
the 
Regional Bureau 
of 
Finance. 
Weredas 
that 
demonstrate 
their 
capacity 
to 
support communities 
will 
attract 
higher 
levels 
of 
funding. 
Those 
that 
demonstrate 
poor 
interaction 
with 
communities and 
poor 
levels 
of 
implementation 
will 
attract 
lower 
levels 
of 
support. 
Details 
of 
the procedures 
and 
criteria 
for 
CIF 
use 
appear 
in 
the 
PIM. 
(c) Support Services 
While 
the 
GoE 
has 
developed a 
strategy 
for 
support service 
delivery to 
pastoral communities, 
the 
PCDP 
at 
wereda, 
kebele 
and 
community 
levels 
will 
inter 
alia, 
operationalize 
the 
Participatory 
Pastoral 
Extension 
System 
by 
financing 
strategic investments 
and 
establish decentralized and 
participatory 
planning 
procedures, 
operating 
within 
the 
government structure. 
Local 
government 
service cadre 
covering 
social, economic 
and 
environmental 
sectors 
and 
in 
the 
arena 
of 
conflict 
resolution 
will 
be 
deployed, 
trained 
and 
sufficiently 
resourced 
to 
ensure 
availability 
and 
accessibility 
to 
rural 
communities 
by: 
providing 
technical 
input 
for 
development 
planning; 
responding 
to 
community planned 
interventions 
under 
the 
CIF; 
taking 
a pro-active 
role 
in 
human 
health, 
hygiene 
and 
HrVIAids 
awareness 
and 
household 
sanitation; 
providing 
basic 
literacy 
and 
numeracy 
training 
and 
primary 
education; 
identifying 
opportunities 
for 
diversification; 
introducing, 
testing 
and 
promoting, through participatory 
programs, 
options 
and 
appropriate 
technologies 
for 
risk 
minimization 
in 
rainfed 
crop production; 
generating 
crop 
packages 
for 
micro-scale 
irrigation; 
providing 
technical 
backstopping 
for 
management 
and 
sustainability 
of 
CIF 
investments; and 
contracting mediators 
for 
conflict 
resolution 
and management. 
PCDP 
financing 
will 
provide 
for 
(i) 
a 
framework 
and 
platform 
within 
which 
competing 
ethnic 
groups 
are 
able 
to harmonize 
access 
to 
resources; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
district 
planning 
capabilities, 
technical 
capacity 
and 
extension outreach; 
(iii) 
the 
delivery 
of 
field 
level 
economic 
and 
social 
services; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
provision 
of 
community 
primary 
education, 
first 
aid 
and 
health 
awareness, 
primary 
animal 
heath 
care 
and 
farmer 
crop 
production 
knowledge 
and 
skills. 
Farmer managed 
action 
research 
programs coordinated 
by 
and 
in 
support 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
programs 
will 
be 
funded. 
Intervention delivery 
is 
sequenced 
and 
phased 
to 
the 
CDD 
approach.

Pastoral 
Development 
Office 
(PDO). 
The 
PDO 
is 
the 
generic 
term 
used 
for 
the 
wereda 
office 
that 
provides 
the 
support 
services. 
The 
actual 
name 
of 
the 
office 
changes 
from 
region to 
region. 
In 
support 
of 
decentralization, 
technical 
services 
are 
being 
redeployment 
from 
zones 
and 
regional 
levels 
for 
wereda 
capacity 
building. 
Additional staff 
will 
be 
drafted 
from 
ongoing 
education and 
training 
programs 
as 
they 
become 
available. 
Given 
that 
few 
weredas 
have 
facilities 
to 
accommodate 
restructuring, 
staff 
transfers 
are 
unlikely 
before 
basic 
facilities 
are 
in 
place. 
PCDP 
support 
to 
local 
government 
will 
involve 
strategic investments 
in 
PDOs 
to 
support capacity 
building 
for 
planning 
and 
service 
delivery 
(generated 
from 
community 
expressed 
needdemand) 
following 
CIF 
investments. 
Capital works covering 
essential 
infrastructure, extension 
equipment 
and 
material, 
transport and 
training 
will 
be 
financed, 
ensuring 
accessibility 
and 
accelerated transfer 
of 
core 
specialist 
staff tailored to 
meet 
local 
needs. 
This 
will 
include 
expertise

Research Support. 
The

will 
support targeted research 
into 
rainfed 
and 
irrigated

livestock production 
as 
well 
as 
investigations 
into 
non-agricultural 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
pastoral 
Communities. 
In 
the 
past, 
few 
resources have 
been 
directed 
to livelihoods 
of 
communities 
of 
the 
lowland 
production 
systems, 
including 
rainfed farming 
and pastoralism.

and 
the 
mandating 
of 
the 
Dryland 
Agmultural 
Research 
Directorate 
to 
implement 
the 
dryland

will 
provide 
more 
focus 
in 
the 
lowland 
research 
effort. 
Fundamental 
technological 
weaknesses 
and 
financing 
gaps, 
however, 
present 
major 
hurdles 
to 
technology 
generation. 
Pressing deficiencies 
include 
(i) 
insufficient 
resources 
to 
equip 
the 
RRCs; 
(ii) 
poorly 
targeted 
training 
of 
research 
staff; 
(iii) 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
sub-program 
selection; 
and 
(iv) 
poor 
donor 
support 
for 
defined 
sub-programs. 
Given 
that 
rainfed farming 
systems 
and crop 
packages 
appropriate 
for 
semi-arid environments 
are 
important 
to 
the 
PCDP

research 
will 
finance 
a 
Dryland

Training 
and 
Support. 
The 
Agricultural 
Research 
and 
Training 
Project 
(ARTP) 
has 
not 
addressed 
the 
lack 
of 
knowledge 
especially 
in 
reference 
to 
developing 
skills 
in 
dryland farming 
technologies 
for 
semi-arid 
environments. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
finance 
institutional 
"twinning" 
with 
an 
institution 
of 
higher 
learning 
in 
similar 
environments 
and 
production 
systems. 
This 
initiative 
will 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
relevant 
tried 
and 
tested technologies 
and 
adapt 
them to 
the 
local 
production 
systems. 
The 
Project 
will 
also support 
curricula 
development 
at 
selected 
universities 
for 
semi-arid and 
arid 
natural 
resource management, 
pastoralist 
production 
systems 
and community livelihoods. 
The 
program 
will 
also finance 
study 
tours and 
short 
courses, 
short-term 
consultancies 
and 
exchange 
visits 
related 
to 
the 
above. 
Knowledge 
Systems 
The 
knowledge 
of 
Ethiopia's 
rangelands 
and 
pastoralist livelihoods 
accumulated 
through 
development 
and 
research 
effort 
over 
the 
last 
30 
years 
is 
no 
longer 
concentrated 
in 
government 
policy, 
research and 
education institutions, 
in 
fact, 
much 
of 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
available 
in 
the 
entire 
Ethiopian 
knowledge 
system. 
A 
similar situation 
exists 
with 
dryland 
farming 
where, 
despite 
a large investment 
in 
dryland 
research 
infrastructure, 
the 
current 
shortage 
of 
expertise 
is 
severely 
constraining 
research 
and technology 
development. 
Dryland 
agriculture 
and 
pastoral 
curricula 
in 
tertiary 
institutes 
is 
also 
outdated and 
teaching 
capacity 
in 
these 
disciplines 
is 
limited. 
This 
knowledge 
gap 
severely 
constrains 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reform 
in 
pastoral 
areas, 
limiting 
pastoralist's 
options and 
choices 
in 
the process. 
The 
Project 
will 
address 
this 
issue 
by: 
reviewing 
and 
refreshing 
course content 
in 
pastoralism and 
dryland 
agriculture 
and 
livestock 
husbandry 
at 
leading tertiary 
education 
centers 
and resourcing 
its 
delivery; 
financing 
a 
medium-term 
(three 
year) 
twinning 
of 
selected research centers 
and 
universities 
with 
an 
internationally 
recognized 
agricultural 
university 
or institution 
for 
the 
development 
and delivery 
of 
in-country 
post-graduate 
training 
in 
pastoralism 
and 
dryland 
agriculture 
and 
natural 
resource 
management 
and collaborative, 
participatory 
research 
into 
pastoralism, 
dryland 
agriculture 
and 
natural 
resource management 
and 
associated 
policies; 
funding 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
in-country 
research-based 
Masterate 
training 
programs 
for 
technicians, 
scientists 
and 
policy 
makers 
in 
pastoralism, 
dryland 
agriculture 
and 
natural 
resource 
management; 
funding 
a 
biennial 
conference 
on 
pastoralism 
and pastoralist 
development 
that 
engages 
the 
concerned 
Ethiopian 
public 
services, 
the 
Ethiopian 
political 
hierarchy 
and 
domestic 
and 
international scientific 
and 
civil 
organizations 
in

rapidly. 
These 
elements 
are 
contained 
in 
three 
sub-components: 
(a) 
a 
Community-based 
Early 
Warning 
System; 
(b) 
Disaster 
Contingency 
Planning; and 
(c) 
the 
Disaster 
Preparedness and 
Contingency 
Fund. 
(a) 
Community-based 
Early 
Warning 
System 
The 
Early 
Warning 
System (EWS) 
sub-component 
includes 
a 
community-based 
early 
warning 
system 
that 
will 
build 
on 
ongoing efforts 
by 
the 
DPPC 
and 
some 
NGOs 
to 
establish, 
at the 
wereda 
level, 
systems 
for 
the 
collection 
and 
analysis 
of 
basic 
household welfare and 
natural 
resource, 
economic 
and 
conflict-related 
data, 
using 
a 
survey 
instrument 
designed 
for 
pastoral 
production 
systems. 
Using 
part-time 
data 
monitors 
at 
the 
kebeZe 
and 
community 
levels, 
weredas 
will 
be 
able 
to 
compile 
and 
analyze 
trends 
in 
household, 
and environmental, economic 
and 
social conditions 
in 
discrete 
areas. 
This 
information 
will 
be 
collected 
and 
collated 
by 
the 
wereda 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Prevention 
Desk 
(DPPD) 
officer 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
wereda 
early warning report 
and 
passed, 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis, 
to 
both 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committee 
and 
upwards 
to 
the 
Zonal 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Prevention 
Office 
(DPPO) 
for 
compilation 
and 
review 
on 
a 
zonal 
basis. 
These 
reports 
will 
initially 
be 
prepared quarterly, 
but 
may 
be 
increased 
to 
monthly 
if 
conditions 
warrant. The DPPBs 
(the 
Regional 
bureaus 
of 
the 
DPPC) 
will 
then 
receive 
these 
reports, 
which 
will 
assist 
in 
planning 
and, 
ultimately, 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
better 
system 
of 
targeting 
of 
early 
reaction 
to 
declines 
in 
the 
welfare 
of 
pastoralist 
communities, 
their 
livestock 
and 
their 
environment. 
The 
component 
will 
begin 
in 
year 
one 
in 
the 
focus 
Project 
weredas, 
but 
as 
the 
early 
warning 
system 
should be 
Region wide 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
it 
will 
scale 
up 
to 
most, 
if 
not 
all, pastoral 
weredas 
in 
the 
four 
Regions. 
The 
household 
welfare 
and 
natural 
resource data 
monitoring 
will 
be 
supported 
at 
zonal 
and regional 
levels 
through 
improved 
access 
to 
normalized differentiated 
vegetation 
index 
(NDVI) 
information 
and other remote 
sensed 
data 
and 
training 
in 
its 
interpretation. 
The 
Project 
will 
finance 
international 
technical 
assistance 
to 
support 
the 
design 
of 
the 
EWS 
and 
train 
federal and 
regional 
staff 
in 
its 
use. 
The 
Project 
will 
also support 
the 
employment 
of 
12 
part-time 
household 
monitors 
at 
each 
wereda, 
phased 
in 
over 
the 
Project, 
a 
food 
security 
analyst 
for 
each 
participating 
DPPO from project 
Year 
1 
to 
coordinate 
the 
development 
of 
household 
food 
security 
monitoring 
systems 
and 
two 
regional 
food 
security 
analysts 
in 
each 
of 
the 4 
Project DPPBs 
form 
project 
Year 
2 
onwards. 
Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Prevention 
Desk 
(DPPD) 
staff 
in 
participating 
weredas 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
motorcycle to 
track 
field 
monitors. Participating 
DPPB 
Regional offices 
will 
each 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
4WD 
double 
cabin 
pickup 
to 
support 
community 
monitoring 
and 
disaster 
contingency 
planning. 
Wereda, 
zonal 
and 
regional 
disaster preparedness 
and prevention offices 
will 
also 
be 
equipped 
with 
computing 
and 
office 
equipment and 
provided office 
and 
field 
operating 
expenses 
related 
to 
managing 
the 
EWS. Project 
resources 
are 
also 
provided 
for 
training 
programs 
in 
EWS 
management. 
Early 
warning 
reports 
will 
assign each 
wereda 
to 
one 
of 
The 
EWS 
will 
trigger 
responses 
to 
one 
of 
the 
5 
levels 
of 
disaster threat 
summarized 
below.

Page  61
Normal 
All 
the 
main 
indicators 
- 
rainfall, 
pasture 
production 
and availability, pastoral 
terms 
of 
trade, 
conflict 
- 
are 
likely 
to 
remain 
within 
normal 
ranges 
for 
the 
time 
of 
year. 
Dry 
season 
preparations 
have been 
carried out 
satisfactorily. 
Some 
indicators 
are 
outside 
their 
normal 
range 
and 
there 
are reasons 
for 
concem. 
Specific 
preparations 
are 
required locally. 
Most 
indicators 
are 
outside 
their 
normal 
range 
and 
the 
rural 
economy 
is 
under heavy 
stress. 
National 
support 
is 
required 
to 
overcome 
upcoming 
disaster 
There 
is 
widespread 
disruption and 
suffering. 
Animal 
deaths 
are 
increasing, 
and 
normal 
patterns 
of 
life 
have been 
abandoned. 
All 
the 
main 
indicators 
are 
returning 
to 
their 
normal 
ranges, 
but 
livestock 
numbers 
are 
reduced 
and 
communities 
need continuing 
support 
to 
maintain purchasing 
power and 
entitlements. 
Alert 
Alarm 
Emergency 
Recovery 
Each 
warning 
level 
will 
trigger 
appropriate 
rapid 
reactions 
to 
mitigate 
the 
threat 
to 
household 
welfare, 
prepared 
in 
advance 
as 
'shelf 
plans' 
under 
the 
disaster 
contingency 
planning 
sub-component. 
(3) 
Disaster Contingency 
Planning 
In 
this 
sub-component, 
the 
Project 
will 
invest 
in 
capacity 
building 
in 
weredu, 
zonal 
and 
Regional 
levels 
to 
prepare disaster 
contingency plans 
and 
manuals, 
monitor 
local 
disaster 
indicators, 
and manage 
funds 
made 
available 
for 
drought and other 
disaster 
response, 
primarily 
from 
other 
donors 
and 
government, 
but 
also 
with 
modest amounts made 
available 
under 
the 
Project. 
This 
should 
result 
in 
improved 
response 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
appropriate disaster 
and drought mitigation, 
management, 
and 
recovery 
activities. 
As 
this 
process 
is 
intensive 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
capacity, 
the 
Project 
will 
only 
aim 
to 
produce 
functioning 
disaster 
contingency plans 
for 
the 
initial 
focus 
weredus. 
It 
is 
expected that 
wereda 
level 
disaster 
contingency plans 
will 
include 
both 
disaster 
mitigation 
activities, 
such 
as 
small 
feeder 
roads, 
improved 
water 
management, 
fodder 
banks, 
and 
range 
improvement, 
to 
be 
implemented 
at 
any 
time, 
as 
well 
as 
rapid 
response 
activities, 
such 
as 
destocking, 
water 
tankering, response 
to 
human and 
animal 
disease 
outbreaks 
and 
the 
like. 
Rapid 
response 
activities 
will 
be 
planned 
in 
detail 
with 
community 
participation, 
and 
held 
as 
'shelf 
plans' 
for rapid 
implementation 
when 
the 
appropriate 
warning 
stage 
is 
reached. 
Wereda 
disaster 
contingency plans 
will 
be 
reviewed 
at 
the 
zonal 
level, 
leading 
to 
recommendations 
for 
cross-weredu 
integration 
of 
DPCF 
investments 
where 
practicable. 
A 
weredu 
disaster 
contingency 
manual 
will 
be 
prepared 
as 
a focus 
for 
the 
cumulative 
experience 
in 
that 
weredu 
of 
putting 
the 
contingency 
plan into 
practice. 
The 
manual 
will 
contain 
a 
description 
of 
the 
strategy, 
the 
early 
warning 
and 
rapid 
reaction 
system 
and 
the 
drought contingency 
fund. 
The 
manual 
will 
contain 
inventories 
of 
equipment 
and 
supplies 
(such 
as 
vaccines, 
or 
tools 
for 
public 
works 
projects) 
needed 
in 
an 
emergency 
so 
no 
time 
is 
lost 
in 
ordering 
these. 
It 
will 
contain instructions 
for 
emergency cash 
for 
work 
or 
feeding 
programs. 
A 
consultant 
will 
draft 
an 
initial 
manual 
with 
help 
from 
a 
working 
group 
at 
federal 
level 
led 
by 
DPPC and 
supported 
by 
the 
Federal 
Inter-ministerial 
Board 
(FIB) 
technical 
committee. 
It 
will 
then 
be 
completed 
in 
each 
Project 
weredu. 
The 
manual 
will 
be 
updated 
regularly. 
(c) 
Disaster Preparedness and Contingency 
Fund 
(DPCF) 
Finally, 
the 
DPCF 
will 
provide 
the 
initial 
thirty 
weredus 
with 
development 
and 
rapid 
reaction 
grants 
to 
finance 
activities 
identified 
in 
their 
disaster 
contingency 
plans. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
weredu 
level 
disaster 
contingency 
plans 
will 
include 
both 
investments 
to 
better 
mitigate 
drought, such 
as 
small 
feeder 
roads, 
improved 
water 
management, 
fodder 
banks, 
and 
range 
improvement, 
as 
well 
as 
funds 
set 
aside 
for 
rapid 
response, 
such 
as 
destocking, 
water 
tankering, response 
to 
human 
and 
animal 
disease 
outbreaks, 
and 
the

like. 
An 
acceptable disaster 
contingency plan, 
containing 
both mitigation 
and 
rapid 
response 
activities, 
including 
documentation 
of 
the 
participatory 
process 
and 
environmental 
assessment, 
if 
applicable, 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
for 
release 
of 
fund 
resources. 
DPCF 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
available 
during 
the 
'recovery' 
waming 
stage 
for livelihood 
rehabilitation 
activities, 
such 
as 
provision 
of 
tools 
and 
seeds, 
or 
strategic 
restocking. 
Wereda 
disaster 
contingency plans 
will 
be 
reviewed 
at 
the 
zonal level, 
leading 
to 
recommendations 
for 
cross-wereda 
integration 
of 
DPCF 
investments 
where 
practicable. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
other 
govemment 
and 
donor 
resources 
will 
be 
the 
prime 
source 
of 
funds 
for 
major 
infrastructure 
investments. 
Investments 
could 
include 
roads, 
livestock 
water 
points, 
flood 
control 
structures, 
grain 
stores 
and electronic 
communication 
systems.

Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
finance 
the 
information 
management 
system 
and Project 
liaison 
activities. 
This 
will 
comprise 
(i) 
a Management 
Information 
System; 
and 
(ii) 
a 
system 
that 
combines 
community derived 
impact 
assessment 
of 
micro-projects 
with 
a 
system 
that 
tracks 
pastoral 
livelihoods 
at the 
wereda 
and 
Regional level. 
The 
M&E 
system 
will 
provide 
timely 
feedback 
to 
program 
management 
on 
how well 
interventions 
are 
reaching 
the 
intended 
beneficiaries and 
how 
effectively 
the 
Project 
resources 
are 
being 
used, 
in 
order that 
rapid 
corrective action 
can 
be 
taken 
if 
necessary. 
The 
communication program 
includes 
development 
and dissemination 
of 
information 
concerning 
program 
activities, 
approaches 
and 
results, 
using 
a 
variety 
of 
media. 
Capacity-building: 
A 
central 
aspect 
of 
this 
Project 
will 
be 
the 
building 
of 
capacities 
for 
pastoral 
community 
development 
among 
support services 
and 
the 
pastoral communities 
themselves. 
Capacity 
is 
understood 
here 
as 
the 
ability 
of 
individuals 
and 
organizations 
in 
terms 
of 
skills, 
knowledge, 
attitudes and 
behavior 
to 
be 
able 
to 
perform 
functions 
to 
achieve 
their 
objectives. 
Capacity grows 
from 
within 
through 
a 
process 
of 
learning 
and 
change, 
building 
on 
existing 
capacities, 
but 
the 
process 
can 
be 
stimulated and 
enhanced 
through 
interventions. 
The 
entire 
pastoral 
community 
development 
(community-driven 
development) process 
involves 
capacity 
building. 
In 
addition 
to 
time-bound 
training 
events 
that 
build 
on 
each other, the process 
of 
participatory 
M&E 
will 
be 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
capacity 
building. 
The 
main 
reason 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
progress 
and 
impact 
is 
to improve 
performance. 
Through actually 
planning 
development 
activities, 
making 
use 
of 
the 
CIF 
and 
then 
reflecting 
on 
the 
process and 
outcomes, 
the 
pastoral communities 
will 
leam 
and 
enhance 
their 
self-management capacities 
and 
external 
services 
will 
learn 
how 
best 
to 
support 
the 
communities. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
central importance 
of 
participatory 
M&E 
for 
capacity 
building, 
the 
FPCU 
in 
Addis 
Ababa, 
the 
RF'CUs 
in 
the 
four 
Regions and 
the 
MSTs 
working 
with 
pastoral communities 
and 
wereda/ 
kebele 
staff 
will 
each have 
training 
in 
participatory 
M&E 
and 
will 
have 
the capacity 
to 
guide 
all 
Project 
participants 
in 
this 
process. 
Effective 
participatory 
M&E 
is 
far 
more 
than 
merely 
compiling 
information; 
it 
is 
inspiring 
participants 
to 
want 
to 
seek 
and 
use 
this 
information 
as 
a 
source 
of 
learning. 
A 
three-level 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
Project: 
At 
the 
grassroots 
level, a 
beneficiary 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
in 
which 
men 
and 
women 
participants 
record 
their 
activities 
and 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
results 
themselves. 
This 
so-called 
responsive 
M&E 
(RME) 
system 
will 
enable 
pastoralists 
to 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
Project 
activities 
on 
their 
own 
lives 
and 
help 
to 
improve future 
activities. 
It 
is 
expected 
that Development 
Agents 
will 
also 
monitor 
the 
beneficiaries 
and 
have 
access 
to 
this 
information, 
providing 
a 
dual 
process 
of 
systematic 
and 
on-going 
data 
collection 
and 
learning. 
At 
the 
implementation 
level, 
Project 
staff 
will 
provide 
a 
two-way linkage 
between the 
RME 
system 
at 
pastoralists' 
level 
and a 
Project 
Benefit 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
(see 
below) 
at 
the 
Project 
management 
level. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
they 
will 
manage 
a 
pastoral 
area information 
system 
to 
collect 
range 
condition, animal health crop 
production 
and 
yield 
information, 
data 
on 
commodity 
prices and 
trade, 
information 
on 
the 
rangeland 
resource 
and climate, and pastoralist social 
organization, 
and 
will 
carry 
out 
analysis 
of 
these 
data 
together 
with 
data 
from 
socio-economic 
surveys 
and 
RME 
systems. 
The 
main 
purpose 
of 
M& 
E 
at 
this 
level 
will 
be 
to improve 
Project 
delivery, 
to monitor natural 
resource 
conditions 
and 
provide 
information 
in 
two 
directions 
to 
inform 
pastoralists, 
technical 
counterparts 
and donor 
partners. 
At 
the 
Project 
management 
level 
a 
Project 
benefit 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(PBME) 
system 
will 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
inputs, 
activities 
and 
outputs (results 
and 
achievements) 
for 
various

System 
Description: 
The 
proposed 
participatory 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
will 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
Project implementation through 
its 
ability 
to 
assure 
regular 
review 
and appropriate 
decision-making. 
It 
requires 
involvement 
of 
all 
relevant 
stakeholders, 
primarily 
community 
members, 
and 
their 
leaders, 
government 
staff 
and 
members 
of 
parliament. 
The 
system 
has 
two 
parallel 
mechanisms, 
one 
written 
and 
one 
oral. 
The 
first 
mechanism 
(written 
and tabulated 
data) 
is 
implemented 
by 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
staff, 
including mobile 
teams 
and 
weredu, 
regional 
and federal 
staff 
and 
is 
based 
on 
systems 
already 
in 
use 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia. 
The 
second, 
oral, 
mechanism 
is 
designed 
and 
implemented 
by 
the 
people 
themselves 
according 
to 
traditional 
and 
locally 
evolving 
mechanisms 
of 
monitoring 
and evaluating 
change. 
These 
two 
systems 
come together 
in 
a 
set 
of 
stakeholder 
meetings 
at 
weredu, 
regional 
and federal 
levels 
held 
at 
twelve-monthly 
intervals. 
Stakeholders analyze 
what 
has 
been 
done, 
what 
impacts have 
been observed 
and 
arrive 
at 
decisions 
for 
ways 
forward 
for 
the Project. 
The 
M&E 
system 
is 
then 
subject 
to 
checks 
and 
balances 
by 
World 
Bank 
supervision 
missions, 
external 
consultants' 
reviews, 
Members 
of 
Federal 
and Regional 
Parliaments 
and 
finally 
an 
overall 
livelihood 
tracking 
system 
coordinated at Federal level. 
System 
Elements: 
Pastoralist 
and 
government leaders 
at 
regional 
and 
I 
level 
have stated 
that 
the 
potential 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
primarily 
related 
to 
its 
responsiveness 
to 
the 
end-users 
and 
their 
realities 
on 
the 
ground. 
The 
following 
activities 
and formats 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
the process 
and 
impact 
of 
the 
CIF, 
DPCF 
and 
policy 
aspects 
of 
the 
Project 
are 
therefore

stakeholders 
at 
all 
levels, 
primarily 
community 
elders, 
line 
ministry 
representatives, and 
parliamentary 
representatives. 
Regular 
external 
reviews

A 
small 
steering 
group, 
with 
representation 
from community, 
govemment 
and 
the 
donor, 
oversees 
the 
M&E 
system, develops 
the terms 
of 
reference 
for 
meetings 
and 
evaluations and 
acts 
as 
ombudsman. 
Stakeholder 
Events: 
Meetings 
between 
government and 
community 
are 
central 
to 
the 
M&E 
system 
as 
they 
ensure 
that 
links 
between 
analysis 
and 
action 
are 
based 
on 
participation.  Meetings 
will 
be 
convened 
- 
58 
- 
Page  65
by 
the 
Project co-ordination 
units 
at each 
of 
three 
levels: 
wereda, 
regional 
and 
federal, 
and 
will 
be 
minuted. 
Wereda 
meetings 
may 
be 
called 
every six 
to 
twelve 
months 
and 
the 
regional 
and federal 
level 
events 
may be 
annual. 
Locations 
for 
the 
federal 
meetings 
would 
be 
in 
the 
regions, 
in 
rotation. 
This 
would 
include opportunity 
for 
federal 
staff 
to 
visit 
and 
stay 
with 
pastoralists and 
the 
mobile 
support 
teams 
in 
the 
kebeles 
and 
to 
hold 
review 
meetings 
with 
them. 
Participants 
should be 
drawn 
from 
among 
the 
main 
stakeholder groups: 
(i) 
governing 
agencies 
(both 
state 
and 
traditional), 
(ii) 
service 
delivery 
agencies 
(governmental and 
non-governmental); 
and 
(iii) 
community 
members. 
The 
difference 
in 
the 
system 
proposed 
here 
to 
other 
systems, 
is 
the 
active 
participation 
of 
the 
traditional 
pastoralist 
leadership 
in 
reviewing 
progress, 
analyzing 
impact and 
discussing ways 
forward 
including 
inter-community 
investments. 
It 
is 
therefore 
crucial 
to 
determine 
who 
is considered 
to 
be 
an 
adequate 
representative 
of 
pastoralist 
men 
and 
women 
by 
pastoralists, 
rather 
than 
assuming this 
from 
outside. 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
for 
the 
Meetings 
would 
include 
the 
following: 
1. 
Review 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
previous 
meetings 
and 
account 
for 
what 
was done 
and 
not 
done 
and 
why. 
2. 
Review 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
various 
CIF 
and 
DPCF 
subprojects since 
the 
last 
meeting. 
3. 
Evaluate the 
impact 
of 
the 
projects 
and 
processes 
of 
PCDP. 
4. 
Analyze 
the 
causes 
of 
successes 
and failures 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
the 
Project 
processes 
and 
the 
external 
environment. 
5. 
Consider 
the 
ways 
forward 
for 
consolidating 
successes 
and 
dealing 
with 
problems 
including 
the 
identification 
of 
inter-community 
subprojects 
for 
CIF 
financing. 
6. 
Make 
recommendations 
for 
action. 
7. 
Agree 
on 
how, 
when, 
by 
whom 
and 
where such recommendations 
should 
be 
pursued. 
8. 
Publicize 
the 
meeting 
content 
and 
decisions. 
In 
preparation 
for 
the 
meeting, 
it 
will 
be 
expected 
that 
the 
traditional 
leaders 
will 
have 
consulted 
their 
constituencies 
using 
their 
own 
systems 
of 
dialogue. 
The 
government 
staff 
will 
have made 
use 
of 
the 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
formats. 
Both 
groups 
will 
therefore 
arrive 
at 
the 
meeting 
ready 
to 
analyze 
and 
make recommendations together 
with 
the 
community 
members 
and 
civil 
society 
and private 
sector 
representatives 
who 
also attend. 
The recommendations 
fulfill 
one 
of 
the 
prime 
objectives 
of 
the 
M&E 
system 
in 
ensuring 
change. 
They 
also 
fulfill 
the 
principle 
that 
both 
formal 
and 
traditional 
perspectives 
are 
included 
in 
accounting 
for 
achievements 
and failures and 
in 
decisions 
about what 
is 
actually 
done 
next.  Therefore 
it 
is 
crucial 
that 
Project 
staff 
and 
community 
leaders 
are 
accountable 
for 
pursuing 
the 
decisions 
within 
their 
subsequent 
activities,  strategies 
and 
policies. 
Mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
this 
accountability 
are 
the 
regularity 
of 
review 
meetings 
themselves 
as 
well 
as 
normal 
sanctions 
including 
withholding 
of 
funds.

Policy 
analyses 
and 
Reform 
Participatory 
Policy 
and Knowledge 
Development: 
Ethiopia’s 
weak 
policy 
environment 
in 
lowland 
areas, 
both 
declared and 
implicit, 
provides 
ample 
scope 
for 
further 
study 
and 
informed, participatory 
policy 
development. 
Uncertain 
land 
use 
rights 
and 
associated 
periodic 
insecurity, 
natural 
resource 
degradation, 
a 
low 
revenue 
base 
and 
associated 
deteriorating infrastructure, disorganized 
markets and 
asymmetrical market 
information, 
the 
weak 
institutional 
framework and 
supporting 
social 
services and 
the 
rising 
physical 
and 
mental 
dependency 
on 
food aid 
are 
major 
concerns 
for 
pastoralists 
and 
policy 
makers 
alike. 
While 
these 
policy 
constraints 
are 
broadly 
recognized, 
a 
knowledge 
gap 
exists 
amongst 
national 
policy 
planners 
concerning 
the 
dynamics 
of 
pastoralism, 
regularly 
leading 
to 
poor 
policy 
choices. 
Combined 
with 
the 
scarcity 
of 
endogenous 
pastoralist organizations 
with 
the capacity 
to 
represent 
and 
defend 
their 
interests 
at 
the 
national 
policy 
level 
and 
an 
often-inappropriate 
institutional 
environment 
for 
pastoral 
development, 
this 
has 
created 
a 
situation 
where 
effort toward 
improvement 
in 
the 
livelihoods 
of 
pastoral people 
frequently 
fails. 
The 
PSDP 
will 
address 
these 
constraints 
by: 
(i) 
empowering pastoralist 
leadership 
to 
understand 
the 
dynamics 
of 
their 
own 
livelihood 
strategies 
in 
relation to 
the broader 
policy 
environment and 
to 
articulate 
this 
at 
both 
the grassroots 
and 
national 
political 
levels; 
(ii) 
funding 
a 
series 
of 
policy 
studies that 
accurately 
inform policy 
decision 
making 
of 
the 
dynamics 
and diversity 
of 
Ethiopian 
pastoral 
systems; 
and 
(iii) 
investment 
in 
the 
knowledge 
system that 
will 
ensure that lessons 
learned 
in 
pastoralist 
development, past 
and 
present, 
will 
be 
retained and 
transferred. 
Pastoralist Empowerment: 
While 
pastoralists 
have 
many 
advocates, 
particularly 
in 
the 
NGO 
and 
donor 
community, 
they 
are 
not 
a 
substitute 
for 
a dynamic and articulate 
pastoralist 
civil 
society 
determining 
their 
own 
future. 
The 
recent 
establishment 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
Pastoralist Standing Committee 
is 
but 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
the 
emergence 
of 
a strong pastoralist 
civil 
society 
in 
Ethiopia. 
The 
newly 
visible 
Federal 
pastoralist 
leadership 
must 
be 
mirrored 
in 
the Regions 
by 
strong, 
articulate 
rural 
leadership, conversant 
with 
local 
and 
national 
body 
politics 
and 
the 
policies, 
institutions 
and 
processes 
that 
impinge 
on 
their 
livelihoods. 
Rural 
pastoralist leadership 
must 
not 
only 
articulate 
to 
power 
centers, 
it 
must 
also 
learn 
to 
listen 
and 
communicate 
with 
its 
people, women, 
youth 
and 
the 
poor, 
and 
broaden 
their 
representation, 
both 
in 
their 
own 
communities 
and 
in 
the 
wider 
socio-economic 
environment. 
These outcomes can 
be 
achieved 
through 
participatory 
learning 
and 
action 
programs that 
build 
skills 
and knowledge, 
improve 
self 
analysis, strategic 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
capacity and 
raise 
understanding 
of 
environment, 
gender 
and 
rights 
issues 
within 
pastoral communities. 
They 
also 
require 
new 
opportunities 
for 
dialogue between 
an 
empowered, 
networked 
pastoral 
lobby 
and 
informed 
local 
and 
national 
policy 
makers, 
from which 
sound 
policy 
choices 
should 
emerge. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
support 
pastoralist 
empowerment 
by: 
e 
designing 
and 
delivering 
a 
generic, 
awareness 
raising training 
course 
on 
the 
dynamics 
of 
pastoral 
systems 
and 
policy 
options 
for 
senior 
regional 
and federal government 
policy 
makers 
and 
service 
managers; 
building 
rural 
leadership and 
conflict 
management 
capacity and 
improving 
rights, 
social and 
environment 
awareness 
amongst 
pastoralist 
men, 
women 
and 
youth 
at 
the 
grassroots 
level, combined 
with 
experiential 
visits 
to 
local 
and national 
government 
agencies 
and 
political 
bodies; 
sponsoring 
networking 
amongst 
pastoral 
groups 
(men, 
women and 
youth) 
and 
between 
them 
and

other interest 
groups, 
both locally 
and 
regionally; 
sponsoring 
meetings, 
preferably 
field-based, that 
facilitate 
a 
two-way 
flow 
of 
information 
and 
ideas 
between pastoralist 
civil 
society 
and 
policy 
makers 
on 
the 
ways 
forward for 
Ethiopian 
pastoralist 
society; 
facilitating 
conflict 
resolution 
amongst 
pastoralist communities 
ensuring 
the 
development, 
legislation 
and 
community-based 
delivery 
of 
pastoralist-friendly 
literacy, 
education, 
health 
and 
veterinary 
services 
and 
their 
integration 
into 
the 
corresponding 
national 
service 
system;

Policy 
studies: 
The 
PCDP 
will 
fund 
the 
cost 
of 
about 
6 
major 
policy 
studies 
(>US$75,000) 
and 
approximately 
6 
policy 
research 
initiatives 
up 
to 
the 
value 
of 
US$ 
10,000 
each, 
the 
design 
of 
which 
will 
be 
finalized 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
preparing 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
(TORS) 
for policy 
studies, 
which may 
involve 
the 
use 
of 
domestic 
or 
international 
technical 
assistance. 
TORS 
for 
major 
policy 
studies 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
Bank review 
prior to 
their 
being 
put 
to 
competitive 
tender. 
Invitations 
to 
bid 
for 
all 
policy 
studies 
will 
be 
advertised 
in 
national 
newspapers. 
Major 
studies 
will 
be 
open 
to 
domestic 
and international 
bidders. 
All 
policy 
studies 
and 
resulting 
recommendations 
will 
be pro-poor 
and 
gender 
and environment 
sensitive. 
Possible 
areas 
of 
policy 
study 
include: 
Pastoral drought 
management, 
to 
identify, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
DPPC 
and 
interested 
NGOs 
and 
donors, 
appropriate 
local 
indicators 
of 
stress 
as 
perceived 
by 
pastoralists 
and 
determine 
how 
they 
can 
be 
collected 
and 
reported 
in

demonstrate 
how 
the

of 
income, 
employment, 
prices, trade, 
poverty 
reduction, 
budget 
cost, 
the

gender 
equity. 
It 
must 
also consider 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
policy 
in 
terms 
of, 
inter 
alia, 
of 
Federal and 
Regional 
State 
budgets, 
regional

Summary 
of 
the 
Local-level Institutional Analysis 
ETHIOPIA 
Pastoral Community Development Project 
Approach 
to 
pastoral 
community 
development 
The 
PCDP 
seeks 
to 
strengthen 
both 
the 
capacities 
of 
pastoral communities 
to 
determine 
and 
manage 
their 
own 
development, 
and 
the 
capacities 
of 
Government 
institutions 
to 
support 
this 
process. 
The 
Project-funded 
Mobile 
Support Teams (MSTs), 
working 
with 
weredu 
or 
kebele staff, 
will 
facilitate participatory situation 
analysis 
in 
pastoral communities 
to 
identify 
opportunities 
and 
problems 
and ways 
to 
address 
them. 
The 
communities 
will 
review 
changes 
they 
have observed 
in 
their 
lives, 
formulate 
their 
visions 
for 
the 
future, 
identify 
stakeholders 
and 
their 
stakes, 
assess 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
their 
institutions 
in 
managing 
development, and 
set 
priorities 
for 
action 
in 
any 
sector 
of 
development. 
They 
will 
be 
guided 
through 
discussions 
of 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
of 
proposed 
activities, 
identifying 
sources 
of 
inputs 
and 
expertise, 
assessing 
environmental 
and social 
impacts, 
and 
agreeing 
on 
roles and 
responsibilities. 
They 
will 
be 
supported 
in 
preparing 
brief 
written 
proposals 
for 
micro 
projects 
for 
submission 
to 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF). 
Community 
institutions 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
supervising 
implementation 
of 
the 
micro 
projects. 
Their 
own 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(M&E) 
of 
the 
activities 
will 
be 
an integral part 
of 
implementation, 
in 
a 
leaming 
process 
of 
action, 
reflection 
and 
re-planning. 
Community activities 
can 
also 
take 
the 
form 
of 
participatory 
research 
to 
investigate, test 
and 
adapt 
promising 
innovations 
that 
could improve local 
livelihoods. 
The 
innovations 
being 
tried 
by 
community 
groups 
can 
serve 
as 
bases 
for 
demonstration and discussion 
by 
visiting 
pastoral 
groups. 
An 
Innovation 
Fund 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
groups 
within 
the 
pastoral communities 
to 
support 
their 
own 
research 
related 
to 
livestock 
and 
crop 
husbandry and 
natural 
resource management 
(NRM). 
The 
MSTs 
and Government technical 
services, 
ideally 
with 
the 
support 
of 
formal 
research 
institutions 
in 
Ethiopia, 
will 
give 
the 
groups guidance 
in 
conducting 
their 
research. 
The 
groups 
will 
make 
their 
own 
decisions 
as 
to 
which 
person(s) 
in 
their 
midst 
will 
actually 
carry 
out 
experiments 
on 
their 
behalf. 
The 
possibility 
will 
be 
explored 
of 
converting 
the 
Innovation 
Fund 
into 
community-managed 
revolving 
funds 
for local 
research. 
Information 
dissemination 
and management 
From 
the outset 
of 
the PCDP, 
information 
will 
be 
spread 
as 
widely 
as 
possible 
about 
the 
approach, 
so 
that 
pastoral communities and 
decision-makers 
in 
modem 
and 
traditional 
institutions 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
possibilities 
the 
Project 
offers. 
In 
order 
to 
address 
the 
problem 
of 
finding 
technical 
expertise 
to 
support 
community initiatives, 
the 
Project 
will 
facilitate 
creation 
of 
a 
database 
of 
approaches 
and 
activities 
in 
pastoral development 
and 
sources 
of 
relevant 
information 
and 
expertise. 
Also 
information 
on 
community-led projects 
and 
experiments 
supported 
by 
the 
Project 
will 
provide 
ideas 
for 
other 
communities 
and 
support 
services. 
The 
information 
will 
be 
spread 
in 
local 
languages 
via 
radio 
and 
in 
posters, brochures, 
leaflets 
and 
booklets 
that 
can also 
be 
used 
in 
literacy 
training. 
Study tours 
will 
be 
organised 
for 
weredu-level Government 
staff 
and 
community 
leaders 
to 
visit 
development activities 
in 
their 
own 
and 
other 
regions. 
Dissemination 
of 
information 
on 
the 
Project 
experiences 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
learning 
process 
for 
the 
Project 
partners 
and 
for 
other 
organisations 
involved 
in 
pastoral 
development. 
The 
Project 
approach and 
outcomes 
will 
be 
made 
known 
via 
mass 
media 
(radio, 
newspapers, 
television) 
as 
well 
as 
seminars 
and 
workshops 
involving 
stakeholders 
in 
pastoral 
development 
at 
regional 
and national 
levels.

Indigenous 
institutions and 
their links 
with 
Local 
Government 
The 
PCDP 
is 
based 
on 
the assumption that 
pastoral 
livelihoods 
can 
be 
improved 
by 
strengthening 
the 
self-management capacities 
of 
indigenous 
institutions. 
As 
the 
MSTs 
will 
be 
working 
through 
these 
structures, 
some 
understanding 
of 
the 
institutions 
for 
social organisation 
and 
resource management 
was 
sought. 
Traditional 
institutions 
among 
the 
Somali, 
Afar, 
Borana and various pastoral ethnic 
groups 
in 
South 
Om0 
are 
described 
in 
the 
Working 
Paper 
on 
“Local-level socio-institutional 
issues 
and capacity 
building 
in 
pastoral 
community 
development”. 
However, 
the 
relative 
strength 
of 
the 
institutions, the details 
of 
their 
structure 
and 
the 
local 
terminology 
may differ 
within 
the 
ethnic 
groups. 
It 
will 
be 
part 
of 
the 
participatory situation 
analysis 
and 
development 
planning 
process 
during 
Project 
implementation 
to: 
1) 
identify 
the 
local 
institutions 
that 
actually 
exist 
in 
that 
area; 
2) 
assess 
their 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses; 
and 
3) 
decide 
jointly with 
community 
members 
whether 
to 
work 
within 
these 
institutions, 
to 
modify 
them 
in 
the 
light 
of 
present 
conditions and 
local 
visions 
for 
the 
future, 
or 
to 
create 
new 
organisations 
for 
new 
tasks. 
The 
smallest 
unit 
that 
could 
be 
called 
a “community” 
is 
a group 
of 
households 
that 
liveimove 
together, 
cooperate 
in 
certain 
tasks 
such 
as 
herding 
or 
watering 
animals, and 
share 
resources 
in 
some 
way 
such 
as 
using 
a common 
source 
of 
water. 
Small 
“communities” 
of 
this 
type 
are 
nested 
within 
larger 
ones 
that 
use 
resources 
jointly on 
a 
larger 
scale, 
such 
as 
a 
broad 
grazing 
area 
that a group 
(e.g. 
a 
subclan) 
is 
entitled to 
use. 
Male 
leaders 
of 
the 
group, 
usually 
together 
with 
a 
council 
of 
male 
elders, 
decide 
on 
how 
these 
resources 
are 
used 
and 
are 
responsible 
for 
organising 
protection 
of 
grazing 
areas 
and 
for 
designing 
seasonal 
movements, 
particularly 
for 
reserving 
dry-season pasture. Access 
to 
pasture 
is 
traditionally controlled 
via 
access 
to 
water, 
but 
interventions 
in 
construction 
of 
additional 
water 
sources 
in 
past 
decades 
appear 
to 
have weakened the 
control 
mechanisms. 
Changes 
in 
access 
to 
resources have also 
resulted 
from 
the 
construction 
of 
bevkado 
(underground 
cisterns) 
by 
rich 
individuals 
as 
well 
as 
from 
Government 
policies 
for 
land 
development 
that favoured expansion 
of 
cultivation 
into 
grazing 
areas, 
particularly 
those 
near 
dry-season water 
sources. 
Also 
large 
influxes 
of 
refugees have 
led 
to considerable 
disturbance 
of 
grazing 
land. 
The 
traditional 
leaders 
and 
elders 
frequently 
deliberate 
on 
political 
matters 
and 
have 
traditionally 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
arranging 
self-defence and 
resolving 
conflicts. 
Also 
pastoral 
women 
played 
a 
role 
in 
conflict 
resolution. However, 
these 
traditional 
mechanisms do 
not 
seem 
able 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
recent 
expansion 
of 
dryland farming 
and 
competition 
with 
outside investors 
for 
land. 
The 
kebele 
(Pastoral 
Association, 
PA) 
should 
be 
the 
main 
communication 
link 
between 
the 
community 
and 
the 
State, 
but 
has 
remained marginal 
to 
community affairs 
in 
most pastoral 
regions. 
Many 
Borana 
regard 
the 
Local 
Government structure 
as 
a 
political 
imposition 
that threatens 
their 
indigenous 
mechanisms 
for 
social organisation and 
resource management. 
The 
MSTs 
seeking contact 
with 
Boran 
communities 
will, 
in 
most 
cases, 
enter 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
olla 
(small 
village 
or 
encampment 
with 
usually 
15-30 
households 
that 
cooperate 
in 
herding 
and 
watering 
animals and 
may 
include 
people 
from 
several clans) 
and 
approach 
first 
its 
traditional 
leader 
(Aba 
Olla). 
Several 
ollas 
may 
join 
to 
plan 
a larger 
project. 
For 
example, 
community 
planning 
to 
rehabilitate 
pasture 
or 
to 
improve 
a water 
source 
would 
be 
done 
on 
the 
level 
of 
the 
dedha 
or 
madda, 
i.e. 
a group that 
uses 
a large 
common 
grazing 
area 
or well. 
Among 
the 
Afar, 
the 
PAS 
coincided 
largely 
with 
clans 
that 
traditionally 
have 
more 
or 
less 
strong 
control 
over 
local 
resources, 
but 
were 
enlarged 
in 
1994 
to 
include 
several clans that compete 
for 
the 
same 
resources. 
This 
makes 
it 
more 
difficult 
to reach 
consensus 
in 
planning 
development. 
The 
Afar 
people 
identify 
in 
different 
contexts 
and 
for 
different 
purposes 
with 
different 
social 
units 
based 
on 
- 
65 
- 
Page  72
kinship, 
descent 
and 
residence. 
The 
level 
of 
“community” 
with 
which 
the 
PCDP 
would 
most 
likely 
interact 
would 
be 
that 
of 
the 
cooperative 
group 
known 
as 
the 
“ganta”, 
a 
collection 
of 
nuclear 
(burra) 
and extended 
(dahla) 
families 
that 
travel 
and 
camp together 
or 
form 
a 
hamlet 
of 
only 
a 
handkl 
of 
household 
or 
as 
many 
as 
60 
households. 
For 
wider 
cooperation 
in 
managing 
natural 
resources 
or 
establishing social 
services, 
the 
Project 
may 
also 
work 
with 
a 
lineage 
(gulub) 
or clan 
(kidoh, 
kedo), 
still 
larger groupings 
of 
related 
people 
who 
share 
common 
resources 
and 
concerns. These groupings 
may 
subdivide 
or 
reform 
in 
different 
constellations depending 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
socio-political, 
economic 
or 
environmental 
factors. 
The 
PAS 
in 
Somali 
Region 
likewise 
used 
to 
be 
organised 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
clan 
membership 
but 
were 
re-organised 
in 
the 
mid-90s. 
In 
the 
northern part 
of 
the 
Region, 
it 
appears 
advisable 
for 
community-based 
projects 
to 
work 
through 
the 
head 
and 
advisors 
of 
the 
qolo 
(subsubclan) 
or 
bee1 
(subclan), 
who 
can 
interact 
well with 
the 
PA 
admmistration. 
The 
reer, 
which 
is 
composed 
of 
the 
households 
of 
a 
senior 
male 
head 
and 
of 
a 
few 
close 
kin 
andor 
dependents, 
would 
be 
the 
smallest 
social 
unit 
that 
might 
be 
regarded 
as 
a “community”. 
Depending 
on 
the 
location 
within 
Somali Region 
and 
the 
types 
of 
concerns 
being 
expressed 
by 
the 
local 
people, 
the 
MST 
may 
work 
with 
several 
reer 
living 
together 
(reero) 
or 
with 
a 
tuulo 
(somewhat 
larger 
grouping 
of 
households 
in 
a village). 
In 
southern 
Somali 
Region, the pastoral communities 
may 
prefer 
to 
collaborate 
in 
planning 
micro 
projects 
through 
the 
wereda 
rather than 
the 
PA. 
In 
South 
Om0 
Zone 
of 
the 
Southern 
Nations, 
Nationalities 
and 
Peoples 
Regional 
State 
(SNNPRS), 
there 
are 
13 
distinct 
pastoral 
groups 
with 
different 
languages 
and 
cultures. 
Their 
forms 
of 
social 
organisation 
differ 
from 
each other 
to 
some 
extent 
and 
are 
in 
a 
state 
of 
flux. 
Compared 
to 
the 
larger 
ethnic groups 
in 
the 
other Regions covered 
by 
this 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Project, 
the 
groups 
in 
South 
Omo 
are 
more confined 
in 
herd 
movements. 
In 
recent 
years, 
small-scale 
cultivation 
has 
become 
more 
widespread 
around 
more 
or 
less 
temporary 
hamlets 
that 
may 
include 
women, 
children 
and 
older 
men 
from 
several 
clans. 
Women play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
cultivation, 
even 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
some 
women 
use 
draught animals 
for 
ploughing 
in 
the 
few 
areas 
in 
South 
Om0 
where 
this 
technology 
has 
been 
adopted. 
These 
hamlets 
would 
be 
the 
initial 
entry 
points 
for 
community 
development support 
by 
the 
MSTs, 
after consultation 
and 
agreement 
with 
the 
traditional male and 
female leaders 
of 
the 
ethnic 
group 
concerned. 
Socio-economic 
differentiation 
in 
pastoral 
communities 
Relative 
wealth. 
There 
is 
a 
marked 
differentiation 
within 
pastoral society 
in 
terms 
of 
livestock 
holdings, 
the 
most 
common 
measure 
of 
relative 
wealth. 
There 
are 
few 
very 
rich 
households, 
with 
large 
mixed 
herds 
of 
camels 
andor 
cattle, equines and 
small 
ruminants. 
The 
households 
that 
are 
more 
or 
less 
viable 
are 
those 
of 
pastoralists 
who 
can 
live 
mainly 
from 
their 
livestock 
and 
the agropastoralists 
who 
have enough 
animals 
to 
buffer 
against 
crop 
harvest 
shortfalls. 
Very 
poor 
agropastoral households 
have 
only 
a small 
flock 
of 
small 
nuninants, a couple 
of 
cattle, 
and 
uncertain 
harvests 
from 
rainfed 
crops. 
The 
destitute have 
access 
to 
neither livestock 
nor 
land. 
They 
depend 
on 
selling 
charcoal 
and 
firewood, 
fetching 
water 
for town 
dwellers, 
tending 
herds 
for 
the 
rich, 
working 
as 
watchmen 
or 
labourers, 
charging tourists 
for 
handicrafts 
or 
photographs 
(particularly 
in 
South 
Omo) 
and traditional 
social welfare networks, where 
these 
still 
function. 
Many 
“modern” 
destitute 
are 
refugees, 
former 
pastoralists 
who 
live 
partly 
from 
food 
aid. 
The 
agropastoralists and 
destitute 
have 
settled at 
least 
temporarily 
in 
towns 
and 
refugee 
camps. 
The 
very 
poor 
do 
not 
send 
their children 
to 
school, have 
little 
or 
no 
access 
to 
health facilities, suffer 
from 
food 
shortage 
and 
take 
no 
part 
in 
community 
decision-making. 
They 
eat 
wild 
foods 
in 
a 
normal 
year, 
not 
just 
during 
crises. Female-headed 
households 
tend 
to 
be 
among 
the 
very 
poor 
and 
destitute. 
As 
a 
very 
rough 
estimate based 
on 
wealthipoverty 
ranking 
results 
in 
recently 
published 
reports, about 
5-10% 
of 
pastoral 
peoples 
in 
the 
- 
66 
- 
Page  73
proposed 
project 
areas 
could 
be 
considered 
rich 
to 
very rich, 
about 
25-35% 
viable, 
about 
40-50% 
poor 
to 
very 
poor, 
and 
about 
15-20% 
destitute. 
The 
pastoral 
groups have 
various 
institutions 
for 
mutual 
aid, 
e.g. 
making 
a 
contribution 
for 
a 
clan 
member 
with 
a 
severe 
problem, 
loaning 
milk 
animals 
for 
a 
short 
period, 
or 
helping 
a 
family 
to 
restock 
when 
it 
loses 
animals 
through 
misfortune. 
The 
pastoralists’ 
ideal 
self-image 
of 
their 
society 
and 
the 
reality often 
differ. 
Movement 
of 
family 
members 
to 
towns 
to 
seek 
work 
in 
non-pastoral 
sectors 
may 
create 
new 
types 
of 
socio-economic 
links 
between 
rural 
and urban 
areas, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
to 
what 
extent 
these 
offer new 
types 
of 
social 
safety 
nets. 
During 
Project 
implementation, 
it 
will 
be 
an 
important part 
of 
situation 
analysis 
in 
the 
communities 
to 
examine 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
traditional 
redistribution networks 
still 
function or 
can 
be 
revived, 
or 
new 
ones 
have developed. 
Attention 
must 
also 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
extent that 
certain 
artisan 
groups outside 
the 
pastoral social 
structure 
are 
marginalised 
from 
community 
decision-making. 
Gender. 
It 
will 
be 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
the 
PCDP 
to 
give 
men 
and 
women 
equal opportunities 
to 
take 
part 
in 
and 
benefit 
from 
the 
Project 
activities. Pastoral 
men 
have 
the 
rights 
to 
own 
livestock, 
the 
main 
factor 
of 
production 
in 
pastoralism. 
A 
woman’s 
economic 
status depends 
on 
her 
relationship 
with 
livestock-owning 
men. 
The 
situation 
of 
widows 
is 
especially 
weak. 
If 
a 
widow 
is 
not 
inherited 
by 
her 
deceased 
husband’s 
brother, 
as 
is 
a 
tradition 
in 
many 
of 
the 
pastoral 
groups, 
she 
lacks 
access 
through 
men 
to 
critical 
productive 
resources such 
as 
labour 
for 
managing 
camels, 
clearing 
land 
etc. 
Pastoral 
men 
are 
normally 
responsible 
for 
herding 
and 
watering 
the 
large 
stock, 
milking 
camels, 
acquiring 
and 
selling 
or 
slaughtering 
animals, 
representing 
the 
household, 
and 
defending the 
family 
and 
kin. 
They 
dominate 
community-level 
decision-making. 
The 
workload 
of 
most pastoral 
women 
is 
far 
greater 
than that 
of 
men 
and includes 
the 
tasks 
of 
building 
huts, 
preparing 
meals, 
fetching 
water 
and 
fuel, 
child 
care, 
caring 
for 
young 
animals, 
helping 
to 
water 
stock, 
milking 
goats 
and 
cattle, and 
processing 
milk. 
Although 
women do 
much 
livestock-related 
work 
and 
may 
be 
consulted 
about 
the 
disposal 
of 
animals, 
men 
usually 
make 
the 
final 
decisions 
in 
this 
regard. 
Women provide 
water 
for 
the 
family 
and 
young 
animals, 
but 
men 
control 
the 
waterpoints. 
Generally, 
women 
sell 
milk 
products 
and 
control 
the 
proceeds, whereas 
men 
control 
the 
proceeds 
from 
animal 
sales. 
On 
account 
of 
cultural 
attitudes 
about 
women’s 
role 
and 
the 
custom 
of 
early 
marriage, 
participation 
of 
pastoral 
girls 
in 
formal 
education 
is 
very 
low 
and 
the 
few 
girls 
who do 
attend school 
rarely 
go 
beyond 
the 
fourth 
grade. 
Pastoral 
families 
are 
reluctant 
to 
allow 
their 
daughters 
to 
attend a school 
far 
from 
the 
home. 
Boys 
and 
girls, 
men 
and women 
of 
all 
ages 
in 
the 
pastoral communities 
are 
concerned 
with 
water, 
health, 
nutrition, animal 
husbandry 
and 
access 
to 
natural 
resources. 
From 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
PCDP, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
incorporate 
gender analysis 
into 
the 
work 
with 
the 
communities. 
Some 
pastoral 
groups, 
particularly 
in 
the 
south 
of 
Ethiopia, 
recognise 
traditional women 
leaders. 
Some 
older women 
past 
child-bearing 
age 
assume 
leadership 
and community-service functions. 
Several 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral projects 
operating 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
in 
Ethiopia 
are 
addressing 
the 
challenge 
of 
gender 
issues 
in 
development. 
A 
more thorough 
study 
of 
their 
approaches 
is 
needed, 
as 
they 
could provide 
good 
examples 
to 
communities, support 
services 
and 
the 
PCDP. 
In 
any 
case, 
to 
give 
pastoral 
women 
a 
better 
chance 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
discussions 
- 
whether 
in 
the 
public 
sphere 
or 
not -both 
traditional 
and 
modem information 
channels 
should 
be 
used 
to 
make 
the 
women 
aware 
of 
the 
PCDP 
approach and 
the 
opportunities 
it 
offers.

Expected 
socio-institutional benefits, constraints 
and 
risks 
Potential benejts. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
PCDP, 
with 
its 
use 
of 
MSTs 
to 
facilitate 
pastoral 
community 
planning 
and 
capacity 
building 
and 
its 
focus 
on 
working 
through 
indigenous social 
structures, 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
organisation 
and 
livelihood 
strategies 
of 
pastoral 
people. 
If 
successful, 
the 
Project 
will 
contribute 
to 
increased 
or 
more 
stable 
income 
of 
pastoral 
households, increased 
access 
to 
social 
and 
technical 
services, 
and 
wider 
community involvement 
in 
decision-making 
about 
local 
development. 
Local 
organisations 
will 
develop better 
skills 
in 
planning, 
accessing 
information 
and 
other 
inputs, 
and 
recognising 
the 
social and environmental impacts 
of 
different 
activities. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
communities 
give 
priority 
to 
education 
and health 
services, these 
will 
contribute 
to 
improving 
the 
well-being 
of 
pastoral 
men, 
women, 
boys 
and 
girls. 
The 
attention 
given 
in 
the 
Project 
to 
early 
warning 
systems 
using 
local 
indicators through 
community-based 
monitoring 
should 
help 
pastoral communities 
and 
supporting 
organisations 
to 
react 
more quickly 
to 
avoid 
disaster 
and 
reduce 
vulnerability 
to 
drought, 
animal 
disease 
and 
other 
risks. 
The 
lessons 
learnt 
during 
Project implementation 
should have a 
positive effect 
on 
subsequent 
work, 
also 
in 
other pastoral 
areas. 
This 
learning 
can 
be 
achieved 
through 
self-assessment 
based 
on 
participatory 
M&E, 
external 
evaluations, 
and 
analysis 
and 
documentation 
of 
the 
Project 
experiences. 
Potential 
constraints 
and 
risks. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
face several constraints 
and 
risks 
including: 
dominance 
of 
more 
powerful 
and 
better 
informed individuals 
in 
benefiting 
from 
the 
Project; 
exclusion 
of 
the poorest; 
gender 
and 
age 
bias; 
exclusion 
of 
more 
mobile 
pastoralists; 
inability 
of 
traditional 
institutions 
to 
manage 
natural 
resources 
under 
changed 
political 
and 
economic conditions;  increased 
conflict; 
incompatibility 
with 
activities 
of 
other 
agencies 
(Government and 
NGO) 
working 
in 
the 
same 
areas; 
biased 
perceptions 
by 
communities and supporting 
services 
of 
fundable projects; 
poor 
functioning 
and 
high 
turnover 
in 
Government 
services; 
and 
World 
BanklIFAD 
impatience 
with 
slow 
draw-down 
of 
funds. 
In 
the 
Working 
Paper, 
several recommendations 
are 
made concerning 
measures 
to 
reduce 
these 
risks. 
During 
Project 
implementation, the 
following 
issues 
will 
need 
further 
study 
and 
monitoring: 
Pastoral 
women 
in 
community 
development: 
analysis 
of 
experience 
in 
improving 
the 
socio-economic 
situation 
of 
pastoral 
women 
and 
strengthening 
their 
contribution to 
community 
development 
Pastoral 
information 
and 
communication 
systems, 
including 
attention 
to 
inclusion or 
exclusion 
of 
certain 
groups 
from 
different 
channels 
of 
information 
Concepts 
ofpastoral 
settlement 
from 
the 
pastoralists’ 
point 
of 
view, 
and 
linkages 
between 
more 
sedentary 
and 
more 
mobile 
groups, also 
between 
those 
in 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas 
Dynamics 
of 
indigenous knowledge:

have 
developed and 
incorporated 
into

and

mechanisms 
of 
mutual 
aid for 
the 
misfortunate 
and 
impoverished. 
Participatory 
approaches 
to 
pastoral 
development 
are 
already 
being 
taken 
by 
some 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral 
projects. 
More 
information 
is 
needed 
about 
their 
effectiveness 
in 
strengthening 
community 
capacities 
to 
manage 
their 
own 
development. 
This 
would 
allow 
the 
PCDP to 
learn 
from 
these 
experiences and 
select 
suitable 
sites 
for 
learning 
visits 
by 
policymakers, Government 
staff 
and 
members 
of 
pastoral 
communities. 
It 
would 
also 
allow 
the 
Project 
to 
harmonise 
its 
approach 
with 
the 
promising 
activities 
already 
on 
the 
ground, 
and 
to 
help 
scale 
them 
up. 
Local 
capacity 
building 
for 
pastoral community 
development 
Building 
capacities 
for 
pastoral 
community 
development 
among 
support services 
and 
the 
communities 
themselves 
is 
central 
to 
the 
Project. Capacity 
is 
understood 
here 
as 
the 
ability 
of 
individuals 
and 
organisations 
in 
terms 
of 
skills, 
knowledge, 
attitudes 
and 
behaviour 
to 
be 
able 
to 
perform 
functions to 
achieve 
their 
objectives. 
It 
grows 
from 
within 
through 
a process 
of 
learning 
and 
change, 
building 
on 
existing 
capacities, 
but 
can 
be 
stimulated 
through 
interventions. 
In 
addition 
to 
time-bound 
learning 
events 
that 
build 
on 
each other, 
the 
process 
of 
participatory 
M&E 
will 
play 
a 
key role 
in 
capacity 
building. 
The learning 
events 
to 
support 
capacity 
building 
at 
all 
levels 
will 
take 
place 
as 
close 
to 
the 
field 
of 
action 
as 
possible and 
will 
be 
alternated 
with 
periods 
of 
application 
in 
day-to-day 
work. 
The 
sessions 
will 
start 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
existing 
knowledge 
of 
all 
participants, 
allowing 
exchange and 
critical 
analysis 
of 
this 
knowledge 
and 
introduced information. 
Preparation 
of 
the 
Project team 
will 
include participation 
in 
the 
work 
of 
existing 
Mobile 
Support/ 
Outreach Teams 
(e.g. 
operated 
by 
NGOs 
such 
as 
FARM-Africa) 
in 
the 
field, 
followed 
by 
training 
in: 
teamwork and 
project 
management; 
facilitation 
and communication; 
training 
of 
trainers; 
participatory 
approaches 
and 
techniques; 
awareness 
of 
gender and other 
differences 
in 
communities; 
participatory 
innovation 
development 
through community-led 
experimentation; 
local 
organisational 
development; 
and 
use 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Management 
Framework. 
Orientation 
and capacity 
building 
in 
Government 
institutions 
will 
be 
carried out through 
various 
activities, 
with 
different 
emphases 
at 
different 
levels, 
and 
will 
include 
seminarslworkshops 
on: 
the 
PCDP 
approach, 
pastoral 
livelihoods 
and 
coping 
strategies, 
principles 
and practices 
of 
NRM 
in 
the 
drylands, 
Participatory 
Learning 
and 
Action 
(PLA), 
participatory 
innovation 
development 
through 
community-led 
experimentation, 
facilitation 
and 
communication, 
gender awareness, 
local 
organisational 
development, 
participatory 
M&E, 
information 
management, 
and 
training 
of 
trainers. 
Government 
staff 
will 
visit 
development 
activities 
and 
experiments planned and 
carried out 
by 
pastoral 
and 
farming 
communities. 
An 
important 
component 
of 
capacity 
building 
at 
all 
levels 
will 
be 
the 
promotion 
of 
multi-stakeholder learning 
fora 
on 
pastoral 
development, 
providing 
occasions 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
PCDP 
process. 
This 
will 
be 
linked 
with 
participatory 
M&E 
and 
process documentation. 
Depending 
on 
the 
demands 
being 
expressed 
by 
pastoral communities, 
wereda 
and 
kebele 
support 
staff 
will 
take 
part 
in 
short-term 
training 
courses, 
exchange 
visits, 
workshops 
etc 
on 
topics 
such 
as 
improving 
water 
supplies, 
low-external-input 
rainfed 
agriculture, micro-scale 
irrigation, 
basic 
animal 
andor 
human health 
care, 
literacy 
and 
numeracy 
training 
etc. 
Additional training 
needs 
will 
doubtless 
be 
identified 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Project. 
In 
pastoral communities, 
much 
of 
the 
capacity 
building 
will 
take 
place 
in 
the 
process 
of 
meetings 
and 
discussions 
for 
planning 
and 
implementing 
activities. 
It 
will 
include: 
information 
and 
awareness-raising 
among 
elders 
and 
other 
community 
members about 
the 
Project 
approach; 
training/coaching 
of

project 
formulation 
and 
M&E; 
training 
in 
leadership and 
organisational 
management; 
travelling 
seminars 
to 
local 
innovations 
and 
initiatives 
and 
visits 
to 
sources 
of 
information on 
relevant 
externally-developed 
technologies; accompaniment 
of 
community-led 
research; 
short-term technical 
training 
in 
innovative 
technologiesiservices 
in 
which local 
groups 
express 
interest; seminars 
on 
principles 
and practices 
of 
NRM 
in 
dryland 
areas; 
and 
guidance 
in 
use 
of 
environmental 
screening 
forms and 
assessing 
impacts 
of 
proposed 
micro 
projects. 
Wherever 
possible, 
training 
will 
be 
given 
by 
experienced 
institutions and 
NGOs 
working 
in 
Ethiopia. 
If 
training 
expertise 
is 
brought 
in 
from 
outside, 
this 
will 
include 
training 
of 
trainers, together 
with 
an 
Ethiopian 
organisation that 
will 
continue 
the 
training 
activities. Government 
institutions 
for 
education 
and 
training 
will 
be 
involved 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing 
appropriate 
courses 
and curricula 
in 
these 
institutions. 
Various 
organisations 
within 
Ethiopia 
can 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
PCDP 
in 
building 
capacities 
for 
pastoral 
community 
development, 
both 
in 
providing 
living 
examples 
for 
learning 
and 
in 
the 
more 
conventional 
sense 
of 
training 
and 
coaching. 
Ethiopian training 
institutes, 
NGOs 
and 
bilateral 
projects 
with 
experience 
in 
capacity 
building 
for 
community 
development 
will 
be 
invited 
to 
a 
planning 
workshop 
to 
design 
capacity 
development 
within 
the 
PCDP. 
The 
ideas 
in 
this 
report 
will 
then 
be 
reviewed, expanded 
and 
refined, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
workshop 
participants’ 
experience.

Annex 6(A): 
Procurement Arrangements 
ETHIOPIA 
Pastoral 
Community 
Development Project 
Procurement 
General. 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Review 
(CPAR) 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
June 
2002. 
The 
findings 
of 
this 
review 
are 
valid for 
the 
PCDP. Public 
procurement 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
regulated 
by 
Financial 
Administration 
Proclamation 
No. 
57/1996 
and 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
Financial 
Regulations 
No. 
1711 
997. 
In 
general, 
Ethiopia’s laws 
and regulations 
do not 
conflict 
with 
IDA 
Guidelines 
and 
the 
procurement 
regulations 
apply 
only 
to 
activities 
for which 
funds 
come 
directly 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
Capacity 
Assessment 
and Proposed 
Procurement 
Arrangements. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Pastoral 
Development Department 
of 
MOFA 
has 
been 
carried 
out. 
The 
assessment has 
addressed 
the 
main 
issues 
and 
recommendations. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
assessment 
the 
following 
action 
plans 
have 
been 
agreed: 
(i) 
The 
procurement 
planning 
and management process 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through 
adequate 
training 
and 
guidance 
to 
key 
staffs 
involved 
in 
the procurement 
process 
(ii) 
a detailed 
procurement 
manual 
will 
be 
developed 
and 
adopted; 
(iii) 
procurement 
staff 
with 
acceptable 
capacity 
and 
qualification 
will 
be 
employed. 
The 
training 
shall be 
provided 
by 
sending 
staffs 
to 
regional 
training 
centers 
and 
conducting 
appropriate trainings 
at 
local 
level. 
The training 
shall include 
the 
whole 
procurement 
process 
in 
addition 
to 
records management 
with 
emphasis 
on 
community 
procurement. 
In 
the 
procurement 
arena, 
the 
main role 
of 
the 
project coordination 
staff 
in 
the 
FPCU 
will 
be 
to 
assist 
weredas 
and Regions 
to 
carry 
out 
any 
procurement 
done at 
those levels. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
be 
strengthened 
with 
additional 
specialized 
staff 
dedicated 
to 
the 
project 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
Effectiveness. 
Its 
procurement 
staff 
will 
have 
prior 
experience 
in 
executing 
IDA 
financed procurement and 
will 
receive 
additional 
training 
as 
needed. 
The 
situation 
will 
be 
closely 
monitored 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
main 
procurement that 
will 
take 
place 
at 
the 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
level 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
operation and 
maintenance 
(office 
supplies, 
gasoline, 
transportation 
material 
maintenance 
and 
repair). 
Procurement 
for 
beneficiary 
executed 
micro-projects 
will 
be 
executed 
using 
procedures 
described 
above 
and detailed 
in 
the 
Project Implementation Manual. 
As 
capacity 
to 
execute 
these 
types 
of 
micro-projects 
will 
be 
weak 
initially, 
substantial 
efforts 
will 
be 
made 
to 
train 
beneficiaries 
before 
the 
start-up 
of 
the 
investment 
program. 
The 
procedures take 
into 
account 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
similar projects 
in 
other 
countries. 
Beneficiaries 
need 
training 
in 
the selection 
of 
service 
providers. 
It 
is 
also 
important to avoid 
trying 
to 
overload 
beneficiaries 
-- 
the 
investment 
program 
will 
proceed 
at 
a 
pace consistent 
with 
the 
implementation 
capacity 
of 
the 
beneficiaries. 
Procurement 
Issues. 
The 
MoFA 
is 
a 
new 
Ministry, 
with no 
prior 
experience 
of 
managing 
projects 
for 
international 
financial 
institutions. 
The 
PCDP 
will 
address 
this 
issue 
by 
recruiting 
an 
experienced 
national 
procurement 
specialist 
to 
manage 
the 
procurement 
program 
and 
through 
refresher 
training 
for 
the procurement 
specialist 
and procurement 
awareness 
training 
for 
the 
Project 
Director 
and 
FPCU 
Manager. 
A 
substantial 
proportion 
of 
the 
procurement 
will 
be 
made 
in 
isolated 
wereda 
where 
there 
will 
be 
little 
competition 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
services. 
The 
RPCU 
will 
employ an 
experienced government 
procurement 
officer 
who 
will 
monitor 
Regional 
and 
wereda 
procurement activities, aggregating 
wereda 
level 
procurement contracts wherever 
possible 
with 
a 
view 
to 
attracting 
wider 
competition. 
The 
RPCU 
procurement 
officers 
will 
train 
wereda 
PDO 
staff 
in 
local 
procurement 
management 
and receive 
refresher 
training 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
Late 
payment 
of 
import 
taxes 
and 
duties 
by 
Government 
frequently 
delays 
delivery 
of 
goods, 
particularly 
now 
that 
most 
goods 
are 
imported 
through 
Djibouti, 
a 
foreign 
port. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
prepare 
detailed 
annual 
estimates 
of 
Program 
tax 
and 
duty 
liabilities 
and 
present 
them 
to 
MoFA 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
to 
ensure 
their 
inclusion 
in 
the 
annual government 
budget.

Funds for communities 
will 
be 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
component. 
Most 
of 
the 
procurement 
involved 
in 
the 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF) 
will 
be 
in 
the 
form 
of 
very small 
transactions 
carried out 
by 
communities and 
kebeles, 
and 
will 
take 
place 
locally 
within 
selected 
weredas. 
Community micro-projects shall 
be 
on 
a 
grant basis, 
not to 
exceed 
US 
$10,000 
per 
grant, subject 
to 
the 
community 
contributing 
at 
least 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
micro-project 
costs. 
Participating 
communities 
will 
not 
be 
eligible 
for 
more 
than 
one 
grant 
per 
year. 
Only 
grants 
approved 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committees 
can 
be 
financed. 
Community contributions 
will 
rise 
to 
40 
percent 
for 
second 
and 
subsequent 
grants. 
Disaster 
preparedness and 
contingency 
funding 
will 
be 
available 
to 
weredas 
and, 
to 
a 
limited 
degree, 
Regions, 
to 
meet 
investments 
in 
infrastructure 
and 
other 
risk 
management 
programs specified 
in 
wereda 
disaster preparedness 
and contingency plans approved 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development Committee and 
integrated 
into 
a zonal 
risk 
management strategy. 
All 
such 
programs 
shall 
be 
assessed 
for 
their 
environmental 
impact 
and 
include 
environment 
mitigation 
activities 
where 
required. 
Wereda 
risk 
management 
projects 
shall 
be 
on 
a 
cost-sharing basis 
with 
20% 
of 
the 
costs 
met 
in 
cash 
and 
kind 
by 
the 
participating 
weredaslRegions. 
Individual 
wereda 
contracts 
shall 
not 
exceed 
US$50,000 
except where 
adjoining 
weredas 
let 
joint 
contracts 
(e.g. 
interconnecting 
roads 
or 
watershed 
management programs) 
where 
the 
contract 
shall 
not 
exceed 
US$lOO,OOO. 
It 
is 
expected that the 
majority 
of 
these 
funds 
will 
be 
expended 
on 
minor 
works valued 
at 
less 
than 
US$20,000 
each, 
predominantly 
using 
local 
labor. 
Flexible 
procurement arrangements: 
Special 
attention 
has 
been 
given 
to 
providing 
procurement 
arrangements 
and 
procedures commensurate 
with 
the 
experimental 
and 
learning 
nature 
of 
the 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the central 
focus 
on 
the 
CIF. 
The 
need 
has 
been 
recognized 
for 
simple 
mechanisms 
to 
ease 
purchase 
of 
materials and 
resources 
by 
households 
and communities 
in 
dispersed 
locations. 
The 
arrangements 
will 
be aimed 
at 
efficient 
procurement 
that 
underpins 
quick 
disbursement 
and 
distribution 
of 
goods 
and 
money, 
mixing 
procurement 
on 
the 
local 
market 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
with 
procurement 
and 
distribution 
from 
Regional, 
national 
and 
international 
levels. 
Where 
they 
fit 
with 
the 
needs 
expressed 
by 
communities, 
simplified 
procurement, 
disbursement, 
accounting 
and 
auditing 
procedures 
would 
be 
used 
for 
communities 
(Africa 
Region’s 
Guidelines 
for 
Simplified 
Procurement 
and 
Disbursement, 
March 
1998; 
see 
also 
Bank 
Procurement 
Guidelines, 
Jan. 
1999, 
Section 
3.15 
Community 
Participation 
in 
Procurement). 
Local 
shopping, single-source selection, 
obtaining 
quotations, 
and 
direct contracting 
would 
all 
be 
allowed 
under 
specified 
procedures. 
Random 
audits 
would 
be 
undertaken 
to 
review 
the 
use 
of 
funds. 
A 
manual 
of 
Procurement 
Procedures 
under 
the 
PCDP 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
the 
Recipient 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
PHRD 
Grant 
and 
be 
complete 
before 
effectiveness. 
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines 
and 
policies 
will 
be 
followed. 
Throughout pastoral 
areas, 
infrastructure 
and 
markets 
are 
poorly 
developed. 
Accessing 
resources 
does 
not 
guarantee 
that communities 
will 
be 
able 
to 
access 
the 
materials they 
require. 
There 
is 
no 
single 
solution 
to 
this, 
and 
each 
wereda 
may 
devise 
its 
own 
solution. 
The 
following 
are 
proposals 
regarding 
the 
options that 
may 
be 
available; 
in 
all 
cases 
the 
communities 
retain control 
over 
the 
financial 
resources 
for 
purchase 
of 
materials: 
. 
open 
market: 
where 
the 
market 
is 
strong, 
or 
where 
the 
wereda 
includes 
or 
is 
near 
towns, 
communities 
should 
be 
able 
to 
access 
resources; 
service co-operatives: 
on 
a 
commercial 
basis 
these 
could 
stock 
commodities 
that 
the 
community 
requires; 
. 
- 
73 
- 
Page  80
. 
* 
community 
groups come together 
to 
buy 
similar 
commodities 
from 
more 
distant 
markets; 
communities 
contract 
local 
merchants 
to 
provide 
materials and 
supplies. 
The 
program 
elements 
by 
disbursement category and 
procurement 
methods 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
A 
below. 
Consultant selection methods 
and thresholds 
for 
procurement 
methods 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
B 
below. 
The 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF) 
for 
micro-projects 
(US$18.0 
million, 
including 
beneficiary 
contribution). 
The 
project provides 
funds 
for 
beneficiary 
executed 
projects 
at 
the 
community level. 
Financing 
will 
depend 
on 
applications 
received 
from 
communities 
and the 
types 
of 
activities 
to 
be 
financed and 
their 
procurement details 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
needs 
identified 
by 
the 
communities. 
In 
addition, beneficiaries 
contribute 
at 
least 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
micro-project 
in 
cash 
or 
in 
kind. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
determine 
ex 
ante 
the 
mix 
of 
goods, 
small 
works, 
and 
services 
to 
be 
procured 
under 
these 
activities 
due 
to 
their 
demand-driven 
nature 
and 
financing 
mix. 
Procurement 
of 
items 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
micro-projects 
would 
be 
carried out 
in 
accordance 
with 
simplified 
procurement 
procedures 
referred 
to 
in 
Section 
3.15 
of 
the 
Guidelines 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Project Implementation Manual. 
The 
manual 
will 
contain 
a special chapter 
describing 
the 
procedures 
and tools 
in 
accordance 
with 
those 
found 
in 
the Bank’s 
Guidelines 
for  Simplijied 
Procurement 
and 
Disbursement 
for 
Community-Based 
Investments 
(February 
1998). 
The 
Regional Project Coordination 
Units 
(RPCUs) 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
these 
guidelines. 
Ex-post 
reviews 
of 
random micro-proj 
ects 
will 
be 
conducted 
periodically 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
through 
independent 
technical 
audits (about 
20 
percent 
of 
all 
subprojects 
over the 
life 
of 
the 
project) carried out 
by 
independent 
consultants. 
The 
Disaster Preparedness 
and 
Contingency 
Fund 
(DPCF) 
(US818 
million 
including 
wereda/Regional 
contribution). 
The 
project provides 
funds 
for 
disaster preparedness 
and 
prevention 
investments and 
for 
contingency 
funds 
held 
in 
reserve 
for 
short-term interventions 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a disaster. 
An 
acceptable 
wereda 
disaster preparedness 
and 
prevention 
plan, approved 
by 
the 
wereda 
Development Committee 
and 
including 
documentation 
of 
the 
participatory 
process 
and, 
if 
applicable, 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
mitigation 
strategy, 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
for 
release 
of 
DPCF 
resources. 
A 
relatively 
small 
portion 
of 
the 
DPCF 
will 
be 
earmarked 
to 
jump-start 
investments 
in 
critical 
infrastructure 
identified 
in 
the 
Regional 
inventory. 
As 
these 
investments 
will 
be 
the 
product 
of 
a 
community 
consultation 
process, 
approved 
at 
wereda 
level 
and consolidated 
at 
the 
zonal 
level, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
determine 
ex 
ante 
the 
mix 
of 
goods, 
small 
works, and 
services 
to 
be 
procured 
under 
the 
DPCF 
due 
to 
their 
demand-driven 
nature 
and 
financing 
mix. 
A 
large 
proportion 
of 
this 
work, 
however,

The 
FPCU 
will 
publicize 
each 
year 
procurement 
notices 
in 
the 
local 
press 
to 
get 
expressions 
of

on 
the 
criteria detailed 
in 
the 
Project Implementation Manual, 
the 
FPCU 
will 
maintain 
and 
update the 
roster 
of

which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
establish short-lists 
or 
select 
firms 
with 
the 
required 
qualifications. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
also 
maintain 
a 
list 
of 
qualified 
construction 
companies 
and 
engineers, 
with 
agreed 
upon 
rates 
that 
can 
be 
accessed 
by 
Project 
beneficiaries. 
Updates 
to 
this

will 
also 
be 
made 
annually, 
at 
which time 
interested 
qualified 
construction 
companies 
and

in 
different 
fields 
of 
expertise 
can 
be 
added 
and 
poorly 
performing

removed. Performance 
will 
be 
rated 
based 
on 
feedback 
from 
the 
beneficiaries and 
the 
results 
of 
the 
technical 
audits.

procedures 
to 
prepare 
the 
Project 
for

(FMR). 
The 
reporting 
requirement 
for 
FMR 
is 
that 
a completed

for 
each quarter 
shall 
be 
received 
by 
the 
Bank 
within 
45 
days 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each 
quarter. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve compliance, 
procurement 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
(procurement progress, 
unit 
costs, 
etc.) 
will 
become an 
integral part 
of 
the 
annual 
work 
program 
and 
reporting 
cycle. 
The 
annual 
work 
programs and 
progress 
reports 
will 
include 
the 
updated 
procurement plan, 
an 
overview 
of 
all 
procurement

ETHIOPIA: Pastoral Community Development Project 
Financial 
Management 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial Management 
Assessment 
Introduction: 
The 
Bank's 
policy 
(OP 
10.02) 
requires 
borrowers and project 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
maintain financial 
management 
systems, 
including 
accounting, 
financial reporting 
and 
auditing 
systems, 
adequate 
to 
ensure 
that they can 
provide 
to 
the 
Bank 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
regarding project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
systems 
of 
this 
project 
is 
done 
in 
line 
with 
the 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management Sector 
Board 
in 
June 
2001. 
Country 
Issues: 
A 
draft report 
on 
the 
Country Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFFA)-Ethiopia 
was 
issued 
on 
10 
November 
2002. 
The 
final 
report 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
issued 
at 
the 
end 
of 
March 
2003. 
The 
overall 
conclusion 
is 
that 
considerable progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
the 
rationalization 
and 
strengthening 
of 
budgeting 
process 
at 
the 
Federal 
level. 
Various 
capacity 
building 
efforts 
are 
being 
undertaken 
at 
the 
Regional 
levels 
as 
well. 
Despite 
some 
progresses made 
in 
last 
three 
years, 
there 
are 
weaknesses 
in 
medium 
term 
planning, 
accounting, 
auditing 
and 
reporting. Remedial 
actions 
on 
the 
weaknesses 
will 
be 
taken 
through 
the 
Expenditure 
Management 
and 
Control 
Program 
(EMCP), 
the 
Capacity 
Building 
Project 
for 
Decentralized 
Service 
Project 
(CBDSD) 
and 
Public 
Service 
Delivery 
Capacity 
Building 
Program 
(PSCAF'). 
Implementing 
entities: 
To 
coordinate 
the 
project 
at 
the 
federal level, a Federal 
Project Coordinating 
Unit 
(FPCU) 
will 
be 
established. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
be 
located 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs. 
The FPCU 
will 
have 
a 
Project 
Coordinator, 
Financial 
Officer 
and 
Assistant, 
a Procurement 
Office, 
a 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
expert, 
a Pastoralist 
Expert, 
and a 
Participatory 
DevelopmenKommunications 
Specialist. 
Its 
roles 
would 
be 
to 
release 
funds 
against agreed plans, 
disburse 
funds 
to 
all 
implementing 
levels, 
and 
co-ordinate 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
project 
as 
a whole. 
It 
would not be 
an 
implementing 
agency. 
Its 
functions 
would 
be 
confined 
to 
facilitating 
and accounting 
for 
the 
flows 
of 
funds, 
and 
it 
will 
not 
be 
responsible 
for 
judging 
the 
merits 
of 
applications 
for 
funds 
or 
the 
uses 
to 
which 
they 
were 
put. 
In 
each 
Region, 
the 
Pastoral Development 
Office 
(PDO) 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
specialized 
staff 
dedicated 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
PDOs vary 
in 
staff 
numbers 
and 
capacity among 
the 
four 
Regions, 
and 
will 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
flows 
of 
funds 
to 
communities 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committee (WDC), 
which 
includes 
officers 
of 
relevant 
bureaus 
(agriculture, 
health, 
labor 
and 
social 
affairs), 
and 
representatives 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
civil 
society. 
The 
wereda 
Finance 
Office 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
handling 
the 
financial 
transactions 
of 
the 
project 
at 
the 
wereda 
and 
kebele 
levels. 
An 
additional 
finance 
officer 
may 
be 
required 
for 
a 
wereda. 
Communities, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
kebele 
staff 
will 
prepare 
community 
development 
plans 
for 
appraisal 
by 
their 
respective 
WDCs. 
Funds 
for 
approved plans 
will 
flow 
from 
weredas 
to 
communities 
in 
appropriately 
sized 
and 
phased 
tranches. 
Expenditure 
on 
any 
tranche 
must 
be 
completed 
before 
a 
new 
tranche 
is 
released. 
The 
flow 
of 
the 
US$12 
million 
for 
disaster 
risk 
management 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
the 
RPCU 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Regional 
DPPB, 
in 
response 
to 
disaster 
preparedness 
and 
prevention 
planning 
at 
the 
community 
level. 
Communities

will 
be 
integrated 
into 
wereda disaster 
preparedness 
and 
prevention 
plans 
by 
the Wereda Disaster 
Preparedness 
and 
Prevention 
Desk 
(DPPD) 
officer, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
zonal 
DPPO. 
The 
resulting 
plan 
and 
budget 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
WDC 
for 
approval 
and 
thereafter 
forwarded to 
the 
the 
zonal 
DPPO for 
consolidation. 
Zonal 
disaster 
preparedness 
and 
prevention 
plans 
will 
be 
forwarded 
to 
the 
Regional DPPB. 
An 
acceptable disaster 
preparedness 
and 
prevention 
plan, 
including 
documentation 
of 
the 
participatory 
process 
and 
environmental 
assessment, 
if 
applicable, 
will 
be 
a 
condition for 
release 
of 
fund 
resources. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
approved 
plans 
and 
budgets, 
hnds 
will 
flow from 
the 
RPCU 
to 
the 
wereda 
Finance 
Office, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
local 
goods 
and 
services 
to 
effect 
the 
plan. 
The participating 
Region 
will 
contribute 
not 
less 
than twenty 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
cost 
of 
an approved investment, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
equipment 
and 
civil 
works, 
staff 
salaries 
and 
operating 
costs. 
Local 
labor 
will 
be 
employed 
and 
paid, 
providing 
an 
injection 
of 
cash 
into 
the 
local 
economy. 
Strengths and 
Weaknesses: 
The 
country’s 
discipline 
in 
executing 
budget 
and compliance 
with 
the 
existing 
government 
regulations 
is 
the 
major 
strength 
in 
implementing 
this 
project. 
The 
wereda 
Finance 
Offices 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
processing most 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
transactions 
in 
which 
the 
weredas 
are 
strictly following-up 
the 
budgetary 
discipline 
and regular government 
reporting 
mechanism. 
Significant 
Weaknesses

Agree 
with 
the 
selected 
auditors 
on 
the 
timetable 
to 
complete 
the 
audit 
well 
in 
advance. 
The 
FPCU 
should 
close 
the 
accounts 
immediately 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
vear. 
Design 
of 
a 
good 
system 
of 
monitoring 
fund 
transfer 
should 
be 
based 
on 
the 
receipt 
of 
regular 
financial 
reports. 
Flow 
of 
funds: 
IDA, 
IFAD, 
GOE 
and 
the 
communities 
will 
finance 
the 
project. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
open 
two 
Special 
Accounts 
(SAs) 
at 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Ethiopia, 
one 
for 
IDA 
and the other 
for 
IFAD. 
IDA 
and 
IFAD 
then, 
from 
the 
Credit 
Account, 
will 
transfer money 
to 
the 
SAs. 
The 
FPCU 
may 
effect 
payments 
directly to 
a supplier/contractor 
from 
the 
credit 
accounts. 
The 
government 
will 
transfer 
the 
counterpart 
portion to 
the 
local 
currency 
account 
maintained 
by 
the 
FPCU. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
transfer 
money 
to 
each 
of 
the 
Regional 
Pastoral Development 
Offices 
(PDOs), 
from 
which 
funds 
will 
flow 
to 
Wereda 
Administration Offices (WAOs) to 
cover 
eligible project 
expenditures. 
The 
transfer 
will 
be 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
annual 
project 
budget. 
On 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
Wereda 
Development 
Committee and 
with 
approval 
of 
the 
WAO, 
the 
wereda 
Finance 
Offices 
will 
transfer money 
to 
the 
Community

Community-based Organizations 
Staffing: 
The 
FPCU, 
the 
PDO, 
and 
wereda 
Finance 
Offices 
should 
be 
staffed 
with 
adequate 
and 
trained 
people, 
who 
are 
capable 
of 
handling 
and managing 
the 
project 
financial 
resources. 
Accountingpolicies andprocedures: 
The 
accounting 
policies 
and 
procedures 
to 
be 
designed 
should 
be 
able 
to produce reliable, 
relevant 
and 
timely 
information 
for 
informed 
decision 
making 
and 
monitoring. 
Internal 
Controls: 
Internal control 
comprises 
the 
entire 
systems 
of 
control, 
financial or 
otherwise, 
established 
by 
management 
in 
order 
to 
(a) 
carry out 
the 
project activities 
in 
an 
orderly 
and 
efficient 
manner; 
(b) 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
policies 
and 
procedures; 
and 
(c) 
safeguard 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
project 
and 
secure 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
the 
completeness 
and 
accuracy 
of 
the 
financial 
and 
other 
records. 
The project 
is 
expected 
to 
design 
and 
install 
internal 
control 
systems, 
which 
will 
help 
the 
management 
of 
the 
project 
in 
achieving 
the 
project 
objectives 
in 
an orderly and 
efficient 
manner. 
Since 
the 
project 
will 
not 
have 
an 
internal 
audit 
section, 
the 
control 
systems 
to 
be 
designed 
should 
compensate 
for 
the 
non-existence 
of 
the 
internal 
audit. 
Thus, 
the 
main 
focus 
of 
the 
internal 
control 
is 
placed 
on 
the 
following: 
Segregation 
of 
duties 
Physical 
control 
of 
assets 
Authorization 
and 
approval 
Clear 
channels 
of command 
Arithmetic 
and accounting accuracy 
Supervision 
Integrity 
and 
performance 
of 
staff 
at 
all 
levels 
Reporting and monitoring: 
The 
FPCU 
will 
establish 
adequate 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
systems, 
which 
will 
produce 
accurate 
and 
reliable information 
regarding 
project 
resources 
and 
expenditures. 
The 
systems 
- 
83 
- 
Page  90
should 
provide reliable 
records 
and 
reports 
on 
all 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
financial 
transactions 
of 
the 
project, and 
sufficient financial information 
for 
managing and 
monitoring 
activities. 
The 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
systems 
will, 
among other 
things, 
include 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
financial 
management manual, 
design 
of 
good internal control 
systems, 
and 
appointment 
of 
qualified 
personnel 
at 
each 
level 
of 
project 
implementing 
agencies. 
The 
manual 
will, 
inter 
alia, 
include: 
Flow 
of 
funds 
Accounting 
policies 
to 
be 
followed 
Accounting 
systems 
Chart 
of 
accounts 
Reporting mechanism 
Budgeting 
process 
Auditing 
arrangements 
Staffing 
requirements 
The 
manual 
should specifically 
mention 
how 
documents 
at 
PDO, 
WDC 
and 
kebelelcommunity 
committee 
levels 
will 
be 
maintained 
and 
consolidated 
with 
the 
FPCU. 
The 
flow 
of 
funds 
and 
flow 
of 
reporting should 
be 
mentioned 
in 
simple, 
but 
clear language. 
The 
manual should contain 
the 
formats 
to 
be 
used 
by 
each 
implementing 
agency 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
reporting. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
preparing 
consolidated 
quarterly 
and 
annual 
reports. 
The 
PDOs, 
WDCs 
and 
other 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
keep 
records 
of 
all 
financial 
transactions 
of 
their 
respective 
units. 
Regular 
financial 
reports 
should 
be 
sent 
to 
the FPCU, 
including 
the 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds 
and 
statements 
of 
expenditures. 
All 
the 
documents 
at 
the 
PDOs and 
WDCs 
(by 
the 
weredu Finance 
Office) 
will 
be 
kept 
in 
their 
respective 
units 
and 
be 
available 
to 
the 
Bank 
staff 
during 
supervision missions 
and 
to 
the 
external auditors 
during 
their 
annual 
audits. 
Each kebelelcommunity 
committee 
will 
maintain 
a 
simple 
accounting 
book, 
which 
shows the amount 
of 
money received 
and 
the expenditures 
made. 
All 
the 
supporting 
documents 
from 
the 
kebelelcommunity 
should 
be 
submitted 
to 
the wereda 
Finance 
Office 
along 
with 
regular 
financial 
reports. 
The 
financial 
management 
manual 
will 
describe 
all 
the 
systems 
of 
recording, 
filing 
and 
recording 
all 
project related 
financial 
transactions. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
produce 
quarterly Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
and 
submit 
the 
same 
to 
IDA 
45 
days 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each quarter. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
include financial, physical 
progress 
and 
procurement 
information. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
the 
financial 
reports 
must 
include 
the 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
hds, 
expenditures 
by 
main 
expenditure classifications, 
beginning 
and ending 
cash 
balances 
and other 
supporting 
schedules. 
The 
formats 
of 
the 
FMRs 
will 
be 
agreed 
during 
negotiation. 
No 
later than 
November 
30 
of 
each 
year, 
the 
FPCU 
will 
submit 
to 
the 
project 
steering committee 
(the 
Emerging 
Regions 
Development 
Board), 
with 
a 
copy to 
IDA, 
the proposed 
Annual 
Work 
Programs 
and 
Financial 
Report. 
The 
report format 
will 
detail 
activities, 
associated 
unit 
costs 
and 
an 
implementation 
timetable. 
It 
will 
also 
include monitorable 
progress 
indicators 
for 
each 
proposed 
activity. 
In 
addition, 
the 
FPCU 
will 
submit 
semi-annual progress 
reports 
to 
its 
Board 
showing 
budgeted 
and 
actual 
expenditures, 
source 
of 
hds 
used, 
statements 
of 
progress 
achieved 
on 
the basis 
of 
the 
agreed 
upon 
indicators 
and 
the 
(revised) 
objectives 
and 
financial 
reports 
for 
the 
forthcoming 
six 
months.

will 
be

widely; 
this 
implies 
that 
local 
currency

used, 
and 
that 
SOEs 
will 
be 
the

Conditions: 
The 
establishment 
of 
satisfactory 
financial 
management 
systems, 
including 
a 
financial

would 
be 
one 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
effectiveness. 
The 
appointment 
of 
a finance

also 
be 
a 
condition 
of

Financial 
Covenants: 
The 
borrower 
shall 
maintain 
a 
financial 
management 
system and 
prepare 
project 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
International Accounting 
Standards. 
The 
borrower 
shall 
submit 
audited 
project 
financial 
statements 
no 
later than six 
months 
after 
the 
close 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year. 
The 
borrower 
will 
also 
submit 
additional 
financial 
reports 
as 
required 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Supervision 
pian: 
Considering 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
Bank’s 
supervision 
mission 
should 
be 
as 
regular 
as 
possible. 
Each 
year, 
there 
should 
be 
at 
least 
two 
main 
supervision missions 
and 
another 
two 
interim 
supervision missions 
by 
the 
country 
office 
staff 
and 
FPCU. 
These 
should 
explain 
the 
FMS 
supervision 
needs 
based 
on 
the 
risk 
analysis. 
There 
would 
be 
two 
missions 
by 
the 
FMS 
in 
the 
first 
year 
and 
one 
a 
year 
subsequently. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
The 
consolidated annual 
financial 
statements 
of 
the project, 
the 
movement 
in 
the 
special accounts 
(SA) 
and 
Statements 
of Expenditures 
(SOEs) 
will 
be 
audited 
by 
an 
external 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
annual 
audited financial 
statements, 
along 
with 
the 
management 
letter, 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
not 
later 
than 
six 
months after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year. 
Since 
the 
Federal 
Auditor 
General 
is 
responsible 
for 
auditing 
all 
government 
funds, 
it 
will 
conduct 
the 
audit 
or 
assign another 
extemal 
auditor 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the external 
auditors 
will 
be 
developed 
immediately after 
effectiveness. 
To 
ensure 
proper 
accountability 
of 
funds 
managed 
by 
beneficiaries, 
technical and 
financial 
audits 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
on 
a 
sample basis. 
These 
audits 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
technical execution 
of 
the 
works 
(technical 
quality 
and progress), 
systems 
in 
place 
to 
ensure 
appropriate 
maintenance, 
and that basic 
information 
is 
available to track 
the 
use 
of 
the 
funds 
(receipts, contracts, 
comparison 
of 
priceshids, 
etc.). 
Where 
funds 
are 
inappropriately 
used, 
the 
Project 
will 
cease 
supporting 
activities 
until 
all 
funds 
have been accounted 
for. 
In 
cases 
where fraud 
is 
suspected, 
local 
authorities 
will 
be 
notified.

Disbursement Arrangements 
The 
closing 
date 
of 
the proposed 
grant 
will 
be 
December 
31,2008. 
The 
proposed 
IDA 
grant 
would 
be 
disbursed 
against 
the 
categories 
shown 
in 
Table 
C. 
Disbursements 
will 
be 
made 
in 
accordance 
with 
procedures 
and 
policies outlined 
in 
the 
Bank's 
Disbursement 
Handbook. 
There 
are 
two 
ways 
to 
disburse 
funds 
from 
the 
Bank. 
The 
first 
one 
is 
the 
traditional 
disbursement 
method, 
which 
uses 
SA, SOE procedures 
and 
direct 
payment 
procedures. 
The 
second 
one 
is 
the 
report-based 
method, 
in 
which 
regular 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMR) 
plus 
additional 
statements 
will 
be 
the 
basis 
for 
disbursement. 
Since 
not 
all 
the 
project 
implementing 
agencies 
at 
all 
levels 
have 
yet 
been 
established, 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
to 
assess 
their 
capacities 
and 
the 
traditional 
disbursement 
procedures 
will 
be 
used 
by 
the project. 
If 
the 
borrower 
is 
interested 
in 
following 
the 
second method, 
it 
is 
possible 
to switch 
to 
a 
report-method 
of 
disbursement 
after 
a 
full 
assessment has 
been 
made 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Uses 
of 
Statement 
of 
Expenditures 
(SOEs): 
Disbursements 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs 
will 
be 
as 
follows: 
(a) 
for 
goods, 
grants and 
consulting 
firms 
on all 
contracts 
less 
than 
US$ 
100,000; 
(b) 
for 
individual 
consultants 
on all 
contracts 
less 
than US$50,000; 
and 
(c) 
for 
training 
and 
workshops, 
and 
operating 
costs 
on all 
contracts regardless 
of 
the 
amount. 
The 
borrower 
will 
retain 
all 
the 
supporting 
documentation 
for 
SOEs, 
including 
completion 
reports and certificates. 
The 
supporting 
documents 
will 
be 
made 
available 
to 
IDA 
during 
project 
supervision and 
will 
be 
audited 
annually 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Association. 
Disbursements 
for 
expenditures above 
these 
thresholds 
will 
be 
made against 
presentation 
of 
full 
documentation 
relating to 
those expenditures. 
During 
the 
project launch 
workshop, there 
will 
be 
a 
session 
on 
proper preparation 
of 
withdrawal 
applications, 
including 
the 
preparation and submission 
of 
required 
supporting 
documents. 
Special Account: 
To 
facilitate 
disbursements against 
eligible 
expenditures 
under 
the 
Grant, the 
Federal 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
(FPCU) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs 
will 
establish 
a Special 
Account 
(SA) 
in 
the 
National 
Bank 
of 
Ethiopia. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
for 
the Special 
Account 
will 
be 
US$ 
3,000,000. 
Upon 
effectiveness, 
IDA 
will 
deposit 
an 
initial 
deposit 
up 
to 
US$ 
1,500,000 
into 
the 
Special 
Account. 
Once 
the 
total 
disbursements 
from 
the 
Credit 
account, 
including 
commitments, 
have reached 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
SDR 
5,000,000, 
the 
initial 
allocation 
may 
be 
increased 
up 
to 
the 
authorized 
allocation. 
The 
FPCU 
will 
submit 
replenishment 
applications at 
least once a 
month. 
The 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
audited 
annually 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
Counterpart fund: 
The 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
will 
open a 
local 
currency account 
in 
a 
commercial 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
and 
will 
deposit 
Birr 
3,210,000 
(USE 375,000 
equivalent) 
for 
the 
first 
project 
year 
and 
subsequent 
deposits 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
each 
project 
year 
based 
on 
the 
annual 
budget 
of 
the 
project.

Summary 
of 
the 
Environmental Assessment and Management Framework 
ETHIOPIA 
Pastoral Community Development Project 
Introduction 
This 
is 
the 
report 
of 
a 
study 
to 
produce 
an 
environmental 
assessment 
management 
framework 
for 
the 
proposed 
Pastoral 
Community 
Development 
Project 
(PCDP) 
for 
which 
the 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
has 
requested 
IDA 
and 
PAD 
financing. 
The 
objectives 
of 
this 
study 
are: 
a 
To 
assess 
the 
potential 
environmental impacts 
of 
the 
proposed Project, whether 
positive or 
negative, 
and propose 
mitigation 
measures 
which 
will 
effectively 
address 
these 
impacts; 
To 
inform 
the 
project 
preparation 
process 
of 
the 
potential impact 
of 
different 
alternatives, and 
relevant 
mitigation 
measures; 
To 
establish 
clear directives and methodologies 
for 
the 
environmental 
screening 
of 
sub-projects 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
The 
study 
was 
carried out 
from 
October-December 
2002, 
which 
included 
two 
consultancy 
team 
missions 
to Ethiopia 
from 
20-30 
October 
2002 
and 
18 
November 
- 
6 
December 
2002, 
the second 
of 
which 
coincided 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
pre-appraisal 
mission, and 
subsequently 
the 
preparation 
of 
this 
draft 
EA 
report. 
The Project 
will 
consist 
of 
three 
components: 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
component. 
This 
component 
focuses 
on 
community 
driven 
development. 
It 
will 
establish 
decentralized 
and participatory 
planning 
at 
wereda 
and 
community 
levels, 
and finance 
community 
development 
projects through 
a 
Community 
Investment 
Fund 
(CIF), 
identified

Major 
EA 
findings 
Environmental sustainability 
is 
fundamental 
to 
sustainable 
pastoral 
livelihoods, 
and 
lowered 
vulnerability 
to 
drought. 
Therefore 
environmental sustainability 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
the 
PCDP. 
There 
is 
a precarious 
balance 
between 
two 
very different 
scenarios: 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
under 
a 
scenario 
of 
a 
successful 
PCDP 
which 
works 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
vision 
and 
approach 
set 
out 
in 
project 
documents, 
the 
PCDP 
would 
make a 
significantly positive 
contribution 
to 
environmental sustainability 
in 
pastoral 
areas; 
On 
the 
other hand, 
under 
a 
scenario 
of 
a 
failing 
project, 
the 
PCDP 
would 
contribute 
to 
marked 
-

Page  101
further 
decline 
in 
environmental sustainability 
in 
pastoral 
areas. 
Discussions 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
pre-appraisal 
mission 
indicates that 
they 
are 
fully 
appreciative 
of 
this 
conclusion. 
Indeed, 
the 
institutional, 
social, 
land 
reform 
and other 
analyses 
that 
are 
being 
carried 
out 
during 
preparation 
will 
lay 
the 
ground 
for 
the 
first, 
successful, scenario. 
This 
conclusion 
emphasizes 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Assessment 
Management 
Framework, 
set 
out 
in 
this 
report, 
to 
ensure 
that 
environmental 
sustainability 
is 
fully 
mainstreamed 
into 
PCDP 
design, 
appraisal, 
and implementation. 
Mitigation 
of 
Potential 
Negative 
Impacts 
The 
potential 
of 
the 
PCDP 
to 
deliver 
positive 
improvements 
in 
reduced 
land 
degradation should far 
outweigh 
any 
localized 
environmental impacts 
of 
activities 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project. 
But 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
overall positive 
impact, 
certain 
of 
the 
project activities 
could 
have 
localized 
negative 
impacts. 
Most 
of 
the developments 
under 
the 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
component and Pastoral 
Risk 
Management 
components 
will 
be small 
in 
scale, 
and the significance 
of 
the 
direct 
negative environmental 
impacts 
is 
likely to 
be 
small. However, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
of 
cumulative 
impacts 
of 
numerous 
small 
projects: 
for 
instance, 
a 
cumulative impact 
of 
building 
construction 
on 
forest 
resources, 
or 
of 
wells 
on 
groundwater. 
Learning 
on 
Environmental 
Impact 
There 
is 
an 
opportunity to 
build 
a 
learning 
approach 
on 
environmental sustainability 
into 
the 
strategic 
management 
and 
direction 
of 
the 
PCDP. 
The 
report 
sets 
out 
an 
environmental 
management 
plan 
(EMP), 
with 
an 
associated 
environmental 
management system (EMS), 
that 
are 
intended to 
be 
fully 
integrated 
into 
the 
Project Implementation Manual. 
This 
integration 
will 
ensure 
that 
environmental 
sustainability 
is 
not 
considered 
in 
isolation 
of 
social, 
economic and 
institutional 
sustainability 
in 
the 
rural 
space. 
The 
environmental 
management 
system 
(EMS) 
is 
based 
on 
a number 
of 
focal 
points 
at 
the 
federal, 
Regional, wereda 
and 
kebele 
levels. 
However 
the 
bulk 
of 
inputs 
to 
the environmental 
management 
system 
(EMS) 
are 
required 
at 
wereda 
and community 
levels. 
In 
addition, 
at 
the 
community 
level, 
there 
is 
an 
opportunity 
to 
reinvigorate traditional 
environmental 
governance, 
through 
its 
use 
in 
training 
and 
sensitization and the 
application 
of 
the 
environmental 
management 
system 
(EMS). 
Capacity-building 
and 
training 
are 
central 
to 
the 
EMP. 
This 
report 
proposes 
that 
this 
should 
include: 
sensitisation among 
Regional 
and 
weveda 
staff 
concerning pastoral 
livelihoods 
and 
pastoralists’ 
coping 
strategies 
towards 
drought; 
sensitisation 
among 
communities and 
kebele leaders 
on how 
to 
integrate 
local 
traditional knowledge 
with 
modem 
administration, 
particularly 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
the 
protection 
and 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
drought contingency planning; 
training 
for 
community 
leaders, 
wereda 
and 
Regional 
officers 
on 
the 
use 
of 
the 
environmental 
screening 
and 
reporting 
system; 
training 
for 
Regional bureau 
officials 
on 
environmental 
impact 
assessment, 
its 
application 
to 
small-scale 
activities, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
environmental 
guidelines 
in 
identifying 
and 
costing 
mitigation 
measures; 
bringing 
together 
groups 
of 
officers 
from 
wereda 
levels, 
to 
encourage 
inter-wereda 
and 
inter-Regional 
learning.

12 
Letter 
of 
Development Policy 
ETHIOPIA 
Pastoral Community Development Project 
Statement 
on 
Pastoral 
Development 
Policy 
Ethiopia 
is 
the 
third 
most populous 
country 
in 
Africa 
with 
a 
projected population 
of 
67 
million 
in 
July 
2002. 
The 
country 
has 
reasonably 
good 
resource 
potential 
for 
development: 
agricultural biodiversity, 
water 
resources, 
minerals 
etc. 
Yet 
Ethiopia 
is 
faced 
with 
complex 
poverty 
that 
is 
broad, 
deep 
and 
structural. 
The 
1980s 
was 
marked 
by 
a 
state 
of 
crisis 
with 
nation wide 
civil 
wars. 
But 
by 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
1990s 
a 
change 
of 
regime 
led 
to 
changes 
in 
economic 
policies 
and 
management 
from 
command 
economic 
system 
and protracted 
civil 
war 
to 
a 
free market 
economy 
and 
relative 
peace. 
Under 
the 
command 
economy 
growth 
plunged 
in 
most 
of 
the 
years, 
accompanied 
by 
loss 
of 
productive 
capacity, competitiveness 
and 
increased 
food 
insecurity. 
Severe 
macroeconomic imbalance and 
instability 
and social 
crisis 
involving 
millions 
of 
displaced 
persons, 
refugees, 
demobilized 
soldiers, 
homelessness 
and 
unemployed 
people 
were 
at 
their 
climax. 
It 
was against 
this 
backdrop that 
the 
then Transitional 
Government 
of 
Ethiopia 
(TGE) 
initiated 
broad 
economic 
reform 
measures 
to 
address 
both 
the 
immediate 
needs 
of 
economic 
recovery and 
reconstruction 
to 
jump 
start 
the 
economy. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
recalled 
that the 
World 
Bank 
played 
a commendable 
role 
in 
those 
critical 
years. 
The 
primary 
notable 
achievement 
of 
Ethiopia 
in 
the 
early 
90s 
was 
the 
end 
of 
internal 
conflict 
followed 
by 
successful 
transition 
from 
a 
command 
economy 
to 
a 
free market 
one. 
Since 
then, 
a 
federal 
system 
of 
government 
has 
been 
put 
in 
place 
with 
the 
1994 
constitution 
guaranteeing 
democratic and human 
rights 
as 
well 
as 
laying 
the 
basis 
for 
devolution 
of 
decision 
malung power 
and responsibilities 
to 
states, 
and 
lower 
echelons 
of 
government, 
creating 
as 
it 
does, 
conditions 
for 
participatory 
development and 
empowerment. 
Ethiopia 
began 
the 
1990s 
with 
a 
clear 
vision 
of 
reversing 
the 
socio- economic 
crisis 
of 
the 
1980s 
and 
rapidly 
transforming 
the 
economy. 
In 
1992193, 
the 
government 
began 
its 
first 
series 
of 
economic 
reform 
programs. 
The 
reform 
programs 
were 
aimed 
at 
reorienting 
the 
economy 
from 
command 
to 
market 
economy, 
rationalizing 
the 
role 
of 
the 
state 
and creating 
legal, 
institutional 
and 
policy 
environment 
to 
enhance 
private 
sector development. 
Adjustment 
policies 
were focused 
on 
liberalization 
of 
prices and 
markets, 
removal 
of 
subsidies, 
reduction 
of 
tariffs 
and current 
account 
convertibility. 
These 
measures 
were 
underpinned 
by 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
policy 
discipline. 
The 
favorable 
policy 
environment 
created 
by 
the economic 
reform, coupled 
with 
macro-economic 
stability 
invigorated 
the 
domestic 
private 
sector, 
which 
was 
suppressed 
during 
the 
previous 
regime. 
To 
further 
consolidate 
the 
gains 
of 
the 
199Os, 
the 
government 
has 
come 
up 
with 
detailed 
policies 
and 
strategies 
recently; 
Rural 
and 
Agricultural 
Development 
policy 
and 
strategy, 
(wherein 
the 
pastoral 
development 
policy 
is 
outlined) 
the 
Food 
Security 
Strategy, 
Capacity 
Building 
Strategy 
and 
Programs, 
Strategy 
for 
Democratization, 
a Sustainable 
Development 
and 
Poverty Reduction Program 
which 
tries 
to 
tie 
up 
the 
thrust 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
polices 
and 
strategies. 
- 
96

Page  103
In 
all 
these 
policies 
and 
strategies 
the 
govemment 
has 
tried 
to 
give 
due 
emphasis 
to 
the 
question 
of 
pastoral 
development. 
To 
that 
end 
it 
has 
come 
up 
with 
an 
outline 
of 
pastoral development 
and 
good 
governance 
policy 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
program 
and 
project formulation 
since 
last 
year. 
A. 
The 
Existing 
Conditions 
in 
Pastoral 
Areas 
Pastoralists 
inhabit 
over 
half 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
territory. 
There 
are 
at 
least 
120 
districts 
(Woredas) 
in 
all, 
51 
in 
Somali 
state, 
29 
in 
Afar 
state, 
33 
in 
Oromia 
state 
and 
7 
in 
the 
Southem 
Nations 
and 
nationalities 
state. 
The 
total population 
of 
Pastoralists 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
over 
7 
million. 
Pastoral 
areas 
have numerous 
natural 
resource 
potential. 
The 
fertile soil 
and water 
deposited 
by 
big 
rivers 
such 
as 
Awash, Wabishebelle, 
Genale, 
Dawa, 
Om0 
and others create 
the 
potential 
for 
irrigated 
pasture and 
farming. 
It 
is 
therefore possible 
to 
obtain sufficient 
water 
for 
human 
consumption and 
irrigation. 
The 
water 
resource 
is 
also essential 
for 
the 
production 
of 
fodder, 
trees, 
vegetables 
and 
fruits. 
Moreover, 
the 
recurrent drought 
in 
the 
pastoral 
areas 
is 
a testimony 
of 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
rainfall. 
The 
evidence 
is 
abundantly 
clear that 
no 
meaningful 
development 
is 
possible 
without 
water 
resources. Pastoralists 
in 
Ethiopia 
are 
mobile 
in 
search 
of 
water 
and 
pasture.  Indeed, 
it 
is 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
household, 
consisting 
of 
young boys 
and 
adult 
men 
who 
travel 
long 
distances 
and 
stay 
with 
the 
herds 
long. 
Women, 
children 
and 
older 
folks 
stay 
behind 
with 
the 
frail 
stock 
and 
lactating 
cows 
in 
semi-permanent residences. 
Furthermore, among the 
Somali 
and 
Afar, 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
pastoralists have 
been 
naturally 
settling 
down 
along 
the banks 
of 
major 
rivers, 
and 
their 
livelihood 
has 
gradually 
been converted 
into 
agro-pastoralism. 
This 
suggests 
that a 
good 
portion 
of 
these 
pastoralists 
would 
undergo 
voluntary 
sedenterization. 
Opportunities 
for 
such 
are 
created 
by 
perennial 
rivers 
flowing 
from 
highland 
areas 
of 
the 
country and 
carrying 
rich 
soil 
deposited 
along 
the 
river 
banks. 
Issues 
of 
upper 
and 
lower riparian 
states are 
expected 
to 
be handled bilaterally, 
but 
since 
no 
big 
dams' 
construction 
is 
envisaged, 
the 
question 
may not 
arise 
at 
all. 
Most 
of 
our 
major 
rivers 
do 
not 
cross 
the 
border, 
anyway. 
Marketing 
is 
also another 
critical 
problem 
for 
pastoralists. 
More 
often 
than 
not, pastoralists 
are 
unable 
to 
find 
fair 
prices 
for 
their 
livestock. 
There 
are 
no 
markets 
where 
they 
could 
get 
consumer 
goods. 
Pastoralists 
are 
forced 
to 
sell 
their 
products at 
an 
illicit 
market 
in 
which 
they 
get 
exorbitantly 
low 
prices. 
More 
importantly, 
the pastoralist 
states 
have become 
the 
dumping 
grounds 
of 
contraband 
goods 
or 
the 
launching 
pads 
for 
illicit 
cross 
border 
trade 
in 
Ethiopia. 
A 
feature 
of 
all 
pastoral 
areas 
is 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
roads. 
Where 
there 
is 
access 
to main 
roads 
like 
the 
Addis 
Ababa 
Djibouti 
road, 
there 
are 
no 
feeder 
roads 
specifically 
designed 
to 
reach 
the 
pastoral 
communities. 
Yet 
another 
important 
aspect 
of 
pastoral 
life 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
basic 
services. 
For 
example, the 
gross 
enrollment 
ratio 
in 
primary 
schools 
for 
the 
country 
is 
now 
nearly 
62 
percent. 
In 
the 
pastoral 
states 
it 
is 
12.6% 
for 
Afar 
and 
13.1% 
for 
Somali. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
that 
there 
are 
fewer 
schools 
and 
fewer 
teachers 
in 
the 
pastoral 
states 
but 
also 
less 
pupils 
coming 
to 
attend 
in 
the 
already 
existing 
schools. 
This 
calls 
for 
different 
arrangements 
including boarding 
schools, hostels, 
school 
meals and other support 
systems 
for 
the 
children 
of 
pastoralists. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
for 
health 
posts 
and 
clinics. 
In 
short, 
we 
have 
phantom 
schools 
and 
phantom clinics. 
Of 
course, 
there 
are 
ways 
to 
overcome 
these 
initial 
bottlenecks 
by 
providing 
hostels 
and 
boarding 
schools, 
although 
the 
local 
resource 
is 
meager. 
Particular attention 
could 
be 
given 
to 
female education 
in 
this 
context. 
Denying 
access 
of 
modem 
education 
to 
pastoralist 
children 
is 
not only 
unacceptable 
but 
also unconstitutional. 
Furthermore, 
modem 
education 
is 
possible 
only 
in 
a 
settled 
environment. 
Without modem 
education, 
- 
97 
- 
Page  104
there 
are 
no 
prospects 
of 
changing pastoral 
life 
and 
livelihood. 
B. 
The 
Development 
Policy 
for 
Pastoralists 
L 
Policy, 
vision and 
issues 
Phased 
voluntary 
sedenterization 
along 
the 
banks 
of 
the 
major 
rivers 
as 
the 
main 
direction 
of 
transforming 
pastoral 
societies 
into 
ago-pastoral 
system, 
from 
mobility 
to 
sedentary 
life, 
from 
rural 
to 
small 
pastoral towns and urbanization. 
Complementing 
sedenterization 
by 
micro 
and small 
enterprises development 
in 
the 
urban 
centers 
and 
off 
farm 
activities 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Undertakmg 
integrated 
development 
with 
irrigation 
as 
the 
basis 
and 
livestock production 
as 
the 
focus, 
complemented 
by 
static 
and 
mobile 
education 
and health 
services 
as 
well 
as 
rural 
roads, 
rural 
energy 
and 
water 
supply, 
rural 
telephone service etc. 
Coordinated 
and concerted federal 
support, 
program 
ownership 
by 
the 
Regional 
States 
and 
communities, enabling 
them through 
support 
in 
capacity 
building, 
to lead 
the 
development 
work 
at 
all 
levels. 
Allow, 
enable 
and coordinate 
private 
sector 
and 
NGO 
to 
play 
positive 
role 
in 
line 
with 
the 
policy 
direction 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
broad program 
and 
strategy, 
after 
mobilizing 
their 
own 
resources. 
Tap indigenous 
knowledge and 
skills 
on 
animal 
husbandry 
and 
rangeland 
management. 
IL 
Objectives 
a) 
Transforming 
the 
pastoral 
societies 
to 
agro-pastoral 
life 
complemented 
by 
urbanization. 
b) 
Promote 
integrated 
rural 
development 
and 
rural 
urban 
link 
by 
way 
of 
sustainable 
growth 
of 
agriculture-especially-livestock 
productivity 
geared 
to 
market 
needs 
to 
raise income 
and 
overall 
living 
standards 
of 
the 
pastoralists. 
c) 
Promote 
modern 
education 
to 
over 
90% 
primary 
education 
coverage 
by 
2015 
and vocational 
training 
as 
well 
as 
access 
to 
tertiary 
and 
higher 
education. 
Vocational 
training 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
education 
is 
needed 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
skilled 
human 
resources 
to 
promote 
development 
and 
full 
transformation. 
d) 
Promote 
urbanization 
and 
industrialization 
by 
way 
of 
micro 
and 
small 
enterprises, 
agro-processing, trade 
and 
others, and reduce 
poverty 
among 
the 
pastoralists. 
IIL 
The 
Establishment 
of 
a 
Fair 
Market 
System 
The 
life 
of 
the pastoralist 
is 
based 
on 
livestock production. 
But 
viable marketing 
outlet 
where 
the 
pastoralists 
could 
sell 
their 
livestock 
and 
in 
exchange 
obtain 
the 
necessary 
industrial 
consumer 
items 
for 
their 
needs has 
not 
been 
established. 
Making 
information 
on 
prices and 
livestock 
market 
outlet 
for 
the 
pastoralists 
should 
be 
part 
of 
the 
development 
program. 
Border 
trade 
deprives 
them 
from 
getting 
fair 
prices 
for 
their 
livestock. 
Their 
economy 
has 
not 
been 
integrated 
into 
the 
national 
economy at 
large. 
In 
order 
to improve 
the 
problem 
of 
marketing 
one 
alternative 
to 
consider 
is 
to 
-

Page  105
organize 
the pastoralists 
into 
co-operatives. 
The 
private 
sector 
is 
expected 
to 
get 
involved 
heavily 
in 
this 
system. 
Small market 
centers 
will 
soon 
grow 
into 
pastoral 
towns, where 
small 
and 
micro 
enterprises 
related 
to 
dairy, 
meat 
and 
other 
animal 
products 
could 
be 
semi-processed. 
Consumer 
items 
and 
services 
from 
bigger 
cities 
and towns 
would 
also 
be 
available 
improving 
the 
urban- 
rural 
linkage. 
IV. 
Provision 
of 
Suitable Social 
Services to 
the 
Pastoralists 
The 
livelihood 
of 
pastoral communities 
is 
based 
on 
livestock 
production 
for 
which 
they 
are 
forced 
to 
move 
from 
place 
to 
place 
in 
search 
of 
pasture 
and 
water. 
There 
have 
been 
some 
efforts 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
social 
services 
to 
date 
but 
these 
have 
been 
quite 
meager 
and 
inadequate. 
Provision 
of 
social 
services 
to 
the 
pastoral communities, 
require 
adequate 
needs 
assessment 
prior 
to 
establishment 
and that 
services 
be 
utilized 
to 
the 
maximum 
degree. 
The 
government 
is 
committed 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
sufficient 
social 
services 
both 
for 
the 
settled 
and 
mobile 
ones, 
especially 
first 
cycle 
primary 
education 
to 
be 
taught 
in 
vernacular languages 
by 
recruiting 
teachers 
from 
the 
communities 
and 
primary 
health 
care. 
Intermediate 
and 
vocational 
training 
on 
animal 
husbandry, 
marketing, 
processing 
of 
small-scale 
dairy, leather and meat 
could 
continue 
thereafter. 
Pastoral towns 
where 
service 
provision 
and 
markets 
are 
the 
main 
activities 
will 
lead 
to 
urbanization. 
V. 
The 
Expansion 
of 
Infrastructure  to 
Improve 
Livestock 
Marketing 
The 
existing 
provision 
of 
road 
transport, 
electricity, 
telecomm-unication 
and 
water 
is 
insignificant 
judging 
from 
the 
size 
of 
the 
population 
to 
be 
served. 
Mainly 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
infrastructure, 
pastoralists were 
unable 
to 
get 
the 
necessary 
social 
services. 
Pastoralists 
are 
endowed 
with 
vast 
natural 
resources 
and 
yet 
due 
to lack 
of 
infrastructure, investors 
were 
not 
attracted 
to 
these 
areas. 
The 
government 
of 
Ethiopia 
thinks 
that 
roads 
and 
other 
infrastructure 
should 
focus 
on 
those 
areas 
where 
future 
settlements 
will 
take place. 
Major 
and 
perennial riverbanks should 
in 
turn 
be 
linked 
to 
major 
roads 
and towns. 
1. 
Priority 
should 
be 
given 
to 
areas 
that 
have already 
settled 
In 
both 
Somali and 
Afar 
States, 
agro-pastoralism 
has 
been 
going 
on 
spontaneously 
for 
decades. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that around 
20% 
of 
Afars 
and 
more 
than 
30% 
of 
Somalis 
are 
already 
settled. 
The 
settlement 
sites 
have 
been 
almost 
invariably 
along 
the 
banks 
of 
major 
rivers 
such 
as 
the 
Awash 
and 
Wabi 
Shebelle. 
There 
is 
no 
stronger 
proof 
to 
voluntary 
settlement 
than 
the 
spontaneous 
sedentarization 
witnessed 
in 
the 
last 
30-40 
years. 
What 
the 
government 
needs 
is 
to 
augment 
and 
accelerate 
the 
process 
already charted out 
by 
the 
pastoralists 
themselves. 
2. 
Policies 
and 
strategies 
should 
be tested 
through pilot 
studies 
The 
Modus 
Operandi 
of 
development 
policies 
and 
strategies 
in 
pastoral 
areas 
should 
be 
based 
on 
field 
studies. 
When 
and 
where 
success 
is 
scored, 
the 
experience 
could 
be 
disseminated and 
scaled 
up 
with 
some 
adjustments 
to 
specific 
local 
conditions. 
For 
the 
year 
2002103, 
the 
federal 
and 
state 
governments have selected 
3 
districts 
(Woredas) 
in 
Afar, 
3 
districts 
in 
Somali 
state, 
2 
districts 
in 
Oromia 
and 
one 
district 
in 
Southern 
Nations 
and 
Nationalities 
state 
to 
verify 
and 
try 
out 
the 
new 
strategy 
of 
pastoral 
development. 
In 
each Woreda, 
a 
number 
of 
villages 
(clans) 
have 
already 
been 
selected and the 
implementation 
program 
already 
begun 
in 
December 
2002. 
Project 
offices specifically 
organized 
to follow 
the 
pilot 
sites 
are 
already 
in 
place and 
quarterly 
assessments 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
activities need 
to 
be 
done.

Page  106
3. 
All 
government interventions should ensure 
the 
participation and 
full 
consent 
of 
the 
pastoralists 
Although 
pastoralists 
do 
have a 
huge 
potential 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
a 
stock 
of 
assets 
in 
terms 
of 
livestock, 
a 
consensus 
has 
to 
be 
reached 
that 
they 
have 
never 
had 
the 
chance 
to 
realize 
their 
full 
potential 
because 
of 
lack 
of 
good 
governance 
and 
appropriate 
development 
policies 
and 
strategies. 
It 
is 
imperative 
that 
consensus 
be 
reached 
between 
the 
pastoralists 
and 
the 
government 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
sedentarization since 
the 
pastoral 
way 
of 
life 
can 
no 
more 
become a sustainable 
means 
of 
livelihood. 
Government 
effort 
in 
this 
respect 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
force 
of 
examples, 
to 
results 
and 
demonstrative outcomes 
in 
situ, 
to 
learning 
by 
doing. 
4. 
The 
main 
entry 
point 
for pastoral 
development 
intervention 
is 
a 
clan 
or a 
number 
of 
associated 
clans 
Although 
there 
may 
be 
some 
important 
interventions 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
household, 
clan 
is 
the 
entry 
point to 
introduce 
new 
technologies 
for 
livestock 
development. 
In 
this 
regard, 
clan 
and 
traditional 
elders 
are 
expected 
to 
have a 
major 
part 
in 
the 
overall 
attempt 
to 
change 
pastoral 
life. 
Clans 
will 
set 
priorities 
and 
their 
traditional 
wisdom 
and 
skills 
could 
be 
made 
use 
of 
to 
the 
utmost 
possible. 
The direction 
is 
to 
enable 
clan 
members 
to 
have a 
sense 
of 
ownership 
in 
all 
development 
efforts. 
5. 
All 
development interventions 
shall 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
joint 
and 
coordinated 
effort 
of 
the 
federal and 
state 
governments 
The 
federal 
inter-ministerial 
board 
members 
include: 
(a) 
Ministry 
of 
Federal 
Affairs 
(b) 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
(c) 
Ministry 
of 
Water 
Resources 
(d)

(g) 
Ministry 
of 
Revenues 
(h) 
Ministry 
of

and 
Industry 
(i) 
Ministry 
of 
Infrastructure. 
There 
is 
also an 
inter-ministerial 
technical committee 
whose 
main 
responsibilities 
are 
focused 
on 
capacity 
building 
of 
pastoral 
states 
at 
all 
levels. 
6. 
Combining 
good governance 
andpastoral 
development 
The 
role 
of 
the 
state 
in 
our context 
is 
developmental. 
It 
sets 
the 
vision, 
policy 
and 
direction. 
It 
is 
both 
bottom 
up 
and 
top 
down 
in 
unison. 
- 
100- 
Page  107
The 
civil 
service 
reform 
unfolding 
all 
over 
the 
country 
is 
all-inclusive. 
It 
has 
a strong human 
resource development 
program 
amongst others. 
The 
pastoral 
states 
need 
a 
competent 
civil 
service 
at 
the 
state 
level 
to 
start 
with. 
This 
needs 
recruitment 
of 
able and experienced 
civil 
servants 
from 
other 
parts 
of 
Ethiopia 
in 
the 
short 
and 
medium-term. 
The 
long-term 
solution, 
however, 
is 
to 
train 
the 
indigenous people 
from 
the 
states. 
So 
far, 
the 
civil 
service 
college 
has 
trained 
several 
hundred 
for 
Somali 
but 
much 
less 
for 
Afar. 
While 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
college 
needs 
redoubling, 
local 
capacities 
in 
each 
state 
should 
be 
developed. 
The 
training 
of 
veterinary 
technicians, water technicians, 
health 
workers and 
teachers 
for 
primary 
schools 
should 
be 
done 
locally. 
7. 
Supporting 
the 
local government structure 
at 
the district level 
Good 
governance 
ultimately 
means 
a 
government 
that 
is 
corruption 
free, 
responsible 
and 
sensitive. 
It 
is 
meaningless 
to 
talk 
about kebeles 
in 
pastoral 
areas. 
What 
we 
have 
instead 
is 
clans 
(communities) and 
their 
leaders. 
Empowering 
and 
recognition 
of 
the 
traditional 
leadership 
and 
blending 
them 
to 
democratic 
rules 
and 
procedures 
is 
mandatory 
if 
some 
real 
steps 
towards 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
is 
to 
be 
attained. 
The 
level 
of 
government where 
modem 
and 
traditional 
leadership 
can 
be 
blended 
is 
the 
district. 
While 
the 
clan 
(Kebele) 
administration 
can 
be mobile, 
the 
district 
government 
will 
of 
necessity 
be 
static. 
In 
building 
institutions 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
the 
district 
governments’ 
capacity 
should 
be 
supported 
through 
short 
courses 
for 
its 
elected 
andlor 
appointed 
officers 
as 
well 
as 
with 
resources 
to improve 
its 
social and 
physical 
infrastructure. 
8. 
Donors and 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
pastoral 
development 
are 
expected 
to 
work 
in 
line 
with 
government 
polices. 
Government 
policy 
in 
pastoral 
development 
is 
gradual 
settlement 
along 
the banks 
of 
major 
rivers, 
an 
economy based 
on 
animal 
husbandry, 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
pastoral 
economy 
with 
that 
of 
the 
farmers 
and 
industrial 
development 
in 
the 
urban 
areas. 
Non- 
govemmental organizations 
and the 
private 
sector have 
a 
major 
role 
to 
play 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
service 
provision 
and 
creating 
a market 
favorable 
to 
the 
pastoralists and 
the 
national 
economy. 
All 
donors, 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
are 
expected 
to 
work 
together 
in 
line 
with 
the 
said 
policy. 
Furthermore, 
they 
are 
expected 
to solicit 
their 
own 
resources 
in 
order 
to work 
in 
partnership. 
Finally, 
the 
proposal 
is 
to 
support the 
29 
districts 
of 
Afar 
state, 
5 
1 
districts 
of 
Somali 
state, 
33 
districts 
in 
Oromia 
and 
7 
districts 
in 
Southem region. 
With 
this, 
the 
road map 
for 
pastoral 
development has 
been 
charted, 
but 
the 
real 
first 
steps 
need 
to 
be taken 
as 
yet.
