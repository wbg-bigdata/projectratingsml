                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

The proposed changes relate to: (i) an extension of Closing Date of the Loan by 12 months, from
the original December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013; (ii) reallocation of Loan proceeds and
increase of disbursement percentage; and (iii) addition of a legal covenant to enable the Bank to
monitor, more efficiently, the activities related to resettlement, until completion.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Background:

The objective of the project is to assist the Borrower to increase the access and mobility of
Guiyang Municipality’s transport users through priority infrastructure investments while
establishing more sustainable mechanisms for rural road maintenance, as well as enhancing
capacity for keeping municipal debt under control.

Originally, the project consisted of three parts:

Part A- Youxiao Road: Construction of about 7 kilometers of urban arterial road to provide
access between Youzhajie, located in the southeastern corner of Guiyang’s urban core and
Xiaobi in the Longdongbao area, including road, tunnel, and bridge civil works.

Part B- Rural Transport: Construction and rehabilitation of about 44 selected rural road segments
to Class III or Class IV national technical standard of the Ministry of Communications of the
Borrower with an aggregate length of about 903kms (668kms of main roads and 235kms of
access roads) and construction of about 45 rural bus stations to Class IV and Class V national
standard of the Ministry of Communications of the Borrower and one rural freight depot.

In March 2012, through an amendment, Part B was modified as follows:

“Part B: Rural Transport
 1. Construction and rehabilitation of about 10 selected rural road segments to Class III or Class IV
     national technical standard of the Ministry of Transport of the Borrower with an aggregate length
     of about 258.3 kms (168.3 kms of main roads and 90 kms of access roads) and construction of
     about 9 rural bus stations to Class IV and Class V national standard of the Ministry of Transport of
     the Borrower and one rural freight depot.
 2. Construction and rehabilitation of 1 rural road segment to Class IV national technical standard of
     the Ministry of Transport of the Borrower with an aggregate length of about 11.8 kms and
     construction of about 6 rural bus stations to Class IV and Class V national standard of the Ministry
     of Transport of the Borrower.?

Part C-Institutional Development: Strengthening the long-term institutional capacity of Guiyang
Municipality to develop the transport sector through: (i) a traffic survey; (ii) technical assistance
in rural road maintenance system; (iii) technical assistance in a debt management system; and
(iv) training activities.
Current Status:

With respect to Part A, the construction of Youxiao Road was completed on February 5, 2010,
and the Road has been under normal operation since then.

With respect to Part B, 8 roads, 9 bus stations and 1 freight depot from Batch-1 are under
construction and will be completed before the end of 2012. Two roads from the same Batch 1
are planned to be completed by middle of 2013. All works in Batch-2 of Part B, including 1 road
and 6 bus stations, will be completed by the end of 2012.

For Part C, all the technical assistance studies have been completed; and all training programs
are progressing well and will be completed by the end of 2012, except for one international study
tour, which is expected to be completed by middle of 2013.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

      Extension of Closing Date. Two rural roads of Batch-1 can only be completed by June
       2013. The first one is the Xiaohegou-Shuikou Road, which suffered from delays due to
       land acquisition and difficult geotechnical condition during the construction. The second
       one is the Zhuhua-Xinyang Road, which was, after substantial completion, damaged due
       to land slide, and will need to be rehabilitated. In addition, an international study tour
       which had been planned for 2012, can only be conducted in 2013 because of the
       government’s quota control system. In order to complete the above mentioned project
       activities and allow sufficient time to process disbursements, an extension of Closing
       Date of the Loan by 12 months is recommended. (See Annex 1).

      Reallocation of Loan proceeds and increase of disbursement percentage. The Loan
       proceeds have been reallocated twice already, on June 8, 2010 and March 5, 2012,
       respectively. The proposed amendments pertain to a reallocation of funds from Category
       (4) to Category (3), and increase in the percentages of expenditures financed by the Bank
       from the Loan proceeds in Category (1)(b) and Category (1)(c). The reallocation will
       come from the funds saved from Category (4) (Interest), and will fill in the funding gap
       for training. The increase in disbursement percentages will also ensure that the Bank
       loan portion in the retention money for the works that have been completed can be
       withdrawn in advance before the Loan closing. (See Annex 2)

      Addition of a legal covenant. Considering that the implementation of the resettlement
       plan will not be fully completed by the proposed extended Loan Closing Date, since the
       last batch of resettlement housing is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 only,
       after discussions with the Bank team, the Guiyang Municipal Government has committed
       to continue reporting, and further ensuring and facilitating the Bank team’s work
       regarding the supervision and monitoring, with the assistance of the external consultant if
       needed, of all resettlement activities under the Project until their full completion and
       beyond the proposed extended loan Closing Date. Accordingly, the Project Agreement
       will be amended to include a covenant requesting Guiyang to report to the Bank on
       resettlement progress after loan closing. The Bank team will keep close monitoring on
       the construction progress of the resettlement housing till the full completion based on the
       milestones set in the working plan.
D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

  The Borrower’s Ministry of Finance has submitted a request for amendments through its
  letters on November 27, 2012.

  Based on the Bank team’s assessment, the proposed changes will neither entail any change to
  the original project development objectives, nor impact the achievement of said objectives.
  Also, with the proposed project restructuring, the original development objectives will
  continue to be achievable.
