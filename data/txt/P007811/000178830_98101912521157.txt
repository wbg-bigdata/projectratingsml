APPRAISAL OF THE
CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Corporacion Financiera Nacional (COFINA) was established in
December 1975 as an autonomous Government-owned development finance company
to promote and finance productive industrial enterprises in accordance with
Government (GOP) development objectives, and to encourage increased commercial
bank financing of industry through cofinancing. The first Bank loan to COFINA,
Loan 1641-PAN for $15.0 million 1/, was approved in December 1978, but did
not become effective until September 1979 due to the fact that COFINA had
undertaken engagements in excess of the exposure limit specified in its
Policy Statement. GOP finally extended the general guarantees required for
these engagements, as a condition of effectiveness 2/.
1.02      Once effective, Loan 1641-PAN has been utilized rapidly.  As of
February 6, 1981, the Bank had authorized 37 subprojects for a total of
$12.5 million, and $7.7 million had been disbursed. Through these subloans,
the Bank has been COFINA's main source of funds for its term lending. The
subloans have been well diversified by subsectors, the largest being oil and
chemical industries ($2.6 million for five subprojects), textiles and garments
($2.3 million for four), non-metallic minerals ($2.0 million for one), metal
industries ($1.7 million for seven), food industries including fisheries ($0.7
million for five) and tourism ($0.8 million for two subprojects). The employ-
ment impact of these subprojects is roughly in line with COFINA's overall
operations, which in 1979 and 1980 (first half) had an average fixed cost per
job of $17,600 (para 5.09). However, other objectives of Loan 1641-PAN were
not fully met. Management problems and the loss of senior staff arrested
COFINA's institutional development, which prevented it from becoming as
important a catalyst for industrial resource mobilization as expected (paras
4.01, 4.06, 4.18). Also, as discussed in para 2.18, the envisaged industrial
survey did not materialize as scheduled.
1.03      Under COFINA's present management, which came to COFINA in April
1980, a number of institutional improvements have taken place, and others are
under preparation (Section 4). This progress deser-ves the Bank's support.
1/   This loan consists of three components:  $13.9 million for COFINA sub-
projects, $0.1 million for COFINA's training program (unused amounts may
be utilized for subprojects), and $1.0 million for lending to small scale
industries through the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MICI). The
utilization of the latter component was delayed due to problems in
reaching agreement on a subsidiary loan agreement (COFINA-MICI) satisfac-
tory to the Bank. Such an agreement has now been signed.
2/   Under the proposed loan, these guarantees have been strengthened and made
more explicit (para 6.07).



Under Loan 1641-PAN, there is now an unauthorized amount for COFINA's
subprojects of only US$1.5 million, which will be authorized over the next
few months, well in advance of the contractual final commitment date of
December 31, 1981. Accordingly, this report recommends a second loan to
COFINA of US$20.0 million, which would cover about 54% of its projected
commitments for the period January 1981-June 1983.
II. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
General 1/
2.01      Panama's geographic location and spatial configuration have been
the country's main natural assets. The canal is the largest single source of
employment, and has given the impetus to a wide range of commercial, financial,
and administrative services located in the metropolitan region, primarily
in Panama City. As a result, this region has been developing rapidly since
Panama's independence. On the other hand, most of the rural population was
traditionally engaged in subsistence agriculture, with few economic ties to
the metropolitan region. The Revolutionary Government that came to power in
1968 took a number of measures to reduce differentials in living standards,
in particular between the urban and rural areas. As a result of substantial
investments in water supply, health, and education, Panama is now becoming
one of the healthiest and best educated countries in the developing world,
with a rapidly falling rate of population growth.  However, these policies put
a considerable strain on GOP's resources, while production and investment
stagnated in the years after 1974. Accordingly, starting in 1976 GOP began a
period of readjustment, including pricing policy changes for agricultural
products, increased incentives for private investments, and modifications in
the labor legislation.
2.02      As a result of its location, Panama's economy is largely oriented to-
wards services, which in 1979 accounted for 62.7% of GDP (Table 1), up from
58.0% in 1960 due to rapid growth for subsectors like banking and finance and
transport and communications. On the other hand, the primary industries
(agriculture, forestry, and fisheries) declined from 23.0% to 15.1% of GDP
over this period, while manufacturing grew in the sixties, and declined in
relative terms in the seventies (para 2.04). The service industries are
concentrated largely in the provinces of Panama and Colon, which in 1978
accounted for 72% of GDP, although they only had half of the country's
population.
1/   A more detailed assessment of the prospects for Panama's economy is
contained in Report No. 2306-PAN of July 20, 1979: "Panama's Development
in the 1980's: A Special Economic Report." An updated Economic Memorandum
will be available in early 1981.

2.03      After a period of rapid, although unbalanced, economic growth in
the sixties, the growth rate of the Panamanian economy gradually dropped
during 1969-77, and during 1975-77 Panama underwent its worst depression since
the late 1940s, caused by increasing oil prices, the international recession,
and the collapse in 1973 of an urban housing boom. In 1978, GDP grew by 3.7%,
followed by 4.9% (preliminary figure) in 1979. This improved growth came
largely from services such as transportation and communications (up by 15.1%
in 1979), and banking and finance (9.8%). In 1979, the manufacturing sector
grew by 5.5%. This economic recovery is due to a nuamber of factors including
the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty, which removed an important source
of political uncertainty for the private sector. In view of the expected
continued growth in the financial and transportation sectors, the longer-term
growth prospects are good for Panama's economy. At present, the economic
recovery is also aided by a revival in the construction industry; this,
however, may not last at its present strength much beyond 1981.
The Manufacturing Sector
2.04      Recent Performance.  The manufacturing sector in Panama grew by more
than 10% p.a. during the period 1960-1970, based largely on import substitution
industrialization. However, the growth rates fell in the early seventies, and
the sector underwent a pronounced slump between 1974 and 1978. In this period,
real output declined by 14%, and the sector's contribution to GDP fell to 13%
from a high (1970) of 17%. The growth rate started to recover in 1978, and in
1979 manufacturing value added increased by 5.5% in real terms, or slightly
more than the growth in GDP of 4.9%. In spite of this improvement, the 1979
real manufacturing value added (1960 prices) of $166 million was still below
the $185 million achieved in 1973.



- 4 -
2.05      The decline in the mid seventies was caused largely by a fall in
local demand in response to Panama's general economic difficulties in this
period (para 2.03), in particular the contraction of construction investment.
In addition, there was little new investment in manufacturing. The easy
options for import substitution had already been taken, and the investment
climate was affected negatively by the political uncertainties surrounding the
canal negotiations, widespread price controls (para 2.14), and GOP's labor
policies (para 2.13). As discussed below, the modifications in GOP's policies
in the latter areas, combined with the signing of the Canal Treaty, have
caused a considerable improvement in private sector investment interest.
Manufacturing output is now also stimulated by a renewed growth in urban
construction activities. The strong growth trend in 1979 (para 2.04) seems to
have continued in 1980. In particular, there has been a significant increase
in manufactured exports; these were about $7 million (FOB) in 1978, $9 million
in 1979, and have been estimated at $14 million for the period January-August
1980.
2.06      Subsector Distribution.  The manufacturing sector in Panama is
engaged primarily in the production of consumer goods, which in 1979 accounted
for 60% of total manufacturing value added. Intermediate goods such as
chemicals, paper products, and petroleum products accounted for 24% (Table 2).

2.07      Among the consumer goods subsectors, the most important is food pro-
cessing, which in 1979 accounted for 26% of total manufacturing value added.
This subsector has shown a relative decline since 1970, due to the stagnation
in Panama's agricultural sector, and also to GOP's price control policy, which
has affected negatively a number of basic food products (para 2.14). On the
other hand, the beverages subsector has grown considerably since 1970, and
now accounts for 18% of total manufacturing value added.  The decline since
1970 for the intermediate goods subsectors is largely due to problems for



the petroleum products industry, plus a substantial decline in the printing
industry due to the closing of an international printing facility in Panama.
2.08      Location.  Panama City has the heaviest concentration of manufactur-
ing activity in the country, with 73% of all organized private enterprises
(with five or more employees), and also 73% of employment (1976 figures).
Other areas with some industrial concentration are Chiriqui (10% of all
enterprises), Colon (5%), and Herrera (4%). The concentration in Panama City
is understandable in view of its infrastructure and other facilities, and also
because the Panama region represents the major local market. GOP has sought
to encourage decentralization through fiscal incentives (para 2.15), but these
have not been very successful. However, it is likely that the present expan-
sion of the Colon Free Zone will cause an increase in manufacturing activities
in that area. Furthermore, there should be good prospects for future growth in
agroindustries in the Chiriqui area, which has the best agricultural land in
the country.
2.09      Size Distribution and Employment.  In 1976 there were 637 firms with
five or more employees. Of these, 141 private companies with fifty or more
employees accounted for 69% of total sales, and 64% of employment.  In the
organized sector firms tend to be capital intensive, due largely to the
types of industries that have grown up in Panama.  In addition, the incentive
structure tends to encourage capital intensive investments (para 2.17), and
many manufacturing plants are operating below full capacity, often only
with one shift. The manufacturing sector employs about 47,000 people, or
10% of Panama's labor force. Of these, the organized private sector employs
27,000, with another 20,000 being employed in the small scale and public
manufacturing sectors. Among the manufacturing slabsectors, food products
accounted (1975) for 29% of organized employment, and the garment industry for
15%. No reliable figures are available on the investment costs per job for
the various manufacturing subsectors.
2.10      Investment.  Although the available manufacturing investment statis-
tics are incomplete, data prepared by the Controller General's office show
gross manufacturing investments (including increases in working capital) of
$50 million in 1973, $31 million in 1977, $35 million in 1978, and $37 million
in 1979. For the latter year, the investments would correspond to about 1.4%
of GDP. These figures indicate a slow but steady growth in manufacturing
investments from a low point in 1977, but with total investments below the
1973 level. The gross investments for 1980 could be around $49 million, and
are expected to be about $55 million per year for the period 1981-83. However,
the figures may understate the increase in investments that has actually taken
place over the last few years. An indication of this is that domestic loans
for industry from commercial banks, which were $139 million as of December
1977, grew at an annual rate of 25% to $217 million as of December 1979, and
further by 14% to $248 million as of June 1980, in spite of the high interest
rates in effect during most of the latter period. Foreign investments played
an important role through 1973, and has lately been showing renewed interest.
It is likely that in the future, foreign investment will again play a consid-
erable role, including investments under the Maquila program (para 2.15).



-6-
The Tourism Sector
2.11      Panama is not a major tourist destination.  However, the number of
visitors 1/ to the country has been increasing steadily, from 123,000 in 1968
to 385,000 in 1978. The annual growth rate from 1975 to 1978 was 11.4%.
About 60% of the visitors arrive at Tocumen International Airport; the average
stay for these visitors has been increasing, and is now about 7.9 nights
(based on a 1977 survey). South and Central America accounted for 50% of the
air visitors, and North America for 39%, measured by visitor nights.  A major
portion of the visitors to Panama arrive on business; accordingly, there is
considerable demand for first-class hotel rooms in Panama City. In 1978,
there were 1,063 such rooms available in five hotels, which had an average
annual occupancy rate of 81% (1976: 72%).
2.12      Several new hotel projects are now under construction (with COFINA
participation), which should give 2,114 first-class rooms by 1984 (including the
expansion of some existing hotels). Assuming 10% annual growth in total arrivals,
this should result in an average annual occupancy rate for the first-class hotels
of 72% in that year, well above a normal breakeven point of about 60%. This
estimate is conservative, in that it does not take into account the effect of
the convention center now being completed by GOP, and which will be able to
accommodate up to 5,000 persons. The tourist authorities in Panama have found
considerable interest among potential users of this center, but the lack of
available hotel space is now a serious bottleneck even for fairly small fairs
and conferences 2/. It is not clear whether the center would be able to generate
enough extra traffic (for at least 220 days of the year) to justify the early
investment in further hotel capacity just for convention traffic. However, in
view of the expected high average annual occupancy rate, the impact of the
convention center should be sufficient to justify some hotel investments
in addition to the projects now under implementation. Panama has just started
to develop tourist resorts. There is good potential for such developments,
for which there would be considerable demand primarily as an offshoot of
the business/convention traffic. However, for the proper development of the
tourism industry, the country would require a hotel school, which it does not
have at the moment.
Labor Policies
2.13      Panama has a relatively well educated workforce with good knowledge
of English. This workforce is protected to a considerable extent by the
present labor legislation, which includes a minimum wage system. In the
organized manufacturing sector, effective average wages are substantially
above the legal minima, and there are also considerable fringe benefits. As a
result, Panama's labor costs are fairly high in comparison with other Latin
American and Caribbean countries. In addition, employees with more than two
years' service may not be dismissed without just cause, and upon leaving they
are entitled to substantial benefits, increasing with length of service. These
benefits were largely the result of the 1972 labor law. In 1977, GOP modified
I/   Excluding direct transit passengers.
2/   The full capacity of the center, 5,000 persons, is almost five times
the present number of first-class hotel rooms in Panama.

some of the provisions of the law; inter alia, it made terminations somewhat
easier and established clearly that profit sharing is at the discretion of
management, and not a right for labor regardless of company profitability.
With these modifications, the labor law gives a reasonable degree of freedom
for industrialists in employment matters 1/.
Price Controls
2.14      Panama's price control legislation is aimed at maintaining the
supply and orderly distribution of basic goods to prevent scarcities and
high prices. At present, about 75 items are being regulated; hereof, fifty
are food products, other articles being fuel, inexpensive clothes, and pharma-
ceuticals. The administration of the price controls has become rigid, and
there are often long delays between an application for price increases and
GOP's approval. As a result, the prices for many articles (e.g., bread, tomato
paste, aspirin, sugar) were unchanged for several years; this led to reduced
profit margins in the affected industries. In 1980, many industries have been
granted some price increases, which should help to restore their profitability.
There is also price supervision on a wider range of items, for which price
increases may be challenged and reversed.
The Incentive Structure
2.15      Fiscal Incentives.  Since the early posit-war period, Panama has
adopted a series of special laws designed to promote investments in manufactur-
ing.  The standard mechanism for granting incentives is a contract between
MICI and the investor, under which the former awards certain tax and other
benefits as provided in the law, and the investor undertakes to implement an
agreed investment project within a specified timetable. 2/ The benefits may
include the following:
(a)  Exemption for the duration of the contract from import duties
and other import taxes on raw materials, semi-processed goods,
machinery, spare parts, and packing materials utilized in the
production process;
(b) Exemption from income tax on net profits in excess of 20% of
net taxable income if reinvested in fixed assets for expansion
of capacity or new plant;
(c) A special system of carry-over of losses to be deducted from
taxable income in any of three immediately succeeding years;
(d) A liberal depreciation system;
1/   A tripartite committee is now reviewing Panama's labor laws, to design
legislation acceptable to management, labor, and the Government. The
outcome of these deliberations will not be known for some time.
2/   In the contracts, agreement is normally reached on the amount of capital
to be invested, the use of local raw materials, and the job preferences
to be given to Panamanian nationals.



- 8 -
(e) Companies that produce manufactured goods totally for exports
may receive, in addition to the above incentives (where applicable),
a 100% exemption from income tax on their export earnings, as well
as exemptions from any export duties, sales taxes, and taxes
on capital or assets (except for license fees and real estate
taxes). GOP is trying to promote foreign investments under its
Maquila (assembly industries) program, and has received several
indications of interest among potential investors;
(f) In 1975, GOP introduced additional export incentives in the form of
tax credit certificates (CATS) for manufacturers of non-traditional
exports 1/. The CATS are now transferable, are redeemable in nine
months, and can be used to pay direct taxes, customs duties, value
added taxes and taxes on exports. To qualify for CATS, firms
located in metropolitan areas must have a minimum local value added
of 20%; this percentage is 10% for companies located elsewhere;
(g) Firms located in nine designated districts in the interior and
producing for the local market may receive the same benefits as for
exports ((e) above); 100% exemption from real estate taxes on land,
buildings, and installations; and an exemption from income tax of
100% for the first five years of operations, and 50% for the subse-
quent three years.
2.16      Protection.  In addition to the fiscal incentives, companies may
also receive protection from competing imports as follows:
(a) Tariffs. A firm qualifying for incentive treatment may receive
"adequate"tariff protection against foreign competition if it
meets GOP-determined standards of quality, quantity, and price.
As a rule, the price should not exceed the CIF import price by
more than 20% for non-agricultural products and 50% for agri-
cultural products. However, in some cases the nominal rates of
protection are well above these limits;
(b) Quotas. In addition to tariffs, GOP has been utilizing a quota
system by permitting imports only for that part of local demand
that cannot be satisfied in a satisfactory manner by local manu-
facturers. About 260 items, or 50% of all contracts approved by
MICI, are now subject to such quotas.
2.17      Evaluation.  The present incentives are, in theory, highly bene-
ficial for industrial investors. However, to achieve the benefits they have
to prepare detailed and time-consuming studies. Also, the system involves
considerable bottlenecks and delays for the industrialists 2/. By its com-
plexity, the system discriminates against smaller investors, who cannot so
easily afford the time and expenses involved in the application process. In
addition, the incentive system raises several conceptual problems:
1/   Exceptions are certain agricultural and livestock products, petroleum and
derivatives, metals and minerals, and exports that either come under
bilateral treaties or move from the Colon Free Trade Zone.
2/   For many investors, the complicated system for industrial incentives
compares especially poorly with the freedom of action they have in the
commercial and financial sectors.



- 9 -
(a)  Although the protective effect of the incentive system has probably
been moderate compared to other Latin-American countries, it is
biased in favor of investments for import-substitution, and a number
of inefficient units with low capacity utilization have been set up
behind the protective walls of tariffs and quotas;
(b)  The system of duty-free imports of production inputs even for
local sales tends to discourage the establishment of backward
linkages, and leads thereby sometimes to low value added (and as
a result, to high effective rates of protection 1/);
(c) Several of the incentives (such as duty--free imports of machinery,
the depreciation allowances, and the tax exemptions for reinvest-
ments), together with the protective system and the fairly high
costs of labor (para 2.13), tend to encourage capital-intensive
production techniques. There are no incentives that encourage the
increased use of labor, e.g., through multi-shift operations, which
would seem desirable in view of the high unemployment and, underemploy-
ment in Panama;
(d)  The locational incentives are probably not very effective in view
of the many incentives that are in any case available also for
investments in the metropolitan area.
2.18      Industrial Sector Study.  GOP is aware of several of the shortcomings
in the incentive structure, and has decided in principle to eliminate the use of
quantitative restrictions in favor of straight tariff protection. To this end,
it is now refusing applications for new quota protection made under existing
contracts between GOP and industrialists. This is a step in the right direction.
However, further reforms are required. In preparation for such reforms, GOP
is in the process of preparing an industrial sector study which will be
financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 2/. The present draft
terms of reference envisage a study in two phases:
(a)  A "descriptive" phase, which would include a review of the
industrial sector, a detailed sample survey of manufacturing
enterprises, and the calculation of effective rates of protection
(including the effects of the present qluota system);
(b) An "analytical" phase, which would incluade an analysis of Panama's
production factors, identification of subsectors with high potential,
and recommendations for changes in the present incentive system.
1/   Effective rates of protection will be calculated under the forthcoming
industrial sector study (para 2.18).
2/   At the time of Loan 1641-PAN, it was expected that GOP (the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Policy) would carry out an industrial survey.
Subsequently, after some discussions it was decided to shift the respon-
sibility for the study to MICI, and to seek special concessionary funding
from IDB. This delayed the preparation of the study.



- 10 -
2.19      GOP is keen to see this study implemented at an early date.  It
would be handled by a firm of foreign consultants (not yet selected), with
MICI as the local counterpart. The latter would involve other ministries
and institutions in Panama, including COFINA. The study will be used as a
basis for the future dialogue with GOP on individual policy questions.
Therefore, GOP has agreed that the study will be initiated not later than
July 15, 1981 (following the completion of IDB's formalities) and be completed
by December 31, 1981 (somewhat earlier completion is likely). GOP will
exchange views with the Bank on the terms of reference of the study and the
qualifications of the consultants, and will send the conclusions of the study
to the Bank for review and comments.
Prospects
2.20      After several years of stagnation, the manufacturing sector showed
considerable growth in production and investment in 1979, and this trend seems
to have continued into 1980. It is likely that over the next few years,
Panama's manufacturing sector will continue its gradual growth. Investor
confidence has been strengthened by the signing of the Canal Treaty, and by
the present climate of dialogue between GOP and the private sector. The
construction sector remains active, and agro-industrial profitability should
be affected positively by the price increases for controlled items early in
1980. The expansion of the Colon Free Zone would encourage investment, as
would the inclusion of the former Canal Zone area in Panama's import tariff
regime.
2.21      In the longer term, Panama's advantages for industrial expansion lie
in its geographical location, the canal, a developed infrastructure for inter-
national commerce including a large banking sector, the high level of health
and education of its population (including widespread knowledge of English),
and marine, forestry, and agricultural resources now only linked to a limited
extent to the manufacturing sector 1/. The Canal Treaty has also given Panama
control over land, port facilities, and other infrastructure for development.
However, for Panama to make use of these advantages it would require an
incentive structure with emphasis on exports and domestic backward linkages,
combined with significant competition from imports in the domestic markets to
encourage efficient production. This would involve some reorientation of the
present incentive system (para 2.17). The industrial sector study (para 2.18)
would place considerable emphasis on the evaluation of the present incentives
including the system of protection, and it is expected that it will be used as
a basis for GOP's internal review of the incentive structure, as well as for
the future dialogue between the Bank and GOP on industrial policy questions.
1/   The Cerro Colorado mining project, if implemented, would also lead to a
huge demand for construction services and materials.

III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
General
3.01      Panama uses the US dollar as its unit of exchange; the official
monetary unit, the balboa, exists only for accounting purposes and in coinage.
There is no central bank. The Ministry of Finance handles treasury functions;
the Controller General's office prepares and audits fiscal and national account-
ing and issues public debt bonds; the Ministry of Planning is responsible for
the national budget, and presides over the National Banking Commission (NBC),
which supervises the banking system 1/. The Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP),
which also operates as a commercial bank, is GOP's depository and fiscal agent.
The Banking System
3.02      Panama's banking law, which has been in effect since 1970, estab-
lishes minimum standards for banks registered in Panama, which are supervised
by NBC. Commercial banks are licensed in one of three categories:
(a)  General license banks, empowered to do business inside as
well as outside Panama;
(b) International (off-shore) banks, limited to do business out-
side Panama; and
(c) Representative offices.
The local transactions are subject to standards set by NBC, whereas the foreign
transactions of general as well as off-shore banks are almost entirely unregu-
lated once a license has been granted.
3.03      As a result of the attractive banking envrironment in Panama combined
with its advantageous geographical location, the banking sector has been growing
rapidly over the past ten years. As of December 31, 1979 there were 94 banking
institutions in Panama, of which 53 with general license, 29 with international
license, 12 representative offices, and two official banks. As of September
1980, the number of banks had increased to 105, and five more banks were
expected to set up office shortly. Most major international banks are now
located in Panama, and NBC expects more banks to arrive over the next few years.
The total assets of the banking system in Panama have been increasing rapidly
over the past few years, from $10.3 billion in December 1975 to $22.2 billion
in December 1978, and further to $35.5 billion as of June 30, 1980 (Table 3).
The banking system is oriented predominantly towardls international banking.
Thus, as of June 30, 1980, foreign loans represented 89% of the total loan
portfolio, compared to 82% as of December 31, 1977.
1/   The NBC supervises only the banking system, whereas other agencies of GOP
are responsible for the supervision of savings and loan associations,
insurance companies, and the stock market (para 3.12).

3.04      Recent Developments.  The foreign banks have recently increased
considerably their foreign exchange trading activities, which in 1979 may have
amounted to about $12-15 billion 1/. On the other hand, the loan syndication
1/   One reason for this increase is a policy change of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York in September 1979, allowing outside brokers to deal
directly in the New York foreign exchange market without going through
local brokers.



- 13 -
market in Panama is still in its infancy; only one syndication (for US$300
million) has taken place so far, with mixed results. However, it is likely
that this market may develop gradually in the eighties, as more bank offices
in Panama grow in stature from being only branch offices with limited authority.
It is also likely that secondary markets will develop in various types of
financial instruments, such as certificates of deposit. In this regard, Banco
Latinoamericano de Exportaciones (BLADEX), 1/ which was established in 1978,
has now become fully operational. It has been able to raise substantial re-
sources at a low spread over LIBOR, and is gradually building a sound portfolio
that in due course may give the impetus for a secondary market in acceptances
and export paper.
Domestic Banking
3.05      In spite of the large number of banks operating in Panama, most
of the domestic lending is handled by six banks, five private banks (Chase
Manhattan Bank, Citibank, Banco de Colombia, Banco Fiduciario, and Bank of
America), and the GOP-owned BNP.  As of December 31, 1979, there were in all
133 bank branch offices in Panama (excluding local head offices). Of these,
BNP accounted for 41, GOP's Caja de Ahorros (a savings bank) for 25, and
14 commercial banks for 67 branches. Almost half of all the branches were
located in the province of Panama. For the rest of the country, there was one
branch office for each 16,000 inhabitants, which indicates a reasonable branch
coverage.
3.06      The excess of offshore sources of funds over offshore uses has
provided a significant source of funds for domestic loans. The banks have
been willing to use foreign sources of funds to finance domestic loans partly
because no exchange risk is involved. Thus, as of' December 31, 1977, local
loans exceeded local deposits by $571 million. Hc'wever, this difference has
recently been reduced considerably, to only $124 mLillion as of June 30, 1980.
The decline is due to the relatively slow growth in outstanding domestic
loans, which grew by only 10% p.a. in the period 1977-1979 (and by only 3% in
the first half of 1980), compared to an annual growth rate of 25% in the
period 1971-1977. Partly, this lower recent growth rate is due to the decline
in outstandings to public entities (Table 4), which fell from $401 million
(23% of total outstandings) in December 1977 to $294 million (13%) as of June
30, 1980. Loans to the agricultural sector also grew slowly, while there was
a substantial increase in loan outstandings for commerce, from $570 million
(32% of total outstandings) in December 1977 to $820 million (37%) in June
1980. This increase is a reflection of the active international commercial
sector in Panama.
1/   BLADEX is a regional export bank promoted by GOP, inter alia, with the
participation of IFC. Its purpose is to promote and finance non-
traditional exports from Latin America.

Industrial Lending
3.07      Table 4 shows that total loan outstandings from commercial banks for
industry 1/ increased from $139 million (8% of total outstandings) in December
1977 to $249 million (11%) in June 1980. In the first half of 1980, the out-
standings went up by as much as 16%, which is a good indication of the present
improved investment climate (para 2.05). The commercial banks in Panama gene-
rally prefer short-term trade credits, and are normally reluctant to provide
longer term financing of fixed assets, although some of the banks do provide
medium-term (5-7 years) credits for their largest and most reliable customers.
Industrial term lending is basically undertaken by two GOP-owned institutions,
BNP's industrial lending department (Banca Industrial) and COFINA 2/. As of
December 31, 1979, BNP's outstandings (including short-term loans) to the
industrial sector amounted to $28 million, or 13% of total outstandings for
industry from the commercial banks 3/. In the period 1977-1979, BNP approved
123 industrial loans for a total of $9.6 million, giving an average loan size
of $78,000. In the first half of 1980, BNP's industrial lending increased
1/   Including mining, which represents less than 1% of the outstandings
for industry.
2/   There is also the private Desarrollo Industrial, S.A. (DISA), which is
relatively inactive.
3/   At that time, COFINA's outstanding regular loans amounted to $23.8 million.



- 15 -
sharply, to $8.2 million for 24 projects, due to its involvement in a few
large projects. It is likely that for the next twro years, most of BNP's
industrial loans (largely to existing customers) will be for less than $200,000.
3.08      IDB has previously extended four loans to BNP for its industrial
lending, for a total of US$9 million. Recently, it approved a new loan of
US$12 million. IDB estimates conservatively that this loan will provide 60%
of the resources for BNP's industrial lending over the three-year commitment
period of the loan. The maximum size of the subloans will be US$0.8 million,
and the initial relending rate will be 12% p.a., to be reviewed annually.
Over the period 1981-83, total industrial investment in Panama (exclusive of
any especially large projects) may be about $165 million (para 2.10), of which
BNP might cover about $20 million (according to IDB's projections), and equity
contributions including retained earnings might account for about $60 million.
This would leave an uncovered demand for funds of about $85 million, to be
provided by the commercial banks and COFINA. Over this period, COFINA's
disbursements (loans and equity investments) are projected at $49 million
(Annex 9), including loans for working capital and for non-industrial sectors
such as fisheries and tourism. Thus, its disbursements for fixed investments
in manufacturing might be around $30 million, or :35% of the uncovered demand.
COFINA's business strategy, including its proposed promotional activities, is
discussed in para 4.14.
3.09      Small-Scale Industry Lending.  The small scale industrial (SSI)
sector receives finance from the commercial banking system and from MICI.
The banks do not keep statistics on loans by size of borrower, but in 1979,
they made industrial loans (approvals) of less than $50,000 for in all $46
million, corresponding to 15% of gross loan approvals for industry. Among the
commercial banks, BNP is the most important source of SSI loans, with a
portfolio as of end 1979 of about $6 million in SSI term credits. MICI's SSI
lending program was established in 1975, and has since then disbursed about
$650,000 for around 125 loans to very small industrial, artisan, and service
enterprises. MICI's lending and collection operations have been hampered by
poorly trained staff and an absence of clear operating procedures. In the
context of the US$1 million MICI component under Loan 1641-PAN, MICI has taken
steps to improve its accounting and loan portfolio management and has prepared
detailed statements covering its operations and procedures. As a result, its
capacity to process loans has improved substantially; during a recent four-month
period it processed 68 loans under project URBE 1/ totalling $740,000.  The loan
collection procedures have also been improved. MICI should be able to utilize
the US$1 million component over a three-year period.
Interest Rates and Resource Mobilization
3.10      Interest rates in Panama are unrestricted except that:  (i)interest
rates paid on savings accounts cannot exceed 4.5% p.a. for commercial banks
and 5.5% for mortgage banks; (ii) interest payments on demand deposits are
prohibited; and (iii) interest rates on time deposits are unrestricted, but
such deposits cannot be established for amounts of less than $14,000. Other-
wise, the interest rate structure for both deposits and loans is based on the
1/   USAID's rural and urban growth and service center project, which, inter
alia, finances SSIs in specific locations through MICI. USAID is also
preparing an SSI project through BNP.



- 16 -
LIBOR 1/ rate; time deposits are normally slightly below the comparable London
rates, and lending rates are quoted at 1%-3% above LIBOR. The major industrial
term lenders, BNP and COFINA, prefer to charge fixed interest rates on their
term loans. COFINA's interest rate policy is discussed in para 4.15.
3.11      The local deposit structure is shown in Table 5.  It shows that
total deposits have been increasing at a moderate pace, from $1,553 million
as of December 31, 1976 to $2,067 million as of June 30, 1980. The increase
in deposits was quite substantial in the first half of 1980, probably due to
the high interest rates during much of this period. However, at the same time
savings deposits declined, as a result of the low interest on such deposits
(para 3.10) 2/. Apart from this problem, the interest rate structure is
appropriate for Panama.

Capital Market
3.12      Public issues of shares and financial instruments for private companies
have been very limited in Panama, amounting to only $8.3 million in the period
January 1977-August 1980. Most of these issues were for financial institutions;
for industrial companies the total amount issued was $1.1 million, of which
only $0.5 million was in ordinary shares.  There is also very little trading of
existing shares, since most companies in Panama are controlled by small groups
of investors. Until now, the absence of a market for risk capital does not
seem to have been a constraining factor for Panama's industrial development,

but this could change with further industrial growth. As part of its promo-
tional efforts (para 4.14), COFINA intends to encourage the growth of the
capital market in a careful manner. As a first step, it plans to underwrite
an issue of convertible debentures for a reputable industrial company.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
General
4.01      COFINA is a new institution (established in December 1975) which,
after a promising start, did not develop as expected due to the concentration
of COFINA's previous management on the operations of Air Panama (para 6.05),
and the departure of several qualified senior staff. However, over the past
few months a number of institutional improvements have taken place, and others
are under preparation, as discussed in this section. This progress deserves
the Bank's support. In this regard, one of the main objectives ofthe proposed
loan is to assist and support the efforts of COFINIA's present management to
build up COFINA as an efficient development finance institution (para 8.09).
Ownership and Management
4.02      Ownership and Board.  COFINA is fully owned by GOP.  Its Board can
have up to eight members, who are appointed by the President of Panama for an
indefinite term. At present, there are seven Board members plus four alter-
nates who also attend most meetings. The majority of the Board members come
from the private sector, while GOP is represented by the Minister of Commerce
and Industries, the General Manager of BNP, and (as alternate) the Vice Minister
of Finance. The Board now meets every two weeks, with good attendance. It is
closely involved in COFINA's affairs and approves all loans above $150,000
(smaller loans can be approved by the General Manager).
4.03      Management.  The present General Manager, Mr. Edgar Ameglio, came
to COFINA in late April 1980 with a solid background in the private financial
sector in Panama. He has already initiated substantial institutional reforms
in several areas, and his leadership will be important for attaining the
further improvements anticipated during the period of the proposed loan. In
the day-to-day operations, he is assisted by a newly appointed Deputy General
Manager, Mr. Rafael Mezquita, previously with the Ministry of Planning and
recently administrator of the port of Cristobal.
Organization and Staff
4.04      Organization.  Annex 1 shows COFINA's organization chart as of
October 1, 1980. Since inception, the organization structure has undergone
several changes, but it is now expected to stabilize, after the following
recent modifications:
(a) The Administration Division has been separated from the Operations
Department (which is still responsible for accounting and loan
administration); this will permit greater emphasis on personnel
policies, which is required (para 4.06);



- 18 -
(b) A small Project Audit unit has been established, initially to
prepare and implement COFINA's new follow-up system (para 4.12).
In the longer term, the unit will undertake subproject inspections
on a random basis, but the responsibility for project follow-up
will remain with the Projects Department (para 4.05);
(c) With effect from October 1, 1980, COFINA has established a third
branch office 1/, in Azuero to cover the central part of the
country.  The present branch structure is appropriate for COFINA,
which intends that the branch offices will be responsible for
most project follow-up in their regions, while also being involved
in project promotion and (staff time permitting) in project appraisal
work. At present, the offices are adequately staffed, but they may
require some increases in the medium term to fulfill adequately
their role;
(d) In November 1980, COFINA also established a small unit that will
handle primarily its promotional activities (para 4.14).
4.05      The project work (appraisal as well as supervision) is the responsi-
bility of COFINA's Projects Department, which consists of two divisions, for
industries and agro-industries, respectively. The branch offices also report
to the Projects Department. The two divisions have almost the same number of
professional staff (seven and eight, respectively), although the major portion of
COFINA's portfolio falls under the preview of the industries division. Accord-
ingly, any further growth in professional staff should benefit primarily the
latter division 2/. Until now, the Projects Department has had a tendency to
give low priority to project follow-up work, which has also been carried out in
an unsystematic manner.   Under the new follow-up system (para 4.12), when fully
implemented, COFINA will be giving equal attention to both functions.
4.06      Staffing.  COFINA's total staff increased from 51 in June 1978 to 72
in September 1980; the professional staff grew from 31 to 40. Basically COFINA
is now adequately staffed, but there is room for improved efficiency. COFINA
plans to increase its staff at a moderate pace, preferably through the selective
recruitment of more senior staff. With an increasing level of operations,
administrative expenses should then decline from the present high level in
relation to total assets (para 6.09). Over the last few years, COFINA has
suffered from very high rates of staff turnover, for professional staff at 55%
in 1978-79 (ending June 30), and 46% in 1979-80.  There is considerable
mobility among financial professionals in Panama; in addition, the high
turnover for COFINA resulted from the frequent organizational alterations and
declining staff morale under the previous management. The latter was caused
in part by a lack of clear policies and procedures, particularly for personnel
matters including salaries and promotions, which were handled in a somewhat
arbitrary manner. Finally, while COFINA's salaries are generally competitive,
in some cases staff with experience and training from COFINA have been
recruited for higher positions in other financial or industrial enterprises
in Panama.
1/   In addition to the established offices in Colon and David.
2/   In the medium term, this division could be divided in two, thereby also
creating a wider control span for the Projects Director.



- 19 -
4.07      COFINA's management is aware of the need to reduce the turnover rates
considerably. The institutional improvements that are now taking place have
caused an improvement in staff attitudes; as a result, only three professionals
left COFINA in the period July-September 1980, corresponding to an annual turn-
over rate of 32%. To reduce turnover even further, COFINA requires a consistent
personnel policy covering, inter alia, salaries, merit increases, performance
evaluation, and promotions. COFINA has initiated a detailed evaluation of
these aspects, which is being undertaken by outside consultants. On the basis
of their recommendations, COFINA should be able to implement a reformed
personnel system not later than mid 1981 1/. The staff salaries have been
frozen pending this new system; accordingly, it is likely that some salary
increases will be required at the time of its implementation.
4.08      Most of COFINA's staff is young, academically qualified, but lacking
in experience. As a result of the high turnover (para 4.06), COFINA does not
have an adequate pool of experienced officers that can provide on-the-job
training for junior officers. To compensate for this deficiency, COFINA
places considerable emphasis on staff training, so far primarily in the form
of staff participation in outside courses and seminars. Thus, in the period
April 1979-June 1980, COFINA sent 15 officers for training 2/ in Panama and
abroad, mainly to follow courses in financial subjects. However, the benefits
of this training have turned out to be low relative to the costs involved.
Accordingly, COFINA has now prepared a revised training program which
includes the following elements:
(a) There will be more training inside COFINA, e.g., in the form of
seminars on various topics (one series of such seminars is now
underway);
(b) Rather than sending individual staff members to attend external
courses, COFINA will seek to develop courses in Panama (alone or
together with other institutions) designed for COFINA's particular
needs and attended by a number of its staff 3/.   In this way, it
will be much easier than at present to utilize inside COFINA the
new techniques/insights learned. In late November 1980, COFINA
arranged a first such intensive seminar for its staff, with
support from INCAE; 4/
(c) In addition to training in financial/economic subjects, COFINA
will also seek to provide management training for those of its staff
that have leadership roles (including senior project officers).
This is required to improve the way the work is organized, opera-
tional efficiency, and on-the-job training.
1/   It is likely that this system will include special measures to retain senior
professional staff, such as wider salary ranges and upgraded job titles.
2/   Excluding language training and courses for secretarial staff.
3/   Preferably, COFINA would seek to arrange intensive courses over periods
of a few days to a week, in subjects such as business finance, economic
analysis of projects, and market analysis.

4.09      Under Loan 1641-PAN, COFINA could withdraw up to $100,000 for
training and technical assistance (foreign exchange cost only) 1/. As of
February 6, 1981, the Bank had authorized withdrawals for COFINA staff partici-
pation in nine foreign training courses, for a total of about $44,000. This
fairly low utilization is partly due to the fact that COFINA has been able to
arrange staff participation in several courses on a grant basis. Although
this component may therefore not be fully utilized, a similar component, for
$200,000, is included under the proposed second loan, to finance the foreign
exchange cost of training and technical assistance for COFINA's staff.
(Under the revised training program (para 4.08) these costs are expected
to increase.) Under this component, COFINA should be able to withdraw 100% of
direct foreign exchange costs, and 60% of total costs if acquired locally (the
estimated foreign exchange content of sending staff to special courses/seminars
in Panama). Probably, all such courses would utilize foreign lecturers, in
particular a series of seminars now being offered by INCAE, and to which
COFINA would like to send a number of its staff members. It is likely that
the new training component would be utilized more rapidly than under the first
loan, due to the training courses expected to be arranged by COFINA in Panama,
using foreign experts, and in particular to the consultancy services to be
utilized by COFINA (para 4.10).
Standards and Procedures
4.10      Appraisal.  The quality of COFINA's appraisal reports is variable,
but in general there is ample room for improvement. For example, since most
of the project staff is inexperienced, they tend to rely too heavily on the
data being presented by the clients or their consultants 2/, and which may
under-estimate, e.g., investment costs and working capital requirements. The
financial analyses tend to be thorough, but often not well focused on the major
issues, and the financial projections are not given sufficient attention when
determining the loan maturities. COFINA has been calculating financial rates
of return for many projects; however, these calculations have sometimes been
for the companies as a whole, and not for the project in question. Under
the proposed loan, COFINA will calculate the financial rate of return for
all subprojects above $100,000, and the economic rate of return for sub-
projects-above $500,000, in all cases only taking into account the benefits
and costs of the subprojects 3/. Finally, many subproject reports are
poorly organized and presented.  COFINA's management is aware of these
shortcomings, but would not have the time required to improve appraisal
1/   The unutilized portion can be disbursed for subloans.
2/   COFINA normally requires that the prospective clients either prepare a
project feasibility study or at least present the basic material required
for such a study. Many clients hire outside consultants for this work.
3/   In the beginning, COFINA's staff would require the assistance of the
consultant to carry out such calculations correctly and efficiently.
Under Loan 1641-PAN, COFINA was required to calculate the economic
rate of return for all subloans above $0.5 million. However, these
calculations have not been made in a satisfactory manner.

standards on their own, as this would involve the preparation of manuals and
standard appraisal formats, and detailed training of the individual project
officers. For this purpose, and to assist in the implementation of the
follow-up program, COFINA has prepared a satisfactory program of consultancy
services, and has recruited a consultant for a period of twelve months,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. It may also recruit other
consultants for shorter periods from time to time. These consulting services
will be financed out of the training component of Loan 1641-PAN and/or the
proposed loan (para 4.09).
4.11      Procurement and Disbursement.  COFINA has normally been exercising
some control over the procurement decisions, inter alia, through the use of
alternate quotations, but this control has by and large been undocumented.
COFINA is aware of the need for improved procedures. For all subprojects to
be submitted to the Bank under the proposed loan, COFINA will include its own
evaluation of the procurement decision, normally supported with at least three
alternative quotations. COFINA will always include a special justification for
submitting less than three quotations, or when the lowest bid is ngt selected.
In the past, COFINA sometimes made disbursements before all loan conditions
had been made. New procedures have recently been established to prevent such
occurrencies in the future; these are satisfactory.
4.12      Project Supervision.  Until now, COFINA's supervision work has often
been given lower priority than appraisal work; as a result, many loans have
gone into arrears (para 6.01).  COFINA's present management has already placed
increased emphasis on project supervision, and also prepared a detailed system
for project follow-up, which it will implement in the near future. Under this
program, all projects will be classified according to stage of implementation,
and a Light program of visits and reporting will be drawn up for each project.
COFINA has also prepared standard reporting formats, and standard su iary
reports that will be forwarded monthly to the General Manager. The program as
it now stands represents a solid effort, although it is likely that COFINA
will find it necessary to make substantial improvements during implementation,
inter alia, to make the reports more focussed on important issues. Also, the
present program is very ambitious, e.g., with monthly reports for certain
project categories. This may turn out to be excessive, at least once COFINA
has built up an initial inventory of information on all the subprojects.
COFINA will obtain assistance under the consultancy services (para 4.10) in
the implementation of the supervision program.
Operating Policies
4.13      General.  Annex 2 shows COFINA's Statement of Objectives and
Policies. This Statement was approved by COFINA's Board on November 22, 1978,
as a condition for Loan 1641-PAN 1/. Any substanitive changes in this Statement

approval of the Statement.

are subject to Bank approval under the Loan Agreement for Loan 1641-PAN.  The
major financial and investment limitations contained in this Statement are:
(a) COFINA's maximum total exposure (loans, guarantees, and equity
investments) for any single client will be limited to US$4.0
million 1/ equivalent through 1982, and thereafter adjusted to
20% of actual capital and reserves. However, COFINA can exceed
this limit when the obligations it has assumed vis-a-vis third
parties are totally and unconditionally covered by the Govern-
ment's guarantee. There are now five projects above the exposure
limit (para 6.07);
(b) COFINA will generally not finance more than 70% of total project
cost and in no case more than 80%. These percentages are high,
and the limitations have at times been defined with flexibility.
Under the Strategy Statement (para 4.14), COFINA will normally limit
itself to a maximum of 70% of total project cost, and its total
exposure in individual companies to 60% of total fixed assets;
(c) COFINA will normally not make equity investments in any single
enterprise for more than 20% of COFINA's capital and reserves, and
its aggregate equity investments will not exceed 75% of its capital
and reserves. COFINA has always stayed within these limits;
(d) COFINA will normally also limit its equity investments in any
company to 25% of that company's capital stock. This limitation
has only been exceeded for Air Panama (para 6.05);
(e) The maximum permissible debt (including guarantees) is five times
capital and reserves.
4.14      Business Strategy.  Annex 3 shows COFINA's draft Strategy Statement
for the period 1981-83, which should be approved by COFINA's Board in a form
satisfactory to the Bank prior to loan effectiveness. Under this statement,
COFINA's activities will be oriented towards complementing the activities of
other financial institutions in Panama, as follows:
(a)  COFINA will finance primarily fixed investments, while to a large
extent leaving working capital finance to the commercial banks. It
will place particular emphasis on the financing of medium- and
large-scale industries 2/, and expects therefore to increase
the average size of its subloans 3/;
1/   $4 million represented 20% of the originally projected 1982 capital and
reserves. Under the present projections, $4 million will be about 16% of
1982 equity (Annex 12).
2/   This would normally mean companies with projected annual sales of more
than $0.5 million.
3/   Thus, COFINA would on the average be financing larger subprojects than
BNP (para 3.07).



- 23 -
(b)  COFINA will concentrate on the financing of manufacturing
industries, but will also finance other productive acti-
vities, such as tourism;
(c)  COFINA will seek to play an active promotional role, both
in the industrial and financial sectors, including subsector
studies, project identification work, and the promotion of
cofinancing with local and foreign financial institutions. No
other financial institution in Panama is likely to play such a
role. However, in this regard, COFINA will require funds to
finance promotional studies and consultancy services, which could
be on subsector basis or for the promoltion of specific projects.
Under the proposed loan, COFINTA should be able to withdraw up
to $200,000, for this purpose;
(d)  COFINA will make equity investments to the extent permitted by
its resource position 1/, and it will seek to promote the
growth of the stock market in Panama (para 3.12).
4.15      Terms of Assistance.  COFINA charges a normal interest rate of 12.5%
p.a., and in addition it has recently introduced for its new loans a manage-
ment fee of 1% p.a. Under the proposed loan, the minimum initial relending
rate will be 13% (para 8.05). It charges somewhat lower rates on URBE funds
(para 3.09), and on loans for preinvestment studies financed by special GOP
funds, and maintains a penalty fee of 1% per month on amounts overdue. COFINA
previously tied its relending rate to LIBOR, in accordance with general
banking practice in Panama (para 3.10). However, during the violent interest
rate fluctuations in the first half of 1980, this turned out to be impractical
for term lending institutions. For this reason, COFINA now maintains lending
rates tied to LIBOR only for loans of shorter maturities that are financed by
borrowings made on this basis, while other term loans are made at fixed rates.
Hlowever, COFINA has not yet modified its Policy Statement (para 4.13) to
reflect this change, but it expects to do so in the near future.
Relations with the Government and the Business Community
4.16      Relations between GOP and COFINA are close, and GOP is represented
directly on COFINA's Board (para 4.02). GOP normally respects COFINA's
operational autonomy, but there have been some exceptions, such as the Miramar
Zona Libre subproject (para 6.02). GOP exercises a very detailed control over
COFINA through its budget review process, e.g. , in matters relating to staff
positions and salaries. This control is procedurally cumbersome for COFINA,
although it has not had any significant impact on its general competitiveness
for qualified staff. Although GOP should be able to maintain fully adequate
control with less rigid control criteria (e.g., by specifying overall staff
positions and salaries instead of the number of positions with corresponding
1/   As a result of the very thin stock market in Panama, most equity invest-
ments are illiquid. For this reason, COFINA's equity portfolio is likely
to remain well below its exposure limit (para 4.13).

salaries in each of a number of staff categories), it intends to maintain the
present system for as long as COFINA receives regular increases in its share
capital through GOP's budget (para. 5.01).
4.17      As a result of its internal problems over the last few years, which
also affected negatively its reputation in Panama, COFINA has so far not played
its intended role as a catalyst for industrial resource mobilization. However,
it has now established a good working relationship with BNP, and has also
initiated contacts with a number of other financial institutions.  With its
planned improvements in appraisal standards and promotional activities, COFINA
should be in a good position to play a leading role in the industrial and
financial sectors in Panama, inter alia, to organize co-financing with banks
and other financial institutions.
V. RESOURCES AND OPERATIONS
Resources
5.01      Equity.  COFINA's equity as of August 31, 1980 amounted to $16.6
million, of which $1.1 million in retained earnings and $15.4 million in share
capital.   The latter has been provided by GOP in various forms, including as
GOP bonds, contributions to finance COFINA's investments in specific projects 1/,
and through USAID loans under the URBE program (para 3.09), where GOP is
responsible for debt servicing. However, the most important contribution has
been the capitalization program under the COFINA Act 2/, whereunder COFINA is
supposed to receive each year 7.5% of a 7.5% import surtax (or 0.56% of the
value of the imports). GOP adhered to this program through 1979 (although not
completely in the latter year), by which time COFTNA had received resources
under the program of $7.3 million, corresponding to 53% of its total share
capital as of end 1979. This represented most of the untied resources received
as share capital. However, GOP did not provide the statutory capital contribu-
tion for 1980, due to its tight budgetary situation. COFINA will require
additional equity resources in the next few years, to maintain a reasonable
debt/equity ratio (para 7.05), and to provide resources for share investments
and promotional activities. Therefore, GOP has agreed to provide COFINA with
annual share capital increases as per the COFINA Act, for the period 1981-1985
(the disbursement period of the proposed loan). The increases will be paid in
quarterly installments. GOP has made budgetary allocation for the 1981 capital
contribution. Prior to loan effectiveness, GOP should make the first quarterly
contribution for this year.
5.02      Apart from the share capital, COFINA's main single source of funds
has been Loan 1641-PAN from the Bank. In addition, COFINA has available sub-
stantial resources from commercial banks located in Panama ($17.8 million in
1/   Including GOP's debt servicing of COFINA's debt to IBERIA on account
of Air Fanav&a (para 6.05).

gross lines of credit as of June 30, 1980), and from sources such as BIADEX
and USAID. Most commercial bank funds are short--term (for 180 or 360 days),
but COFINA is seeking to obtain some credits at longer maturities (up to five
years including grace). It will probably co-finance some projects with
commercial banks, with COFINA taking the longer maturities. In addition,
COFINA has recently initiated contacts with a number of foreign export credit
institutions, and has already received positive responses from a few of these.
Until now, most of COFINA's term lending (apart f-rom short-term working
capital loans and bridging loans) has been financed out of Loan 1641-PAN
and COFINA's own resources (para 5.01). It is likely that over the next few
years, COFINA will be able to mobilize substantial resources as described
above, but these resources will be mostly short-term or tied to specific
projects or countries of procurement. According]Ly, COFINA requires
untied term resources to blend with its other sources; the proposed loan
would fulfill this function.
5.03      COFINA, not being a bank, is not entitled to receive deposits from
non-banking institutions. In view of the fairly easy availability of short-
term resources from the banking sector, for the time being COFINA would not
need to seek general deposits from the public. HIowever, it would be useful
for COFINA to be able to receive temporary deposits from its clients, inter
alia, to ensure that they contribute their agreed share of project costs in
a timely manner. GOP may permit COFINA to do so at a later date.
Resource Allocation
5.04      Overall Operations.  Annex 4 presents a summary of COFINA's oper-
ations through June 30, 1980.  Excluding guarantees (para 6.04), gross
approvals increased from $11.6 million for 23 projects in 1978 to $14.7
million for 60 projects in 1980.  In the first half of 1980, COFINA had
30 gross approvals for a total of $5 million. This represented a moderate
decline from the level of activity in 1979, caused by the concentration of the
previous management on the affairs of Air Panama (para 6.05) and then by the
change in management in April 1980. Almost all of COFINA's approvals in the
period 1978-1980 have been in the form of loans. In this period, total
cancellations have amounted to only $1.1 million, or less than 4% of gross
approvals. The disbursements have been showing an upwards trend, from $4.7
million in 1978 to $12.5 million in 1979, and to $7.5 million in the first
half of 1980.
Characteristics of Operations
5.05       Size.  In recent years, the average size of COFINA's loans has
declined considerably, from $409,000 in 1978 to $223,000 in 1979, and further
to $167,000 in the first half of 1980. Annex 5 shows that this development
has been caused by a decline in the relative number and size of larger loans
(above $0.5 million). COFINA now intends to reverse this trend, as discussed
in para 4.14.



- 26 
5.06      Geographical Spread.  COFINA's operations have become increasingly
concentrated in the metropolitan region (Panama City and adjacent regions).
However, even in the first half of 1980 this region accounted for only 47% of
gross approvals; this is still low in view of the heavy geographical concen-
tration of Panama's manufacturing sector (para 2.08). Thus, COFINA's regional
distribution is reasonable.
5.07      Sectoral Distribution.  COFINA's operations are well diversified by
industrial subsectors.  Thus, in 1979, the tourism sector accounted for 27% of
gross approvals by amount, plastics and chemicals for 21%, and agroindustries
(including food processing) for 11%. The latter subsector has consistently
been the largest by number of projects (23 in 1979, and 16 in the first half
of 1980), but mostly with small subprojects. COFINA's concentration on this
subsector has helped it to maintain a reasonable regional balance (para 5.06). 1/
5.08      Type of Operations.  COFINA can lend to both the public and private
sectors; however, almost all of its regular loans have been for the latter.
In the period 1978-1980 (first half), 75% of all loan approvals by amount
were for new projects, 11% for expansion, 10% for refinancing (to improve
clients' financial structure), and 4% for modernization. COFINA has made few
loans only for working capital, but in many cases it has covered substantial
working capital requirements in connection with loans for fixed assets. In
view of the fairly easy availability of commercial bank financing in Panama,
COFINA will now reduce its financing of working capital (para 4.14).
Developmental Impact
5.09      Until now, COFINA's developmental impact has been below original
expectations due to its institutional problems, which in particular reduced
its ability to engage in promotional activities and to arrange cofinancing
with banks and other financial institutions.  (As discussed above, under its
new management COFINA should be able to improve substantially its performance
in these areas over the next few years.) COFINA's statistics (ex-ante) on
its past operations are not complete, and ex-post figures are lacking 2/.
However, based largely on appraisal data, the following observations can be
made:
(a) COFINA has been financing a large percentage of project costs in
many cases; thus, in 1979 it covered 54% of total project costs
including working capital. In many cases, this percentage was
around 70%. These high percentages probably represent one reason
for the increasing arrears (para 6.01), which are, nevertheless,
still at a reasonable level. In the future, COFINA will reduce its
relative share of project financing (para 4.13);
1/   Annex 6 shows that the service sector (including transport and tourism)
accounted for 54% of total outstandings as of June 30, 1980, while agro-
industries accounted for 12%.
2/   Such statistics will be developed for the subprojects under Loan 1641-PAN
through the Bank's subproject data system.



- 27 -
(b) The financial (ex-ante) rates of return have generally been high for
COFINA's projects, often well above 30%. This indicates that the
financial viability is good for most COFINA projects;
(c) Due to the incentive system in Panama (para 2.15), most of
COFINA's subprojects have been for the local market, although
in 1979 and 1980 there were also some subprojects aiming primarily
at the export market. Under its Strategy Statement (para 4.14),
COFINA will seek to encourage such subprojects, within the limits
set by the incentive system;
(d) COFINA estimates that its subprojects approved in 1979 and 1980 will
generate 1,036 new jobs, giving an average fixed cost per job of
$17,600. This is below the average cost per job in Panama over the
past two years. 1/ Under its Strategy Statement, COFINA will seek
to emphasize subprojects with high employment generation.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Quality of Portfolio
6.01      Loan Portfolio.  Table 6 shows the development of COFINA's arrears
over three months from 1978 to 1980.

1/   An IDB survey of a sample of its subprojects through BNP revealed an

- 28 -
COFINA's arrears over three months have been increasing, but still represent
(as of June 30, 1980) only 3% of total loan portfolio, while 14% of the out-
standing portfolio (by amount) is affected by arrears over three months.
Hereof, outstandings of $2.4 million (8% of total loan portfolio) for eight
loans were affected by arrears of more than twelve months. There are only five
projects with serious long-term problems, with arrears of about $0.8 million.
These figures indicate that the quality of COFINA's portfolio is reasonably
good; however, many clients are notoriously late in honoring their repayment
obligations. As a result, as of June 30, 1980, 62 loans with total outstand-
ings of $12.7 million (40% of total loan portfolio) were affected by arrears
of less than three months, although the actual arrears on these loans were
only $0.3 million. Annex 6 shows that the service sector (including transport
and tourism) accounted for 34% of total arrears, agroindustries for 28%, and
metals and minerals for 15%. COFINA's collections (principal and interest)
represented 87% of amounts falling due in 1978, 83% in 1979, and 75% in the
first half of 1980. However, with the steps now initiated to encourage timely
repayments, including more regular project follow-up (para 4.12), written
notices prior to each due date, and repeated reminders to clients in arrears,
this declining trend is expected to be reversed in the second half of 1980.
6.02      Miramar Zona Libre.  At the insistence of GOP, COFINA has extended
long-term loans of about $3.5 million to Miramar Zona Libre at 10.5% p.a.,
of which COFINA had to finance about $1.5 million out of short-term borrowings
(at around 15%) that are being rolled over or refinanced. This is a viable,
export-oriented subproject, but COFINA's profitability and liquidity have been
affected negatively due to the GOP-induced terms and maturity of its exposure.
To solve this problem, GOP has provided a loan to COFINA at terms (including
maturity) similar to the portion of COFINA's exposure in Miramar financed by
short-term borrowings.
6.03      Investment Portfolio.  COFINA's total equity investment portfolio as
of June 30, 1980 amounted to $2.9 million at cost in eight companies, excluding
Air Panama (para 6.05). There is no quoted market value for any of these
investments, mainly due to the lack of a proper stock market in Panama, and no
dividends have yet been paid. COFINA has made loans or guarantees to all
these companies, and has therefore a contractual right to approve any dividend
payments. The financial position of four of the five projects is good, while
one of the projects (where COFINA has an investment of $430,000), is listed as
a problem project.
6.04      Guarantees.  Over the past two years, COFINA has increased its
guarantee portfolio very rapidly, largely on account of a few large projects
(primarily in the tourism sector) where its exposure is counter-guaranteed by
GOP (para 6.07). For this type of operations, COFINA performs a useful
function as the financial arm of GOP, and in this capacity it has been able to
support large projects that otherwise might not have materialized. As of
August 31, 1980, COFINA had outstanding guarantees of $36.2 million, of which
$30 million on account of companies covered by GOP's guarantees. COFINA does
not foresee any problems on account of these guarantees. However, in the
past, COFINA did not receive all its guarantee fees, due to lack of an internal



- 29 -
mechanism to keep track of such payments. It is now in the process of deter-
mining the amounts due from previous years on this account. In the future,
COFINA will insist that all repayments on guaranteed loans be channelled
through it, thereby ensuring proper accounting and payment of COFINA's fees.
6.05      Air Panama.  Air Panama, which is the national airline of Panama,
has been suffering large losses for several years. COFINA's previous manage-
ment was heavily involved in the day-to-day affairs of Air Panama, in which
COFINA's exposure reached $12.3 million in the form of shares, credit lines,
and credits originally extended by IBERIA (the national airline of Spain).
COFINA has not received any payments of dividend, interest (which has been
capitalized), or principal on account of these outstandings. Also, although
it held 100% of the share capital in Air Panama, under Mr. Ameglio COFINA did
not any longer involve itself in the management of Air Panama, and was not in
a position to exercise any ownership control. COFINA's exposure in Air Panama
has represented an important problem, in two aspects:
(a)  COFINA had lines of credit outstanding with Air Panama for a
total of $5 million, financed by short-term borrowings. COFINA
has not been making any new credits available to Air Panama, but
has had to refinance the existing credits, which represented a very
significant drain on COFINA's liquidity;
(b) As per an agreement of September 12, 1977 between the Governments
of Spain and Panama, IBERIA transferred to COFINA its shares and
credits in Air Panama for a total of $6.5 million 1/, which COFINA
was obliged to repay over ten years at 8% rate of interest.
GOP has been servicing this debt 2/, but there was no formal agree-
ment/undertaking that this would be done in the future.  Accordingly,
COFINA remained legally responsible for this debt.
6.06      To solve the problem of COFINA's exposure in Air Panama, GOP and
COFINA have now entered into an agreement, as follows, and which is fully
satisfactory:
(a) COFINA's shares in Air Panama have been transferred to GOP
without any 'oss for COFINA;
(b) GOP has appointed COFINA as trustee for its shares in
Air Panama, with the right to appoint Board and management
in the airline. However, COFINA will not carry any financial
responsibility, and will not be involved in the day-to-day
operations of Air Panama;
1/   Through this transaction, COFINA obtained 49% of the shares in Air
Panama. The remaining 51% were obtained through the payment out of
COFINA's own resources of $780,000.
2/   GOP's debt servicing on this account was treated as share capital
increases for COFINA.



- 30 -
(c) COFINA's other assets and liabilities concerning Air Panama
will also be taken over by GOP. The transfer of any liabilities
(in particular concerning the IBERIA transaction) will require
the approval of the creditors concerned. Until such approvals
are received, GOP will service all debt obligations as they
fall due.
6.07      Exposure Limit.  COFINA has exceeded its normal $4 million exposure
limit in five cases (including Air Panama), for a total exposure including
guarantees of $57 million as of August 31, 1980. GOP had extended its guaran-
tee for most of these cases in general terms 1/, but the guarantees did not
define precisely GOP's responsibilities.  GOP has now provided clear state-
ments for its guarantees in three cases (excluding PTPT and Air Panama, where
no such statement was required), whereunder it will reimburse COFINA promptly
for any defaults (on loans or guarantees) or losses (on equity investments),
including interest payments and guarantee commissions. GOP has agreed that
any future guarantees for projects above COFINA's exposure limit will be
similarly worded.
6.08      Provisions.  COFINA's provisions for bad and doubtful loans as of
August 31, 1980 were $1.2 million, corresponding to 3.5% of total loan portfolio
(including outstanding interest), and corresponding to 1.5% of COFINA's total
portfolio including Air Panama, equity investments, and guarantees. This seems
low, even when GOP's guarantees are taken into account (para 6.07). COFINA has
never had to write off any amounts, and it feels that most of its loan arrears
are of a temporary nature. Until now, the provisions have been determined by
COFINA's auditors (para 6.11). In the future, COFINA will itself review its
portfolio to determine its provisions, subject to the approval of the auditors.
Profitability
6.09      Annex 7 shows COFINA's profit and loss statements for 1976-1979
and 1980 (through August 31). From inception and through 1978, COFINA incurred
losses which were offset by subventions from GOP. These were terminated in 1978.
In 1979, COFINA's profit before provisions was $0.6 million, corresponding to
1.2% of average total assets (including guarantees). Net profit 2/ was 1.8%
of average equity, which is very low.  COFINA is aware of the need to increase
its profitability, and is taking the following steps in this regard:
1/   COFINA never sought GOP's guarantee for one project (Petroterminales
de Panama - PTP), an excellent company with majority international owner-
ship.  At the time of Loan 1641-PAN (para. 1.01), the Bank made an excep-
tion from the general guarantee requirement for this company, at COFINA's
request.  Since that time, COFINA has not increased its exposure in the
company.  Accordingly, it was not found necessary to require a GOP
guarantee for the PTP involvement at this stage.
21   Profit after provisions.  COFINk does not pay any income tax, and has
so far not paid any dividends to GOP.



- 31 -
(a) COFINA's spread 1/ on its regular loan operations in 1979 was 3.9%.
To increase this spread, COFINA introduced the 1% p.a. management
fee (para 4.15), and has also increased where possible the lending
rate on some old loans made at around 9% p.a. Under its Strategy
Statement (para 4.14), COFINA will seek to increase its lending
rates where possible. However, in view of the open financial
sector in Panama, COFINA will be constrained in this regard by
considerations of competitiveness (para 8.05);
(b) COFINA's administrative expenses are high at 2.7% of average
total assets (1979). Over the next few years, COFINA expects
to increase its staff at a moderate pace 2/; this should result
in a relative reduction in administrative expenses;
(c) COFINA is now taking steps to recover all its guarantee
commissions (para 6.04);
(d)  The profitability should also be improved through the solution
to the problem of the Miramar Zona Libire subproject (para 6.02).
Capital Structure
6.10      Annex 8 shows COFINA's balance sheets as of December 31, 1976-1979,
and as of August 31, 1980. Total assets including guarantees have increased
rapidly, and were $86 million as of August 31, 1980. COFINA's liquidity
situation has lately become increasingly unfavorable; the current ratio was
0.9:1 as of December 31, 1979, and 0.4:1 as of August 31, 1980, excluding the
current maturities of term borrowings. In general, COFINA has been able to
match the maturities of its borrowings and lendings, except for cases like Air
Panama (para 6.05), and Miramar Zona Libre (para 6.02). The solution of
these problems should improve COFINA's liquidity position considerably.
COFINA's long-term debt/equity ratio (including guarantees as debt) increased
from 1.5:1 as of December 31, 1978 to 3.8:1 as of August 31, 1980, well below
the contractual limit of 5:1.
6.11      Audit.  Since 1978, COFINA's accounts have been audited by the firm
of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co., who have approved COFINA's accounts without
any qualifications. The long form audit reports have normally been prepared
in a timely fashion, and have been reasonably comprehensive. The Bank has
made some suggestions for improvement, which should be incorporated in the
audit report for 1980.
1/   Income from loans as % of average loan portfolio minus cost of debt as
% of average debt.
2/   COFINA will be able to increase its operations at a faster rate than
its staff due to expected improvements in staff efficiency and a higher
average project size (para 4.14).

VII. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
7.01      After a few years of stagnation in the mid seventies, Panama's
GDP showed renewed growth in 1978 and, more pronounced, in 1979. In the
latter year, the growth in the manufacturing sector exceeded that for the
economy as a whole. This tendency seems to have continued into 1980, and
the prospects are good for gradual growth in manufacturing production over
the next few years. Investor confidence has recently improved, inter alia,
due to the signing of the Canal Treaty and the present climate of dialogue
between GOP and the private sector. Also, in view of the low industrial
investments during much of the seventies, it is likely that there is a
substantial need for investments in balancing, modernization, and expansion
of existing production facilities. On this basis, industrial investment
should increase considerably over the levels achieved in 1978 and 1979.
Projected Operations
7.02      Project Pipeline.  The improved investment interest would also
affect the demand for COFINA funds, and, as a result of the ongoing insti-
tutional improvements, this institution will gradually become better placed
to meet the demand in a timely fashion. It should also become able to
generate additional business through its own promotional efforts. Already,
COFINA has a substantial pipeline of projects. As of September 30, 1980, it
had received feasibility studies or notes of intent for 44 projects, with an
estimated total project cost of $44 million. (In addition, COFINA has a
number of notional ideas or inquiries in its pipeline.) Hereof, the agro-
industrial sector (including food processing) accounted for $13.8 million
for 17 projects, miscellaneous manufacturing for $14.9 million (nine projects),
fisheries including fish processing for $5.9 million (six projects), tourism
for $3.9 million (one project), and the metal industry for $2.8 million (four
projects). In most of these cases, COFINA would be requested to provide term
loans. Assuming an average COFINA share of 50% of project costs, this pipe-
line would imply a present demand for COFINA funds of $22 million. It is
likely that many of these projects will never materialize, or that they will
be financed from other sources than COFINA. Nevertheless, the size of this
pipeline indicates the extent of the present financing demand from the indus-
trial sector.
7.03      Annex 9 shows COFINA's projected operations 1980-1984.  Gross loan
approvals are expected to decline from $14.7 million in 1979 to $12 million in
1980, based on actual approvals in the first half of the year (para 5.04) and a
project-by-project evaluation of COFINA's pipeline. Thereafter, the approvals
(in nominal terms) should increase to $15 million in 1981, and by about 15% p.a.
in the following years. In addition, it is projected that COFINA will make
equity investments of $1 million per year, starting in 1981. COFINA's out-
standing guarantees are projected to increase by close to $14 million in 1980,
and by $8 million per year in the following years. These projections could be
on the conservative side (assuming no resource constraints); in particular,
the guarantees could easily grow by considerably higher amounts, if a few
large projects should materialize.



- 33 -
Resource Reguirements
7.04      On the above basis, COFINA's loan commitments 1/ are projected to
be $13.1 million in 1981, and increase to $17.5 million in 1983. For the
commitment period of the proposed loan, roughly JaLnuary 1981-June 1983, COFINA
would then have loan commitments of at least $37 umillion. As discussed in
para 5.02, COFINA does not face resource constraints as such, but requires
untied term funds to mix with its short-term and tied resources. To achieve a
reasonable resource blend, COFINA would require about $20 million from the
Bank, or 54% of its total loan commitments 2/. COFINA would cover the
remainder with borrowings from commercial banks (perhaps $7 million), foreign
export credit institutions ($5 million), miscellaneous sources including USAID
($1 million), and equity ($4 million) 3/.
Financial Prolections
7.05      Annexes 10-12 show COFINA's projected financial statementSs for
the years 1980-1984.  The projections are based on the assumption that after
1980, there will be no income or expenditures on account of Air Panama (para
6.05). COFINA's net profit is expected to increase from $230,000 (1979) to
$3.0 million (1984), or from 1.8% to 8.7% of average equity. This increase
would be caused by a reduction in relative administrative expenses and a
gradual increase in interest income; in addition, the projections take into
account that the problem of Miramar Zona Libre (para 6.02) has been solved.
The projections also assume continued share capital increases (and no dividend
payments); paid-in capital is assumed to be $28.9 million by 1984, compared to
$13.8 million by end 1979. On this basis, the projected debt/equity ratio 4/
is expected to reach a maximum of 4.3:1 as of end 1981 and 1982, and then to
decline to 3.8:1 by end 1984. (If there should be no share capital increases
in the period 1980-84, the debt/equity ratio would reach 7.0:1 by the end of
the period. Also, as mentioned in para 7.03, the projections are based on a
moderate increase in outstanding guarantees. If one or two very large projects
should materialize, COFINA's long-term debt/equity ratio could quickly reach
its statutory limit.)
1/   COFINA has not been keeping statistics on loan commitments.  The projected
commitments for 1980, $19.8 million, is an estimate that includes a
substantial backlog. It is likely that some of these commitments actually
will take place in 1981.
2/   COFINA believes that it may be able to commit about $55 million in this
period; in that case, the proposed loan would cover only about 36% of
COFINA's resource requirements.
3/   COFINA's projected equity increases (Annex 11) will also be utilized
for share investments and to build COFINA's liquidity position.
4/   Total debt (including guarantees) to equity.

VIII. THE PROJECT
Lending Scheme
8.01      The proposed $20 million loan would be made to COFINA at the Bank's
standard interest rate at the time the loan documents are circulated to the
Board (now 9.6% p.a.) and standard 0.75% commitment fee, with the guarantee
of GOP. The proceeds of the loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange 1/
component (para 8.07) of COFINA's subloans and equity investments for the
acquisition of fixed assets (including related services) and permanent working
capital by productive private and public sector enterprises in the manufactur-
ing and related subsectors, such as tourism. Out of the $20 million, COFINA
would also be able to make the following withdrawals: 2/
(a) Up to $200,000 for the foreign exchange cost of technical
assistance and training for COFINA's staff (para 4.09). The
Bank would reimburse 100% of direct foreign exchange costs,
and 60% of total costs if acquired locally (the estimated foreign
exchange content of sending staff to special courses/seminars in
Panama);
(b) Up to $200,000 for the actual foreign exchange cost of studies
and consultancy services for COFINA's promotional activities
(para 4.14).
Basic Features
8.02      Loan Amortization.  As in the case of Loan 1641-PAN, the loan would
carry a fixed amortization schedule (level principal payment). COFINA has
requested such a schedule to give it more flexibility, and to make it easier
to blend the proceeds of the proposed loan with other resources. COFINA would
have adequate liquidity to meet its repayments to the Bank and other lenders.
Maximum subloan amortization schedule would be 15 years from the date of the
loan agreement, with a maximum grace period of three years. The average
subloan term is expected to be about ten years including grace, and COFINA is
expected to make loans with a maturity of up to 12-13 years including grace.
Taking into account the four-year disbursement period of the proposed loan,
the amortization would then be over 15 years including three years of grace.
There would be some roll-over of funds, but this would not impose any foreign
exchange risk (para 8.03). The roll-over funds would be used by COFINA in
line with its Policy Statement.
1/   In the context of Panama's currency system (para 3.01 ), foreign
exchange costs would mean the cost of goods and services incurred
outside of Panama.
2/   Roughly, under the two components combined, COFINA would contact
40 man-months of consultancy services at an average cost of $8,000 per
man-month.



- 35 -
8.03      Foreign Exchange Risk.  Under Loan 1641--PAN, GOP undertook to cover
COFINA against the foreign exchange risk, to ensure its competitive position in
the financial sector in Panama. Since the banking system in Panama uses the
US dollar, COFINA would only be able to pass on the exchange risk (as measured
by the currency pool) by pricing its loans at a considerable discount. Any
exchange risk fee would also have to come out of COFINA's spread, which is
barely adequate. Accordingly, GOP has agreed to take the cross-currency
exchange risk (between the US dollar and the currencies of disbursement
measured by the currency pool) 1/ under the proposed loan. No fee will be
charged for this service.
8.04      Although GOP undertook to carry the exchange risk for Loan 1641-PAN,
it reached only after some time a firm understanding with COFINA on a practical
mechanism for how to handle this coverage. As a result, COFINA incurred some
minor foreign exchange losses. In the future, GOP will reimburse COFINA
promptly for any exchange losses incurred under Loan 1641-PAN as well as under
the proposed loan.
8.05      Interest Rate.  COFINA's minimum onlending rate (which would be
fixed for the period of each subloan) will be reviewed by the Bank and COFINA
every six months, based on: (i) COFINA's cost of borrowed funds; and (ii) the
interest rates charged for term industrial credit by other financial institu-
tions in Panama and in international financial markets. Failure to reach
agreement within a period of two months would cause the Bank to terminate
further authorizations. In view of Panama's open financial system, it is
likely that inflation expectations will be reflected in the market interest
rates. Under present conditions, the minimum initial interest rate would be
13% p.a.; this is higher than the 12.0% BNP will charge initially under its
new loan from IDB (para 3.08), but the difference should not affect signifi-
cantly COFINA's competitive position. The inflation rate for Panama, measured
by the wholesale price index, is projected at 13% for 1981 and at about 10%
p.a. over the period 1982-83; this would give a positive real interest rate
for COFINA of 3.6%, including the 1% p.a. management fee. Inclusive of this
fee, COFINA would have a spread of 4.4%; this is far from excessive in view of
COFINA's low profitability (para 6.09).
8.06      Procurement.  Under the proposed loan, COFINA would follow standard
procurement practice for Bank DFC-type projects. For all subprojects submitted
to the Bank, COFINA will include a discussion of the procurement decision
(para 4.11). Hereunder, it will certify that in its own judgment, the goods
and services to be purchased are suitable for the investment projects and are
reasonably priced. Normally, COFINA will insist on three alternative quota-
tions, which will be listed in its procurement discussion. To ensure a proper
evaluation, COFINA will provide a justification w4henever three quotations have
not been obtained, or when the lowest bids have riot been selected.
1/   COFINA's loans are denominated in US dollars or in balboas, depending on
the denomination of the sources utilized in the respective cases.



- 36 -
8.07      Disbursement.  Panama imports most capital and intermediate goods,
due to the country's emphasis on commerce and service activities. For this
reason, the foreign exchange content of most industrial projects is relatively
high. As under Loan 1641-PAN, the funds of the proposed loan would be utilized
to reimburse COFINA for 100% of amounts disbursed for eligible subproject ex-
penditures (for investment projects for fixed assets and permanent working
capital), up to a limit of 70% of documented total project costs, which is
roughly estimated to represent the average foreign exchange content of COFINA's
projects 1/. In practice, it is likely that COFINA's average financing will
be below this limit. The Bank would also reimburse 100% of direct foreign
exchange costs of studies, consultancy services, and training, and 60% of the
labor if acquired locally (para 8.01). Standard documentation will accompany
withdrawal applications under the proposed loan, which would be fully committed
by June 30, 1983, and disbursed by June 30, 1985. Annex 13 shows the estimated
disbursement schedule for the loan.
8.08      Free Limit.  The free limit for the proposed project would be
$500,000 of Bank assistance (including any amounts committed or outstanding
from Loan 1641-PAN). This is the same as under Loan 1641-PAN, and would per-
mit the Bank to review about 75% of the subloans by amount, and 40% by number.
The Bank will review this limit with COFINA from time to time.
Project Benefits and Risk
8.09      Project Objectives and Benefits.  The proposed loan would have
the following objectives:
(a)  Assist and support the efforts of COFINA's management to
build up COFINA as an efficient development finance institution.
Through these efforts, COFINA should become well placed to play
a leading role in the industrial and financial sectors in Panama.
In addition to being one of the leading institutions for indus-
trial term finance, it would to an increasing extent also engage
in promotional activities and industrial resource mobilization;
1/   This percentage will be calculated following these definitions:
Eligible expenditures: Will only include expenditures for fixed assets
(excluding land) and permanent working capital, including reasonable
transport and installation charges;
Total project costs: Will only include expenditures related to the
investment project being financed (and thus exclusive of sunk costs),
for fixed assets (including land), permanent working capital, relevant
studies and consultancy services, and contingencies up to 10% of the cost
of the fixed assets.



- 37 -
(b) Assist Panama's industrial development through the financing of
economically and financially sound investment projects. COFINA
would provide a substantial portion of the term resources required
for the present expansion in industrial investment, and which to
a large extent would not be available from the commercial banking
system. The subprojects that will be financed under the loan may
generate about 1,750 new jobs;
(c) Support COFINA's promotional efforts in the financial and indus-
trial sectors, inter alia, through the financing of studies and
consultancy services; and
(d) Serve as a vehicle for the future dialogue with GOP in industrial
policy issues, which would follow the completion of the industrial
sector study now being prepared.
8.10      Project Risk.  The primary risk associated with the proposed loan
also concerns COFINA as an institution. During the period of Loan 1641-PAN,
COFINA did not develop as expected, due largely to management changes.
COFINA's present management has already undertaken a number of institutional
improvements, and more are being prepared. However, early changes in manage-
ment could still lead to increased staff turnover, reduced efficiency and
operational quality, and a stagnating level of operations. This could also
affect negatively the utilization of the proposed loan.
IX. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements
9.01      During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
With GOP:
(a) The industrial sector study (para 2.19);
(b) COFINA's share capital increases (para 5.01);
(c) GOP's future guarantees for projects above COFINA's exposure
limit (para 6.07);
(d) The foreign exchange risk under the proposed loan (para 8.03);
With COFINA:
(e) The calculation of economic and financial rates of return
for subprojects (para 4.10);
(f) The procurement procedures under the proposed loan (paras 4.11,
8.06);
(g) The onlending rate under the proposed loan (para 8.05);



- 38 -
(h) The lending scheme for the proposed loan (paras 8.01, 8.02,
8.07); and
(i) The free limit under the proposed loan (para 8.08).
9.02      The following will be conditions for loan effectiveness:
(a) GOP should make the first quarterly share capital contribution
for 1981 (para 5.01);
(b) COFINA's Board should adopt a Strategy Paper satisfactory to
the Bank (para 4.14).
Recommendation
9.03      With the above agreements and understandings, the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for a $20 million loan to COFINA, on the
terms and conditions outlined in Chapter 8.

ANNEX 2
PANAMA
SECOND DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECT
CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL
Statement of Objectives and Policies*
Corporacion Financiera Nacional (COFINA), established under Law
No. 65 of December 10, 1975, will direct its activities in accordance with
the following policies:
1.        General objective
In making its assistance available, COFINA will pursue national
economic and social development priorities as reflected in present and future
national development plans. To that end, the Corporation will:
1.1 Grant short, medium and long-term loans and invest in the capital
stock of productive enterprises so as to foster activities and
ventures likely to further national economic development, parti-
cularly in the following fields:
1.1.1 Manufacturing, assembly and processing industries,
including those that involve the processing of agri-
cultural, forest and fisheries products; and
1.1.2 Transportation, tourism, mining and promotion of exports.
1.2 Provide consulting services and technical assistance designed to
foster industrial development.
1.3 Administer such special funds as may from time to time be placed
at its disposal.
1.4 Engage in whatever additional activities it regards as either
necessary or advantageous in the task of pursuing the objectives
enumerated here.
2.        General policy
2.1 As a national development institution, COFINA will provide assistance
designed to foster the spread of efficient business administration
in all productive sectors in Panama, with the exception of agriculture.
2.2 Assistance made available by COFINA will be in line with national
economic and social development priorities as reflected in Panama's
current and future development plans. COFINA will promote and
finance only projects that are technically and financially viable
and economically sound. COFINA's own economic appraisal of each
project will be based on a consideration of the following factors,
among others:
* Approved by COFINA's Board on November 22, 1978.



41 -
ANNEX 2
2.2.1  The possibilities of saving or generating foreign
exchange;
2.2.2  The contribution to development of a stock of skilled
manpower;
2.2.3  The employment opportunities generated;
2.2.4  The value added to the economy;
2.2.5  The effect on the national budget.
2.3 COFINA will not subsidize enterprises or projects either in the
public or private sector, although, if a project is not considered
financially viable in itself and the Government still has a
special interest in seeing it implemented, COFINA will administer
it for a fee to be determined.  COFINA will not assume any
financial risk in such operations.
2.4 COFINA will undertake studies of those sectors in which a need
is known or thought to exist for its financial support, the inten-
tion being to ensure that its appraisal of projects is comprehensive
and complete. COFINA may also make any other studies likely to
facilitate examination of its own participation in the formulation
of national development policies, thus reinforcing its role as an
active agent in the national planning effort.
2.5 COFINA will have a directional role in the identification and
active promotion of investment opportunities in all productive
sectors of the national economy. When appropriate, the
Corporation will provide its clients with consulting services
and technical assistance in the fields of project planning,
organization and finance, and, in general, will work to ensure
that clients adopt modern management techniques.
3.        Investment policy
3.1  COFINA will make long, medium and short-term loans available on
terms and conditions -- grace and maturity periods, for
instance -- that can be varied to suit the particular require-
ments of each project. In cases considered appropriate, COFINA
will invest in the capital stock of productive enterprises,
guarantee obligations vis-a-vis third parties and itself issue
bonds and securities.
3.2 Each investment decision will rest on prior and complete
appraisal of the particular project based on a comprehensive
and well-documented report which sets out all pertinent facts
on the main aspects of the project (i.e., its technical,
market, administrative, financial and economic facets) and



- 42 -
ANNEX 2
which examines and interprets them. This report will
also give recommendations regarding contractual agreements,
together with computations of the internal, economic and
financial rates of return expected from the project.
3.3  Financing made available by COFINA from its own ordinary
resources will not be less than US$50,000 for any one
project. However, the Corporation may consider applica-
tions for financing amounting to less than US$50,000 when
they are of economic interest.
3.4  COFINA will be careful to maintain a good balance in its
loan portfolio by means of a prudent spreading of its
commitments (loans, guarantees, participations) across
the various sectors of the economy specified as constituting
its proper sphere of corporate activity.
3.5  The risk assumed by COFINA in connection with any project will
be kept to a reasonable level. As a general rule, the total
sums committeed (in the form of loans, guarantees and stock
participations) by the Corporation to a specific project will
normally not exceed 70% of total project cost, and will in
no case exceed 80%.
3.6  So that the general level of risk borne by the Corporation
may be kept within acceptable limits, its total commitment
(loans, stock participations and guarantees or sureties) to
a single borrower will be limited to US$4 million equivalent
through 1982 and thereafter adjusted to 20% of capital and
reserves.
3.7  Exceptions may be made in regard to the restrictions enumerated
in paragraphs 3.5. and 3.6 above in cases where COFINA is
acting either as a depositary-trustee, or on behalf of the
Government as the administrator of funds earmarked for specific
projects, or when the obligations it has assumed vis-a-vis third
parties are totally and unconditionally covered under the
Government's guarantee.
3.8  As a general rule, COFINA will not invest more than 20% of its
own capital and reserves in the capital stock of any one enter-
prise.  The Corporation's total investment in stock participa-
tions will not exceed 75% of its capital and reserves.
3.9  Under normal circumstances, COFINA will not grant loans for
the purpose of refinancing projects or enterprises.



- 43 -
ANNEX 2
3.10 In principle, COFINA will only participate in the financing
of a project when necessary equipment, machinery, civil works
construction and services are procured through widely based
invitations to tender. Wherever possible, international
bidding procedures will be required, although, should there
be local contractors or suppliers qualified to bid, it will
be considered sufficient if procurement procedures
are restricted to them. No proceedings for the procurement of
goods and services, or for the award of contracts, involving all or
part of the financial assistance obtained from COFINA may go ahead
until the borrower or the promoter of the project has consulted
COFINA.
3.11  COFINA will not finance infrastructure projects for roads,
buildings, etc., unless such infrastructure constitutes part
of a particular project and that project falls within COFINA's
special sphere of operations.
3.12  Part of COFINA's role will be to act as a catalyst in mobilizing
resources in the domestic banking sector or abroad through the
cofinancing of viable projects within Panama.
4.        Financial policy
4.1  The fundamental general aim of COFINA's financial policies will
be the administration of its funds in such a way that it will at
all times be in a position to meet its obligations and obtain a
profit margin which covers its operating costs and allows it to
maintain reserves that are adequate to kceep up the value of its
capital in real terms.
4.2  COFINA will maintain a proper balance between the maturities on
its own obligations and those on the loans it makes available.
4.3  In cases where COFINA borrows in currencies other than US dollars,
it will not assume any exchange risk. Such risk will be
assumed by the Government of Panama or by the final user of the
funds borrowed.
4.4* COFINA will charge a fixed interest rat,e on its loans based on
LIBOR and its own cost of funds such that the rate charged will
at least equal the higher of LIBOR plus 2% or COFINA's average
cost of borrowed funds plus 3%. The rate will be periodically
adjusted to reflect prevailing LIBOR rates and COFINA's own
cost of funds.
4.5  In addition to interest, COFINA will collect a once-only fee
of up to 1% of total loan proceeds payable at the time of the
first disbursement. The purpose of this fee will be to cover
the cost of the studies and analyses made in connection with
project appraisal.
* This para is no longer operative, and should be changed.



- 44 -
ANNEX 2
4.6 Whenever it extends a guarantee to a supplier, a bidder or
a lender, COFINA will charge a fee, the size of which will
depend on the nature of the particular project, the current
or expected future status of the borrower's business, the
extent of the commitment made, the amount guaranteed and
the duration of COFINA's commitment. In the normal course
of events, this fee will be not less than 1.5% per annum
of the loan proceeds actually disbursed.
4.7 All COFINA loans will be subject to a standard commitment
charge of 1% per annum on funds committed but not utilized
or disbursed; it will be payable from the date of signature
of the loan contract or at the latest from the thirtieth day
following receipt by the borrower of written notice of
COFINA's decision to grant the loan.
4.8 As a general rule, the maximum term of a loan or guarantee
will be 15 years from the date of the contract of loan or
guarantee to the date of the last repayment scheduled. The
maximum grace period will be five years from the date of the
loan contract. Approval of a loan or guarantee application
shall remain effective for a maximum of six months from the
date of the decision to approve.
4.9 All expenses such as legal fees, bank charges, commissions
and the cost of analyses and studies other than those covered
by normal COFINA charges will be regarded as recoverable
expenses during the loan application and contract period.
4.10 COFINA will require adequate collateral for all loans it
grants, which may be in the form of securities, mortgages,
pledges, bonds and shares that have market value. The type
and amount of collateral required will depend on the
nature of the assets put forward and the readiness with
which they can be liquidated, on the position of the
guarantors and on other considerations, particularly the
feasibility of the particular project.
4.11 In certain specific circumstances, such as inability to
meet repayment obligations or failure to carry out loan
conditions fully, COFINA, having duly notified the
borrower, may either partially or totally suspend his
right to further disbursement of loan proceeds.
4.12  COFINA will make adequate provision to cover possible losses
and will maintain reserves at a level consistent with
generally accepted financial practices and in keeping with
the extent and nature of its portfolio of loans, guarantees
and other investments.



- 45 -
ANNEX 2
4.13 Whenever COFINA requires credit facilities with which to
finance its lending operations, it will obtain funds locally
or abroad by negotiating loans or issuing bonds. The Corporation
will be prudent in taking on financial obligations and will not
contract, assume or guarantee any debt if as a result of that
particular operation the whole ensemble of obligations contracted,
assumed or guaranteed by the Corporatiorn would then exceed five
times the value of its capital and reserves.
5.        Relations with enterprises financed
5.1 When making capital stock investments, COFINA will not endeavor
to obtain control of the particular company or project. As a
general rule, the maximum investment by COFINA in shares will be
limited to 25% of the capital stock of a single body corporate or
borrower. The Corporation will also normally avoid takins on
management responsibilities for the projects or companies it
invests in, although this does not mean that it may not insist
on placing a representative with the right to be heard and to
vote on the Board of Directors of some or all of the companies
in which it holds shares or to which it has made loans not yet
repaid or to which it has extended guarantees.
5.2  On reaching a decision as to the type anid amount of financial
assistance it will provide in a particular case, COFINA will
take into account all the financial requirements of the project
itself as well as the general financial position of the borrowers
concerned.
5.3 In accordance with sound banking practice, COFINA will insist
that its borrowers obtain and keep up adequate insurance policies,
that they maintain accounting records as dictated by generally
accepted business principles and that they furnish such information
on their operations and costs as may be required by COFINA. The
Corporation will have the right to inspect borrowers' books,
operations and finances from time to time.
5.4 All information and business secrets divulged by a loan applicant
or borrower will be treated by COFINA as strictly confidential.
6.        Organizational policies
6.1 The management of COFINA will formulate administrative procedures,
regulations and guidelines designed to achieve maximum efficiency
in the conduct of the Corporation's operations and the-provision
of its services.



-4t) -
ANNEX 2
6.2 COFINA's operating expenses and costs will be kept as low as
possible, although they will be consistent with the range of
its activities and the volume and quality of its operations.
6.3 COFINA will establish what indicators it regards as necessary
for the measurement and monitoring of the following:
6.3.1 Observance of all legal and operational procedures
and regulations;
6.3.2 The efficiency of those procedures and the accuracy
and precision of all accounting records;
6.3.3 The management of its assets and the utilization of
its funds; and
6.3.4 Maintenance of an adequate personnel cost control system.
6.4 COFINA will contract the services of a firm of independent
external auditors of recognized prestige to carry out periodic
audits. The management of COFINA will ensure that the Corpora-
tion's internal audit procedures are subject to constant ongoing
evaluation as regards their effectiveness and reliability, and
also that audits are carried out at suitable intervals for the
purpose of protecting Corporation assets.
6.5 COFINA will maintain an effective system for:
(a) the selection of key personnel;
(b) the implementation of personnel development policies in
keeping with Corporation needs and requirements in that
sphere.
6.6  From time to time, the management of COFINA will issue specific
regulations and put out manuals which interpret and facilitate
implementation of this Statement of Objectives and Policies.

B. OBJECTIVES
Basic Objectives
2.          Within the framework of the policiets to be implemented by
the Government COFINA will perform a major role! in promotion and technical
and financial assistance in support of developmtent projects in the
following areas:
(a)    Manufacture, assembly and processing industries, including
those concerned with the integrated processing of forestry



- 48-                      ANNEX3
and agricultural products.
(b)    Transportation, tourism, mining and export promotion.
3.          Special importance and emphasis will be attached to projects
contributing to:
(a)    The creation of jobs and income;
(b)    Industries oriented to savings and the generation of foreign
exchange;
(c)    Development of projects outside the metropolitan area;
(d)    Employment of technology that will contribute to productivity
and not necessarily replace workers.
C. STRATEGY FOR THE REALIZATION OF THESE OBJECTIVES
4.          In seeking to realize the above objectives COFINA will place
primary emphasis on stimulating, supporting, promoting and participating
in the projects that represent its basic objectives (section B above).
5.          COFINA will give its support to investments that show an
economic return and to activities consistent with the development objectives
established and supported by feasibility studies.
6.          Wherever necessary, COFINA will arrange for effective technical
assistance in the implementation of projects and consider the participation
in such operations of other financial and support institutions in Panama.
D. ACTIVITIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN
Promotion
7.          COFINA willintensify its promotional activities and will give
priority to these as part of its function as development bank. With this
in view the following actions should be taken:
(a)    The regional offices will intensify their promotional activities,
oriented to identifying new and potential projects that could
be implemented. Promotional activities will also be undertaken
at national and international levels with a view to stimulating
investment.



- 49 -                 ANNEX 3
(b)    Participate in the study of the industrial sector that is
shortly to be financed by the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), so as to be able to develop and formulate priority
policies of resource mobilization for projects in those
subsectors that require substantial financial support for
their expansion.
(c)    Undertake special research into the development potential
of projects and into the various fields of economic activity
associated with these andprepare project profiles to be used
as a basis for development programs for new investments.
8.          COFINA will participate in the preparation of additional
projects to be used as a basis for the formulation of such strategic
projects as the following: Colon Plan, development of industrial estates,
industries associated with the fishing port at Vacamonte and others.
Financial Policy
9.          COFINA will promote the development of the capital market
through the placement of securities. If market conditions permit, a stock
exchange will be established for the channeling of resources primarily
into industrial development. To this end, activities have been coordinated
with the Ministry of Trade and Industry with a view to developing effective
mechanisms for the possible organization of such a national stock exchange.
10.         COFINA will participate, in the form of investments in share
capital, in projects that require such stimulation for their implementation.
Special importance will be attached to the availability of COFINA funds
and to project risks. Co-financing operations with the banking system in
Panama will also be promoted in order to increase the latter's participation
in industrial financing. COFINA, seeking to attract external financial
resources, will obtain financial support from the developed countries,
whose export-promoting agencies can finance projects that use the capital
goods they manufacture.
11.         Contact will also be made with development banks with a view
to obtaining co-financing in the form of loans and/or capital contributions
for any multinational projects that can be undertaken.
Lending Policy
12.         In the financial support and technical assistance it seeks to
promote to achieve the objectives of industria:L development, COFINA will
take the following into account:
(a)    COFINA will appraise each project :Ln the light of technical,
marketing, financial, economic and other important considerations.
(b)    COFINA will provide financing mainly for the purchase of fixed



-50 -                 ANNEX 3
assets and will seek to give the Panamanian banking system
an increasing role in the financing of the corresponding
working capital.
(c)    COFINA will seek to ensure that promoters participate
increasingly in projects. In no case may this contribution
be less than 20% of the project cost.
(d)    COFINA will use the criteria normally applied in banking
practice in respect of the conditions, duration and repayment
installments of the loans it makes.
(e)    COFINA's project financing may take the form of loans, invest-
ments in share capital and guarantees, provided its actions
are consistent with the objectives of economic development,
taking into consideration the rate of return, the level of risk
and the capacity of the borrower to meet debt servicing on
the project.
(f)    Normally COFINA will limit its participation to 70% of the
total cost of each project and in no circumstances may this
exceed 80% of the cost, and the sum at risk, in the case
of each firm, may not exceed 60% of the total of its fixed
assets or whichever of these two criteria is the lower.
(g)    In its financial analysis of projects COFINA will lay special
emphasis on the capacity to meet debt servicing.
(h)    In the case of projects involving investments in share capital,
capital and reserve levels, amongst other factors, will be
taken into account.
(i)    In the course of appraising each project COFINA will calculate
the financial rate of return for all loans, investments and
guarantees with a value exceeding B100,000 and, in addition,
the economic rate of return for projects with a value exceeding
B500,000.
(j)    COFINA will give priority to financing medium and large-scale
enterprises. In this way it will seek to increase the average
size of its loans.
Institutional Aspects
13.         COFINA will increase its profits by adopting a systematic policy
for interest-rates and collections, raising the efficiency of its operations
and increasing the average size of the subprojects it finances.



- 51 -                 ANNEX 3
14.         COFINA will seek to improve its organization and operations,
including the appraisal, supervision, monitoring and management of
projects.
15.         COFINA will introduce a system of staff grading, evaluation,
promotion and incentives and will seek to improve working conditions with
a view to maintaining the technical quality of its staff and doing
everything possible to avoid an unnecessary turnover.
16.         COFINA will expand its staff selectively and to the extent
necessary in the light of increases in its ope.rations.
17.         COFINA will continue to attach importance to the effective
trainings of its staff, adding to their knowledge in various fields of
development banking in order to achieve optimum performance levels.
Emphasis will be laid on the development and strengthening of the
executive and supervisory functions of the intermediate levels of authority
without overlooking technical requirements.
18.         COFINA will develop a system for coordinating action by the
various State agencies in order to ensure uniformity of criteria in
project financing.
