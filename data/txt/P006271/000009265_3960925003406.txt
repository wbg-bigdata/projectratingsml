PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - ARAUCARIA FERTILIZER PPOJECT
(LOAN 1256-BR)
PREFACE
1.        On May 11, 1976 the Bank approved a loan of US$50.0 million
equivalent to Petrobras Fertilizantes S.A., (PETROFERTIL) to assist in the
financing of the Araucaria Fertilizer Project (Loan 1256-BR). The loan was
guaranteed by the Government of Brazil. In March 1981, with the agreement
of the Bank, the Project ownership was transferred to Industria e Comercio
de Pertilizantes S.A. (ULTRAFERTIL), a subsidiary of PETROPERTIL. The
repayment and other obligations under the loan agreement were therefore
assumed by ULTRAFERTIL.
1.        Work on the Project continued after the closing of the loan on
March 31, 1981 to complete construction. The plant was commissionet in
January 1982 but commercial operations started in March 1983 due to
physical and mechanical problems. After the start of commercial
operations, IND staff visited Braiil in December 1983 for the preparation
of the Project Completion Report (PCR) and had discussions with the
Government, PETROFERTIL and ULTRAFERTIL, the Project implementing agency.
A follow-up mission visited Brazil in October 1984 to finalize the draft
PCR prepared by ULTRAFERTIL. This report reflects the findings of these
missions as well as a review of the project files and related documents.
The report also incorporates, wherever appropriate, comments received from
the Borrower, which are appended at the end of this report.
3.        In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.

PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - ARAUCARIA FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1256-BR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Over the last two decades, Brazil has been promoting increased
agricultural production through mechanization, irrigation, extension,
research and by making available to the farmers agricultural credits and
modern inputs including fertilizers. In this context, the Government
encouraged domestic production of fertilizers to reach self-sufficiency to
ensure their reliable supply to farmers (para 1.01).
2.        PETROBRAS, a state-owned petroleum company, was antrusted the
task of expanding the nitrogenous fertilizer production in Brazil. In
March 1976, PETROBRAS organized PETROFERTIL, a subsidiary, to build, own
and operate three ammonia/urea plants, including the Araucaria Fertilizer
Project (the Project). The Project was appraised in October 1975 following
a request from PETROBRAS. The Board approved a Bank loan of US$ 50.0
million equivalent to PETROFERTIL at an interest rate of 8.5X per annum
(p.a.) with a maturity of about 15 years, including a grace period of about
4.5 years. The loan which became effective on July 20, 1976, was
guaranteed by the Government of Brazil for a fee of 1.51 p.a.(para 1.03 -
2.02).
3.        The Project was designed to produce 495,000 tons per year (tpy)
of urea and 396,000 ipy of ammonia of which 100,500 tpy of ammonia would be
for direct sale. The Project also produces 7,920 tpy methanol and 19,140
tpy sulfur as a by-product. The Project uses as feedstoc): high sulfur
heavy residue (HSHR) fuel oil from which almost all the diesel oil,
normally contained in fuel oil as diloent, has been extracted. The
resulting product (HSHR) used as the Project's feedstock is not easily
marketable refinery product, thus contributing to improving Brazil's
petroleum product balance (para 2.03-2.04).
4.        In March 1981, with the agreement of the Bank, the Project
ownership was transferred to ULTRAFERTIL, a subsidiary of PETROFERTIL,
which assumed repayment and other obligations under the loan agreement.
The Project employs 716 persons. ULTRAPERTIL trained a total of 480 people
of which 370 were employed. The Project facilities were mechanically
completed in January 1982, 34 months behind the original schedule due
principally to delays in the supply of locally-manufactured equipment. A
larger than expected commissioning period of 15 months to bring the units
to commercial operation phase, further increased overall delay tc 45
months. Physical and mechanical problems with process units were the main
reasons for the prolonged commissioning period. Except for some



- vi -
coordination problems at the early stages of Project implementation, the
performance of the foreign engineering firm was generally satisfactorily.
However, the domestic firms experienced severe problem In the design,
scheduling and manufacturing of equipment resulting in completion delays
and cost overruns (para 3.01-3.07).
5.        PETROFERTIL followed generally acceptable procurement procedures
for construction, equipment, erection and civil works. In the initial
stages, however, there were some difficulties in understanding and
following the Bank guidelines. Subsequently, with Bank assistance, the
procurement department was completely reorganized and systems were
established to carry out procurement efficiently. During Project
implementation, the decision to procure more equipment locally was the
major cause of completion delays(due to delivery delays by Brazilian
manufactureres ranging from 3 to 17 months) as well as of cost overruns
(due to higher cost of locally procured equipment and materials) (para
3.08-3.10).
6.        The total Project cost was US$478.3 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of US$271.9 million, representing a 762 cost overrun
mainly due to : (i) Lgher cost of locally manufactured equipment; (ii)
project completion delays; (iii) long commissioning period; and (iv) higher
domestic inflation rates.  Total financing required of US$ 478.3 million
was met with equity provided by PETROBRAS (54.11), Bank loan (10.51) and
other long-term borrowings (35.4X) (para 3.13-3.16).
7.        ULTRAFERTIL projects to reach 90X capacity utilization by 1987,
and expects that the market demand will absorb such production. The
financial rate of return (FRR) for the Project is now estimated at -1.41
and 7.7% under two scenarios compared to the appraisal estimate of 22.21,
mainly due Zo (i) long completion delays; (ii) extessive cost overruns; and
(iii) the low ex-factory prices set by the Government's pricing policy.
Under this policy, ex-factory prices are set at lower than international
level and ar:e based on a cost-plus formula fc a designated efficient
producer which was built many years ago at lower capital cost, and whose
facilities have been substantilly depreciated. The Project's financial
statements are consoltdated, since March 1981, with ULTRAPKRTIL financial
statements. Despite unfavorable Project finances, ULTRAPERTIL remains
financially sound and meets the financial convenants agreed upon with the
Bank. The economic rate of return (ERR) is now computed at 7.6% compared
to the appraisal estimate of 23.8%. The net annual foreign exchange
savinge from the Project are estimated to be about US$94 million (in
constatnt 1983 dollars). In addition, the Project has resulted in
substantial technology transfer to Brazilian firms especially in
engineering and heavy specialized equipment manufacturing but at a high
cost to the Project (para 5.01-6.05).L/
1/   Please see Borrower's comments in which slightly different estimates
of FRR and ERR using somewhat different assumptions are presented.



- vii -
8.        During various phases of the Project, the Bank worked closely
with PSTROPRTIL and ULTRAFRTIL and contributed in arranging Project
financing, improving procurement activities, and helping to set up the
Project organization. tovever, due to the lack of experienced and dynamic
management, the Project suffered serious implementation problems some of
which could have been controlled by the management. In hiLdsight, the Bank
should also have I-en more forceful in resisting certain changes (e.g.
procurement of more locally manufactured equipment) and in influencing
certain managerial and organizational 5mprovements during Project
implementation (para 7.01-8.03).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - ARAUCARIA FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1256-BR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Brazil's agricultural policy aims to increase agricultural
production and make Brazil one of t'  world's foremost producers and
exporters of agricultural commodities. 'razil plans to achieve this
objective both by expanding the area under cultivation and by using
intensive agricultural practices supported by extension programs, increased
fertilizer application, better credit availability and use of improved
seeds. From the mid-1960s, as a result of rural credit expansion as well
as o:.her subsidized inputs needed to modernize Brazil's agricultural
ector, fertilizer consumption increased rapidly. Annual fertilizer
consumption growth rates which had been negligible before 1966, improved to
an average rate of 35$ annually through 1972 and then moderated to 142
annually during 1973-80. Until 1974, Brazil's fertilizer industry
consisted of a large number of relatively small companies, mainly
concentrating on importing, blending and distribution of fertilizers. In
1974, the Government launched the National Fertilizer Program for a major
expansion of production capacity based on large scale, efficient plants,
with a view to achiqving self-sufficency by the mid-1980s.  The Bank
supported three of these projects--the fuel oil-based ammonia/urea couplex
near Araucaria, Parana, in the Southeast (Loan 1256-BR); a gas-based
ammonia/urea complex in Sergipe, Salvador, in the Northeast (Loan 1406-BR);
and the Valefertil phosphatic fertilizer plant near Uberaba, Minas Gerais,
in the Centerwest (Loan 1411-BR). Other projects included in the National
Fertilizer Program, and not supported by the Bank, were not implemented.
1.02      Fertilizer consumption in Brazil has grown rapidly but
erratically, responding to changes in the country's economic conditions.
The fertilizer nutrient consumption in Brazil increased from 2.5 million
tons in 1976 to 4.0 million tons in 1980, but decreased to 2.2 million tons
in 1983 due to the poor foreign and domestic economic situation of the
country and the elimination of subsidies for agriculture. The high
inflation rates, large public deficit, and the increased volumes of
subsidized rural credits forced the Government, in 1980-81, to reviewAi its
rural credit policies for agricultural investment and production. As a
result, Brazilian agriculture faced a new reality of non-subsidized
financial costs for agricultural inputs and investments. Faced with this
situation, the Brazilian farmer in the first year (1981) of the new rural
credit policies depleted his fertilizer Inventories and in the second year
(1982) started cutting back on fertilizer application. This rezulted in a
very sharp decrease in demand during 1981-83 - nearly 36% - dropping
present consumption level to that prevailing in 1976/77. This transition
period coincided with the initial production years of the two new
nitrogenoua fertilizer projects supported by the Bank and as a result could



-2-
not be operated at their target capacities. The recent recovery of
international prices for agricultural commodities traditionally exported by
Brazil opens up a new horizon for the internal fertilizer demand;
consumption trend in 1984 seems to support this development- By 1990
Brazil's fertilizer nutrient consumption is expected to reach 4.0 million
tons per year, the level achieved in 1980, representing an annual growth
rate of 9%. This growth rate appears reasonable given the fact that
fertilizer demand in Brazil grew at an average rate of 35% p.s. during
1966-72 and 14% during 1973-80.
1.03      The expansion of nitrogenous fertilizer production in Brazil was
entrusted to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS), a Government-owned
petroleum company responsible for the exploration and exploitation of the
country's hydrocarbon resources. PETROBRAS was already substantially
involved in the chemical industry through its subsidiary, Petrobras Quimica
S.A., (PETROQUISA) which had responsibility for PETROBRAS interests in the
chemical and petrochemical industries. In view of the growing fertilizer
activities, PETROBRAS, in March 1976, organized another subsidiary,
Petrobras Pertilizantes S.A. (PETROFERTIL) to foster the development of the
domestic fertilizer industry, and in particular to own and operate the
Project in Araucaria as well as the two other fertilizer projects supported
by the Bank.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.  Project Idenzification, Preparation, Appraisal, Approval
and Loan Effectiveness
2.01      Following a request from PETROBRAS for Bank participation in
the Project, a Bank identification mission visited Brazil in May 1975. The
Project was appraised in October 1975. The process technology, engineering
features, procurement procedures, and co-financing arrangements were
extensively discussed with the Bank during and after appraisal. The Bank
also discussed with various Government agencies, PETROBRAS, and PETROFERTIL
the need for a fertilizer sector study covering consumption, distribution
and financing requirements of capacity expansion as well as to develop a
mechanism to update demand/supply forecasts and related data on a periodic
basis.
2.02      On May 11, 1976, the Board approved a Bank loan of US$50 million
equivalent to PETROFERTIL at an interest rate of 8.5% p.a. and a maturity
of about 15 years, including about 4.5 years of grace period. The loan was
guaranteed by the Government for a fee of 1.5% p.a. The luan became
effective on July 20, 1976.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2.03      The Project's major objective was to contribute towards the
development of the agricultural sector in Brazil by satisfying economically



- 3 -
the growing nitrogenous fertilizer demand in the Southeast region of the
country. In addition, a secondary objective was to create an outlet for
the high sulfur heavy residue to be produced by PETROBRAS refinery then
under construction at Araucaria. The Project was designed to produce
495,500 tons per year (tpy) of urea and 396,000 tpy of ammonia of which
100,500 tpy (of ammonia) would be for direct sale.   The Project also
produces 7,920 tpy methanol - partly for captive use in the Rectisol
process for the removal of sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide from the
process gases, and 19,140 tpy of sulfur as a by-product. The Project
includes the following main facilities: (i) a gasification plant for
partial oxidation of the residual oil; (ii) a 1200 tons per day (tpd)
ammonia plant; (illi) a 1500 tpd urea platt; (iv) a 58 tpd sulfur recovery
plant; (v) a 24 tpd methanol synthesis plant; and (vi) necessary utilities,
offaite facilities, effluent treatment and disposal systems.
2.04      The Project uses as its main raw material high sulfur heavy
residue (HSIR) obtained from the nearby refinery. By using the USHR as
feed to the fertilizer plant, it would allow extraction of about 30X of
diesel oil normally left in fuel oil to meet market specification into the
diesel yield of the Tefinery, thus increasing transportation fuel at the
expense of fuel oil.' The resulting HSHR would, however, not have been
easily marketable. It 90% capacity utilization of the Project, use of the
HSRR (about 300,000 tpy) as the Project's feedstock increases Brazil's
diesel availability by about 1.5 million barrels per annum. The Project,
therefore, indirectly contributes to improving Brazil's petroleum product
balance.
-II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project has achieved its major objectives of providing
fertilizer to the Southeast region of the country and of utilizing the high
sulfur heavy residue; however, this has been achieved at a high cost. The
Project experienced long completion delays (34 months) and excessive cost
overruns (76X) (para 3.10-3.13). The Project was completed and
commissioned in January 1982, about 34 months behind the original
schedule. The pre-operational phase also lasted excessively long - about
15 months, bringing the commercial operation date to March 1983, about 45
months behind the original schedule.
B. Project Scope
3.02      There was no significant change in the Prvject scope, except for
the addition of a small methanol unit to supply the captive methanol demand
of the Project. In addition, small modifications were carried out during
start-up to facilitate more flexible operation of the complex. These
include: (i) connecting steam system to the neighboring Gertulio Vargas
Refinery; (ii) modifications to speed up the motor driven plunger pumps of



- 4 -
waste water for further treatment to avoid pollution problems. These
changes did not significantly increase the Project costs, but improved
systems economy and safety. In addition, ULTRAFERTIL is installing (i) a
fourth gasifier assembly at the ammonia unit to further improve and
stabilize capacity utilization at the plant; and (ii) a refinery off gas
utilization unit to provide itself with the flexibility of substituting
high sulphur heavy fuel oil with residual gas from the refinery (page 6 and
7 of Borrower's comments).
C. ProJect Ownership and Management
3.03      Initially, PETROBRAS had the responsibility for Project
implementation. Based on PETROBRAS's experience for executing large
projects, a new group, COFEN-PR, was organized within the Engineering
Service Structure (SEGEN) of PETROBRAS. However, by the time the Bank loan
was approved, PETROBRAS has already organised PETROFERTIL which became the
official borrower for the Bank loan and took over the implementation
responsibility for the Project. PETROFERTIL formed the Araucaria
Enterprise Management (GEMPAR) to manage the Project. In March 1981, with
the agreement of the Bank, the Project ownership was transferred to
ULTRAPERTIL S.A., a subsidiary of PETROFERTIL, to better utilize the
operating experience of ULTRAEERTIL. As a consequence of this transfer,
ULTRAFERTIL assumed repayment and other obligations under the loan
a2reement. PETROFERTIL and the Project organization is shown in Annex 1.
At present ULTRAPERTIL owns and operates three fertilizer plants at
Cubatao, Piagaguera and Araucaria. Thus, the expertise of ULTRAFERTIL in
operations and especially in marketing became available to the Project
while at the same time maintaining the overall reaponsibility of
PETROPERTIL as a holding company. In retrospecL however, these
arrangements did not prove adequate and the Project suffered from the lack
of experienced and dynamic management resulting in long completion delays
and excessive cost overruns somP of which could have been controlled by the
Project management.
D. Manpower Development and Training
3.04      The Project's manpower requirement at the time of appraisal was
estimated as 400 jobs in production and an additional 400 in the subsequent
distribution network. At present, the Project employs 716 persons
consisting of administrative-142, production-293, maintenance-187,
technical-67, and others-27 (Annex 1-4). The present operation and
maintenance manpower level is substantially higher than the appraisal
estimate, mainly due to the complexities of the plant and operating
difficulties. The present manpower is, however, not considered excessive.
3.05      Based on its past experience, PETROBRAS developed and implemented
a comprehensive training program. As technically experienced personnel
were not easily available in the area, training efforts started as early as
in 1976. Engineers and technicians were trained in universities and
technical schools with the participation of experienced PETROBRAS
personnel. Selected trainees were then sent abroad where necessary for
specific areas of expertise. Training activities continued up to 1982, and
covered a total of 480 people of whom 370 were employed, as shown below.

E. Performance of Engineering Contractors
3.06      Two engineering companies of the Federal Republic of Germany
(FRG), in partnershi,, were responsible for the basic engineering, foreign
procurement services, supervision of detailed engineering made in Brazil,
erection, pre-operation and start-up supervision for the amonia and ureat
units. A Brazilian engineering company undertook the detailed engineering
for the Project. Process licenses for different sections of the complex
were provided by the foreign firms. PRTROBRAS/PRTWOFRTIL opted not to use
external assistance for Project management; the decision, in retrospect,
may have been a costly mistake.
3.07      PITROFERTIL was, in general, satisfied with the services provided
by the contractors. However, had the relations between the foreign firms
and their Brazilian counterparts been coordinated more effectively In the
early stages of the Project implementation, many problems that occurred
during the civil works construction could have been avoided. At later
stages of Project implementatlon such cooperation was improved but
substantial delay (about 17 months) had already occured which was never
recouped.
F.  Procurement and Performance of Su  lirs
3.08      PETROFERTIL followed generally acceptable procedures for
contracting and procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines were followed for procuring
the foreign equipment and materials. Among foreign suppliers the met
important country of origin was FRG which wa 621 of the contracts financed
by the Bank loan. The next highest foreign suppliers under the Bank loan
were from USA (11.4Z) followed by Japan (10) (Annex 2). At the Initial
stages of Project implementation the PETROFIRTIL procurement department had
difficulties in understanding and following the Bank guidelines.
Subsequently, with Bank assistance, the procurement department was
reorganized and systems were established to carry out procurement
activities effectively.
3.09      Of the total amount disbursed for procurement of equipment,
materials and other se-vices (excluding pre-operating expenses), 562



- 6 -
corresponds to local cost and 44Z to foreign cost (both direct and
indirect) items against the appraisal estimate of 511 and 49%,
respectively. However, for the equipment and materials only the share of
foreign expenditures was 501 compared to the appraisal estimate of 63Z
(para 3.13). The larger share of local supplies was mainly because of the
increase in the reserve list during Project implementation due to the
efforts of the domestic manufacturers to maximixe their participation which
the Project management was unsuccessful in avoiding. These local supplies
were not financed by the Bank, but by local sources, principally equity
from PETROBRAS. Domestic manufacturers often experienced difficulties in
the design, scheduling, and manufacture of such equipment aid in meeting
rigid quality control procedures of international standarde (especially FRG
DIN and ADNERKBLATTEVt Codes). Some of the sophisticated equipment such as
multi-wall vessels, tIgh pressure exchangers and some rotary equipment,
were being manufact*ed for the first time in Brazil. Domestic suppliers
frequently depended upon imported raw materials, licenses and/or know-how
and lacked proper coordinated efforts in obtaining these items in time.
Such problems often caused long delays in deliveries ranging from 3 to 17
months.
3.10      In addition, difficulties encountered by local manufacturers in
fabricating some of the equipment for the first time were also reflected in
equipment failures/inadequacies faced by ULTRAPERTIL during testing and
commissioning. These difficulties resulted in excessively long
commissioning period (15 months). However, there were no major problems in
obtaining equipment suppliers' cooperation and assistance in carrying out
the required repairs/modifications related to the equipment problems
encountered during commissioning and initial operation.
G. Project Implementation Schedule
3.11      The mechanical completion and commissioning dates of various
facilities are listed in Annex 3. The Project was mechanically completed
in January 1982, about 34 months behind appraisal schedule.  The above
delay was mainly due to the following factors: (i) delay in the start of
civil works; (ii) delays in the deliveries of local materials and equipment
(para 3.09); and (iii) delay in the completion of the effluent treatment
system. Despite Project management's efforts to achieve earlier mechanical
completion, established target dates were constantly deferred from July
1979 to January 1982, Indicating the use of unrealistic target dates in the
programming of implementation schedule. In retrospect, the Project
management should have been more realistic in making implementation
schedules and should have used modern scheduling and monitoring techniques
(e.g. PERT) to monitor Project Implementation.
3.12      Following commissioning, a number of technical and operational
problems were experienced and the production could not be stabilized at
targeted levels without Intermittent equipment failures until end 1982,
primarily because of the design/mechanical problems in the locally
manufacturered equipment.  The major problems were:  (i) lmtations on
refrigeration plant; (il) abnormally high (3.6 times more than design
value) consumption of nitrogen in the wash plant; (iii) distribution of gas



in the catalyst bed of shift converter reactor; (iv) deficiency in meezing
the effluent specifications on cyanhydric acid (HCN) stripper and excessive
corrosion on stripper column; (v) very sbort life (only 200 hours against
1200 to 2000 design hours) of atomizer guns of the gasifiers; and (vi)
limited capacity and/or vibration problems on rotary machinuiry. It appears
that despite long and comprehensive training efforts, the lack of direct
experience with the operation and maintenance of large fuel-oil based
plants resulted in a longer than normal in-plant familiaritation period for
the staff. The technical problems were gradually overcome by carrying out
certain plant modifigations during January 1982 - March 1983 with the help
of the engineering f*rms and/or manufacturers of the equipment and
machinery. Even aftbr giving allowance for the fact that the Project was
the first fuel-oil based fertilizer complex in Brazil and that at the time
world experience with such plants was limited, the difficulties encountered
in stabilizing production at Araucaria are considered unusual.
H. Capital Costs, ?inancing and Disbursements
3.13      A table summarizing the Project capital cost estimates at the
time of appraisal and the actual costs is presented below:

3.14      Total actual Project cost was US$478.3 million, 76Z higher than
the appraisal estimate of US$271.9 million, mainly due to the delays in
Project completion, higher prices of domestic equipment and the higher than



- 8 -
expected domestic Inflation rates. Detailed analysis of the cost overrun
is presented in Annex 4. After accounting for contingencies, the major
increases occurred on (i) equipment and materials-22X; (il) engineering,
civil works and erection-17%; (iii) pra-operating expeases-35X; and (iv)
interest during construction-26%. The actual cost of locally manufactured
equipment was US$123.7 million (including US$28.7 million of indirect
foreign exchange cost) compared to the appraisal estimate of US$58.6
million (including U,S$13.8 million of indirect foreign exchange cost and
excluding contingencies). Long commissioning period caused huge
supervision and pre4-perating expenses (US$88.0 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of US$13.2 million).   During appraisal, local capital
costs were estimated using international inflation rates. It was assumed
that the difference   between the international and domestic inflation
rates will be reflected in the relative exchange rates. Further it was
also assumed that the majority of the equipment orders would have been
placed by end-1976 early-1977. In fact, both international and domestic
inflation rates (weighted average) exceeded appraisal estimates, partly as
a result of the higher than expected domestic inflation rates and longer
procurement periods. For total procurement the weighted average of actual
inflation rates was 37% against a 14% price escalation (weighted average)
included in the Project costs at appraisal. Among other factors this
development also contributed to the cost overrun.
3.15      The cumulative disbursement pattern for the Bank loan is
summarized below:

Estimate             36.0    35.2   43.1   94.8   99.6  100.0
The late start of main activities and delays in Project completion resulted
in loan disbursement period longer than the appraisal estimate. The
disbursement schedule for the total Project cost is given in Annex 5.
3.16      The total Project cost of US$478.3 million has been financed with
equity of US$258.8 million (54.1%) provided by PETROBRAS through
PETROFERTIL/ULTRAPERTIL, and borrowings of US$219.5 million of which
US$111.6 million equivalent (23.3Z) from local sources and US$107.9 million
(22.62) from foreign sources. Details of the Project financing plan are
given in Annex 6. The Project cost overrun of US$206.4 million has been
financed by additional equity of US$146.9 million (712) and borrowings of
US$59.5 million (292). The foreign loans, including the Bank loan (10.52),
accounted for 23% of the Project financing against 392 estimated at
appraisal. The reduction is due to (i) the increased share of locally
manufactured equipment, and (ii) the Project



t                                         - 9-
cost overruns (and pre-operating expenses) having been mainly in local
costs. The final debt/equity ratio of 46:54 is more favorable compared to
the ratio of 60:40 stipulated at the time of appraisal.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As men#ioned earlier (para 3.11), the Project facililties were
mechanically completed in January 1982 about 34 months behind appraisal
schedule. The commissioning of the plants was also troublesome and the
commercial level of production was only achieved in March 1983. While the
individual plants were able to reach an average capacity of 75Z, their
on-stream time was extremely short due to various interruptions in the
operation caused by equipment and/or power failures. Annex 7 gives
operating performance of the Project during 1982-84. During 1982, the
ammonia plant operated nine months and produced a total of 67,765 tons of
product corresponding to about 17% of the annual design capacity. Urea
production in eight months of operation in 1982 was 47,565 tons
corresponding to about 10% of the annual design capacity.
B.   Build-up of Production
4.03      In 1983, the ammonia plant operated eleven months and the urea
plant ten uonths and production of amonia reached 224,315 and that of urea
262,955 tons or 57% and 53% of the annual design capacity, respectively.
During 1984 the production of ammonia and urea was 289,055 tons and 370,810
tons, or 73% and 75% of capacity, respectively. The production levels
achieved in 1983-85 and expected thereafter and respective rated capacities
are summarized below.

4.04      At the time of appraisal it was expected that the plant would
begin commercial operations by July 1979 starting at a 50X *apacity
utilization and gradually reaching 90% by 1981. Considering the 45 months
delay in commercial production and taking 1983 when the production
stabilized as the first year of commercial operation, on nutrient basis,
the plant achieved 57% capacity usage in 1983 and, 73% in 1984 and 1985.
ULTRAFERTIL plans to reach 90% capacity usage by 1987; the capacity
utilization during several months of 1984 and 1985 was over 901, clearly

indicating that 90X capacity utilization on a sustained basis is easily
achievable, particularly considering the installation of fourth gasifier
unit. The production performance during the first year of operations
(1983) has been close to the appraiaal estimate of 50%. Notwithstanding
completion delays and commissioning problems, achieving a 90% capacity
level within three # ars is considered an acceptable performance.
C. Marketing Aspects
4.05      Historical development and projections on Brazil's fertilizer
market are discussed in Chapter I (para 1.01). Consumption and production
details and projections are given in Annex 8, and total nitrogenous
fertilizer production installed capacity and historical production are
given in Annex 9. After a three-year (1981-83) depression, the fertilizer
demand in Brazil began to recover in 1984 and the productions plants were
not only able to deplete their high level of inventories but also to
Increase production levels. It is expected that the improving market
conditions will allow the Project to operate at 90% capacity level in
coming years.
4.06      Until 1981, ULTRAFERTIL used to maintain a large and efficient
marketing organization. About 502 of its output was marketed directly to
the farmers through its own retail outlets while the remaining 502 through
blenders and distributors. However, as a result of the sudden drop in
fertilizer demand in 1981 (para 1.02) ULTRAJERTIL decided to close down its
own retail outlets on economic grounds. Currently the Project's total
output is marketed through blenders and distributors. This system gives
ULTRAFERTIL lest control over the marketing of its products.
V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. PricinS Policy
5.01      Since the input and output prices for the fertilizer industry are
set by the Government, the financial performance of the Project greatly
depends upon the Government's pricing policies. Price controls by the
Government started in September 1975 with NPK blends and were extended in
1977 to basic fertilizers and raw materials as well.  These controls
prevailed until December 1980. Periodic adjustments were made on the basis
of changes in production cost. In 1981-82, prices were partially
deregulated with controls remaining only on raw materials. However, in
1983, price regulations were reestablished for the fertilizer sector as a
whole. Under the current system, the ex-factory prices for locally-
produced fertilizers are set quarterly by the Government's Interministerial
Prices Council (GIPC) usirg a cost-plus system that theoretically allows an
efficient producer an 18.81 before tax average return on investment. In
the case of nitrogenous fertilizers, the Government has designated the
natural-gas based Camacari plant in Bahia as the efficient producer whose
profile is used to set the ex-factory prices. This plant, which was built
many years ago at lower capital costs has been substantially depreciated,
as a result the ex-factory prices fixed by GIPC on this basis do not permit
an efficient producer with more recent facilities which have higher asset
value to earn a satisfactory financial rate of return and tend to be below
the international CIF prices (See Table 5.1 below and Annex 12). 8conomic

stabilization program introduced in early 1986 to control inflation and
improve economic environment is also expected to have significant impact on
different sector of the economy (page 18 of Borrower's comments).
Table 5.1 Comparison of Prevailing CI? and Local Prices
(In 1983 constant dollars)
CIF      Local       Difference
($/ton)   ($Iton)    ($/ton)   (%)

Urea (Bulk)      190        151         39       21
This policy, although, in strictly legal sense, may be in compliance with
the understanding reached with the Government during loan negotiations and
recorded in the Guarantee Agreement, it is in violation of the spirit of
the agreement as the intention of the agreement was for the financial
health of the Project and not the company as a whole which owns facilities
other than the Project as well. This issue was raised with the Governient
during the Project Completion Report preparation mission. However, a shift
in the policy is not likely in the immediate future in light of the current
economic situation in Brazil where the Government, in its efforts to con-
trol inflation, is trying to keep the prices under control. With the
installation of the Refinery Off Gas Unit, ULTRAPERTIL Is negotiating with
PETROBRAS the supply of gas and its price. ULTRAPERTIL expects that after
these negotiations are completed, it would be in a better position to com-
ply with Bank's pricing covenant (page 12 of Borrower's coments). The
overall economic stabilization program introduced in early 1986 to control
Inflation and improve economic environment is also expected to have a sig-
nificant impact on different sectors of the economy including ULTRAFERTIL
(page 18 of Borrower's comments).
B. Financial Rate of Return
5.02      The assumptions, production costs and the output prices for
financial and economic analyses are given in Annexes 10, 11 and 12. The
financial rate of return (FRR) for the Project has been calculated under
two different cases as given in Annex 13 and summarized below. In both
cases, actual input prices currently prevailing are taken and are assumed
to remain constant (in dollar terms) during the Project life. All prices
are expressed in 1983 constant dollars terms.
Table 5.2 Financial Rate of Return
FRn
Case I.  Actual output prices as prevailing on January           -1.4X
1, 1985 and to remain constant (in 1983 constant
dollar terms) during Project life.
Case II. Output prices adjusted to international level by          7.7%
1986 and to follow expected international trends
in fertilizer prices (in 1983 constant dollar terms)
during Project life.



- 12 -
5.03      In both cases the Project's FRR at -1.4% and 7.7% is much lower
than the appraisal 4stimate of 22.2% mainly due to (i) the Government's
pricing policy (para 5.01), (ii) excessive completion delays (34 months),
(iiI) long commissioning period (15 months); (iv) substantial cost overruns
(62%, excluding interest during construction); and (v) sharply increased
cost of the heavy fuel oil without corresponding increases in fertilizer
prices.   At appraisal the urea/fuel oil price ratio was 5.2, while in 1983
it was only ;.8 due to the sharp increase in crude prices in 1979. Even
though the feedstock (HSHR) is priced below the international economic
price due to its non-marketability, the price of heavy fuel oil used as
fuel actually charged to the company is significantly higher (about 30%)
than its economic cost. The prices required to obtain a 12X FRR are
calculated to be ammonia -US$340 per ton and urea (bag)-US$330 per ton
which are about 30% higher than the average international prices (CIF)
projected during Project life.2/
C.   Financial Results
5.04      As mentioned earlier, the Project ownership was transferred from
PETROFERTIL to ULTRAFERTIL in March 1981 (para 3.03). Detailed financial
statements for ULTRAFERTIL and the Araucaria Project are presented in
Annex 14. The selected financial data for ULTRAFERTIL as a company and
projected income statement for the Project alone are presented below.

5.05      The Project's financial statements are consolidated, since March
1981, with ULTRAFERTIL financial statements. Despite the adverse effect of
the Project operation, ULTRAFERTIL's financial position remains sound as it
earns adequate profits from its other operations (two other fertilizer
plants at Cubatao and Piacaguera). It meets the agreed loan covenants of
maintaining a long-term debt/equity ratio of 60:40 or better and a current
ratio of not less than 1.2. Because of the large devaluations of the
Cruzeiro, the debt service coverage ratio during 1983 was lower than the
required level of at least 1.5. The situation has however, improved in
1985 and expected thereafter with greater capacity utilization, when the
ratio is expected to be over 2.
VI. ECONOMIC PER0ORMANCE
A.   Economic Rate of Return
6.01      As mentioned earlier, the assumptions, production cost and output
price details are summarized in Annexes 10, 11 and 12. For economic
analysis all tradeable items have been priced based on the projected
international prices allowing for transportation and handling costs. Since
inputs aad products are exempt from taxes and duties no adlustment for
taxes has been made to the prices. The domestic costs have been
shadov-priced by using a factor of 0.83 for Brazll. The economic cost and
benefit streams are given in Annex 15.
6.02      The economic rate of return (ERR) is now estimated at 7.61, lower
than the appraisal estimate of 23.81. The main reasons for the low ERR



- 14 -
are: (i) long delays in Project completion (para 3.11) and; (il) excessive
cost overruns (para 3.13). In addition, higher fuel oil and lover
fertilizer prices have contributed to the low ERR estimates.3/
B. Foreign Exchange Savings
6.03      The average foreign exchange value of the Project's production
with the facilities operating at 90X capacity are estimated to be US$122
4Illion annually (in 1983 constant dollars). The foreign exchange cost of
heavy fuels and maintenance materials is expected to be in the order of
US$28 million. Therefore, the net annual foreign exchange savings for
Brazil (before debt service of the foreign loans) are estimated to be US$94
million (in 1983 constant dollars) compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$103 million (in constant 1983 dollars); in 1975 constant dollars .tis
amount was US$65 million. The annual average debt service on foreign loans
would be around US$17 million.
C. Transfer of Technology
6.04      The Project has been implemented with substantial involvement of
Brazilian institutions. Using know-how and basic design obtained from
process licensors, the detailed engineering was carried out by a Brazilian
engineering company. Several equipment for the Project were also obtained
from Brazilian suppliers. V'ery sophisticated multi-wall high pressure
equipment such as reactors, exchangers, etc., were manulactured for the
first time in Brazil under licence agreements with reputable foreign
firms. The heavy equipment manufacturing industry of Brazil benefitted
immensely by obtaining the technology and know-how to supply equipment and
machinery to the Project. The Araucaria staff as well as the engineers of
the local firms involved with the Project, also benefited from the
technology transferred to them. However, as explained earlier (para
3.09-3.13) such technology transfers have been achieved at a substantial
cost to the Project.
D.   Environmental Aspects
6.05      The Project facilities have been constructed in conformity with
environmntal regulation norms agreed to during Project appraisal. The
measures taken have ensured that the required standards set by
Government's Secretariat of the Environment (SEMA) and by the
Superintendency of Water Resources and Environment (SUREHMA) are met during
plant operation except for the cyanhydric acid content in the effluent
water. To overcome this problem, an additional disposal lagoon, to store
waste water, was provided. The accumulated water is gradually treated
before its rejection to final disposal. Although burning high sulfur fuel
oil, gas emissions from the stacks remain within the accepted pollution
limits in the area. The process gases exhausted by flare require special
attention as these emmissions may be considered excessive although within
legal limits. ULTRAFERTIL has set up a working group of technicians from
SUREHMA and ULTRAPERTIL to further study various environmental issues and
3/ Borrower has estimated ERR to be between 6.31 and 7.1% using somewhat
different assumptions (page 16 of Borrower's comments).



- 15 -
plans to take necessary action based on its recommendations to further
im.prove environmental quality of the plant (page 9 of Borrower's comments).
VII, BANK ROLE
7.01      During various phases of the Project, the Bank worked closely
with PETROBRAS, PETROFERTIL and ULTRAFERTIL. During Project appraidal and
the early stages of Project implementation, the Bank participated in
formulating and implementing Project financing arrangements especially for
meeting the foreign exchange requirements. The Bank also provided
consultant services to organize the procurement activities and advised on
the development of the Project organization. At various stages, although
the Bank advised the Project authorities against expanding the reserve
list, the Bank was unsuccessful in avoiding major changes which have
resulted in long completion delays and excessive cost overruns.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The Project gives the impression of a poorly executed project
with extensive delays and major cost overruns. The original 42 months
completion time was estimated under certain premises and understandings.
During the initial phase of Project implementation , many of the
understandings were changed. The most significant one was the CACEX4/
Agreement which was the result of negotiations between the Associations of
Local Manufacturers, the Project sponsor and CACEX. The Agreement stated
the estimated ex-factory value of the equipment reserved for local
procurement and also provided a list of the equipment, with estimated FOB
values, to be imported or purchased through ICB. Under this Agreement
about 65% (in terms of value) of the equipment was reserved for local
procurewent, compared to the appraisal estimate of 50X. This alteration
brought about three major changes in the Project:(i) an increase in capital
cost due to th'e higher cost of locally manufactured equipment; (ii)
excessive completion delays; and (iii) change in the financing plan. The
Bank expressed its concern on these changes as early as October 1976, but
was unsuccessful in stopping them. The increase in the local manufactur-
ers' involvement, especially in the areas of highly sophisticated equipment
and machinery, have yielded benefits to the country through the transfer of
technology, but the cost of 'learning' has been taigh and had to be paid by
the Project alone. The Project management should have been more forceful
in resisting these changes.
8.02      The financial and economic performance of the Project is also
less than satisfactory and does not coincide with the appraisal estimates,
mainly because of: (i) excessive cost overruns; and (ii) long completion
delays. In addit'on, under the prevailing international market conditions
fuel-oil based fertilizer plants are less attractive economically as they
have to compete with the more efficient gas-based plants given today's
4/   CACEX is the import licensing agency of the Government.



- 16 -
energy price structure. The Government's pricing policy which is based on
a cost-plus formula for a designated efficient producer, is another major
factor for the poor financial performance of the Project. ULTRAFERTIL has
been, however, able to comply with most of the financial covenants and
expects to do better in the future.
8.03      Overall, the Project has achieved its objective of producing
fertilizers by utilizing a less attractive feedstock (high sulfur heavy
residue) but this has been done at a high cost. The major lesson learned
from the Project Is that managerial and orgkanizational weaknesses can cause
serious problem in Project implementation. A strong and dynamic Project
management under a Project unit concept with adequate autonomy and
authority can better deal with the implementation problems and withstand
undue domestic influences. Transfer of technology has been done but the
costs have been high. In hindsight, the Bank should also have been more
forceful in resisting undesirable changes (e.g. expansion of reserve list)
as it had legal remedies at its hand. More attention should have been paid
to the mnagerial and organizational issues.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANLAYSIS
1.  It is assumed that ammonia and bulk urea prices will retain 1:1
relation at international market.
2.  For bagging US$15 is added to bulk urea prices.
3.  High Sulfur Heavy Residue (HSHR) economic price is derived on the
basis that about 0.3 tons of vacuum gas oil (VGO) at US$220 per ton
cost would be blended Into 0.7 eons of 1HSH to produce a high sulfur
heavy fuel oil. US$5 per ton is deducted from international fuel oil
prices to compensate for 'igh sulfur.
4. For shadow pricing, local components of capital cost and other inputs
and services are adjusted by using standard conversion factor of 0.83
for Brazil.
5.  International methanol prices are estimated as a fraction of gasoline
price by using factors given in the World Bank Report entitled
"Emerging Energy and Chemical Applications of Methanol" April 1982.
6.  Crude oil/Fuel oil prices and price relations are taken from the
World Bank Report entitled "World Refinery Industry", December 1984.
7.   Sulfur prices are taken from the World Bank Report entitled 'World
Sulfur Survey", July 1984.
8.   Utility prices and other local costs are converted to 1983 constant
dollars and assumed to remain constant in dollar terms.
9.   For financial rate of return, actual input prices are taken and
assumed to remain constant (in 1983 constant dollar terms) for the
life of the Project. For output prices two cases have been
analyzed. Under Case I, actual output prices as of January 1, 1985
are taken and assumed to remain constant (in 1953 constant dollar
terms) during the Project life. Under Case II, output prices are
adjusted to international level by 1986, and thereafter assumed to
follow expected international trends for fertilizer prices (in
constant 1983 dollar terms).
10. All prices are expressed in 1983 constant US dollars terms.

OUTWARD CIRCLES HOWEVER HAVE SUFFERED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE
ALTERATIONS CREATED BY NEW BRAZILIAN MONEtARY PACKAGE OF
FEBRUARY 28. 1986 (LAW 2283) WHICH CAUSED THE DESINDEXATION OF
OUR ECONOMY AND WHICH CONSTITUTED BY ITSELF IN A DECISIVE STEP TO
REMOVE ALL STRUCTURAL BARR IERS SET UP AGAINST INFLATION RATE
REDUCTION IN OUR COUNTRY.
PRICES WERE FROZEN, CONTRACTS SUPPORTING CLQUSES WITH LESS-ThAN-

The external environment, however, has suffered substantial chanses,
- The monetary reform dated Februari 28 (decree-law n. 2283)
disindexed the econom.s and this was an important step to remove
structural obstacles which Prevented the inflation rate to
decrease in the countri.
- The frozen Price, the Prohibition of contracts with indexation
clauses with terms inferior to one wear (except savins accounts.
PIS-PASEP and FGTS), the s.nchronization of salari readJustments

Provide the Government an immediate maneuver marsin in the
important areas of the stabilization Policu. specially the
reversion of the inflationaru expectations.
- Decrease of the international oil Prices.
- Increase of the international Sulphur Prices.
- World-wide economi  reorsanization.
Due to these new facts, several orientative Parameters of the

BRAZIL ARAUcARAI FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(LOAN i256-BR)
At the time the ProJect Completion Report was Prepared, Ultrafertil
was consolidating the Project itselfr Prosrammins operation from
i985 onwards at a Production capacits of 90X.
In order to definitelM implement the aimed capacitM, a decision was
taken to introduce the 4th. sasifier/coal reduction proJect still in
1984. with its conclusion forecast to the end of 1986.
The Installation of the 4th. sasifier assemblv at the ammonia unit
aims to suarantee the Production capacitu contemplated in the
orisinal ProJett of Araucaria Industrial complex. With this
installation, the maintenance of the nominal load of the complex
(IGOX) would become feasible and the other sasifier assemblies
would be Periodicallu realeased for maintenance.
The Production capacitw of the new sasifier assembly is identical
to that of the other sasifiers, which will not oriuinate an
increase in the current Production capacity Installed. due to
its stand-be nature.
The installation of the coal reduction system Is motivated by the
fact that in the crude sas Production taken Place in the sasifiers,
we have non-reacted carbon as reaction subproduct. When one of the
sasifiers stops, its Pressure Is initially released to the flare
system and, after reachins the 5 bar level inside the equipmentr
direct to the atmosphere.
However rare, this operation carries out the carbon residue which
is still in the swstem, to the atmosphere. This fact determined
the installation of the new system in order to avoid Possible
contamination, Protectins the environment.
From the abover we come to the conclusion that   the Installation
of the 4th sasifier/coal reduction ProJect will not senerate
increments in the current consumptions, nor will it demand actions
concernins the current orsanizational structure adequacy of the
industrial complex, either operational or administrative.

Equipments nationalization Index is around 80%.
An analisis of enersetic improvement of Arauciria Industrial
Complex with direct impacts in the reduction of manufactured
Product costs, induced Ultrafertil to search for alternative
sources such as fuel for steam Production. Studies carried out In
order to meet "Petr6leo Brasileiro S.A." - Petrobris's Policies
intesrate the Companu In  the "Fundo do Barrill"  rosram
(improvement of lishter oil fractions Prosram) and Propose
to increase the burnins of these residues In the refineriesvaimins
to reduce the use of lisht ba-products, necessary to dilute the
heuve residues to be commercialized as fuel oil.
In Practical terms, two steps were technicallM taken for this new
ProJect (Refinaru off sas) with the substitution of the Hish
Sulphur Heavi Fuel Oil (HSHFO), Part of it bw residual sas from the
adJacent "Refinaria Presidente Getulio Varsas - REPAR" and Part of
it by Hish Sulphur Heavy Residue (HSHR).
Due to the fact that Ultrafertil Araucaria's boiler was not desisned
to operate with such feedstock the use of HSHR would mean efficiency
los1 due to residues incrustation in boiler tubes reducins thermal
exchanse and makino it more difficult for the combustion air to flow.
Therefore. in order to attend the Improvement Prosram of lishter
oil fractiVns,the most econL,I.;ical solution would be to burn the
asphaltic residue in REPAR's furnaces and release the refinarw
off sas to Ultrafertil.
In order to install this project, Ultrafertil has made adaptations
in the boiler burnins sustem besides the construction of the sas
Pipeline.

(LOAN 1256-BR)
At the time of the installation of Araucarla Fertilizer Plant
Project, Petrobras has handed over to the Superintendencia dos Re-
cursos Hidricos e Meio Ambiente - SUREHMA the ProJects for emission
control based on the best existins technolosm under International
standards, beino, some of them, really Pionner In the world and
restricted to onle a few Plants up to that date.
The basic desisn of the environment control s,stem contemplated a
foremost method, bearins in itself the best known environmental
standards.
With the Purpose of discussing Problems Pertainins to environmental
conditions, it was created, in Maw £985, a Work Group composed of
technicians from Ultrafertil and SUREHMA.
Upon the second meetins of such Work Group, held in July £0. 1985,
the followins decisions have been reached with that Superintendenci
(SUREHMA):
i. Specification of the Coolins Tower Blowdown of Ultrafertil's
Araucaria Plant, aiming at the consideration of the Possibilitv
of direct disczarse to the river;
2. Evalution of the ammonia contents in the Barisui River, with the
Purpose of revisins the Paremeters of discharse from Ultrafertil;
3. Specification of the demineralization water flush. Such flow has
been carried out towards thcr Waste Water Treatment Station - ETDI
throush an alteration in the Pipelines, makins it unnecessary
its evaluation.
4. Ammonia Reduction S,stem. Once It had been confirmed a
deficiencj in the s.stem as anticipated in the ProJect, Ultrafer-
til has sone throush a research schedule in order to obtain
assistance to Put the final sustem into action.
5. Cyanide Reduction System. With the Purpose of evaluatins the
best Possible technolosH available runnins in Parallel with
the acclimatization research of the biological culture at the
ETDI, various tests on cianide chemical oxidation have been
Performed in the Pilot units.

de Pesquisas Tecnol6sicas de Sgo Paulo - IPT (Institute of
Technolosical Research of Sao Paulo)r which Performed a survey
in the various stacks. as Indicated bi SUREHMA.
7. Research on the acclimatization of the biolosical culture, with
the Purpose of adaptins the microbiolosical culture of ETOD to
the Presence of csanides and methanol, as well as improve the
operation of said Station.  Ultrafertil has re4uired from SUREHMA
to worc out the correspondins research Plan. Such Plan was the
obJect of a meetins amonsst technicians from the two concerns,
which was held on January i3w with an asreement between the
Parties beins Presentli under wau.
8. System for treatment of the Holdins Lasoon of the Carbon
Recoveru Unit. With the Purpose of reabsorbins the waste waters
of the industrial units in the Carbon Recoverw Unit,
eliminatins its direct discharse to the river, a ProJect
has been worked out amonust technicians from SUREHMA and
Ultrafertil, based on an exchanse of information, after their
havins reached an asreement as to Its necessits.
SUREHMA has granted license n.0245 for erection-of the Plant on
December 16, £980, and License for Operation has been required on
Miarch 5, 1982 and JulY 21t 1982, still durins the Pre-operatlon
work of the Complex. License for Operation n. 065/86 has been
granted on Februarn 3, 1986, after the mentioned Procedures have
been carried out.

A. PRICE POLICY
The factors input and output Prices for fertilizer industry are
of the resPonsibiliti and control of sovernment departments.
With the installation of the Refinerw Off Gas ProJect, discussions
are beins held with Petrobras towards the negotiation concernins
the suppli  of 220 t/daw of sas and the determination of its
Price. Such nesotiation rises in significance Proportion as
the settlement of the Price to the level of USS 28.29 (June
1986) and USS 26.08 (in constant 1984 US uollar terms) would
allow in a certain manner to restore the costs to the time of
the conception of the AraucAria ProJect, and to Partialli
satisfw the clause 3.03 of the Guarantee Agreement, Section
3.93.
B. FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
Investments for ProJects of the 4th. Gasifier/Carbon Reduction
and Refiners Off Gas amount to respectiveli  USS 9.2 million and
USS 0.5 million (in constant 1984 US dollar terms).
The assumptions, capital costs, Production costs and output
Prices for financial and economic analysis Purposes are shown in
annexes I to 4. The proJect's financial rate of return (FRR),
considerins the exclusive application of oil as raw material
and the reachins of Production capacity to 9O% from £987 onwards,
has been estimated under two circumstances as Per shown in Annexes
5 and condensed below. In both cases It is taken into
consideration the real Prices for raw saterial and it is assumed
that thew should remain constant (in terms of dollars) durins
ProJect life (until 1996). All the fisures are beins expressed
in constant US dollar terms as of 1984.

A. As mentioned before.the assumptions,capital costs, Production cos
and output Prices are summarized in Annexes i to :. For economica
analusis, all tradeable items have been Priced on projected inter
national Prices allowing handling and transportation costs.
In view of the fact that Inputs and Products are exempt from taxe
and duties. no adjustment for taxes has been made to the Prices.
For domestic costs in terms of shadow Price . we have used the
conversion factor 0.83. The economic cost and benefits streams
are shown in Annexes 6.
B. For the simulation usins refinerm off sas and Installation of 4th

of February 1985. we have tried to show and search for
endosenous and exosenous factors that have interfaces
with Araucaria ProJect, as well as to effect the up-
datins occurred between that date and June i986.
As resards to the content of topic 81 (Alternative Hypothesis
for Financial Rate of Return) from the chapter "Financial
Aspects", in case the Postulations of feedstocks Prices
in that alternative be materialized, the Financial Rate of
Return soes from a deficient situation to a Positive steP of
return on investments.
Brazilian agriculture, besides Producins exchanse values bv
means of exports, enersetic sources throush biomass, leads
Production of food in volume and Price adequate to Brazilian
reality. Derivins from ProJect installation, we could Point out
Improvements in fertilizer supply to agriculture, net economy of
exchanse values and development of Jobs.
From an economic Point of view, as well as social, Araucaria
ProJect brousht up qualitative improvements, as technolosY
transferr whichy as a multiplyins factor, Produced seneration
of soods and services, Pioneer in the domestic economy
and of renown International qualltg. Althoush non mensurable
in economic and financial analisls, these improvements lead
to the development of the country. The benefits, difficult
to quantify, are beins absorbed bg the Project, as an exPres-
sive burden.
Economical Stabilization Prosram introduced bw Decree-Law 2283
brousht about Perspectives of a better foresisht for Plannins
Process, due to the elimination of Inert inflation.
In the international market, where reorsanization of world's
economy is takins Place, with the increase of sulphur Price
and the fall in Price of oil, a realignment of financial and
economic rates of return can be noticed.

1. It  is assumed  that ammonia  and bulk  *urea prices  will
retain iti relation at international market.
2. For bagsins USS 15 is added to blilk urea prices.
3. For shadow pricing, local components of capital cost and
other inptits and services are adjulstea by utsing standard
conversion factor of 0.83 for Brazil.
4. Crude  oil/Fuel oil priLes are taken from Platt 's OlIgram
Price Service, March i986.
S.- Ammonia,  Urea and Sulfuir prices are taken from the Green
Markets, May 1.9, 1986.
6. Methanol  prices following  the  same  trend  as  on  the
completion report.
7. Utilit!s prices and  other local  costs are  converted to
£984 constant  dollars and  assumed to remain constant in
dollars terms.
8. For  financial rate  of return,  actual input  prices are
taken and  assumed to  remain constant  (in 1984 constant
dollar terms)  for the  life of  the Project.  For Output
prices two cases have been analssed. Under Case I, actual
output prices   as of Juine, 1986 are taken and assumed to
remain constant  (in £984  constant dollar  terms) during
the Project  life.  Under  Case  II.  output  prices  are
adjusted to international level bs i987, and thereafter
assumed  to  follow   expected  international  trends  for
fertilizer prices (in constant i984 dollar terms).
9. All  prices are  expressed in  i984  constant  US  dollar
terms.

3.04    The  Project's manpower  requirement at  the time of
appraisal was  estimated aLs  400 jobs  in product ion  and an
additional 400  in the  subsequent distribution  network. At
present, the ProJect *emplous 713 persons consisting of
administrative -  142, production  - 293. maintenance - 187,
techinical -  67, and  others 24.  The present operation and
maintenance manpower  level Is substantiails hisher than the
appraisal estimate,  mainlI  due  to the  complexities of the
plant and  operating difficulties.  The present manpower is,
however, not considered excessive.
