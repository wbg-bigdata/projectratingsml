                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The GEF project was declared effective on December 27, 2007 and has then faced major difficulties during the first years of implementation. During the Mid-term review (MTR)
                         mission of this project (May 2010), it was jointly agreed by the Government of Gabon and the Bank that this project needed a thorough restructuring. During the nine months following

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                       Report No: ISR6245



                         the MTR, the project team and the Bank team have closely worked together and the Project is now back to a "Satisfactory" status (for the last 18 months). The following points can be
                         highlighted:

                         (i) The ANPN capacity to implement the project has been significantly improved: all various units within ANPN (both at central and Park levels) are fully aware and committed to the

                         implementation of the project activities. The ANPN management has indicated that the GEF project has been instrumental in defining the roles and operational modalities of the
                         ANPN (cf. the Agency was just created when the Project got effective) as well as in setting up key systems in the functioning of the agency (Fiduciary management, HR management,
                         Monitoring and Evaluation system). Many features developed under the project for the three targeted National Parks are now applied to the entire Park Network (comprising 13
                         National Parks).

                         (ii) The 2-year action plan agreed upon as part of the project restructuring is implemented in a satisfactory manner. Activities are implemented according to a 2-year Action Plan
                         adopted during the restructuring process. Progress towards the objectives of the project is deemed satisfactory, inter alia (for a more comprehensive view of progress, see Results
                         Framework): the ANPN has now set up robust systems to Financial management (FM), Human resources (HR); a Communication plan has been prepared and is now rolled out; the
                         biological inventories in Evaro/Wonga-Wongue have been completed and data are now compiled to be included in a Biodiversity database; the management plan for the three
                         targeted parks is under preparation (through a consultative process) and will be finalized by August 2013; monitoring capacities in and outside the National Parks have been
                         significantly increased. The partnership with international and national NGOs to support project activities is seen as very positive and the ANPN is discussing a 6-month extension of
                         their contract.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the last SPN mission in May 2012, the main priorities were to discuss with the team the following aspects:
                         (i) revision of the Budget (and accordingly procurement plan): the objective was to ensure that the remaining resources (about US$1.76 million cf. not paid, not committed) will be
                         used in the most efficient manner to achieve the development objective of the project: priorities were jointly defined and arbitrage was made on the the proposals from the various
                         NGOs. One extension of the contracts with NGOs are signed (by the end of June), the level of commitment will be of 90 percent.
                         (ii) sustainability after the project closure. The ANPN management has indicated that the experts recruited under the project will be financed by national resources in 2013 (inscription
                         to the National Budget 2013) to ensure a smooth transition after the closing date of the project (June 30th, 2013) -same will be done for the operating costs for the 3 targeted National
                         Parks-. This is seen as a very positive signal and will certainly largely contribute to the sustainability of the project achievements after project closure.
