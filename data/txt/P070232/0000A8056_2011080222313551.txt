                         disbursement rate has significantly improved (51 per cent) and commitment amounts to about 75 per cent, (iii) results framework is in place and operational and (iv) safeguards
                         capacities have been reinforced both within the governmental entities and NGOs providing support to the National Parks.

                         accordingly been revised. The four Components of the Projects are now:

                         Component 2. Enhanced knowledge on critical natural habitats for the expansion of the Network of the National Parks
