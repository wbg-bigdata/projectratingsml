                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The GEF project was declared effective on December 27, 2007 and has then faced major difficulties during the first years of implementation. During the Mid-term review (MTR)
                         mission of this project (May 2010), it was jointly agreed by the Government of Gabon and the Bank that this project needed a thorough restructuring. The period following the MTR
                         allowed the ANPN and WB teams to closely work together and complete the restructuring the project in May 2011. Since then the project has been rated "Satisfactory". The following
                         points can be highlighted:
                         (i) The Project has been instrumental to build ANPN capacities: The Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux (ANPN) was created by the Law on National Parks, adopted on August
                         27, 2007 (6 months prior the effectiveness of the GEF project). One of the objective of the GEF project was to build capacities of the newly created agency. After five years of
                         implementation (and despite difficulties at the beginning), the GEF project helped define roles and operational modalities of the ANPN as well as also largely contributed to the set up
                         of key systems in the functioning of the agency (Fiduciary management, HR management, Monitoring and Evaluation system). Many features developed under the project for the
                         three targeted National Parks are now applied to the entire Park Network (comprising 13 National Parks). The partnership with international NGOs has been significantly adjusted
                         over the past few years to better take into account the leadership of the ANPN on all issues related to National Parks in Gabon. New partnerships have been deployed with local
                         NGOs.
                         (ii) Since its restructuring, the project has been implemented in a satisfactory manner.

                         (iii) Based on the revised Results Framework, most of the indicators are either already fulfilled or making good progress for a completion by the end of the project (in June 2013).
                         In terms of sustainability after project closure, the ANPN has confirmed that the experts recruited under the project will be financed by national resources starting March 2013 to
                         ensure a smooth transition after the closing date of the project (June 30th, 2013) -same will be done for the operating costs for the 3 targeted National Parks and the Brigades
