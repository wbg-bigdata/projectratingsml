CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
Since August 13, 1979, the Bangladesh Taka (Tk) has been pegged to
a basket of currencies of major trading partners, with the Pound Sterling as
intervention currency; consequently the Taka-Dollar rate is subject to change.
In the twelve month period, July 1979 through June 1980, this rate fluctuated
b1-_tween Tk 14.61 and 16.27 per US dollar. On October 13, 1980, the Taka was
officially revalued at Tk 38.45 5o the Pound Sterling (equivalent to Tk 16
per US dollar). Also at that time, the Government narrowed the margin within
which the exchange rate in terms of the Pound Sterling will be maintained,
from 3.5% to 1% on either side. On October 27, 1980, the exchange rate was
again adjusted, to Tk 38.92 per Pound Sterling. The rate below has been used
throughout this report except where otherwise stated.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL II PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Floods and drainage problems affect two-thirds of Bangladesh's
cultivable area. Flood protection is, therefore, a major national objec-
tive and the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has sought IDA technical and
financial assistance for drainage and flood control projects being carried
out by the Water Development Board (WDB). The first Drainage and Flood
Control Project (Credit 864-BD, December 22, 1978) and the Small Scale
Drainage and Flood Control Project (Credit 955-BD October 30, 1979) are
being implemented.
1.02      The proposed project was prepared by WDB, assisted by a con-
sultant (NEDECO, Netherlands) financed under the IDA Technical Assistance
Credit 622-BD. In June/July 1980, a mission consisting of Messrs.
D. W. Jeffries, H. J. Tennent and P. M. Tamboli (IDA) appraised two sub-
projects, one of which, subsequently modified, is included in the
proposed project. In February 1981, a mission consisting of Messrs.
D. W. Jeffries, H. J. Tennent and M. Maasland (Consultant) reappraised
the above mentioned subproject and two other subprojects which had been
prepared later and which are now included in the proposed project. A
mission consisting of Messrs. L. Vidaeus, Y. Tang and L. Sprague (IDA),
in April 1981, appraised the proposed fisheries component of the project
in conjunction with other operational activities in Bangladesh.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      With a population of about 92 million and a cultivable area of
only 22.5 M ac, Bangladesh presents a complex development problem. The
population is poor (per capita income is about US$100), overcrowded (1,550
per sq mile and growing at 2.8% per year), in many cases unemployed (per-
haps 25-30%) and largely illiterate (about 75%). Foodgrain imports of
about 1.5 M tons, or nearly 15% of total requirements, are needed in the
"normal" year to maintain minimum per capita consumption levels. Apart
from agriculture, the country has few natural resources and GOB gives
priority to agricultural development as the means to benefit the largest
number of people.
2.02      To attain self-sufficiency in foodgrains is the major objective
of GOB's Second Five Year Plan (1980/81 - 1984/85) with a production



-2-
target of 20 M tons by the end of the period. IDA has assisted GOB in
drawing up the Medium-Term Foodgrain Production Plan which indicates
development activities needed to attain the production targets and
emphasizes quick-yielding, low-cost and labor-intensive projects. The
proposed project is part of that plan and has such characteristics.
The Agriculture Sector
2.03      Agriculture accounts for 57% of Bangladesh's GDP, 75% of all
employment and, directly or indirectly, over 80% of its exports. Rice is
by far the most important crop and accounts for over 80% of the cultivated
area; jute, the principal export and industrial raw material crop, for 6%
and a variety of other crops such as wheat, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane
and vegetables for the balance. In recent years, however, wheat acreage
has expanded dramatically, from 0.3 M in FY75 to about 1.5 M in FY81, with
production reaching 1.2 M tons. The dominance of rice is due to the flat
topography of the country, heavy monsoon rains and river flooding which
saturate most soils during the six months rainy season, a condition well
suited for rice cultivation and tolerated by some jute varieties, but
unsuitable for most other crops. The cropping intensity has averaged
about 147% in recent years. During the monsoon (May to October), the
rivers rise causing extensive flood damage and during the long dry season
(November to April), the rivers are low and severe drought conditions
often prevail. Agricultural productivity is low, reflecting low use of
modern inputs, lack of irrigation facilities and use of traditional farm-
ing methods and practices which emphasize risk avoidance. The average
paddy yield of about 0.5 ton per ac is barely half of the average for Asia
as a whole.
2.04      Over 80% of all rural households in Bangladesh own less than
three acres; the land ownership distribution is highly skewed. Four
percent of households own 32% of the land, while 45% of households own 8%
of the land. Fifty-four percent of the rural population is virtually
landless, owning less than half an acre. The proportion of rural landless
is growing rapidly.
Production Trends
2.05      Despite large areas of fertile deltaic soils, temperatures
suitable for year-round cropping, an abundance of good quality groundwater
for dry season irrigation and abundant labor, Bangladesh has been a food
deficit area for more than 20 years. During the 1960s, agricultural
output rose at an average annual rate of 2.5% and foodgrain at about 2.4%;
however, both lagged behind a population growth of 2.8% per year. Food-
grain imports, while down from the peak 2.8 M tons following the combined
disruption of the war of liberation and bad drought in 1972/73, have still
averaged 1.3 tons over the last five years. Production has fluctuated
with weather conditions, but peaks have been rising, from 11.3 M tons



-3-
in 1969/70 to 12.6 M tons in 1975/76, and to 13.1 M tons in 1977/78.
In 1980/81, foodgrain production reached a record of nearly 15 M tons.
2.06      GOB policy of emphasizing use of inputs such as seeds, fer-
tilizers, pesticides and irrigation and of supporting research and exten-
sion is beginning to pay dividends. Latest high-yielding varieties of
rice and wheat released by research stations are finding increasing
acceptance by farmers. Progress in promoting improved farming during the
last decade has been encouraging and includes an increase of almost one
million acres under modern irrigation methods, growth in fertilizer con-
sumption from about 300,000 tons per annum to almost one million tons
(mainly during the last five years) and spread of rice and wheat HYV from
less than one million acres to about 3.5 M acres.
2.07      There have also been disappointments, in particular the rela-
tively modest increase in production from rainfed rice (about 85% of the
paddy area and 75% of production) and, until quite recently, the slower
than anticipated development of irrigation. Government's recognition of
the priority of increasing agricultural production to achieve the goal of
foodgrain self-sufficiency by the mid-1980s is shown by various recent
measures to step up agricultural growth and rationalize food policies:
the formulation of the detailed Medium-Term Foodgrain Production Plan,
increased budgetary allocations to agricultural development, increased
recognition of the private sector's role in provision of inputs, provision
of more effective price support policies and strengthened agricultural
planning. These factors make it possible to foresee a more rapid growth
in agriculture.
IDA Operations in the Agricultural Sector
2.08      Consistent with Government policies, the focus of IDA assistance
to Bangladesh in recent years has been on agriculture. In addition to
assisting in the preparation of the Medium-Term Foodgrain Production Plan,
IDA is involved in a major program of financing agricultural and rural
development (including two fertilizer import credits, 19 of the 53 new
credits approved since independence). Eight projects involve irrigation
and the others the development of agricultural extension services,
agricultural research, jute cultivation, the seeds industry, inland
fisheries, grain storage, agricultural credit, area-based rural develop-
ment and drainage and flood control. Drainage and flood control have been
the main or an important part of several projects: the Chandpur II
Irrigation Project (Credit 340-BD, 1972, US$13.0 M) to provide flood
protection for about 140,000 ac as well as irrigation for about 75,000 ac;
the Karnafuli Irrigation Project (Credit 605-BD, 1976, US$21.0 M) to
provide irrigation, flood control and drainage to 46,000 ac; the Drainage
and Flood Control Project (Credit 864-BD, 1978, US$19.0 M) to provide
flood control and improved drainage to 46,000 ac and 42,000 ac in two
subproject areas and to rehabilitate and improve the embankment which
protects about 180,000 ac against flooding from the Brahamaputra River;



-4-
the Small Scale Drainage and Flood Control Project (Credit 955-BD, 1979,
US$25.0 M) to improve flood protection, drainage and irrigation affecting
about 350,000 ac.
2.09      Project implementation has involved substantial delays in the
past due to difficulties in hiring consultants, appointment of project
staff, timely release of budgetary allocation, approval of contracts,
procurement problems and coordination among various implementing agencies.
The Government has taken or is taking steps to remedy the most serious
bottlenecks and both IDA and Government have given increased attention
to monitoring and supervision. Already these measures have resulted in
noticeable improvements in implementation.
2.10      For many years, IDA has been assisting GOB to improve its water
sector planning. As early as the Land and Water Resources Sector Study
(Report No. PS-13, December 1, 1972), the Bank advocated that Bangladesh
focus its investments in the irrigation, drainage and flood control sector
on activities with an earlier impact on foodgrain production rather than
on the long-gestation, major flood control and drainage projects that had
dominated its program. WDB's program was based on the 1964 Master Plan
prepared by IECO (Consultants, USA) for developing water resources which
emphasized the protection and drainage of deeply flooded areas even though
two-thirds of the cultivable land is either flood-free or would require
flood protection for flood depths of less than three feet. Rates of
return are inversely related to the per acre capital investment cost,
which is largely a function of depth of flooding. Furthermore, since the
financial requirements of such large projects far exceeded available
funding, implementation was slow and rates of return low. Thus, there
appeared to be considerable opportunity to redirect WDB's portfolio to low
capital investment per acre schemes in the shallower or nonflooded areas.
The Bank's Hardcore Program Report of February 1973 recommended criteria
for selection of such irrigation and flood control projects: that they
should contribute to rapid increase in food production, be self-contained
or part of a phased plan, be economically viable and incorporate
labor-intensive methods. Among the general criteria agreed between IDA
and GOB are that total irrigation investment per net arable acre should
not exceed US$250 and that the total drainage and flood control investment
per net arable acre should not exceed US$200, including cost of land
acquisition, both in 1980 prices. The projects appraised in this report
would be consistent with these criteria. In 1976, the Special Project
Preparation Cell of WDB, later renamed Directorate of Planning (Schemes),
DP(S), was set up to prepare such projects, limited to minor flood embank-
ment and drainage improvement works. The Bank assisted this new cell by
financing consultants (NEDECO) under the first Technical Assistance Credit
to help DP(S) revise a number of feasibility reports which had earlier
been prepared on various projects.

2.11      At GOB's request, the Bank undertook a joint review with GOB
of WDB's operations, its investment program and management. The joint
report, issued April 2, 1979 (Report No. 2327-BD), recommended further
technical assistance being extended to improve WDB'S planning and
implementation capabilities. This is now being carried out with the help
of UNDP-financed consultants under a program for which the Bank is the
Executing Agency (para 5.03).
III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
3.01      The proposed project consists of three separate subprojects:
Chalan Beel (CB), Satla Bagda (SB) and Hail Haor (HH).
3.02      Chalan Beel is in Rajshahi District, about six miles north of
Rajshahi, in the northwestern region of Bangladesh. The project area is
within five thanas: Manda, Mohanpur, Bagmara, Tanore and Paba. It covers
about 131,000 ac and is enclosed by the Atrai, Fakirni, Sib and Baranai
rivers. The area is a relatively flat plain with many low-lying basins
(beels), separated by patches of higher land, mostly levees of existing or
old river courses. From about June to October, a large part of the area
is flooded to depths of one to up to ten feet due to high river levels and
accumulated rainfall. The many beels in the northwestern part of the area
retain water after the flood waters have subsided, as much as one to four
feet at the normal time of planting a boro crop. The many natural chan-
nels are dry in the period from December to May or June and the surround-
ing rivers, except the Atrai, also stop flowing (Map 15269).
3.03      Satla Bagda is in the extreme southwestern part of Faridpur
District and the northwestern part of Barisal District, about 17 miles
northwest of Barisal, in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. The proj-
ect area is in six thanas: Kotwalipara and Tungipara in Faridpur District
and Gournadi, Uzirpur, Nazirpur and Banaripara in Barisal District. The
area, about 72,200 ac, is a small part of a large delta formed by the
three major rivers (the Ganges, the Jamuna and the Meghna) and their
branches. The lands within the area are basically flat, with the Satla
and Bagda beels occupying a large part of the total. Much of the area is
subject to daily tidal flooding of backed up non-saline water throughout
the year. Flood irrigation is practiced on those lands that are within
reach of spring floods, when the tidal difference amounts to about two
feet. During the monsoon season, the entire project area, except for the
raised lands used mainly for homesteads, is subject to moderate to deep
flooding of two to eight feet (Map 15654).



-6-
3.04      Hail Haor is in the southern part of Sylhet District, nine miles
southwest of Maulvi Bazar, in the northeastern region of Bangladesh. It
covers parts of two thanas: Maulvi Bazar and Srimangal. The project area,
about 60,200 ac, contains a permanent water body (the haor) of 6,000 to
20,000 ac depending on the season, and is bounded by hills in the east,
south and west. The lands to the north are fairly flat, containing
numerous small beels and extend for about 13 miles to the Kushiyara River.
The haor is fed by the Lungla River and many seasonal streams (charas) and
is drained by the Gopla River. During the rainy season, the Lungla and
many charas from the surrounding hills cause a large inflow into the area,
which together with the heavy accumulated rainfall and the overflow from
the Kushiyara River causes flooding of most of the area. The higher parts
of the area are naturally well drained; however, drainage of the central
part is restricted and determined by the level of the drainage outlet, the
Gopla River (Map 15653).
Climate
3.05    The climate in all three subproject areas can be divided into
three distinct seasons, from an agricultural viewpoint. A cool and rela-
tively dry season (Rabi or Boro season) extends from the beginning of
November up to the beginning of April. The early rainy season (first
Kharif or Aus season) extends from April up to June/July and is wet and
hot.  The late rainy season (second Kharif or Aman season) extends from
June/July up to the beginning of November and is wet and warm. The
climate allows for the cultivation of tropical crops in the Kharif season
and temperate crops in the Rabi season. In the early as well as the late
rainy seasons, one rainfed rice crop can be grown. Cultivation of a Boro
paddy crop requires supplementary irrigation. Rainfall is heavy, but
varies considerably among the three subproject areas. Average rainfall in
Chalan Beel is among the lowest in Bangladesh, about 55 inches, with 90%
falling from June through October. Satla Bagda has mean annual rainfall
of about 80 inches, with 89% occuring in May through October. Hail Haor
is in one of the areas of highest rainfall in Bangladesh, with about 98
inches annually, 94% of the total falling in the seven months (April till
November), equally divided between the early and the late rainy seasons.
The mean monthly evapotranspiration varies from a minimum of two inches in
December/January to a maximum of six to seven inches in May. Evapotran-
spiration thus exceeds rainfall from November to April.
3.06    The lower temperatures of the Rabi season (with mean daily tem-
peratures from the mid-60s to low 70s) allow the cultivation of temperate
crops like winter vegetables, wheat, pulses, and oilseeds in addition to
the traditional cold-resistant Boro paddy. During the Kharif season (with
mean daily temperatures in the low 80s) tropical crops such as paddy,
jute, summer vegetables and fruits can be cultivated. Relative humidity
is high throughout the year, being highest (about 90%) during the late



-7-
rainy season because of the high rainfall and the limited sunshine dura-
tion.
Soils
3.07    There are no major soil fertility problems in the three subproject
areas and crops are expected to respond well to standard fertilizer
applications. A major part of the soils in all three areas is suitable
for intensive rice growing. Soils in the Satla Bagda area were given
special attention, however, because of the presence of mucky soils and/or
soils with high organic content in about 70% of the area. Flood protec-
tion and improved drainage, together with irrigation, would result in
substantial improvement in these soils making them suitable for more
intensive and diversified cropping. This has already been experienced in
one small polder which was recently improved under the Early Implementa-
tion Projects. 1/ These soils are particularly suitable for intensive
vegetable production, but paddy yields are also high under proper manage-
ment. The Hail Haor soils are generally sandy loams developed upon
alluvium deposited from the overflow of the Kushiyara and Manu Rivers and
also outwash of sandy deposits from the surrounding hills. The arable
soils appear relatively fertile, but under more intensive cropping will
require higher dosages of fertilizers. Soils in Chalan Beel consist of a
variety of silts, loams and clays which are fairly fertile and well suited
for the main crops in the area.
Farm Size, Land Tenure and Population
3.08    Size of Farm  Although somewhat larger than the average in
Bangladesh, farms are small in the three subproject areas, averaging 3.3
ac in CB, 3.5 ac in SB and 5 ac in HH compared with 2.8 ac for all of
Bangladesh (Annex 1, Table 1).
3.09    Land Tenure  Data on land tenure and fragmentation of farm hold-
ings were derived from agro-economic surveys carried out by WDB in prepar-
ing the feasibility reports for the three subproject areas during 1979 and
1980. Most of the lands in the three subproject areas are owner-operated:
70% in CB, 75% in SB and 67% in HH. Part-owners operate most of the
remainder: 25% in CB, 20% in SB and 29% in HH. Landless tenants account
for only 5% of the total land in CB and SB and 4% in HH, somewhat less
than the national average. Fragmentation into more than ten plots
accounts for 45% of all farms in CB, 37% in SB and 67% in HH (Annex 1,
Table 2).   While there is sometimes advantage in dispersion of plots
1/ A technical assistance program of the Government of the Netherlands
for minor schemes in shallow flood or non-flooded areas.



farmed to reduce risks of flooding, owners often rent out part of their
land and, in turn, rent other land closer to them.
3.10    Population  The population of the subproject areas is entirely
rural and of high density: about 1,500 per sq mi in CB, 1,700 in SB, but
only 900 in HH, compared with a rural population density of 1,510 for all
of Bangladesh. This means that there are about two people per arable acre
in HH, and about four per arable acre in the other two subproject areas.
The land/man ratio, i.e., adult male cultivators per net cultivable acre
after project development, is 1.5 for CB, 1.4 for SB and 0.35 for HH.
Thus, there is an abundance of agricultural labor even without women and
children assisting.
3.11    Based upon the average income per acre and the size of farms, an
estimate can be made of the numbers of households in the project areas
which have incomes below subsistence level. Assuming a per capita cereals
consumption of 16 oz per day, a 20% margin for other foods to achieve a
balanced diet, and a 30% margin for non-food expenditures, the per capita
subsistence level requirements are estimated to be the equivalent of about
300 kg of rice (or 12 mds of paddy) per year. At the prevailing price
levels in Bangladesh, this implies a subsistence level income of about Tk
1,400 per annum. The largest percentage of population below subsistence
level appears to be found in Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda and the lowest in
Hail Haor. A conservative estimate indicates that two-thirds to
three-fourths of the population in both Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda and
30% in Hail Haor fall below this level, in the order of 200,000 to 230,000
in Chalan Beel, 150,000 in Satla Bagda and 25,000 in Hail Haor. Most of
the rest are small farmers whose per capita income is only marginally
above the poverty level criteria.
Agricultural Practices
3.12    Cultivating techniques in all three subproject areas are tradi-
tional and characterized by low risk practices. Improved seed, chemical
fertilizers and agricultural chemicals for pest, disease and weed control
are used only in very limited quantities. Average yields are low but do
not differ much from other places with similar flooding problems in
Bangladesh. The main factors affecting present crop yields in the project
areas are the long and deep flooding during the monsoon season and
prolonged and frequent drought during the winter season, both of which
result in low and unpredictable yields. Cropping patterns and crop
varieties are determined by the annual flooding. Low yields are often the
result of early or late flooding as well as the depth of flooding.
3.13    Rice is the predominate crop, with yields averaging about 15
md/ac, varying from 9 md/ac for B. Aman in CB to 50 md/ac or more for Boro
(HYV) in SB. The present average wheat yield is a little above 15 md/ac.



-9-
Two other important crops, oilseeds and pulses, yield not more than 5 and
10 md/ac, respectively.
3.14    In Chalan Beel, about 90% of the arable land (85,000 out of 95,000
ac) is cropped with rice during the monsoon season. Less than half is
farmed during the dry season. The resulting cropping intensity at present
is about 150%. The area under HYV T. Aman is very limited. Braus or Boro
HYV is a rabi rice crop produced in lower parts of the area where irriga-
tion by pumps or traditional methods is possible. At present, about
12,000 ac of CB area is under command of tubewells and low-lift pumps.
Over the next five years, about 900 shallow tubewells will be sunk under
The Christian Commission for Development of Bangladesh (CCDB) program,
commanding about 18,000 ac. BADC and others are also expected to sink
additional wells, estimated to command about 2,000 acres. To completely
irrigate the subproject area, a further 1,600 shallow tubewells will also
be needed.
3.15    In Satla Bagda, cropping intensity has been increasing in recent
years, but is still only about 130%. Rice covers about 70% of the total
arable area during the Kharif season (40,000 ac out of 58,000 ac) and at
least 30% during the winter season (20,000 ac out of 58,000 ac). The
remaining areas are either too deeply flooded or suffer from droughts and
are not suitable for rice production. Because of tidal flooding in the dry
season, only those farmers cultivating the higher lands are now in a
position to avoid crop damage from flooding by changing to an irrigated
Rabi crop, i.e., Boro paddy or Braus, harvested in the Aus season. In
those areas, irrigation is possible during spring tide or by using
low-lift pumps. This practice seems to be gaining and the area under
irrigated Rabi crops may continue to increase, especially where Braus is
cultivated. Consequently, the rather low average yields in SB can be
expected to show some increase in future. As indicated above, yields of
the Boro paddy are 50 md/ac and more, well above the national average, as
a result possibly of the daily tidal silt deposits. Some farmers in SB
grow vegetables during the winter season on peaty soils on beds raised
above the high tide level.
3.16    Agriculture in the Hail Haor area is essentially a monoculture
of rice, accounting for almost all of the cultivated area during the wet
season (46,000 ac) and 80% during the dry season. No irrigation with
tubewells or low-lift pumps is found in the project area. Some of the
perennial charas are blocked in the winter season for irrigation. A
narrow area along the haor is also cultivated during the winter season
using indigenous irrigation methods. Almost equal proportions of the
total arable area are single and double-cropped, with the predominant
cropping system being single B. Aman, single Boro and sequential cropping
of Aus followed by Aman, reflecting the different topographical and
hydrological conditions in the area. Depending on flood hazard, T. Aus is
planted either early or late in the early Kharif season, mainly on the



-10-
lands along the western periphery of the area. Triple cropping and the
cultivation of vegetables, jute and miscellaneous crops are relatively
limited. The overall cropping intensity is 151%.
3.17    Yields of paddy in HH area vary at present from an average of 15
md/ac for B. Aus to 40 md/ac for Braus. The weighted average paddy yield
is close to 18 md/ac. Although B. Aman can withstand flooding, once it
has passed the tillering stage, early floods can also damage the crop.
Similarly, T. Aman suffers from drought if there is no rain at the time of
flowering and grain formation. Boro crops which are generally grown in
areas adjacent to beels, can also be affected by prolonged droughts.
Transplanted rice varieties are grown on the highest land, but may be
subject to flash floods from the charas coming from the surrounding hills.
Lower areas, where deep water rice varieties are grown, are subject to
deep inundation which may occur during the critical stages when the crop
is still in its germination or tillering phase. The extent of inundation
varies from year-to-year, but under average conditions about 5% of the
area cropped with rice is affected, with yield reductions of up to about
50% compared with normal yields.
Agricultural Inputs and Supporting Services
3.18    While demand for modern inputs is growing, it is still very low.
Stocks of fertilizer are generally sufficient and available at official,
controlled prices. As demand for fertilizer grows, distribution should be
satisfactory since all three subproject areas are close to BADC principal
distribution points from which private wholesalers and dealers can obtain
supplies. Distribution of pesticides has also recently been turned over
to the private sector, which should facilitate its distribution as the
demand grows. Supplies of low-lift pumps and tubewells should also be
sufficient in these areas, although in the past, shortages and poor serv-
ice have been noted in CB area, the only one of the three areas with a
substantial number of tubewells and low-lift pumps. BADC has fielded a
small number of low-lift pumps in SB area. No effort has been made to
promote shallow tubewells or low-lift pumps in the HH area. It should be
mentioned that The Christian Commission for Development of Bangladesh has
been very successful with its program of shallow tubewells in CB area.
3.19    Seeds for the project area are generally supplied to the thana
fertilizer stores by the BADC district seed development officers, although
BADC meets only a very small fraction of the farmers' requirement of
quality seeds. Sales are made directly to the farmers or agricultural
cooperative societies under the supervision of the thana seed inspectors
employed in each thana. With the establishment of processing plants,
assisted by IDA Credit 410-BD and the proposed second seeds project, BADC
should be in a position to ensure adequate supplies of quality seeds to
farmers in the project areas.



-11-
3.20    Institutional services are very limited within the three project
areas, probably in part because of their poor accessibility. This is
especially true in SB, which is only reached by water. With the construc-
tion of the roads proposed under the project, better coverage should be
achieved within the project areas.
3.21    Extension services in the project areas are poor to nonexistent.
The responsibility for providing agricultural extension and education will
be mainly that of the Directorate of Agricultural Extension andi Manage-
ment, which has been receiving ass.staice from IDA to expand and im-roc-e
services throughout the country. The first Extension and Research Project
(Credit 729-BD) covered only the northwestern region. The proposed second
Extension and Research Project would be extended to a larger area and
would focus on building up the effectiveness of field staff where the
greatest impact on production could be made. Government has already
introduced a modified T and V system of extension throughout the country
and extension services in the project areas should improve. Some notable
extension and community development work is being furnished in SB area by
the National Church Council of Bangladesh which has a directorate in one
of the project thanas. It promotes use of HYV by small farmers through
demonstration fields, rents out LLPs, forms fishing and poultry coopera-
tives and promotes a number of cottage industries. The Christian Commis-
sion for Development of Bangladesh also has a successful support program
connected with its shallow tubewell program in the CB area.
3.22    There are a number of KSS in CB and SB, but none in HH.  Credit
facilities are quite scarce in general, although the GOB's 100 Crore Taka
Credit Program, which is designed to make rural credit freely available,
has never been fully disbursed. As in other parts of Bangladesh, farmers
have four sources of institutional credit: BKB, the commercial banks, the
traditional cooperative banks and (except in HH) the IRDP/TCCA cooperative
program. The average estimated credit per agricultural household in SB
(1978-79) was Tk 78, a total of Tk 3,031,000 for 39,000 households. Such
an amount would finance only around 6% of the estimated annual production
costs for seed, fertilizer, pesticides and animal labor of Tk 850 for one
acre of one local Boro and one B. Aman crop. The estimated average amount
of agricultural credit per agricultural household in the HH project area
(1978-79) amounted to only Tk 143, a total of Tk 1,861,000 for 13,000
households. This would represent only about 3% of the total credit
requirement of an average farm of about five ac assuming annual production
costs of seed, fertilizer, pesticides and animal labor of Tk 4,492 for one
Boro and one B. Aman crop. There are no similar credit data for the CB
area, but the amount of institutional credit would also be very small.
3.23    Credit availability and institutional support should improve with
the strengthening and expansion of the TCCA/KSS system of cooperatives.
IDA's Rural Development Project (Credit 631-BD) sought to strengthen this
system as a medium for the channeling and distribution of minor irrigation



-12-
equipment, farm inputs, rural credit and agricultural support services.
This project has served as a pilot for the proposed Rural Development II
Project. The system is being expanded to all thanas, including Hail Haor,
the only one of the three subproject areas where it is lacking.
3.24    Agricultural marketing is very poorly developed in the project
areas largely because the transportation infrastructure is poor and there
is little or no marketable surplus of the main crops. SB is a deficit
area and CB and HH produce very limited surplus for the market. Shortage
of storage facilities inside the project area would aggravate the problem
further if surpluses were produced. On the other hand, marketing
facilities appear to be adequate for the cash crops produced. In CB an
important cash crop is the betel leaf (grown on about 1,800 ac) with a
market in Rajshahi. Jute production is limited to about 2,000 ac. Rape
seed, from about 3,000 ac, is almost all sold to middlemen and sent to
Rajshahi and Dacca. Except for wheat milling and the husking of rice, no
agro-industrial processing takes place in the project areas.
IV. THE PROJECT
General Purpose
4.01    The project would empolder the subproject areas by building
embankments to eliminate flooding from the surrounding rivers. With the
gravity drainage which would be provided at this stage of development,
substantial flooding would still occur as the monsoon progresses since
drainage depends on the levels of the surrounding rivers, which fall only
at the end of the monsoon season. However, the project would enable both
a reduction in the depth of flooding and a substantial delay in the
incidence of flooding. Thus, the reduction of the risk factor of flooding
that now characterizes the agricultural situation in the project areas
would promote an increase in crop production. Farmers would increase the
cultivation of HYV rice, losses of the Aus crop due to flood damage would
be reduced or eliminated and Aman yields would be improved. As indicated
in paras 6.01 - 6.03 and Table 6.1, once seasonal floods are controlled,
gross cropping intensities will increase on account of more land becoming
available for double cropping during the fairly prolonged monsoon season.
Crop yields would increase with greater use of crop inputs because of the
reduced risk of crop failure due to flood hazard and through increased use
of higher yielding varieties of Aus and Aman rice and of Braus.
Project Components
4.02    The Chalan Beel Subproject would have the following main
components:



-13-
(a)  83 miles of embankment with height varying from three ft to
10 ft for most of its length, but up to 20 ft in some reaches,
a crest width of 12 ft, except for the 10 miles carrying
the main road where a width of 20 ft would be used, and
involving about 217 M cu ft of earthwork;
(b)  drainage improvements including nine sluices;
(c)  improvement and paving of 27 miles of main roads, construction
of four miles of new main road, improvement of about 30 miles of
village roads and construction of the road embankment and
paving of about 30 additional miles of village roads;
(d)  construction of miscellaneous ancillary facilities such as
gatekeepers' quarters, warehouses and construction offices; and
(e)  equipment and vehicles for the construction program (Annex 1,
Table 9).
4.03    The Satla Bagda Subproject would have the following main
components:
(a)  construction of about 55 miles of new embankment and improvement
of about 20 miles of existing embankments, with height varying
generally from 9 to 12 ft, crest width of 14 ft and involving
about 219 M cu ft of earthwork;
(b)  construction of 9 gravity drainage regulators and 450 inlet
structures in the embankments of the supplying water courses
and excavation of drainage and irrigation channels to provide
gravity irrigation and drainage for a gross area of about
30,000 ac;
(c)  construction of about 25.5 miles of new main road and 19.5 miles
of village roads, with 11 culverts and five two-span bridges;
(d)  a small ferry boat for people and vehicles which will serve as
the only access for the smallest of the three polders to the
road system through the other two polders;
(e)  construction of miscellaneous ancillary facilities such as
gatekeepers' quarters, warehouses, construction offices and
storage facilities to supplement those at Barisal from which
the project is to be managed; and
(f) equipment and vehicles for the construction program (Annex 1,
Table 9).



-14-
4.04    The Hail Haor Subproject would have the following main
components:
(a) construction of an embankment about 8 miles long by upgrading an
existing road, increasing the height above ground level in some
places by five feet, with a crest width of 14 ft and involving
about 1,750,000 cu ft of earthwork;
(b) construction of a gravity drainage regulator where the embankment
crosses the Gopla River;
(c) construction of a secondary drainage system for about 21,800 ac;
(d) improvement of 19 miles of village roads to main road standards and
improvement of about 20 miles of village roads and including
about 4 one-span and 4 two-span bridges and 10 culverts;
(e) construction of miscellaneous ancillary facilities;
(f) equipment and vehicles for the construction program (Annex 1,
Table 9);
(g) a fisheries development study and infrastructure investments
totalling about US$0.5 M; and
(h) groundwater investigation works totalling about US$0.5 M.
4.05    The fisheries component would finance a study of the present
fisheries circumstances of the Hail Haor area, forecast the likely future
fisheries environment and make recommendations for a fisheries enhancement
program including the construction of the infrastructure required for the
implementation of the program (Annex 1, Table 10). The program would be
developed by the Directorate of Fisheries and its inland fisheries unit
which has been working with the Chandpur, Muhuri and Karnafuli irrigation
projects in consultation with the Bank. This unit now has a well-trained
staff of 25 professionals and is carrying out the fisheries components of
these projects successfully. Draft terms of reference for the preparatory
study are given in Annex 2. Once agreement has been reached on the
development program, a Project Implementation Unit within the Directorate
of Fisheries in consultation with WDB should carry out the planning,
supervision and construction of facilities recommended.
4.06    The groundwater investigation of the Hail Haor area is to estab-
lish the feasibility of shallow tubewell irrigation. About 20 test holes
would be drilled, 10 test wells installed, 40 piezometric observation
wells installed and water and soil samples collected from the aquifer and
analyzed (Annex 1, Table 11). All work would be carried out by the WDB.



-15-
4.07    The proposed credit would not include financing of extension
services, credit facilities or the low lift pumps and shallow tubewells
which will be required to irrigate the subproject areas since these would
be available under programs being financed by GOB, IDA and other donors.
However, assurances were obtained that reasonable coverage of the sub-
project areas with extension services and credit facilities would be
achieved and maintained throughout the project life. Supplies of irriga-
tion equipment appear to be adequate and are expected to continue to be so
during the life of the project.
Engineering Works
4.08    The project has been planned and designed to feasibility standards
by WDB, with the assistance of NEDECO (Netherlands) consultants. The
deslgns to be used are very similar to those used in the first Drainage
and Flood Control Project. All embankments would be provided with a
three-foot freeboard, except for a ten mile section along the Atra River
in the CB subproject where a main road would be on the crest and a
four-foot freeboard would be provided. Crest widths vary from 12 to 14
ft, except for the above mentioned section with a main road where the
width would be 20 ft. Side slopes of 1:2 and 1:3 are proposed for the
country and river sides respectively. Stability calculations were carried
out for the country side slope, checking the safety coefficient for dif-
ferent slip circles. The embankment heights have been designed for
50-year flood levels in SB and HH and for 100-year flood levels in CB, the
latter being almost identical to the 50-year flood level. Where embank-
ments are not following the alignment of an existing embankment, a minimum
distance of about 200 ft from the river bank has been maintained. Due to
unfavorable subsoil conditions in some sections of the SB embankments,
allowances would be made in the required earthwork volumes for the
expected subsidence of the embankment after construction. Suitability
of the foundation material of the proposed embankments should be studied
during the design phase with soil samples taken at intervals along the
alignment and analyzed. Similar investigations would be made for the
borrow pits.
4.09    After construction of the embankments, the project areas will be
safeguarded against flooding from the surrounding rivers, but without
proper pump drainage systems, which are not considered economic at
present, the lower parts of the areas would still suffer from inundation
from rainfall and streams flowing into the area since gravity drainage
becomes effective only at the end of the monsoon season, about the end of
October. The drainage requirements for the secondary drainage systems,
conveying the surface runoff to the lower lying areas, is based on
analysis of daily rainfall figures, using a design storm frequency of 80%
(return period of 5 years). The drainage systems generally will follow
existing khals, canals and old river courses, resulting in relatively low
investment costs. Exact alignments would be defined during the design



-16-
study. The channel system used to drain the basins during the wet season
will function as the distribution system for irrigation during the dry
season. The cross sectional area of each drainage regulator has been
based on a study of the river levels at the proposed site of the outlet
(with its daily and seasonal fluctuations) and the drainage basin water
levels. Detailed alignments, designs and quantities for secondary drains
and field ditches would be made during the design study, based on proper
topographical surveys.
4.10    The main and village roads will be built according to common
practice in Bangladesh. Main roads will be paved with 3 to 4 inches of
water-bound macadam on a 3 inch brick soling and 3 inches of sand cushion.
Village roads are to be constructed with 4 to 6-inch brick chips (khoa) on
a 3-inch sand cushion. Main roads are given a paved width of 12 ft;
village roads, 8 ft. Culverts and bridges are to be constructed at
drainage crossings.
4.11    Since the works are of a simple nature, WDB would do the final
design work and supervise construction itself without outside assistance.
Assurances were obtained that WDB would design embankments to the above
standards satisfactory to IDA.
Implementation Schedule
4.12    Project implementation would take five years, although HE should
require only three years, extending from late 1981 until the onset of the
rainy season in May 1986. Most of the construction work can begin in the
first year. WDB has already started surveys, site investigations and
designs. The design and construction of the embankments can start almost
simultaneously. Construction of drainage outlet structures would begin in
the second year, after completion of the necessary topographical and site
surveys and final designs. Tender documents for the construction equip-
ment and vehicles are being prepared and procurement is to be completed by
December 31, 1982. In order to expedite project implementation, a
schedule of contracting for civil works was discussed during negotiations.
Bid documents for civil works for the first year of construction will be
prepared by the Superintending Engineers concerned soon after Board
approval of the proposed Credit. The process has already been started to
acquire any additional land required for the first year of construction
(para 5.08).
Cost Estimates
4.13    The total project cost (in 1980 prices), including the groundwater
survey and fisheries component at Hail Haor, is estimated at US$41.4 M
(Tk 662 M equivalent) including taxes and duties of US$2.0 M equivalent.
About 11% (US$4.4 M) would be foreign exchange (Table 4.1). The cost
estimates for imported vehicles and equipment are based on unit prices in



-17-
recent contract awards and on international prices. Costs of civil works,
including embankments, drains and buildings are based on recent costs in
Bangladesh for similar works. Physical contingencies have been estimated
at 20% on civil works since detailed surveys are yet to be completed.
Price contingencies are based on an annual inflation rate of 12% for local
costs and 9%, 8.5%, 8%, 7.5% and 7.0% for the five years of the implemen-
tation period for foreign costs. Annex 1, Tables 12, 13, 14 and 15
present detailed cost estimates and a schedule of expenditures.

Financing
4.14    The financial plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2.  The
proposed IDA credit of US$27.0 M would cover 70% of the total project
costs excluding taxes and duties. The credit would finance 100% of for-
eign exchange costs and about 84% of local costs other than taxes and
duties and land acquisition costs.  GOB would finance the balance of the
project cost, US$14.4 M (Tk 230 M equivalent) including taxes and duties
and land acquisition costs, through annual budget appropriations. To
ensure prompt provision of project budgetary funds, it would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness that GOB had approved the Project Proforma, an
internal GOB document whose approval is a prerequisite for release of
funds, and that a copy would be sent to IDA. Draft Project Proforma were
brought to negotiations.

Procurement
4.15    Civil Works  (US$28 M, including physical and price contingen-
cies).  The works would not be suitable for international competitive
bidding (ICB) because they are relatively small, simple, labor-intensive
and scattered. In addition, construction would be subject to seasonal
weather and flood interruptions. The work would be carried out under
contracts let through WDB's standard local competitive bidding procedures,
which are satisfactory to IDA. WDB would obtain through LCB any construc-
tion materials not provided by the contractors. There is a tendency in
Bangladesh to let many petty contracts, resulting in excessive paperwork
at all levels of project implementation. Therefore, assurances were
obtained that none of the civil works contracts would be smaller than



-20-
US$5,000 (Tk8O,000), although the average contract is expected to be
considerably larger, as has been the experience with the first Drainage
and Flood Control Project. Force account work is expected to be very
limited and would be restricted to amounts under $1,000 equivalent. There
would be no retroactive financing under the proposed credit.
4.16    Equipment, Vehicles and Spare Parts  (US$0.6 M, including contin-
gencies, but excluding taxes and duties). These would be procured through
ICB in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15%
of c.i.f. price or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower, would
be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Small
off-the-shelf items costing less than US$50,000 for each contract, which
are either urgently needed or are not suitable for ICB, would be purchased
through normal government procedures, on the basis of comparing prices
from no less than three suppliers. Such purchases would be limited to a
total of US$200,000. After the project, the vehicles and equipment would
be used for maintenance or moved to other projects.
4.17    Documents for all contracts estimated to cost above US$200,000
would be sent to IDA for review before bids were invited and later before
award. All other contracts would be awarded in accordance with normal
government procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA, and a summary of the
bid evaluations with the contracts would be sent to IDA before disburse-
ment is sought.
Disbursements
4.18    Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit would cover:
(a) 90% of civil works;
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures for directly imported
vehicles, equipment, spare parts and construction materials;
(c) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured
equipment, vehicles, spare parts and construction materials
procured under ICB;
(d) 60% of total expenditures for other equipment, vehicles, spare
parts and construction materials procured locally without ICB;
and
(e) 100% of expenditures for technical assistance (studies).
Full documentation for all expenditures would be submitted to IDA in
support of withdrawal applications, except for a small amount of force
account that may be necessary for road or other works where a statement of
expenditures together with a statement of work performed, certified by the
Director of the Monitoring Cell, would be forwarded to IDA. Documents for
force account expenditures would be retained by WDB for review by IDA
missions. All documents would have been checked and certified by the
Project Director concerned.



-21-
4.19    The proposed credit allocation and the estimated schedules oa
expenditures and of disbursements are shown in Annex 1, Tables 15, 16 aal-
17.  It is expected that the credit would be fully disbursed by Jtne 30,
1987, i.e., about one year after the project completion. While this is a
somewhat shorter disbursement period than experienced with past WDB
projects, it is justified by the simplicity of the works and the arrnage-
ments for their execution.
Joint Project Revolving Fund
4.20    Inadequate counterpart funding by GOB has been a major constraint
to successful implementation of a number of priority development programs,
including IDA-assisted projects, in Bangladesh. To avoid delays in the
implementation of priority programs, pre-financing of certain project
expenditures on a selective basis has been agreed by GOB and IDA, as in
Small Scale Drainage and Flood Control Project Credit. A Project Revolv-
ing Fund in an initial amount of about Tk 20 M (US$ 1.0 M) and Tk 2.0 M by
GOB) would be operated by WDB and maintained in a commercial bank which is
satisfactory to IDA. The two amounts represent the proportions of finance
to be contributed by IDA and the Government to the expenditures to be met
by withdrawals from the fund. The fund would be used to finance: (a)
civil works expenditures carried out by contract or (b) purchase of
equipment, vehicles, spare parts and construction materials procured
locally without ICB. It is for expenditures of these natures that local
currency financing is often delayed. Contracts for materials, vehicles
and equipment obtained through ICB as well as force account work would not
be financed from the fund. Initial advances from the account would be
made, as necessary, and at the discretion of WDB, to officers designated
responsible for subproject implementation. They would report monthly to
WDB on the use of these funds and support their statements of expenditures
with appropriate documentation such as certified statements of expendi-
ture, invoices, contracts, etc. WDB would prepare and submit to IDA a
consolidated return together with a reimbursement claim for IDA's share of
expenditures financed from the fund. The claim would be supported with
evidence that Government's share of these costs had already been paid into
the fund. Withdrawal applications for the replenishment of the revolving
fund would be accompanied by full documentation submitted by WDB and by
monthly statements of the revolving fund account prepared by the financial
institution in which the revolving fund account is opened. The monthly
statements would give the details of all withdrawals and deposits as well
as the opening and closing balances of the account. Should any disburse-
ments be made from the revolving fund which are not acceptable to IDA, the
Government would deposit the corresponding amount in the fund account.
Assurances were obtained that the procedures for use of the revolving fund
(Annex 3) would be employed and a condition of credit effectiveness would
be the establishment of the revolving fund in a commercial bank. The
initial deposit of Tk 2.0 M by GOB would be a condition for IDA's initial



-22-
deposit to the fund. Assurances were also obtained that GOB would employ
an independent auditor to audit annually the fund account, statements of
expenditure and supporting documentation, that the auditor would produce
an annual report, and that a copy of each report would be sent to IDA
within six months of the close of each fiscal year. A revolving fund of
the above type established for the Small Scale Drainage and Flood Control
Project has been working well.
Accounts and Audits
4.21    Assurances were obtained that WDB and the Directorate of Fisheries
would maintain records, satisfactory to IDA, to identify physical and
financial transactions relating to the project. Separate project accounts
would be prepared annually by each of these participating agencies.
Assurances were obtained that auditors acceptable to IDA would audit these
accounts and statements of expenditure where applicable (para 4.18) and
that audited accounts, together with auditor's comments, would be sent to
IDA within nine months of the close of the first two fiscal years and
within six months of the close of each of the following fiscal years. At
present, WDB's accounts are audited by the Government Audit and by WDB's
internal Directorate of Audits. The auditing arrangements have been
satisfactory in previous IDA-financed projects. A recent review of the
internal audit unit by the task force on organization and implementation
(para 5.03) has found no major deficiency in the auditing arrangements.
Environmental Impact
4.22    The subprojects financed under the project are not expected to
have any significant impact on public health although improved flood
protection and drainage should reduce the incidence of malaria and
cholera. The effect of the construction of polders on flood levels out-
side the project areas is likely to be negligible since the flood dischar-
ges in the affected rivers are vast compared with the increased discharge
volumes of the subproject areas as a consequence of the project. Con-
struction of the embankments could have some adverse impact on water
transport; however, since most cargo is transferred from small boats to
larger boats at the confluence of major rivers and drains, the effect will
be small. Furthermore, road development under the project should greatly
improve transport within and to the project areas. Flood control will
result in some reduction in soil fertility by elimination of silt deposits
from floods. This, however, can be offset by increased use of chemical or
organic fertilizers. Damage of annual flooding to homes, gardens and
livestock would also be greatly reduced.
4.23    Some adverse affect to fish production due to elimination of flood
fishing is expected in the project areas, particularly at Hail Haor.
Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda will continue to have a substantial area of
tanks, beels and khals, which can be served from the central hatchery



-23-
financed under the IDA-assisted Oxbow Lakes Fisheries Project. The Hail
Haor area is part of the northeast floodplain where flood plain fishing is
conducted in the haors and beels during the period November to February
when fish, concentrated by receding flood waters are easily harvested.
Flood fishing has been a rich source of protein in the local diet and has
provided employment for some 200 to 300 commercial fishermen and perhaps
2,000 to 3,000 part-time fishermen. The data base for assessing the
current fisheries in the haor is poor and outdated. Indications are that
annual yields are decreasing and that the catch consists mainly of low
value species. The annual fish yield from the area is estimated as around
400 tons, valued at Tk 3 to 4 M. Some reduction in this production would
be expected until it could be offset by the fisheries development program
proposed under the project. This should demonstrate how the adverse
impact of such flood control and irrigation projects can be offset. The
prospects for continued implementation of drainage and flood control
projects in the floodplains of northern Bangladesh, an area of about two
million acres, and the significance of fisheries in this general area
point to the need for proper integration of floodplain fisheries develop-
ment within such projects. Fish stocks in an enclosed floodplain such as
the Hail Haor area create opportunities for fish enhancement as well as
fisheries management programs. Such programs are of particular sig-
nificance in that they could halt the detrimental effects on the fishery
of the current institutional (leasing) arrangements which give little
incentive to leaseholders for maintaining fisheries bunds and shelters
or for conserving fish stocks in the haors and beels for future breeding.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01    The project, except for the fisheries component at Hail Haor,
would be managed by WDB. WDB was established in 1972 as a semi-autonomous
agency within the Ministry of Power, Water Resources and Flood Control and
is responsible for providing surface water irrigation, drainage, flood
control, erosion control, town protection and river training throughout
Bangladesh. WDB's organization is shown in Chart 22907. It is managed
by a Chairman and five Board Members covering planning, implementation,
supply and services, finance and administration. Under their overall
direction, day-to-day management is provided by 11 Chief Engineers and
about 50 Superintending Engineers and Directors. WDB has approximately
2,300 fully professional staff, mainly engineers, of whom about half are
in Dacca. Of 6,500 technical and accounting staff, approximately 4,000
are in the field.
5.02    WDB's organization structure is basically sound and has in the
past enabled it to successfully implement and complete a large number of
water resources development projects. WDB manages six ongoing



-24-
IDA-financed projects in the irrigation, drainage and flood control sec-
tor. Delays in implementation have been cause for concern in the past and
the Government has taken a number of positive actions aimed at streamlin-
ing WDB's administrative procedures and improving its overall performance.
There has been a noticeable improvement in WDB's performance in recent
years and it is expected that further improvements will result from the
implementation of the recommendations of the Joint GOB/IDA Review Mission
that completed an in-depth review of WDB and its program in 1979 (see para
5.03). The Government fully realizes that a further strengthening of
WDB's organization and management will be required to enable it to cope
effectively with the expansion of its program envisaged in the Second Five
Year Plan, which calls for a four-fold increase in the irrigated area
developed under WDB schemes (from 240,000 to about 1 M ac by 1985), and
with the shift in emphasis from large-scale, long-gestation projects
towards smaller schemes with lower capital investment per acre. This
ambitious target and attendant shift in emphasis on widely dispersed
smaller schemes will obviously place even greater demands on WDB's plan-
ning, implementation and management capacity.
5.03    In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Review, the
Government requested UNDP assistance to finance two projects, one aimed at
the introduction of improved planning standards, procedures and priorities
within WDB and the National Planning Commission of the Ministry of Plan-
ning and the other to focus on organization and implementation. Both
projects are ongoing, under IDA supervision. Consultants (Harza Engineer-
ing Company International) are assisting WDB task forces to make specific
studies leading to detailed recommendations for further action to
strengthen WDB's planning, its field organization, management, internal
coordination and implementation arrangements and procedures.
5.04    WDB's technical performance in the implementation of its six
IDA-assisted projects is satisfactory. The Chandpur project is virtually
completed. The Performance Audit Report 1/ noted that inadequate counter-
part funding was a major constraint in implementation and called attention
to the problem of maintaining fish and prawn catch in the project area
after its enclosure. In the proposed project, the revolving fund should
ease the problem of counterpart funding and the fisheries component is
intended to help maintain fish production. The original Barisal project
has also been substantially completed, on schedule, but fewer project
works were required than originally expected and the project area has been
extended and a later completion date agreed. WDB's performance in the
project has been satisfactory. Two subprojects of the first Drainage and
Flood Control Project are well underway and should be completed on
1/ Performance Audit Report, March 25, 1981, and Project Completion
Report, August 20, 1980.



-25-
schedule in 1983.  IDA's continued involvement with the third subproject
(the Brahmaputra Right Embankment) is under review.  Karnafuli, after
initial delays due to shortages of local funds and disputes between WDB
and contractors, and more recently to managerial difficulties, is now
progressing satisfactorily under a new Project Director.  Muhuri has
experienced delays in construction due to equipment breakdowns and
shortages and financial difficulties on the part of the contractor, but
performance of the contractor, consultants and WDB has improved resulting
in more satisfactory progress in construction. The Small Scale Drainage
and Flood Control Project has made a good start.
5.05    WDB would carry out the work in the proposed project through its
normal channels: planning and design being undertaken in Dacca under the
Chief Engineer (Planning) and Chief Engineer (Design) and construction and
detailed financial control being through the regional Chief Engineers,
Superintending Engineers and Executive Engineers. Overall responsibility
for project administration and supervision would be with the Member,
Implementation. To assist him in monitoring project progress, coordinat-
ing the work of various WDB units, coordinating with other agencies and
sorting out implementation problems, a Monitoring Cell for IDA-financed
projects has been recently established and attached to the Member's
office. This cell will assume the responsibilities for these activities
from the Director of Programs who has been functioning part-time as
Project Coordinator for the earlier IDA-financed projects. The cell is
headed by a Director with the rank of Superintending Engineer. This new
arrangement should improve performance in procurement and tendering, in
timely reporting on progress of implementation and generally help in
maintaining good contact between IDA and the projects.
5.06    At the field level, WDB staff would need to maintain close contact
with the staff of other agricultural agencies such as BADC, IRDP and
DOAEM. This would be particularly important in the later stages of the
project when the project works would enable introduction of substantial
changes in prevailing cropping patterns and cultivation practices.
Accordingly, for each subproject, a Project Coordination Committee would
be established. The committees would report to the Member, Implementation
and would include appropriate level officials from the concerned agricul-
tural agencies. It would meet quarterly or more often, if needed. This
type of arrangement has been used with the first Drainage and Flood Con-
trol Project and with other IDA-financed WDB projects and appears to have
provided effective coordination at the project level. Assurances-were
obtained that the three Coordination Committees with membership and terms
of reference satisfactory to IDA would be established by June 30, 1982.
The chairmen of these committees would be the project directors: the
Superintending Engineer at Rajshahi for CB, the Superintending Engineer,
Water Development Circle, Barisal for SB and the Superintending Engineer
of Manu River Circle at Maulvi Bazar for HH.



-26-
Annual Work Programs
5.07    Before each construction season, WDB would prepare an annual
program detailing activities and works to be undertaken during the
forthcoming year. Such programs would include appropriate maps, charts
and drawings, staffing and material requirements as well as cost
estimates. The Monitoring Cell would be responsible for collating and
consolidating these programs for submission to IDA. A work program for
the remainder of FY82 has been agreed. Assurances were obtained that by
April 30 of each year, commencing with 1982, IDA would receive for review
and comment work programs for the forthcoming construction year.
Land Acquisition
5.08    Construction of the project facilities would require acquisition
of privately owned land: about 2,848 ac in CB, 1,365 ac in SB, and 77 ac
in HH. Due to land scarcity and a lack of alternative means of
livelihood, many landowners are reluctant to sell their holdings. Inade-
quate and delayed financial compensation have also often obstructed timely
land acquisition. Delays in land acquisition have, in turn, often con-
tributed to long and costly delays in implementation of various projects.
Under the latest Ordinance relating to land acquisition, GOB cannot enter
land without paying 90% of its estimated value to the owner. The balance
due may be delayed a few months. This ensures that the owner will be
paid, provided funds are available. Since the land will be purchased
piecemeal, keeping as much scarce financial resources as possible avail-
able for works, assurances would be sought that at least three months
before the land is required, sufficient funds for such land would be
deposited with the Deputy Commissioner or other appropriate authority. A
similar arrangement has worked satisfactorily for the first Drainage and
Flood Control Project. In addition, WDB will deposit funds with the
Deputy Commissioners for acquiring any land required for the first year's
construction program as a condition of credit effectiveness and WDB's
possession of such land is required as a condition of IDA's initial
deposit in the revolving fund account. The land acquired for embankments
and roads consists of relatively narrow strips and since holdings are
fragmented, it is likely that a person would sell only one or two plots
but retain five or six within the project area. Thus, the need to reset-
tle displaced persons is not expected to arise.
Operation and Maintenance
5.09    The primary responsibility for the operation and maintenance of
the subprojects would be with WDB. WDB's normal staff of Executive
Engineers and their assistants would undertake the work. In the past,
attention given to operation and maintenance has been grossly inadequate
and, as a result, many works and facilities in Bangladesh have tended to



-27-
lose their usefulness prematurely. Part of the problem has been due to
the lack of well-formulated procedures and programs for operation and
maintenance and part due to inadequate budgetary allocations. Provision
for these costs during the implementation period have been made under the
project. Subsequent annual operation and maintenance costs are estimated
to require (in 1980 prices) Tk 4.9 M, 6.7 M and 1.3 M for CB, SB and HH,
respectively. This would have to be financed from GOB's normal budgetary
appropriations. Assurances were obtained that adequate and timely funds
would be allocated annually for operation and maintenance of the project
and that project facilities would be maintained in accordance with sound
engineering practices. Assurances would also be sought that before-
December 31, 1982, WDB would submit to IDA for review and comment a
detailed program for inspection, maintenance and operation of the subproj-
ect embankments. The task force established to examine ways and means of
improving the Board's implementation capacity has recommended relieving
the Member, Implementation of operation and maintenance responsibilities
and establishing a new position of Member, 0 & M, with associated staff
arrangements. An assurance was obtained that the new position would be
established and that the Member and key staff would be appointed by March
31, 1982.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.10    Monitoring of project progress would be through quarterly and
annual reports prepared by the Monitoring Cell of WDB. The reports would
include all relevant data on physical and financial progress of the
project together with reasons for any deviations from the targets set
under annual work programs. Following review and consolidation by the
Monitoring Cell, quarterly and annual reports would be sent promptly to
IDA.
5.11    The main objectives of the evaluation studies would be to estimate
the direct and indirect benefits resulting from the project as well as the
socio-economic characteristics of the project beneficiaries. The data for
evaluation would be obtained through a few selected in-depth interviews in
the project areas as well as through canvassing representative samples of
project beneficiaries. A benchmark survey would be conducted during the
first or second year of the project to establish the pre-project situa-
tion. Two follow-up surveys would be conducted after completion of the
project works; the first after one year and the second after four years.
The surveys would include information on cropping patterns, yields, cul-
tivation practices, production and employment levels as well as income
levels for the various classes of project beneficiaries. The evaluation
studies and surveys would be undertaken by a suitably qualified local
consulting firm or research institution selected in consultation with IDA.
Assurances were obtained that before June 30, 1982, WDB would prepare and
submit to IDA for concurrence a detailed proposal for evaluation of the
project impact. The progress reports and the data from evaluation studies



-28-
and surveys would form, in part, the basis for preparation of the Project
Completion Report by WDB.
VI. PRODUCTION, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
Cropping Patterns
6.01    As a result of the project, total cropped area is expected to
increase because of higher cropping intensities made possible as a direct
result of the project investments in flood protection and drainage. Since
gravity will not allow full drainage of the low-lying areas for a sig-
nificant period of the year due to high outside water levels, the most
suitable crops for these parts of the three subproject areas will remain
risk crops (B. Aman/B. Aus). In those areas with inundation depths
between one to three feet, HYV rice cannot be used. Such areas must be
planted with local varieties of T. Aman or with B. Aus. However, in large
areas of all three subprojects, protection from early flooding and reduc-
tion in flooding depth and duration as a result of project works would
enable shifts from B. Aus and B. Aman to T. Aman and/or from local to HYV
paddy and promote cultivation of T. Aus, as indicated in Table 6.1.
6.02    Based on expected flooding levels and durations at various eleva-
tions within the project areas, the cropping patterns in the three project
areas are projected to change as shown in Table 6.1. Because of the flood
protection provided by the project, in Chalan Beel the area flooded from 3
ft to 15 ft would decline from 40,000 ac to 20,000 ac and that flooded
from 1 ft to 5 ft from 40,500 ac to 25,000 ac while the area flooded by no
more than 1 ft would increase from nothing at present to 35,000 ac. In
Satla Bagda, the area flooded 3 ft to 15 ft would increase from 7,600 ac
to 14,000 ac as depth of flooding in more deeply flooded areas would be
reduced and a greater area could be brought into production. The area
flooded 3 ft to 5 ft would be reduced from 31,600 ac to 9,500 ac while the
areas flooded by from 1 ft to 3 ft would increase from 500 ac to 6,000 ac.
In Hail Haor, the area flooded from 3 ft to 15 ft would be reduced from
9,500 ac to 8,000 ac, the area with flood depths of 3 ft to 5 ft would
be increased from 16,700 ac to 19,000 ac, the area flooded from 1 ft to 3
ft would be reduced from 24,300 ac to 15,000 ac while that flooded by less
than 1 ft would increase from 3,200 ac to 18,000 ac.
6.03    When considering only the direct effects of the project, however,
a rather theoretical scenario of cropping patterns results. In fact, the
project also makes it possible for the farmer to install irrigation equip-
ment for increased wheat and boro cultivation and supplementary irrigation
of monsoon crops, enabling him to take advantage of high yielding seed
varieties and other crop inputs where this was not possible without the
project. If this equipment and these inputs are made available to the



-29-
farmer (a number of existing programs provide them and credit to assist in
purchasing them) then production increases will be substantially higher
and the farmers will be able to diversify crops and produce more cash
crops such as spices and vegetables in the rabi season.

-31-
Yields and Production
6.04    Average yields in the subproject areas are low but do not differ
much from those in other places in Bangladesh. Yields have been increas-
ing moderately during the past decade, but low risk practices with limited
use of crop inputs result in low crop outputs and frequent shortages of
foodgrains. The main factors adversely affecting present crop yields are
the long and deep flooding during the wet season and drought during the
dry season, which encourage low risk farming practices with traditional
cultivating techniques and the limited use of modern inputs. The exten-
sion services generally do not contribute much to increased yields in the
subproject areas. The land tenure situation is also believed to con-
tribute to low yields since land rentals are often only for one year or
one season and the usual sharecropping arrangement, calling for the
farmers to pay for all production costs but to keep only half the output,
is a.distinct disincentive to using productive inputs.
6.05    Without the project, assuming increased effectiveness of the
extension services, some improvements would be expected in such cultiva-
tion practices as soil preparation, weeding, use of fertilizers and pest
control, leading to an annual increase in yields of perhaps 1-2%. The
area irrigated is also expected to increase, with additional pumps and
tubewells being financed under various programs. An increase in the use
of improved seeds is also expected to continue and would probably result
in modest increases in use of fertilizer and pesticides; however, use of
improved seeds seems closely related to the degree of water control in an
area.
6.06    Although use of fertilizer is now limited, farmers in these areas
are generally aware of its advantages and use it on Boro and HYVs as well
as potatoes and other vegetables. Use of fertilizer and other modern
inputs is expected to increase much more rapidly as soon as physical
conditions change as they would with protection against early and late
flooding, improved drainage and more irrigation. More fertilizer will
also be needed to replace the natural supply of nutrients once brought in
by flood waters.
6.07    Labor, the most important production factor, is available to cope
with the demands of intensified agricultural outputs, although the amount
of hired labor will probably increase after introduction of double and
triple cropping.
6.08    Land preparation is done with animal traction, mainly using simple
indigenous equipment. This method of tillage is expected to continue
throughout the project life. Available animal power is adequate to meet



-32-
present demand and is not expected to become a limiting factor, except
possibly in CB.
6.09    With the project, average yields of paddy are expected to increase
substantially at full development, 15 years after works completion. Wheat
yields are also expected to increase rather rapidly. Future yields with
the project would be higher than those without due to reduction of damage
because of the delayed incidence and reduced level of flooding as well as
improved drainage. This would encourage higher risk farming practices
with greater use of higher yielding varieties of seeds, fertilizers and
chemicals for control of pests, diseases and weeds. Production could be
increased further when pump drainage is introduced to reduce flooding in
the wet season. While the project would not finance investments in minor
irrigation to complement the flood protection works (see para 4.08),
completion of the latter and confirmation of the feasibility of shallow
tubewell irrigation in Hail Haor from the proposed groundwater study (see
para 4.06) should increase the demand for and use of minor irrigation
(hand tubewells, low lift pumps, shallow tubewells and traditional irriga-
tion methods), thus increasing yields further. Present and projected
yields and production levels are given in Annex 1, Tables 3 to 8 with and
without irrigation. Below in Table 6.2 is a summary of major changes in
production levels of foodgrains directly due to the Project.

Marketing and Prices
6.10    At present, both CB and SB are foodgrain deficit areas, while HH
produces a small surplus which can be marketed. CB meets about 70% of its
needs and SB about 80%. As indicated in Table 6.3 below, without the
project these deficits would grow larger with the growth in population and
the surplus from HH would virtually disappear within 30 years, despite
substantial increases in production. With the project, assuming the
irrigation made possible by the project is implemented, CB and HH would
each be able to produce surpluses of over 15,000 tons of foodgrains (rice
and wheat) and SB's deficit will be reduced to about 10,000 tons, not much
larger than that at present. Further increases in production in all three
areas could be achieved with full drainage by pumping, should that alter-
native become economically attractive. Once the foodgrain needs within
these areas are met, some foodgrain acreage may be diverted to other cash
crops; however, the overall demand for foodgrains, the lack of research
and extension required to support introduction of new crops and marketing
problems make it unlikely that much marketing of new crops will be
required. No problem is foreseen in marketing the additional production
of foodgrain, pulses, oilseeds and vegetables. With improved income
levels, demand within the project areas would grow considerably; any
surplus would be marketed in the urban centers which are nearby. The
traditional marketing system is well developed. Chalan Beel is close to
Rajshahi, Satla Bagda to Barisal and Khulna and Hail Haor to Sylhet. The
access roads to be constructed under the project should facilitate the
movement of agricultural produce within the project areas.

6.11    Prices fluctuate from year to year, particularly in grain surplus
areas despite Government's guaranteed support prices for paddy and wheat.
In recent years, however, the Government has increasingly shifted the
emphasis of its domestic foodgrain procurement to buying grain in the
market in order to support farmgate prices at or near incentive levels.
Partly to purchase more grain locally for its food distribution program
and partly to stabilize prices, GOB, through its Food Ministry, has been
stepping up grain purchases and may now procure about 10-15% of grain
entering the commercial market. Procurement prices of paddy, rice and
wheat have been raised markedly since 1977 and, if effectively maintained,
provide significant incentives to farmers to use modern, yield-increasing
cash inputs and to improve their cultivation methods. The greatest
obstacle to more effective farmgate price support continues to be the
shortage of suitable storage facilities, particularly in the major
procurement regions and in peak production years such as 1980/81. The
ongoing Foodgrain Storage II Project (Credit 787-BD) and a proposed fol-
low-up project, which is under preparation, are designed to improve GOB's
capacity to stabilize prices.
Farm Incomes
6.12    Crop budgets have been analyzed and production values calculated
for each of the subproject areas. Table 6.4 below summarizes the gross
production values and net production values per acre and for the average
size farm for each area at present and after full development both with
and without the project. The future projections, both with and without
the project, for CB and SB include irrigation since irrigation is well
advanced in these areas and is expected to be substantially completed
under various programs within a few years, but not in HH where only
limited irrigation by traditional methods is now employed. With the
expected introduction of shallow tubewell irrigation there, following the
feasibility study proposed under this project, production and farm income
figure.s would be substantially higher. The income and cost calculations
include labor valued at Tk 10 per man-day in HH, Tk 15 per man-day in SB
and Tk 12 per man-day in CB, reflecting differing labor rates in those
areas.

6.13    Because of the difficulty of making meaningful judgments about
farm budgets for small farms fragmented into many plots, average per acre
values have been used in estimating farm incomes. Farm incomes based on
the above production values and costs, present and future, are shown in
Table 6.5 below. The value of the farmer's own labor is taken as 80% of
the total labor cost since hired labor is estimated to amount to less than
20% of total labor input. This percentage would probably be higher for
larger farms and less for smaller ones. Farm income for tenants is based
on gross income being shared equally between tenant and landowner. Since
most of the farms in these areas are owner-operated (70% to 75%) and of
average size and many farmers both rent some land while renting out equiv-
alent other land less conveniently located, the income based on owner
farming is probably more representative than one based completely on
tenant farming.
6.14    The increases in farm incomes are substantial, resulting, in the
first place, from higher cropping intensity and, secondly, from higher
yields, less higher production costs. The greatest absolute and relative
increase in income from the project would be in CB and the least in RH.
Farm income per acre with the project at full development would be higher
by about 150% for tenants and 160% for owner-operators in CB, by about



-37-
140% for both tenants and owner-operators in SB and by about 30% for
tenants and 70% for owner-operators in HH. The farm income figures do
not take into account income from sale of betel nuts, coconut, fish, the
renting out of bullocks or other employment.

Recovery of Costs
6.15    At a discount rate of 12% per annum, the estimated opportunity
cost of capital, the present value of the construction costs (net of taxes
and duties, in constant 1980 prices) is Tk 99 M or Tk 1039 per ac in CB,
Tk 166 M or Tk 2337 per ac in SB and Tk 34 M or Tk 719 per ac in HH. In
addition, the operation and maintenance costs of the project works



-38-
would be about Tk 51.5 per ac in CB, Tk 125.6 per ac in SB and Tk 26.9 per
ac in HH.   Assuming that project charges were to be introduced two years
after project completion, full cost recovery would require a total annual
per acre charge of about Tk 277 for CB, Tk 553 for SB and Tk 149 for HH.
These amount to 18% of the estimated annual per acre project rent in CB,
59% in SB and 30% in HH. It would be unrealistic to expect a high propor-
tion of the benefits accruing from a government-financed project to be
taxed for investment cost recovery, particularly in view of the low per
capita incomes of most of the project area population.
6.16    At present, there is widespread reluctance to require the
beneficiaries of drainage and flood control projects to repay project
costs even though the beneficiaries of such projects often gain a con-
siderable increase in incomes. While it is possible to determine
aggregate benefits of the project or average per acre benefits, it would
be administratively difficult to design and enforce a cost recovery scheme
geared to individual farmer's ability to pay in a situation where they
experience a wide variety of cultivation risks, depending on their loca-
tion and the quality of land. On the other hand, imposing charges based
on average conditions would not be equitable. Furthermore, flood protec-
tion in Bangladesh, as in many countries, is considered a social service
and no charges have been collected for this type of project. Since land
values are likely to reflect differences in productivity as a result of
the project, a betterment tax would be a more logical means of achieving
cost recovery from this type of project. However, in the absence of an
effective land taxation system in Bangladesh, this alternative is not
practical for the present.
6.17    For the above reasons, as in previous Bank Group-financed drainage
and flood control projects, it is not proposed to impose charges on the
beneficiaries under this project. In practice, public investments in
flood control and drainage are made as subsidies in the rural sector and
represent a relatively small part of the total of such subsidies.
However, Bangladesh's domestic savings performance compares unfavorably
both with its needs and with the performance of other countries in South
Asia. For the past three years, the domestic savings rate as a percentage
of Gross Domestic Product has averaged only about 3.5%, compared with an
average of about 15% for all countries in South Asia. GOB's revenues as a
share of Gross Domestic Product is also low, averaging 10-12% compared
with averages for India and Sri Lanka of over 20% and of about 15% for
Pakistan. GOB is taking steps to reduce the subsidies on inputs and
irrigation. The subsidy on pesticides has recently been removed and its
distribution turned over to the private sector. The process of turning
fertilizer distribution over to the private sector has also begun and in
connection with the IDA Fertilizer Imports Credits (944-BD, June 1979 and
1044-BD, June 1980), substantial increases were made in the price of
fertilizer. Further reductions in the fertilizer subsidy are expected,



-39-
although the cost of the fertilizer subsidy will be more than 20% of the
agricultural sector budget for the Second Five Year Plan period. The
Government has now decided that all new minor irrigation equipment will be
sold and that the existing rental programs for deep tubewells and low lift
pumps will be run down as rapidly as possible. Public sector agencies
will gradually curtail procurement and supply of all irrigation equipment
other than deep tubewells. The Government, in consultation with IDA, is
now determining an appropriate cost structure for the sale of irrigation
equipment based on the principle that prices for individual equipment
should be related to each other on the basis of total cost per unit of
water generated. Shallow tubewells are now being sold at full cost, net
of taxes and duties. Last year, Government began selling deep tubewells
at a subsidized price, but representing a marked reduction over the rental
subsidy. Both these subsidies are to be reduced further. In connection
with the Low-Lift Pump Credit (990-BD, April 1980), rental rates would be
doubled over a two-year period and a sales program would be introduced
which would further reduce the subsidy. With the emphasis in the Medium
Term.Food Production Plan on groundwater development by shallow tubewells
and hand tubewells, and the policy of selling these at or near full cost
net of duties and taxes, and the reduction in subsidy on low lift pump
sales and rentals, the subsidy for flood control, drainage and irrigation
together should be substantially reduced and cost recovery improved over
the next several years. Because of the low per acre cost of flood control
projects and the sales policy for minor irrigation equipment, in fact the
costs to Government (both capital and recurrent) of introducing widespread
irrigation in Bangladesh, where minor irrigation schemes predominate, are
much lower than in other South Asian countries which are forced to use
surface irrigation systems.
6.18    Eventually, some cost recovery may be attempted for drainage and
flood control projects. GOB is currently considering increases in rural
sector taxes through the adoption of a system of land taxes based on
potential production. Charges assessed project beneficiaries could be
used to spread development to the poorer groups without these facilities
and are, therefore, justified on equity grounds. Development of
reasonable policy options and formulas for repayment of project costs will
be an important task for the new Master Plan to develop Bangladesh's water
resources, a UNDP-financed technical assistance project being administered
by the Bank.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Production and Employment
7.01    The principal direct benefit due to the project would be increased
foodgrain production, about 40,000 tons of milled rice and 10,000 tons of
wheat. Based on projected import prices (1982-90 average in 1980 constant



-40-
dollars) of $425 per ton for rice and $300 per ton for wheat, the annual
foreign exchange savings of this additional production would be equivalent
to $17 million, net of the foreign exchange cost of additional fertilizer
used. If the effects of irrigation made possible through the project were
included, these numbers would be considerably higher.
7.02    With increasing farm production, farm incomes would rise and
employment opportunities would be increased, mainly through greater demand
for on-farm labor. The total annual on-farm requirement for the principal
crops would increase from an estimated 16 million man-days at present to
27 million man-days with the project at full development with irrigation
as compared to a future requirement of 19 million man-days in future
without the project. There would also be a substantial increase in such
secondary employment activities as marketing, processing and supplying
farm inputs. All these would help to relieve the high unemployment and
underemployment prevailing in the project areas.
Income Distribution
7.03    Although the overall income distribution would remain largely
unchanged, reflecting land ownership patterns, the project would
facilitate substantial reductions in the level of absolute poverty, even
allowing for the increase in population. With the project, and assuming
that the irrigation made possible through the project is implemented, net
farm incomes in the three areas benefitted would be generally increased
from two to three times present levels. The minimum acreage which a
farmer would need to own to provide subsistence level income for an
average size family would fall from 5 acres to 1.9 in CB, from 3.4 to 1.4
in SB and from 3.3 to 2.0 in HH. Given this, the proportion of farms too
small to ensure subsistence needs would decrease from two-thirds to
three-fourths of the total at present to roughly 30% of the total in CB
and SB and to about 15% in HH. The increase in demand for hired labor
would provide employment opportunities for landless laborers and smaller
farmers.
Other Benefits
7.04    Transportation would be improved in all three project areas.
Connections to main roads would be improved increasing accessibility of
the areas. Satla Bagda, until now accessible only by water, would be
connected by road with the national road system. Village road improvement
would give better access to the main roads. Thus, inputs required for
increasing productivity could more easily be brought into the areas and
any surpluses produced could more readily be marketed.
7.05    The benefits of the investigation of fisheries development in the
Hail Haor area would not be limited to this subproject area alone, since
fisheries are important for the entire northeast floodplain covering an



-41-
area of about 2 M acres in the districts of Sylhet and Mymensingh. A
further important benefit of the proposed fisheries component would be to
assist the development of the capability within the Department of
Fisheries to assess the effects of large scale modifications in the
fisheries environment and to identify options for development of fisheries
in the modified fisheries environment.
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
7.06    The following assumptions have been used in the economic analysis:
(a)  Benefits:  The benefit streams used in the economic analysis to
establish the basic rate of return to project investments are
derived from the direct increases in production made possible by
the flood control and drainage structures financed under the
project. They include only the increases in yields and area sown
to T. Aman and some T. Aus crops, and the increases due to gravity
irrigation made possible by construction works in SB, but do not
include any benefits from additional LLPs or STWs which are
expected to be established in areas protected by the embankments
but financed outside the project -- largely through the agricul-
tural credit system. Expected crop yields, acreage and production
are shown in Annex 1 Tables 3 to 5. Expected gross benefits are
summarized in Annex 1 Tables 21 to 23.
(b)  Prices:  For internationally traded goods (paddy, wheat, jute,
oilseeds, urea, TSP, MP), economic prices are based on the average
forecast world prices for 1982 to 1990 at the official exchange
rate, Tk 16.0 to US$ 1.0. Adjustments have been made for freight,
handling and processing, and quality differentials. Other costs
and benefits are adjusted by the standard conversion factor, 0.75,
to reflect the prevailing regime of import taxes and quotas.
Labor is valued at 68% of the financial wage rate to reflect the
prevailing degree of unemployment and underemployment and adjusted
by the standard conversion factor of 0.75. (Annex 1, Tables 18
and 19).
(c)  Investment and Operation and Maintenance Costs:  All investment
costs except price contingencies, cost of land acquisition and
taxes and duties are included in the economic analysis. Produc-
tion to be foregone on land required for project works has been
subtracted from project benefits. The main construction cost of
the civil works is for unskilled labor, which has been adjusted as
noted above. Other local cost elements in the civil works have
been adjusted by the standard conversion factor of 0.75. The
operation and maintenance costs during construction have been
included in the investment costs. Subsequent annual operation and
maintenance costs for project works and services, estimated (in



-42-
economic terms) at Tk 3.0 M for CB, Tk 4.2 M for SB and Tk 0.8 M
for HH, have been included separately in the analysis.
(d)  Phasing of the Benefits and Costs:  Construction would be over
five years for CB, four years for SB and over three years for H1.
It has been assumed that benefits would commence upon or near
completion of the flood control works of each subproject although
it is probable that some benefits would accrue earlier. Full
benefit from project works is projected only from the fifteenth
year after completion, to take into account the time to change to
new cropping patterns, crops, and production methods needed to
reach the maximum projected yields. Crop production costs and
production values have been calculated for a project lifetime of
30 years.
7.07    The economic rates of return based on these conservative assump-
tions are estimated at 25% for CB, 21% for SB, and 24% for HH. The figure
for the project as a whole is 23%. If the benefits from irrigation that
are made possible by project works, and for the establishment of which
programs are already in hand, are included, then the rates of return are
considerably higher.
7.08    Sensitivity tests indicate that the subprojects are mildly sensi-
tive to most variables, though more sensitive to benefit changes than
investment cost increases.

As indicated in Table 7.1, under all combinations of adverse circumstan-
ces, the subprojects maintain rates of return above the estimated oppor-
tunity cost of capital of 12%, except in the highly unlikely event that
project costs increase by 50% simultaneously with a 50% reduction in the
benefits. The main unknown adverse development in the project is the
potential reduction in fish production at Hail Haor. Although provisions
are proposed to offset the reduction of flood fishing, it should be noted
that the entire estimated value of present fish production in the area is
equivalent to about 10% of the net benefits of this subproject. A more
important risk faced would be a substantial delay in project implementa-
tion. However, the proposed subprojects are simple technically, the
implementation period allowed has been conservatively estimated and only
one agency is involved in implementation of the project works. Another
frequent risk to such projects in Bangladesh is that operation and main-
tenance provisions will be inadequate. Compliance with the program which
WDB is preparing should minimize the problems related to inadequate main-
tenance, but it will be advisable for both Government and IDA to pay
particular attention to this aspect of project implementation, as is being
done under the first Drainage and Flood Control Project. Given proper
maintenance, there is very little risk to the projects from excessive,
unanticipated flooding, since the duration and depth of flooding is well
known, varies relatively little from year to year, and the embankments
have been designed for 50/100 year flood frequencies.

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASSURANCES
8.01    During negotiations, a schedule of contracting for civil works
and draft bid documents for the first year's civil works were reviewed.
Tender documents for the construction equipment and vehicles are being
prepared and procurement would be completed by December 31, 1982 (para
4.12).  Draft Project Proforma were brought to negotiations (para 4.14).
8.02    The following assurances were obtained from the Government:
(a) that it would provide reasonable coverage of the subproject areas
with extension services (para 4.07);
(b) that it would provide adequate credit facilities to cover the
subproject areas (para 4.07);
(c) that design standards and construction specifications including
compaction for the embankments would be satisfactory to IDA (para
4.11);
(d) that no civil works contracts smaller than US$5,000 equivalent
would be let (para 4.15);
(e) that (i) detailed procedures for the operation of the project
revolving fund account would be as agreed by Government and IDA
(Annex 3); (ii) the project revolving fund account would be
opened by WDB; and (iii) GOB would employ an independent auditor
to audit annually the fund account expenditures and documentation
(para 4.20);
(f) that by June 30, 1982, GOB would establish a Project Coordinating
Committee for each of the three subprojects, with membership and
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para 5.06);
(g) that by July 31 of each year, IDA would receive, for review and
comment, work programs for the forthcoming construction year (para
5.07);
(h) that (i) at least three months before land was required, WDB would
deposit sufficient funds for such land with the appropriate
authority (para 5.08);
(i) that adequate and timely funds would be allocated annually for
operation and maintenance of the project and that project
facilities would be maintained in accordance with sound engineer-
ing practices (para 5.09);



-45-
(j) that before December 31, 1982 WDB would submit to IDA a detailed
program for inspection, maintenance and operation of the CB, SB
and HH embankments, that adequate and timely funds would be
provided annually for operation and maintenance of the project
and that project facilities would be maintained in accordance with
sound engineering practices (para 5.09);
(k) that WDB would establish and fill by March 31, 1982 the position
of Member, 0 & M, with associated staff arrangements (para 5.09);
and
(1)  that WDB would prepare and submit to IDA for concurrence, before
January 1, 1982, a detailed proposal for evaluating the project
impact (para 5.12).
8.03    Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) the Project Proforma had been approved by the Executive Committee
of the National Economic Council (para 4.14);
(b) the revolving fund had been established in a commercial bank (para
4.20); and
(c) WDB had deposited with the appropriate Deputy Commissioners the
funds required to acquire any additional lands required for the
first year's construction program (para 5.08).
8.04    With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of US$27.0 million on standard IDA terms. The
borrower would be the Government of Bangladesh.

DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL II PROJECT
PROPOSED FISHERY DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
Draft Terms of Reference for Preparatory Study
General
1.        The fisheries investigations and development programs relative
to the Drainage and Flood Control II Project are covered by the following
Terms of Reference (TOR) and are expected to be within the competence of
the Directorate of Fisheries (DOF) of the Bangladesh Government (GOB) and
such other agencies of GOB which may be called upon to furnish non-fisheries
specialist inputs (technical, sociological, economic, etc.). It is expected
that DOF would entrust the major responsibility for carrying out these
activities to the inland fisheries unit which was organized in 1976 for
the purpose of conducting fisheries related studies in the Chandpur, Muhuri
and Karnafuli irrigation and flood control areas.
2.        The studies shall consist of the following three parts:
i) an investigation of existing fisheries;
ii) an assessment of the effects of the proposed water control
structures on the fisheries in Hail Haor and other parts of the
project area; and
iii) a proposal for fisheries development in the project area.
It is expected that the unit should carry out these studies and have
prepared a final report of the studies and recommendations not later than
15 months from the time of the agreement to conduct the studies.
I. Investigations of Existing Fishery
3.        The investigations should include:
i) A thorough description of the existing water bodies in the
area, including the Hail Haor, principal tributary streams, and
the controlling features of the topography.
ii) A description of the important fish stocks of the area taking
into account the annual catch, the species, migratory patterns,
recruitment sources, sizes, etc. Emphasis should be placed on
those species which either occupy a significant part of the
catch, play a large role in the nutrition of the local
population, serve as major food sources for predator species,
or command a high unit price.



Terms of Reference                -74                           ANNEX 2
Page 2
iii) A description of the fishery (commercial and subsistence)
including the seasonal pattern of fishing, fish landing places,
leasing arrangement major gear types, etc.
iv) A description of the fishermen community, numbers of full-time
and part-time fishermen, ethnic characteristics, incomes from
fishing and other activities, and the main centers of habitation
of the fishermen communities.
v) A description of the fish marketing arrangements now practiced,
including price by month and species, methods of transportation,
and processing, if any.
II. Assessment of the Effects of the Proposed Water Control
Structures on the Fishery of the Project Area
4.        The assessments should include:
i) A projection of the physical changes in the water bodies within
the project area as these water areas relate to fisheries taking
into account seasonal fluctuations.
ii) An analysis of expected changes in the composition of fish
stocks in the area with respect to species, sizes, numbers,
seasonal variations, etc. as well as an analysis of the
,expected effects on reproductive behavior of the important
species affected.
iii)  Projections of anticipated changes in the fishermen population,
landing places, gear used, leasing arrangements, catch sharing, etc.
iv) Analysis of any other changes which may not have been anticipated
but which are expected to have beneficial or detrimental effects
on the fishery or fishermen communities.
III. Proposed Program for Fisheries Development
5.        Proposals relating specifically to the above investigations
and projections should include:
i) A description of the basic concept of the proposal and its
rationale.
ii) Detailed requirements for facilities and equipment.
iii) The nature, and scope of requirements for organization, and
implementation.
