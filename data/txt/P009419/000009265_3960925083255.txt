PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CON'YROL II PROJECT
(CREDIT 1184-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Drainage and
Flood Control Project in Baneladesh for which Credit 1184-BD in the amount of
SDR 24 million was approved on October 27, 1981. The credit was closed on
June 30, 1989, two years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on December 29, 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II). It
is aased on the findings of an FAO/CP mission which visited Bangladesh in May
19ijo, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrowe:
internal bank memo.anda, evaluation study reports prepared by local
consultants and discussions with staff of the Bank and the Borrower concerned
with the project. FAO/CP's report was reviewed by ASlAG and, apart from minor
corrections, remains as submitted. Subsequent comments by the Borrower on
Part III have been reflected in the report, where appropriate.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL II PROJECT
(CREDIT 1184-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The principal objective of the project was to promote an increase in
production of rice and other crc s by increasing (a) cropping intensities by
making more  land available  for double cropping during the monsoon season
following the controlling of seasonal floods and (b) crop yields through greater
use of crop inputs because of reduced risk of crop failure due to flood hazard
and through increased use of higher yielding varieties of paddy which would
perform well with reduced depth of floods.   The project,  which was to be
completed in about five years, was to comprise the protection from floods and
improved drainage for three areas totalling about 79,000 ha by constructing
embankments, drains, water control structures, roads and associated structures.
Implementation Experience
2.    Project implementation was somewhat slower than anticipated at appraisal
due to: (a) frequent changes to the agreed Project Proformas made by Government
of Bangladesh (GOB) without reference to IDA in order to reduce costs;
(b) shortage of funds for construction due in part to slow replenishment of the
project revolving fund; (c) delays in design of civil works due to shortage of
staff in the Bangladesh Water Development Board's (BWDB) central design office;
(d) slow land acquisition; and (e) inadequate preparation of one subproject,
which resulted in substantial changes. The eXceptionally severe floods in 1987
and 1988 caused extensive damage to project works which were only substantially
completed in 1990 using project funds, Food for Work Programme (FFW) and funds
from Flood Damage Rehabilitation Projects. There was no agricultural component
in the project, which suffered from the lack of coordination between BWDB and
Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), observed in other projects. Actual
disbursements amounted to SDR 23.96 million (US$27.9 million), out of a total
credit amount of SDR 24 million (US$27 million at time of appraisal). Costs of
the project as originally designed were less in USS and SDR terms than estimated
at appraisal due to devaluation of the Bangladesh taka and changes to one
subproject. As a result, it was possible for the Bank to increase the scope of
the project so that US$12.1 million was used for flood damage rehabilitation
(FDR) of embankments and water control structures throughout Bangladesh damaged
during the 1984, 1987 and 1988 floods and the May 1985 cyclone.   The crediL
closed on June 30, 1989 and the final disbursement was on December 29, 1989.



iv
3.    Project results are difficult to evaluate owing to inadequate data on
project benefits. The project achieved substantial reduction in flooding depth
on about 34,530 ha in two of the subproiect areas but had little effect on
flooding in the third subproject. Consequently, it has been estimated that there
would be an increase  in production of paddy of 30,700 tons per year and
6,000 tons per year of wheat at full development. This is considerably less than
estimated at appraisal (60,400 tons of paddy and 10,000 tons of wheat per year)
due to lower assumed incremental rice yields, loss of cultivable land for
construction of embankments which was underestimated at appraisal, a reduction
in the area of grain crops grown due to diversification to other crops and the
lack of benefits in the badly designed subproject.   By reducing the flooded
areas, the project reduced the area suitable for open water fisheries (while
increasing the area suitable for agricultural production) and natural stocking
of the remaining beel areas with fry during floods is now much restricted. It
has been estimated that the loss of fish production is about 960 tons per year.
Constr'tction and improvement of more than 500 km of roads and embankments have
improved road transport and more than compensated for obstructions to navigation
caused by the constructicn of embankments and water control structures.  The
project has improved the livelihood of some 110,000 farm families. The economic
rate of return for the Liroject has been reestimated  to be 7Z.   This  is
considerably lower than the 232 estimated at appraisal due to lower estimated
incremental production and delays in achieving benefits.
Sustainability
4.    The sustainability of benefit- generated by the project depends on the
project works being properly maintained and operated.   There is no adequate
provision of budget for maintenance works: what budget is provided is for staff,
office and vehicle operating costs; maintenance work is generally only financed
under FFW, FDR or other projects. There is no regular programme for carrying
ouc minor repairs, which, if effected early, could save rapid detericration and
much larger cost later. It is difficult to be confident that the flood control
works will be in adequate condition to withstand flitra flt,,ega And storms-  The
Bank is addressing this maintenance problem under the BWDB Systems Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 2099-BD).   Furthermore,  in the case of Chalan Beel, there are
indications that extensive construction of flood control embankments, by
restricting t:,e spread of flood water, results in higher flood levels in the
water courses thereby increasing the likelihood of embankments being overtopped.
Findings and Lessons
5. The project was less successful than estimated at appraisal due to one
subproject being poorly prepared, damage and delay in achieving benefits caused
by exceptionally severe floods in 1987 and 1988, and other implementation delays.
It is difficult to quantify the benefits of the project because monitoring and
evaluation of benefits are inadequate for the preparation of the PCR. GOB has
not complied with covenants of the Development Credit Agreement which required
it to undertake benchmark surveys and monitor the benefits being derived from
the project. The mission found that BWDB staff were mainly concerned with
construction and had little interest in estimating the extent of the benefits
the project generates. DAE staff were often unaware of the project's objectives
and did not directly monitor benefits.  The project was prepared without the



v
benefit of any overall regional plans and the effects of the subprojects on
upstream water levels and other aspects were given scant attention.  It has now
been realized that the combined effects of many such projects can be appreciable
and that regional studies are needed before their planning.
6.    Lesons  to be derived from the project are that project preparation
requires close scrutiny of feasibility studies, regional development plans are
necessary to estimate the overall effects of a number of subprojects, and it is
necessary to arrange finance for a project benefit monitorinb component in order
to obtain satisfactory data on project results. Beneficiaries should be involved
in project design to encourage an interest in the project which could later
become an involvement in maintenance and to avoid cutting of completed
embanki.ents by providing water control structures where needed.

B.    Background
1.    The project was initiated at the request of the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) to support the agricultural development efforts outlined under the Second
Five-Year Plan (FY81 to FY85,. The main objectives of the plan were to obtain
food self-sufficiency by the end of the plan period, to create employment for
the rural poor in order to improve incomes and nutritional standards and to
4inrea.e  e rt eanita         n4- T e  4re-     cf d z.-z_g  an.. fl:c-c

goals.
C.    Project Objectives and Description
2.    in line      G.^B'.s'to.  Sec^..d Fivc-vCar PlIan, U,e   1   siiAL6 l uljauLive
was to promote an increase in rice and other crop production by: (a) increasing
cropping intensities due to more land becoming ava.lable for double cropping
during the monsoon season by controlling seasonal floods; and (b) increasing crop
yields with greater use of crop inputs because of the reduced risk of crop
failure due to flood hazard and through the increased use of higher yielding
variaties of paddy, which was possible with better control of water levels.
3.    The project was to comprise the protection from floods and improved
drainage and communications for three areas by constructing embankments, drains,
water control structures, roads and associated structures. At Chalan Bee!
(Map 1), construction of about 134 km of embankment, drains and nine water
contirol sLrucLures and constructicn and improvement of about 145 km of roads
would improve an area of about 38,000 ha. At Satla Bagada (Map 2), construction



2
and improvement of about 121 km of embankment, drains and 459 water control
structures and construction of about 72 km of new roads would improve about
21,000 ha. At Hail Haor (Map 3), construction of about 13 km of embankment,
drains and a water control structure and improvement of about 64 km of roads
would improve a gross area of about 19,000 ha. A fisheries study, infrastructure
investments for fisheries development and investigations into the potential for
groundwater development were also proposed components for Hail Hoar.
D.    Project Design and Organization
4.    The project, which was similar in concept to the Drainage and Flood Control
Project (Credit 864-BD), was prepared by the Bangladesh Water Develop-ment Board
(BWDB), assisted by foreign consultants who prepared a feasibility report for
each sub-project. Two of these feasibility reports formed a good basis for
sub-project design but the third (for Hail Haor) was found during implementation
to be unsatisfactory and the sub-project was not successful. The project concept
was clear but in designing the project insufficient attention was given to the
involvement of the beneficiaries and other related agencies. The project was to
include only civil works. Although the SAR described extension services in the
project areas to be poor to non-existent, it was considered that other ongoing
and proposed Bank extension projects (such as Extension and Research Project,
Credit 729-BD) would adequately cope with the need for improved extension. A
covenant was included in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) requiring the
Borrower to ensure that adequate coverage of the project areas with extension
services would be maintained but this was not achieved. The project was prepared
without the benefit of any overall regional plans and the effects of the
sub-projects on water levels outside the protected areas were given scant
attention. It has now been realized that the combined effects of many such
projects can be appreciable and that regional studies are needed before planning
such sub-projects. Cost rec:.ery was considered to be neither appropriate nor
feasible for drainage and flood control projects.
5.    The project, other than the fisheries study, was to be implemented over
about five years 1 by BWDB: this arrangement was satisfactory. In order to ensure
that close contact would be maintained between BWDB and other agencies, such as
the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Bangladesh Rural Development
Board (BRDB) and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), a
Project Coordinating Committee was proposed for each sub-project but this Bas
never effective due to lack of incentive for other agencies to participate and
to BWDB's lack of interest in aspects other than construction.
L.    A Joint Project Revolving Fund with initial amounts of Tk2O million
(US$1 million) provided by IDA and Tk2 million provided by GOB was to be
established in a commercial bank and operated by BWDB to finance civil works
carried out by contract and local purchase of equipment and materials. This was
found to be good in principle but the amounts needed to be increased.
1     SAR, para 4.12, says that project implementation would take five years.
Implementation schedule shows 4.7 years. The DCA shows project completion
4.5 years, after credit signing.



3
E.    Project Implementation
7.    The credit was declared effective in July 1982, following GOB's approval
of the Project Proformas (PPs) for the three sub-projects. Project implementation
was delayed by: frequent changes to the agreed PPs made by GOB without rete.ence
to IDA in order to reduce costs; shortage of funds for construction due -1i part
to slow replenishment of the revolving fund; delays in design (even minor works
were designed in BWDB's central design office); slow land acquisition; and
changes to the project at Hail Hacr.
8.    Reassessment  of the  scope of the Hail Haor  sub-project  resulted  in
substantial changes. The water control regulator was found to be unnecessary and
was omitted, a submersible embankment was added to protect boro crops from early
flocding and emergency strengthening of the Manu River left embankment north of
Maulvi Bazar was included in the project. The need for these changes could have
been avoided with better project preparation. Due to these changes in scope and
reduced unit costs in US$ terms, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was
amended to permit the resulting saving in project funds to be used to finance
rehabilitation of water control structures damaged in the 1984, 1987 and 1988
floods and the May 1985 cyclone.
9.    The exceptionally severe 1987 and 1988 floods caused extensive damage to
project works, particularly at Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda, which have only
recently been substantially completed using a combination of project funds, FFW
and funds from the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Projects. In general the works
at Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda have been construc.ted in accordance with appraisal
proposals and to locally acceptable standards. If properly maintained, they
should be able to withstand floods up to design water level. At Chalan Beel there
is still a need for additional water control structures and improvements to the
drainage in the southeastern part of the sub-project area. At Satla Bagda there
is some drainage congestion to the south of Polder 2, which also requires
additional water control structures and improved drainage. BWDB consider that
once these additional structures are built there will be no need for farmers to
cut embankments to improve drainage flows to the river as hanpened extensively
following the 1987 and 1988 floods. At Hail Haor one bridge on the "main' road
on the uest of the sub-project area has been left unfinished for several years,
while a legal dispute between BWDB and the contractor drags throtgh the courts.
10.   The fisheries and groundwater studies at Hail Haor were carried out but
no fisheries infrastructure has ieen provided in the project area.
F.    Project Results
11.   Since neither the planned benchmark survey nor the planned monitoring
programme was carried out as required by the DCA, the project impact cannot be
properly evaluated. However, Evaluation Studies we,.e carried out by local
consultants in 1988/89 with a view to giving a basis for the preparation of a
PCR. Lack of records of annual flooding and crop production posed problems for
the consultants in making quantitative evaluations. The consultants point out
that there are serious weaknesses in the methodology adopted. The brief field
visits carried out by the PCR mission did not give sufficient information to
improve the data in the Evaluation Studies. In the absence of other data, the



4
cropped areas, yields and production given in the Evaluation Studies form the
basis of the PCR re-evaluation of the project but it is difficult to be confident
of the results, which should be considered as indicative only. They are
nevertheless discussed in some detail in order to give a qualitative indication
of the pLUJeiL beILVIA.L
12.   The project aimed to decrease the depth of flooding in the sub-project
areas and the evaluation studies estimate that in a year of normal flooding
considerable reduction has been achieved: about 24,600 ha at Chalan Beel and
about 9,900 ha at Satla Bagda. The project did not have much effect on flooding
at Hail Haor. Table 6A in Part III shows the extent of flooded area by different
inundation depths, as estimated in the SAR and in the Evaluation Studies. The
SAR did not relate the flooding depths shown to cropping patterns nor otherwise
explain their significance. Comparison between SAR and the Evaluaticn Reports,
confirmied by field visits, indicates that:
(a)   Pre-project flooding conditions are quite different, particularly
at Satla Bagda and Hail Haor. Satla Bagda had a deeper inundation
problem than the SAR estimated, whereas Hail Haor's flooding problem
appears to be less pronounced than the SAR estimated.
(b)   Post-project conditions are also different between the two reports.
Chalan Beel was expected to have about 14,000 ha with less than 30 cm
flood depth under the SAR estimate, whereas the Evaluation Study
estimate is much more (25,000 ha). Satla Bagda achievement is
difficult to com^-are since the SAR projection is not clear. Hail Haor
achievement is marginal.
13.   The project  re3ults  in an estimated  increase of production at full
development of 30,700 tons/year of paddy and 6,000 tons/year of wheat. This is
considerably less than estimated at appraisal (Part III) due to: the small
improvement at Hail Haor; the SAR did not account for all land lost for
construction of embankments; the area of non-grain crops has increased; and
incremental rice yields assumed in the Evaluation Reports are lower than assumed
in the SAR.
14.   At Chalan Beel,  the Evaluation Report states that before the project,
broadcast aman and aus were the dominant crops in the wet season. Local boro was
the main crop grown in the dry season in lower land. Aus and aman were damaged
by early flash floods and aman by high floods during the monsoon season. Dry
season crops were affected by periodic drought. Embankments constructed under
the sub-project have reduced losses to the aus and aman crops by preventing
floods e,1tering from the surrounding rivers. Inside the polder, some flooding
by rainfall would still occur as gravity drainage provided under the sub-project
depends on the water level of the surrounding rivers. The reductions in depth
and incidence of flooding have reduced the risk of crop failure. This has enabled
shifts from broadcast to transplanted aus and aman and also from local to high
yielding varieties. Drainage improvement has encouraged the farmers to transplant
boro and winter vegetables earlier, which in turn allows early transplanting of
HYV aus and aman. The project constructed many irrigation inlets which provide
a more reliable irrigation supply than unregulated khals and permit storage of
drainage water and return irrigation flows from inside the polder as well as the



5
controlled trapping of water from occasional floods outside the polder for use
for irrigation. The PCR mission noted that the average yield of the boro crop
in the west of the project area was slightly increased due to protection from
the occasional early flash flood from the Barind tract.
15.   Satla Bagda is reported to have similar benefits to Chalan Beel except that
the main dry season crop is aus rather than local boro and aman was not subject
to the early flash floods. The PCR mission noted that dry season crops were
previously subject to daily tidal flooding and cyclonic surges, which are now
controlled and can be used for irrigation. Water control structures also permit
irrigation by low-lift pumps of areas near khals using trapped runoff and return
irrigation flows, as well as the controlled trapping of water when the river
level outside the polder is high. The first appreciable benefits were in 1986
and 1987. The 1988 flood caused extenAve damage which was not repaired in time
for the 1989 flood. The first time the full area is expected to be protected is
1990.
16.   At Hail Haor, the only flood control work in the original project which
was constructed was the north flood embankment. This still has several openings
in it and does not provide reliable control of floods. The submersible embankment
which waa added to the project in the southeast of the sub-project area protects
about 750 ha of boro from early floods which would otherwise damage the crop
roughly every other year. BWDB proposed that improvements to the drainage would
be carried out under the FFW, but have found difficulty in recruiting labour for
this work because local wage rates are higher than the value of food given under
FFW. Project funds were also used for urgent repairs to the Manu left embankment
and hence contributed, along with funds from FDR, FFW and other sources, to the
flood protection of Maulvi Bazar, as well as the project area and the area to
the north of the north flood embankment. However, details of the other costs of
Manu embankment were not available to the PCR mission and the benefits from this
have not been estimated. Considerable benefits are derived from the main road
on the west of the project area (complete except for one bridge), the village
road and north embankment which also acts as a road. To a lesser extent the
submersible embankment also improves access. The benefits from improved
accessibility built up gradually from 1983/84 to 1989/90 and will reach full
development when the bridge on the main road is completed (assumed to be in
1991/92).
17.   The livelihood of some 110,000 farm families has improved and the average
farm income has improved (Part III, 6 D and Annex A). Construction and
improvement of over 500 km of roads and embankments have improved road transport
and more than compensated for the obstruction to navigation caused by the
construction of embankments and water control structures.
18.   By reducing the flooded areas at Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda, the project
reduced the area suitable for open water fisheries (while increasing the area
for agricultural production). Furthermore, the natural stocking with fry of the
remaining beel areas during floods is now much restricted. On the other hand,
it is now practicable to develop intensive fish rearing in the protected beels,
but to date, although studies   have been carried out, no action has been taken
on this

19.   Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been reestimated on the basis of
inadequate data (para 11) and the results (Part III, 6 C and Annex A) should be
treated with caution. The reestimated ERRs are lower than estinated at appraisal
due to much higher economic costs of construction, lower incremental production
and the delay in achieving benefits.
G.    Project Sustainaility
20.   The sustainability of benefits generated by the project depends on the
project works being properly maintained and operated. The responsibility for this
remains with BWDB but there is no adequate provision of budget for maintenance
works: what budget is provided is for staff, office and vehicle operating costs;
maintenance work is generally only financed under FFW, FDR or other projects.
There is no regular programme for carrying out minor repairs, which if effected
early could save rapid deterioration and much larger cost later. It is difficult
to be confident that the flood control works will be in adequate condition to
withstand future floods and storms. However, the Bank is addressing this problem
under the BWDB's Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2099-BD). Furthermore, in
the case of Chalan Beel polder D, there are indications that extensive
construction of flood control embankments, by restricting the spread of flood
water results in higher flood levels thereby increasing the likelihood of
embankments being overtopped. Nevertheless, the embankments were designed to
withstand the one in fifty years flood with 0.9 m of freeboard and the benefits
have been estimated on the assumption that the works will survive for the life
of the project (30 years).
H.    Bank Performance
21.   Appraisal relied on feasibility studies prepared by foreign consultants
which, in the case of Hail Haor, turned out to be unsatisfactory. Although the
DCA required the Borrower to monitor benefits and carry out a benchmark survey,
no finance was allowed for these operations which were therefore not carried out.
It was not clear from the SAR how flood protection would result in increased
agricultural production.
22.   Twelve missions, from Washington and the Resident Mission in Bangladesh
supervised the project between 1982 and 1989. Supervision missions were unable
to enforce conditions of the credit agreement concerning audit of accounts: only
when the bank took a stand and refused to extend the closing date until audit
reports were available, did auditing get up-to-date.
23.   The Bank adopted a flexible attitude to reallocation of funds between
disbursement categories and amended the DCA to allow for financing Evaluation
Studies and Flood Damage Rehabilitation.
24.   The main lessons learnt by the Bank and the Borrower are that project
preparation requires close scrutiny of feasibility studies, regional plans and
the involvement of beneficiaries and that it is preferable to arrange finance
for a benefit monitoring component in order to acnieve satisfactory data. More
water control structures are generally required than was considered necessary
at appraisal. The need to ensure adequate and timely funding of the revolving
fund to maintain uninterrupted progress of civil work construction is another



7
lesson from experience of the project. Further, up-to-date auditing can be
achieved if the Bank uses the means available to persuade GOB to comply.
I.    Borrower Performance
25.   Once the subprojects were identified, the Borrower relied on consultants
for detailed project preparation. More careful supervision might have improved
the preparation of Hail Haor. Project implementation was significantly delayed
by frequent changes to PPs, delays in design, slow land acquisition and shortage
of funds for construction caused in part by delay between IDA disbursement and
money being placed in the revolving fund. Nevertheless, the Borrower did
eventually substantially complete Chalan Beel and Satla Bagda subprojects after
overcoming considerable difficulties caused by unusually high floods in 1987 and
1988. The Borrower consistently failed to furnish to IDA on time audited
financial statements and audit reports. The Borrower did not undertake the
benchmark survey, nor the monitoring programme designed to assess the impact of
the project on agricultural development as required by the DCA. Once the Bank
agreed to finance the Evaluation Studies the Borrower arranged for these in 1987,
but the terms of reference did not require collection and presentation of annual
project specific data on agricultural production. 1
J.    Project Relationships
26.   Good relations were maintained between the Borrower and the Bank mainly
through frequent communication between BWDB and the staff of the Bank's Resident
Mission in Bangladesh. There were, nevertheless, lapses such as unilateral
changes to PPs (para 7).
27.   There was a serious lack of communication between BWDB and the agricultural
extension service and no effort was made to provide coverage of the project area
with extension services. The project cocLdination committees established to
ensure cooperation between BWDB and other agricultural agencies of the Borrower
were never effective (para 5).
K.    Consulting Services
28.   The project was prepared by BWDB assisted by foreign consultants financed
under the IDA Technical Assistance Credit 622-BD, who prepared a feasibility
report for each subproject. Changes to the feasibility report recommendations
introduced during appraisal included the omission of pumped drainage and
reduction in incremental yields and estimated ERRs. The feasibility study for
Hail Haor was subsequently found to be based on inadequate topographical survey
and hydrological data: this resulted in substantial changes to the project which
considerably reduced its benefits.
1     This was stated by the consultant who carried out the study.   The PCR
mission was unable to find a copy of the terms of reference in the Bank
files, but has been informed that they here prepared by the Bank in 1983
and only approved by BWDB in 1987.



8
29.   Local consultants were employed under the project for the evaluation
studies of the three subprojects conducted in 1988/89. The studies appear to have
been well conducted and in general the results are clearly presented. However,
they lack year by year recoras or fiooding, crop arLes aiiu yieiLib wiLiL uidikeb
it almost impossible to estimate accurately the agricultural impact of the
project. The economic analyses were unsatisfactory.
L.    Project Documentation and Data
30.   The Staff Appraisal Report generally provided a useful framework for the
Bank and Borrower during project implementation. However, there was no provision
in the legal agreements and appraisal report for financing agricultural extension
and benefit monitoring. Consequently, although covenants were included in the
DCA, requiring the Borrower to take action on both these, almost nothing was done
and the data on crop areas and yields are inadequate to estimate accurately the
benefits of the project.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 1/
A. Bank Performance
1.       The performance of tbe Bank during evaluation and implementation was
generally satisfactory. The observation of the Review mission from time to time
helped implementation on the project properly.
2.       The IDA mission and RM.B made a number of field trips to inspect the
works while in progress. They provided necessary advice and assistance as and
when required which helped improve the quality of works. Also, or. financial and
technical matters, the help and co-operation extended by the Bank is no less
important for the successful completion cf the project.
3.       The Bank introduced revolving fund system in order to ensure easy and
timely un-interrupted flow of fund for the implementation of the project
properly. But due to lengthy and cumbersome release procedure of revolving fund
now in force, the very purpose of revolving fund was defeated resulting in this
slow flow of fund to the field. From lessons learnt in the process of this slow
fund flow affecting the implementation of projects SAFE fund flow system has been
introduced instead of revolving fund, which is in operation in a number of
current credits.
B. Borrower Performance
4.       The overall performance of the borrower is quite satisfactory.  Almost
all the physical components of the project like embankments, water control
structures, roads, bridges and culverts are completed in accordance with their
respective designs and specifications. Yet there are some lapses noticed in the
field of construction of physical works for reasons beyond control.
5.       In Hail Haor sub-project construction of Gopla regulator was abandoned
as the technical and hydrological behavior of Hail Haor and Gopla river did not
support construction of the regulator.   Besides,  IDA mission in 1985 also
recommended for further studies. The project consultant MIS. NEDECO could not
identify this necessary in their Feasibility Report for Hail Haor sub-project.
In this sub-project also, construction of a bridge could not be completed and
had to be abandoned following on injunction by the Court.   Construction of
internal and submersible dyke and drainage channel proposed to be executed under
Food for Works Programme could not be done due to low wheat rate and cash wage
problem.
6.       There ere still some local drainage congestion in the Satla-Bagda sub-
1/  This is a summary of substantive comments from the Borrower.

project, after completion of the project.  This sort of problem is not uncommon
in newly completed drainage and flood control projects.  This difficulty should
be overcome gradually after study.  Additional drainage regulators might have
to be built and the drainage canals within the project might have to be re-
sectioned.
7.       For development of Agriculture and Fisheries under DFC-II Project a
study have been taken up under IDA assistance.  The necessity for re-excavation
of the drainage channels may be identified under that study.
8.       The problem of implementation that generally affects the completion of
the works is the system of selecting suitable contractors for the execution of
works.   Award of contracts of works on the basis of tender was hampered and
delayed due to administrative procedures. The project also hampered due to land
acquisition constraints.
9.       GOB fund allocation and timely release was  found to be  irregular
sometime and as such fund could not reach the field in time affecting utilisation
of RPA fund.
10.      During the process of implementation it is however learnt that better
organisational activities, timely receipt of land possession and release of fund
are required for timely completion of works.
C. Bank-Borrower Relations
11.      During the process of implementation of the project it is evident that
a warm and cordial relationship have been established between the Bank and the
Borrower. This has encouraged the Bank to come up with all the financial
assistance needed, advice and supervision in one hand and allowing the Borrower
to utilize the assistance for the betterment of the project on the other.

DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL II PROJECT
FINANCIAL REASSESSMENT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
General
The period of observation of farmers' response to the changed water regime
in the affected areas since the completion of works has been too short to provide
a basis on which to make reliable forecasts of changes in cropping pattern and
farming practices. The unreliability of the benefit forecasts is further
compromised by the lack of long-term flood height, timing and volume records for
the areas, which could provide a basis for predicting frequency of flood damage
reduction. Furthermore, in the absence of any project benefit monitoring, the
data on recent crop areas, production and yields are not derived from systematic
surveys but from secondary sources and very limited field observations.
The PCR used the post-project crop yields and cropping patterns estimated
for the normal flooding year by the Evaluation Study, which were also used for
their "Scenario I" analysis. The Study, however, made an additional analysis
(Scenario II) with higher crop yields and cropping intensities assuming that
further investment in irrigation would take place in the project area. The SAR
also made similar assumptions and provided additional cropping patterns with
irrigation development. However, the SAR did not carry out the analysis for this
as the irrigation development was considered to be an indirect effect of the
project. For the same Lea un, Lhe PCR did not take account ot tiis seconaary
effect on crop yield and cropping intensities, which would probably occur in the
future if the project is maintained adequately. Furthermore, the SAR assumed that
their projected yields would be attained 15 years after completion of the
project. This appears to be too cautious. Although the PCR mission is unable to
verify this, the level of crop yield targeted in the SAR would not require
suostantiai changes in present farming practices.
Neither the SAR nor the PCR have evaluated the effect of the project works
on areas outside the polders.
Financial Reassesment
The actual investment costs are shown in Tables 9.to 11. The total
investment costs are compared with the SAR as follows:

1/ Including physical and price contingencies in 1980 terms.
2/ In current terms but excluding FFW and FDR costs.
These costs have been obtained from the accounts of the respective circle
offices of the BWDB. However, the cost of equipment and vehicles for SB compared
with the physical quantities purchased by the project, appears to be
under-accounted.
Because of the continuing change in the exchange rates over the project
period, the annual investment costs have been converted to US dollars by the
average exchange rates in the respective periods. The period average exchange
rates are shown in Table 9. The totals are compared with the SAR estimates in
Part III, 5A.
The per ha financial benefit at farm level, in accordance with the SAR,
is based on the average per ha gross value of output less per ha production
costs, both valued at financial prices. The results are summarized in the
following table.

Economic Re-evaluation
Economic re-evaluation is at spring 1990 constant prices. Import prices
for rice, wheat and some inputs have been derived from World Bank price
projections, dated January 1990, using the average of the forecasts for 1990 and
1995. Export prices for jute and urea are based on information from the
Bangladesh Jute Corporation and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, world
price trends and estimated average costs to destination. Derivations to farmgate
level are shown in Table 7.
The prices of non-traded commodities have been adjusted by the Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.8. The costs of farm labour and irrigation have been
adjusted by the respective Conversion Factors (CF) of 0.75 and 0.85. A list of
financial and economic prices used in the analysis is given in Table 8.
The economic costs of investment include the value of wheat distributed
under the Food for Work (FFW) programme for work carried out on the project after
1981 at an economic price of Tk8,000/ton and costs incurred under the Flood
Damage Rehabilitation Projects (FDR). (See Tables 10 to 12).
To obtain economic costs, the financial costs of investment have been
adjusted as follows:

Page 4
(a)   Taxes and duties have been deducted from the costs in the same
proportions as assumed in the SAR.
(b)   The cost to BWDB of la-id acquisition has been omitted.
(c)   The local costs have been adjusted by the SCF 0.80. In the absentce
of any information on this from the BWDB accounts, the proportion
of local costs in the actual costs has been assumed to be the same
as in the SAR.
This results in the following factors by which financial costs must be
multiplied to convert to economic costs.
CB             SB            HH
Civil Works                               0.77           0.79          0.74
Equipment and Vehicles                    0.54           0.53          0.62
Engineering and Administration            0.77           0.77          0.77
The series obtained from the above adjustments has been brought to 1990
prices level by adjusting the annual figures in Taka by the respective GDP
deflators for Bangladesh, as shown in Table 9.
Net project incremental agricultural benefits have been obtained using the
cropping patterns, yield, input and price assumptions shown in Tables 1 to 6,
valued at economic prices. The assumed phasing of incremental agricultural costs
and benefits is as follows:
1985/86 1986/87 1987/88 1988/89 1989/90 1990/91

The re-evaluation assumes a project life of 30 years and that the project
works will be fully maintained.
The benefits of improved accessibility due to roads and embankments in the
Hail Haor sub-project are estimated at 3Z of the marketable surplus in 1990 when
36 km of road and embankment were completed. The benefits in the other years are
ir proportion to the length of roads and embankments operating in those years.
The length of road and the assumed benefits are as follows:

The loss of fish production has been deducted from the project benefits.
Based on information in the Evaluation Studies, the loss of fish has been assumed
at 37 kg/ha/year. This, valued at a net economic price of Tk2O/kg, has been
deducted from the full development net benefit stream. The estimated loss is as
follows:

The economic cost and benefit streams are shown in Table 13. The re-
estimated economic rates of return for CB,  SB and HH are 11?, OZ and 8Z
The ERR for the whole project is 7Z. The ERR is lower than that estimated
in the SAR because: (a) the assumed farm incremental benefits are lower than
those in the SAR; (b) the economic investment costs are significantly higher than
those in the SAR as shown below:.
