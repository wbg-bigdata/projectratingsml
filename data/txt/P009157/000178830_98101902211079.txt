INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
LIVNICA ZELJEZA I TEMPERA - KIKINDA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUCOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed loan
to Livnica Zeljeza i Tempera - Kikinda (the Kikinda Iron Foundry), with the
guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent
of US$14.5 million to help finance an iron foundry project. The loan would
have a term of 14 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum. The Government of the Socialist Autonomous Province of
Vojvodina, which would provide a prior guarantee required under l'ugoslav law,
would charge a guarantee fee of 1-3/4 percent per annum on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to the enterprise to
9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An econcmic mission visited Yugoslavia in October/November 1972, and
a basic report on the economy of Yugoslavia is under preparation. A report
entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Yugoslavia" (R72-141) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on June 7, 1972. Basic data on the
economy of Yugoslavia are given in Annex I.
3.        Yugoslavia has had rapid growth and rising living standards during
the last decade, with total GDP at constant prices having increased at about
5-1/2 percent per year and per capita GDP at over 4-1/2 percent per year.
Economic growth has proceeded in an environment of major institutional and
organizational changes, characterized by the decentralizing of economic man-
agement, the creation of a market economy, and the opening up of the economy
to international trade, with the objective of increasing economic efficiency
and improving the allocation of resources.
4.        The population growth rate averaged 1.0 percent per year in the
last ten years; the rate in the less-developed Republics was 1.6 percent com-
pared to 0.7 percent in the developed Republics. There is little open unem-
ployment. There is, however, some evidence of growing regional and occupa-
tional imbalances in labor demand and supply. This results from the low
mobility between labor surplus less-developed regions and labor-scarce de-
veloped regions, and a discrepancy between the skills needed in a fast-changing
economy and those supplied by the present education system.
5.        Economic growth in the less-developed regions has been at about the
same rate as that of the more developed, but their per capita income has in-
creased more slowly because of faster population growth. Consequently, re-
gional inequalities have widened. Yugoslavia has had an active regional



- 2 -
development policy for more than two decades. The policy aims at reducing
regioiial inequality by achieving a growth rate above the national average in
the less-developed regions, financed by a transfer of resources mainly through
the Fund for the Accelerated Development of Underdeveloped Regions. In addi-
tion, Federal budgetary grants are provided to the less-developed regions for
current expenditure for social purposes such as health and education.
Recent Developments
6.        Economic development since 1968 has been characterized by a rel-
atively rapid increase in exports and production (averaging 12 and 7 percent
per year respectively during 1969-1972), the emergence of serious inflationary
pressures and substantial balance of payments deficits (averaging $220 million
during 1968-71).
7.        To counter the rising inflationary pressures and improve the ex-
ternal payments position, the Government since 1969 has adopted measures airfLed
at restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditures, strengthening
price controls and developing an incomes policy.    In addition, it has adopted
a policy of frequent exchange rate adjustments in order to neutralize the
effect of inflationary pressure on the balance of payments.    After a period
of unchanged rates, following a major devaluation in 1965, the dinar was
devalued by 16.6 percent in January 1971.    In the course of the international
currency realignment in December 1971, Yugoslavia devalued again by 18,8 per-
cent against gold and by 11.8 percent against the dollar.    Following the more
recent devaluation of the dollar, Yugoslavia adjusted the gold parity of the
dinar to maintain its parity with the dollar until mid-July 1973.    Since then
the dinar has been floating vis-a-vis the US dollar along with other European
currencies.
8.        Largely as a result of the policy measures undertaken since 1969,
export growth picked up, import growth declined, and the investment boom slowed
down.  In 1972, exports of goods increased by 20 percent anid imports bV about
5 percent and the trade deficit was $1.1 billion dollars compared to $1.4 bi>
lion in 1971. Workers' remittances increased by 25 percent to $780 million in
1972.  Consequently, the current account showed a surplus of about $190 million
compared to a deficit of about $320 million in 1971.    Foreign exchange reserves,
which were equivalent to about one months' imports in 1970 and 1971, have in-
creased and, at the end of 1972, were equivalent to nearly three months' mer-
charLdise imports. There has been some slowdowrn in the rate of price inflation
in 1972. The cost of living index increased by about 11 percent during the
year compared to 17 percent during 19751.   owever, diespite serious efforts to
contain inflationary pressures, price increases accelerated in 1973.
Prospects
9.        Real GDP is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 1973 (about the
same rate as the average for 1971 and 1972) reflecting Government policies
to control the expansion of investment and consumption.    The reduction of
excess aggregate demand together with the recent devailuations and continued
economic growti-h in its main trading partners is expected to lead to export



- 3 -
growth of about 12 percent this year. Reduction of tariffs in mid-1972 and
a major import liberalization program effective since January 1973 are likely
to encourage import growth of about 12 percent. Even with this anticipated
increase in import growth the balance of payments is expected to show a sur-
plus. Inflationary pressures are to be reduced by a continuation of price
controls and restrictive demand management.
10.       The 1971-1975 Social Development Plan, adopted in June 1972, aims
at an overall growth rate of 7.5 percent per year with gross investments grow-
ing at the same rate as production, and private consumption and government
expenditure somewhat slower. The Plan stresses the importance of achieving
domestic stabilization, improving resource allocation and increasing produc-
tive efficiency to attain these targets. Domestic savings rates are expected
to be maintained at the present level of around 22-24 percent of GDP, and
would finance about 80 percent of gross investment. The bulk of the pro-
jected external resource gap would be covered largely from rising workers'
remittances from abroad. Exports are projected to grow at about 11-13 per-
cent per year and imports at about 9-11 percent annually. Agricultural pro-
duction is expected to grow at an average rate of 3.2 percent per yeer com-
pared with 2.2 percent annually during 1965-70. Industrial production is
projected to grow at an average rate of 8 percent and industrial exports at
about 12 percent per annum compared with 6 percent and 10 percent respectively
during 1965-1970. Present indications are that, with both total exports and
imports running at higher than Plan projected rates, and the current account
in surplus during 1973, the Plan targets are reasonable.
11.       The prospects for continued economic growth in the medium-term are
good. The endowment of natural and human resources, the pragmatic approach
to economic problems, the readiness to consider and undertake necessary in-
stitutional changes, and the strong commitment to an open, market-oriented
economy, gives ground for a favorable assessment of future prospects.
External Assistance
12.       Gross capital inflows have more than doubled in the last five years
reaching US$860 million in 1971, and an estimated US$930 million in 1972.
Most of these funds are medium-term commercial credits, reflecting the limited
assistance coming from governments, and the liberalization of foreign trade
and borrowing regulations following the 1965 Economic Reform. The inflow
of bilateral and suppliers' credits has been largely from the United States,
Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. IBRD loans have been
the main source of long-term capital since 1968. Yugoslavia has, so far,
not been able to place public bond issues on the world capital markets. How-
ever, three private placements (medium-term) totaling US$115 million have
been made in 1972 in the U.S., and other possibilities for raising long-
term funds are being explored. In October 1972, an agreement was reached
with the USSR for credits equivalent to a total of 540 million clearing
account dollars for financing the energy, ferrous and non-ferrous metal,
cement and shipbuilding industries.



- 4 -
13.       The Government has tried to encourage private foreign investment
througOt special legislation in 1967, and by April 1973, 79 joint venture
agreements had been signed b;etween local and foreign enterprises, involving
a total investment of about US$110 million.   The conditions for foreign
partners in joint ventures withl Yugoslav enterprises have recently been
rurther improved in an effort to encourage a more rapid flow of foreign
investmeCut.
E;xterual Debt Mlana3gement
14.       Thle pattern of capital inflow since the ririd-1960's nas led to a
deterioration in the inaturity structure of external debt.   The Government,
being aware of the dangers irk the uoregulated growth of external debt, has
embarked on .an active debt management policy.  Since mid-1971, all foreign
credits hiave to be registered with the National B.ank to ensure that contracted
credits reimain within the ceilings determined by the Federal Government and
the National Bank, and that the terms of borrowing -are appropriate to the
transaction anLd to tue general economic situation.   In connection withi the
Standby Ag,reemenl with the I_MF signed in July 1971, the Government decided
to limijt outstandling short-terra credits to the 1970 level, ard maediumi- and
long-term  loans incurred or guaranteeci by the banks to US$900 million, and
has been borrowing within these limits since tn       Ii. 1i April 1972, a new
system for regulating external borrowing was adopted which operates by in-
fluencing the cost of external borrowing through varying dinar deposit re-
quireiments according to tihe terms and purpose of the credit.  Mloreover, the
National L,ank has been given authority to veto any credit arrangement.   The
Goverrmtenit has also e-mbarked on a stabilization prograi that includes re-
scheduling or refinancing existing debts.   The United States agreed to re-
schedule US$58.5 millicn of debt paynents falling due in 1971 and 1972.     Italy,
Germanv, France., Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to extend financial
credits totalling US$277 million during 1972-1975 (Germany $142 million, Italy
$75 m-iilion, Japan $30 million, France $20 million, Belgium $5 -million, Nether-
lands $5 million) on terms which will not, however, affect the structure of
Yugoslav debt.. The Government hopes to secure another $180 million from,
Western European countries during 1973-75.
15.       Total external public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as
of December 31, 1972 was US$1,730 million.    In addition, there was USS1,820
million non-guaranteed external debt outstanding on that date.    Total debt
service payments in 1972 are estimated at about US$796 rmillion, mostly in
convertible currencies, and representedi 2(0 percent of the country's foreign
exchange earnings. Thte pcrcentage increases to 24 oercent if the debts and
earninrs in norn-conivertible currencies are excluded.  The debt service ratio
is expected to remain at about the 1972 level during the next five years.
Taking into accouint Yugoslavia's debt service record and the new measures
for imiproved external debt managemrent, the prospective growth of production
and exports and the expected increase of foreign exchange earnings from tour-
ism and workers' remittances, Yugoslavia is creditworthy for substantial Bank
lending.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
16.       The Bank has made 23 loans to Yugoslavia totalling about US$750 mil-
lion, equivalent. The proposed loan would be the first direct loan for indus-
try in Yugoslavia. Of the previous loans for industry (four loans totalling
US$46.9 million), three have been channelled through the Yugoslav Investment
Bank and one through the Yugoslav Government.   Bank lending, however, has been
concentrated in infrastructure projects such as transportation (five highway
loans totalling US$150 million, three railway loans totalling US$155 million,
and one gas pipeline loan of $59.4 million), power (three loans totalling
US$135 million), telecommunications (US$40 million) and three multipurpose
projects (totalling US$103 million). Loans have also been made to tourism
(two loans totalling US$30 million) and for an agricultural industries proj-
ect (US$31 million). IFC has made six investments totalling about US$56 miL-
lion in Yugoslavia. Its most recent participation, $13.7 millior in the
Belisce/Bell joint venture for manufacturing pulp and paper, was approved by
the Executive Directors in January 1973.
17.       There have been delays in the execution of many projects, partic-
ularly the Railway Modernization Program of FY65 (Loan 395-YU), the Belgrade-
Bar Railway Project of FY68 (Loan 531-YU) and the Babin Kuk Tourism Project
of FY71 (Loan 782-YU). Part of the reason for the delays stems from the
cnangeover to decentralized political and economic management in Yugoslavia;
the problems are exacerbated by financial and technical difficulties, cost
overruns and the lack of domestic financing.   The Bank has maintained and
increased its efforts to deal with these problems, especially in providing
assistance to review the situation of the railways and in increasing the
number of supervision and other missions; the situation is improving. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
September 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
18.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are (a) to ac-
celerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b) to
promote structural reforms in major sectors of the economy through improved
coordination, the strengthening of institutions and technical assistance,
(c) to help provide Yugoslavia witlh long-term external canital and thus help
redress the excessively short-term character of Yugoslavia's external borrow-
ings; and (d) to help alleviate Yugoslavia's shortage of foreign exchange by
financing export-oriented projects. These objectives are basically the same
as those which guided lending in previous years, but efforts to give special
support to the less-developed regions are being strengthened, and a continu-
ing high level of technical assistance will be provided in appropriate cases.
19.       To achieve these objectives, loans to further support railway mod-
ernization, a tourism project in Jaz (Montenegro), expansion of the port fa-
cilities of Bar, river regulation, urban pollution control, roads and high-
ways, and a water and sewerage project (tourism infrastructure) in Dubrovnik
are envisaged during the next two years. Also planned for this period are an
industrial line of credit to assist small- and medium-size industrial enter-
prises, and two or three direct loans for specific industrial projects that



are of vital importance to the country but which are unsuitable for IFC par-
ticipation and for which private foreign financing on reasonable terms is
not available.  IFC is currently investigating several new investment oppor-
tunities to encourage joint ventures which will provide, apart from iong-term
capital, technical, management and marketing expertise.
20.       In addition to help with the preparation of projects for Bank fi-
nancing, the Bank's recent technical assistance to Yugoslavia has incluided
reviews of the power, tourism and transportation sectors.   Other current Bank
activities include assistance to a project appraisal training institution and
training some of its teachers; assistance with a study of the Yugoslav capital
market which should help improve resource mobilization and allocation; and
help in establishing a training program for auditors in Yugoslavia's Social
Accountin- Service, which audits several Bank-financed projects.
21.       Bank commitmnents to Yugoslavia have averaged close to US$100 million
annually in the last three years.  Although this represents only a relatively
small proportion of the country's need for external finance, it is equivalent
to about two-thirds of the annual long-term official capital inflow in con-
vertible currencies.  The outstanding debt to the Bank could rise from the
level of 12 percent of Yugoslavia's total external debt in 1972, to 19 per-
cenit by 1978. Service onl Bank loans as a proportion of total debt service
would increase from 4 percent to 7 percent during the same period.
PA{T Ill - TrL INEDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN YUGOSLAVIIA
22).      The mair objective of Yugoslavia's development strategy during the
past two *iecades has been the transformation of a predominantly primary pro-
ducing economyv in,o a highly industrialized economy.  Rapid industrialization,
modernization and integ.,ration of the economy with the world market hiave been
emphaasized.  inrdustrial. development policy has included both import substitu-'
tion and export promotion with the emphasis varying according to branches andc
their stage of development.  In the first postwar decade priority was given
to investments in heavy industries and power generation. In the late 195O's
the strategy changed to thle st-imulation of manufacturing industries.  Sincc
the denendenc:y of the economy on imports, particularly of raw materials and
investment goods, increased significantly, thie policy followed in the current
Five-Year Social Development Plan (1971-1975) emphasizes tihe reed to accelerate
tiie development of domestic resource-based industries, both for export and for
lomestic manufacturing intdustries.
'3.       IncdtLstry has played a key role in Yugoslavia's economic ,rowth.  It
accounts for about one-thircd of CDP, one-half of economic investments and
I3 percent oi' social sector 1/ employment.  Industrial output rose at about 9
percent annually in real terns over the last decade: industrial exports grew
at about 14 percent annualily and accounted in 1971 for 8, percent of total
merchandise exports.  As a result of its diversified production and export
1/   The sociq1 sector covers all enterprises save for small, private concerns
in agricult;ure an! the retail trade.



- 7 -
structure and persistent efforts to increase efficiency in industry,
Yugoslavia has become more competitive in the world markets, particularly
in the highly competitive lWestern markets. The industrial sector has con-
cluded a number of cooperation and joint venture agreements with foreign
partners.
24.       Despite a long period of rapid growth, the development of the in-
dustrial sector has suffered from a number of problems including deficiencies
in countrywide coordination of investment planning, lack of mobility of both
labor and capital, distortions in the allocation of resources, and increasing
dependence of the industrial sector on raw materials and investment goods im-
ports. Growing foreign debt service payments of industrial enterprises due
to heavy short- and medium-term borrowing on relatively hard terms over the
last five years, have increased the need for long-term external finance.
25.       The Bank's lending to industry is directed at supporting the Govern-
ment in its efforts to improve the allocation of resources, reduce import
dependency and strengthen the export capacity of the industrial sector. It
also will help to improve the structure and terms of the industrial sector's
external borrowing. The proposed project is in line with these objectives.
26.       In the Social Development Plan for 1971-1975, industrial output is
expected to grow at 8 percent per annum with the production of ferrous and
non-ferrous metals increasing at 10 to 12 percent and metal manufacturing
industries growing at 8 percent per annum. Special emphasis is given to
thie development of domestic raw material and semi-manufacturing production,
to reduce the import dependency of the industrial sector. Steel and steel
products are expected to grow at around 15 percent per year to meet 70 per-
cent of the estimated domestic demand by 1975.
27.       Rapid develooment is foreseen, particularly for sub-sectors such
as a-ricultural machinery, motor vehicles, machine tools, electrical and non-
electrical equipment, rail wagons, construction and shipbuilding industries
which are expected to register annual average growth rates ranging from 9 to
19 percent.  As these industries are major consumers of iron castings, the
domestic demand for these castings is likely to increase from 375,000 tons in
1973 to about 609,000 tons in 1977. Adding to this the expected export demand,
and taking into account the presently conceived expansion plans, including the
proposed project, and projected imports, which consist mainly of itenms that are
not domestically produced, Yugoslavia is expected to have a shortage of about
109,000 tons in 1977. Even if no castings were exported the expected demand
would exceed the supply by 9,000 tons in 1977.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       Following an industrial projects identification mission in April
1971 , the Covernment in May 1972 subrmitted eight industrial projects to the
T.ank for financing, including the expansion of Liviica Zelieza i Tempera -
Kikinda (Kikinda)   A Bank mission in ])eccinber 1972 assisted in the preparation



- 8 -
of the project, whlich was apnraised during April/May 1973.  Negotiations were
held during, September 1973 in Washington.  The Yugoslav delegation was led
by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary for Finance, and included
representatives of the Federal Government, the Government of the Socialist
Autonomous Province of Vujvodina, Jugobanka and Kikinda (the Borrower).
29.       The propcsed loan would be the first direct Bank loan for ar. indus-
trial project in Yugoslavia.  IFC, which gives priority to joint ventures be-
tween Yugoslav and foreign eriterprises that provide, apart from long-term
capital, technology, management and marketing expertise, does not regard the
pruject as suitable for its financing, since Kikinda neiLher needs nor wants
foreign participation to provide technology or market outlets. Kikinda's
efforts to obtain external f'inance on reasonable terms from other foreign,
sources before approaching the Bank were not successful.
Thle Borrower
30.       The Kikinda Iron Foundry is an autonomcus, self-managed, socially-
owned enterprise located at Kikinda, a town aDout 130 km north of Belgrade
in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. It is one of the mnajor
castings producers and the sole producer of grinding machines in Yugoslavia.
Kikinda started operations in 1908 with a brick factory and has since added
various new production lines and undlertaken a series of expansion programs,
raising its annual production capacity to the following current levels:
malleable castings, 11,500 tons; nodular castiags, 4,500 tons; gray castings,
900 tons; finishedl pipe fittings, 4,000 ,ons; ancd machine tools, 350 units.
The plants are well-o-perated and maintained.
31.       Kikindn's organization follows the general Yugusiav concept of de-
centralized economic decision-making, autonormy Of the enterprise and workers'
self-managemant of social property.  The policy-making 'Dody for each etnter-
prise 4zs a Workers' Council which is elected by the personnel of the enter-
prise; the Cuuncil appoints the Gcrneral Manager and the 1,xecutive Board con-

This expansion prograrn is nearing completion as scheduled.

Project Description
33.       The proposed project is of key significance for Yugoslavia's indus-
trial development as outlined in the Social Development Plan of Yugoslavia for
1971-1975. It is also in line with the Social Development Plan 1971-75 of
Vojvodina. Both the Federal Government and the Government of Vojvodina are
giving high priority to this project.
34.       A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.    The Appraisal
Report entitled "Appraisal of Kikinda Iron Foundry Expansion Project", No.
218a-YU, dated October, 1973 is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. The project would include:
(a) expansion (from 11,500 to about 21,000 TPY) and modernization
of the malleable foundry;
(b)  expansion of the gray and nodular foundry (from 8,400 to about
18,000 TPY);
(c) expansion (from 4,000 to about 6,400 TPY) and modernization of
the fitting finishing shop;
(d) expansion (from 350 to about 460 units annually) and moderniza-
tion of the machine tool plant, including the introduction of
new production lines for precision and internal grinding
machines;
(e)  a streamlined storage and materials handling system;
(f) expansion and modernization of the existing utility
installations;
(g) construction of a connection with the railroad system; and
(h) installation of equipment for dust and fume extraction.
35.       The proposed facilities were chosen to increase and modernize the
capacitv of the existing plants and further improve product quality and pro-
ductivity. The project would be implemented during 1973 to 1977 without sig-
nificantly interfering with production in the existing facilities.
Project Execution
36.       After implementing several expansion programs, the personnel of
Kikinda is well experienced to carry out the project. Kikinda has agreed to
assign to it qualified full-time staff, under the leadership of an experienced
foundry expert, for the implementation of the project. The arrangements would
be adequate to insure proper project execution.



- 10 -
37.       The enterprise appointed an experienced firm of engineering consul-
tants in September 1973 to assist in the preparation of specifications for inter-
national competitive bidding and evaluation of tenders. Civil construction and
erection of equipment would bDe carried out by Yugoslav contractors, while
Kikinda's own construction department would be responsible for additions and
alterations to the existing facilities. Equipment suppliers would provide
assistance in erection and start-up and a performance guarantee.
Project Cost
38.       The total cost of the project, including start-txp costs and incre-
mental working capital but excluding duties and taxes of US$3.0 million, equiv-
alent would be US$32.1 miliion, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.7
million, (about 49 percent of the project cost excluding duties and taxes).
The proposed Bank loan would cover 92 percent of the foreign exchange ^ost.
Interest during construction would amount to USs:3 million.   (See also para.
39).  Equipment cost estimates are derived from quotations received in the
first quarter of 1973 from suppliers in six western countries. The prevail-
ing import duties and taxes of about 27 percent on the c.i.f. value of for-
eign equipment (Yugoslav border) have been added.    Pre-operating and start-up
expenses are based on Kikinda 's previous experience. Civil engineering and
construction costs are based on quotations received by the Com-Dany in early
1973.  Physical contingencies equivalent to 10 percent of equipment and civil
works cost estimates would be adequate.    T'he price contingency provision is
based on the assumptions of a 6 percent per annumn annual in2crease for foreign
exchange costs and annual increases for locai costs of 10, 8, 6 and 6 percent
in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976, respectively.   Increuiental working cap:Ltal re-
quirements due to the project would be US$6.6 million, of which about $0.7
million equiv-alent would be needed in foreign exchange.
Financing
39.       The proposed Bank loan of US$14.5 millioni, would finance the entire
foreign exchange costs of equipipment: and snare parts.  Irthe remainiing financind-
required of US$23.6 million, includingé incremental wo-rkini-i capital and int&:ms;
during construction, would be met fronm internal cash generation.   Should actual
financing requirements in domestic or foreign currencies at any time exceec
the internal cashi generation, Kikinda would finance them with credits from
Jugobanka - Novi Sad. An agree,ment between Kikinda and Jugobanrka - Novi Sad
to this end wculd be. concluded.
Cost of Loan
40.       A fee of 1-3/4 percent to accrue to the Socialist Autonomnous Province
of Vojvodiina would be charged for guaranteeing 'I./ the Bank loan.  Thus the
1/   Under Yugoslav law withn respect to Zank loans to enterprises, the Federal
Covernment, whlich wo'ud bc the guarantor of thwe proposed Bank loan, is
required to obtain a prior guarantee frorm the Government of the Republic
or Autonomous Province concerned, in this case Vojvodina.    The enterprise
is also required to obtain a guarantie from a local bank, in this case
Jugobanka - Novi Sad.



effective cost of the Bank loan to Kikinda would be increased by 1-3/4 percent
above the Bankrs interest rate to a total of 9 percent.
Financial Position
41.       Kikinda has a sound financial position that provides a good basis
for expansion. Kikinda's estimated net income of Din. 62 million in 1973 is
expected to increase by about Din. 75 million, or about 120 percent between
1973 and 1977; net sales are projected to increase by Din. 415 million, or
by about 139 percent during the same period. Net income increases less ra-
pidly than net sales because higher inflation rates are assumed for production
cost inputs than for sales, proportion of which would be exports.    Since a
major portion of the project cost would be financed from the enterprise's
internal cash generation, its debt service burden would remain low. Kikinda's
liquidity position is satisfactory and is expected to improve during project
implementation.   The ratio of current assets to current liabilities is ex-
pected to increase from 2.3 in 1972 to 2.6 in 1977 and remain at that level
thereafter.
42.       The project would have an incremental financial rate of return in
current prices of about 23 percent compared to the financial return on
Kikinda's existing operations of 8.4 percent. In order to maintain a sound
financial position, Kikinda has agreed that, without the prior consent of
the Bank, it would not:
(a)  until the completion of the project, undertake new investments
or incur new debts in excess of Din. 20 million, equivalent,
in any one year, other than for the project; and
(b)  following the completion of the project, distribute net income
and/or make other cash outlays other than for normal operations
if the current ratio were to fall below 2:1 after such profits
distribution and/or cash outlay.
Following the completion of the project, Kikinda would consult the Bank prior
to incurring new financial obligations or undertaking new investments in ex-
cess of Din. 20 million, equivalent.
Markets
43.       Markets for Kikinda's products appear well assured and the enter-
prise has established a good name for high quality, both at home and abroad.
The development of the domestic market is directly linked to the expected
expansion of industries in Yugoslavia such as agricultural machinery, elec-
trical equipment, building construction, commercial vehicles and automobiles,
machine tools, consumer durables, rail wagons and shipbuilding. Their rapid
growth is dependent on the availability of castings and machine tools which,
if domestic output is not expanded, would hiave to be imported under tight



- 12 -
world supply conditions, especially for castings.   Kikinda has also estab-
lished a strong and competitive position in foreign markets. In 1972, nearly
35 percent of the sales revenue of US$19.1 million, equivalent, came from ex-
ports, more than half of which was to convertible currency areas. By 1977,
when the project is expected to be fully operational, exports are expected to
account for more than half of total revenue estimated at US$46 million, about
three quarters of total exports would be to convertible currency areas. Kikinda
has already secured most of its projected exports through long-term sales con-
tracts with a few foreign companies, and is negotiating with others for similar
contracts.  Concernina the availability of inputs, Kikinda appears to be well
assured of its domestic raw material and import reciuirements.
Procurement
44.       The equipment and spares to be financed by the proposed Loan would
be divided into 21 packages and would be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines.  Equipment packages costing over US$100,000, equivalent, eacn (15
packages) would be procured by international compet:itive bidding, while t:he
remaining 6 packages costing less than US$100,000, each (totalling less tharn
6 percent of total foreign equipment costs) would be obtained through a pro-
cedure under which the borrcoer may award contracts after having received at:
least four comparable bids from qualified suppliers in at least three eligi-
ble countries. Since it is not expected that Yugoslav manufacturers would
bid on the equipment to be procured under the loan,, preference would be given
to clearly identified Yugoslav components of foreign bids to the extent of 15
percent of the price of such components or the actual custorms duty levied on
similar imported components, whichever is less, for purposes of bid cous'pari-
son.
Disbursements
45.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the actual forelgn exchange
cost (c.i.f. Yugoslav border or port entry) of equipment and spare Darts tor
the project.  Disbursements would take place ove-r three years fron, the ben-
ning of 1974 to the beginning of 1977. A schedule of estimated disbursa;encs
is given in the Loan and Project Summary (Annex III).
Environment
46.       Kikinda would install devices for dust and fume extraction in its
foundries at a coSt of about Dini. 10 million, representing some 10 percent
of the foundry equipment cost of the project.   Th1ese neasures are judged to
provide adequate pollution control and the Bank has received assurances from
the enterprise that they would be implemented.
Labor Force
47.       With a total of 2,.084 employees at the end of 1972, including 415
persons in the machine tool plant, the enterprise is a major employer in the
area. The project is expected to double the labor productivity and to raise
the number of employees by 626 or 30 percent. Thie Bank has received assur-
ances from the enterprise that it would maintain ar. adequate labor force to
meet fully the needs of the project.



- 13
Aud it
48.       Kikinda' s accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting Service
(SAS), which is an autonomous governmental agency responsible for financial
inspection of Yugoslav economic enterprises. It audits several Bank-financed
projects. SAS is currently planning a training program to begin in January
1974 under which its staff will be trained by an international accounting
firm in auditing methods consistent with Bank requirements. It is likely
to be some time before it will be possible to fully realize the objective
of the program. In support of the training program, Kikinda has agreed to
invite the SAS to undertake the audit of its accounts in the next two years
as part of the SAS's on-the-job training of its staff, in collaboration with
the international accounting firm with whom SAS is cooperating in the train-
ing program. In addition the Government has undertaken that, if SAS cannot
perform a satisfactory audit, it would retain an independent auditor for this
task.
Justification
49.       The incremental economic rate of return for the project would be
about 18 percent. The calculation is based on export prices (c.i.f. border)
of Kikinda to the convertible currency area for sales revenues, and on c.i.f.
border prices for material inputs and on market wage rates for labor costs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that even under pessimistic assumptions the
project would havae a rate of return of more than 10 percent.
50.       The project would help overcome a major constraint on long-terra
economic growth in Yugoslavia, i.e. the shortage of convertible foreign ex-
change, by providing a variety of rapidly expanding industrial inputs which
otherwise would be imported and also by significantly increasing the coun-
try's foreign exchange earnings. The net foreign exchange earnings (mostly
in convertible currencies) of Kikinda would increase from about US$7 million,
equivalent, in 1973 to about US$23 million, equivalent, in 1983. Gross foreign
exchange earnings from exports and savings through substituting imports to-
gether would increase from US$19 million, equivalent, in 1973 to US$55 million,
equivalent, in 1983.
51.       The project is of key significance for Yugoslavia's industrial de-
velopment. The further growth of the country's engineering industries, par-
ticularly those producing mac hine tools, agricultural machinery, motor vehi-
cles, ships, electrical and non-electrical equipment and consumer durables,
is dependent on the expansion of castings production. Some of the enterprises
in these sub-sectors have already started their expansion in anticipation of
the additional castings and machine tools from this project.
52.       The project is also crucial for the industrial development of
Vojvodina. It would help diversify the predominantly agrarian structure of
Vojvodina and lay the base for industries that could help absorb the increas-
ing number of workers leaving the agricultural sector.   About 600 new jobs
wouldi be created in Kikinda and about 1000 indirectly in industries supplied
by Kikinda.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan 395 Railway Modernization Program: US$70.0 million Loan of December 11,
1964.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, after the Closing
Date had been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1975, due to financial planning and technical
difficulties. After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a continuous deter-
ioration of their financial position and liquidity for a number of related
reasons. Project cost estimates increased nearly threefold between 1963 and
1971 because of inflation, devaluation of the dinar, revaluation of some
European currencies and as a consequence of additional work following more
detailed feasibility studies. Payments for railway freight services were
held back by the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway
Transport Enterprises which, under the Yugoslav system, are expected to oper-
ate on a commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in their
ability to respond to changed market conditions. Furthermore, the responsibility
of the Federal Government to meet railway deficits has been transferred to the
Republican Governments, which only now are in a position to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government that the Bank
would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems. Following this
review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting team, the
Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Republic Governments and the
Railways. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very favorable
and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways' situation.
In view of this, the Bank agreed to consider making a further loan in fiscal
year 1973 or 1974 to assist completion of the 1964 modernization program,
provided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clarification of
government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of action both
for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise (including
clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives), a revised
tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals for
dealing with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management.
The Governments and the railways have taken and are taking measures to meet
these conditions, and a mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972
to assist in the preparation of new action plans. Revised investment and
financing plans submitted recently required substantial re-appraisal of the
project which was done in May/June 1973. Although the final size of the
proposed project is just now being determined, as Republics clarify the avail-
ability of local resources, the Bank's financial assistance would be concen-
trated on the completion of the 1964 modernization program of main lines.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in.project execution.



ANNEX II

Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could further jeopardize the competitive position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
with Bank assistance since 1964.
Loan 531  Belgrade-Bar Railway:   US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Execution of this project was delayed by more than one year due to
geological difficulties and inefficiency of the contractor responsible for
the civil engineering work at the Kos Tunnel. The contract has now been placed
with another more efficient contractor already working for the project. The
delays have made it necessary to reschedule track-laying which is now expected
to be completed in 1975- The line is expected to become operative at the end
of 1975. The closing date has been postponed from December 31, 1973, to
December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $292.0 million. This has resulted in a
financing gap of $37.0 million. The authorities are presently considering
arrangements for closing this gap.
Loan 554  Industrial Projects - 1968:   US$16.8 million Loan of August 15, 1968;
Closing Date: October 31,1973.
Seven of the nine sub-projects under the loan have been completed,
but two sub-projects have been delayed. Sub-project Nis (Electronic Industries)
is behind schedule up to two and a half years, due primarily to delays in pro-
curement, but is now expected to be completed shortly. Two production ex-
pansion schemes under sub-project Sevojno (Copper and Brass Mill) were revised
with Bank approval and are expected to be completed in December 1973 with six
months' delay and about two years delay, respectively. The Closing Date was
postponed on April 11, 1973 from March 31 to October 31, 1973. Disbursement
of the loan is in line with the revised sub-project completion schedules.
Loan 608 Third Highway: US$30.0 million Loan of June 5, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Construction works under the loan have been substantially completed,
except for the construction of the Karlovac bypass and the access road in
Zagreb, which are expected to require several additional months. The Closing
Date of the Loan was accordingly postponed from December 31, 1972 to December
31, 1973. In view of increases in costs, the disbursement percentage has been
reduced from the original 42 percent to 27 percent, in order to continue dis-
bursements until the completion of these works.

Loan 654 Industrial Projects - 1970: US$18.5 million Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
All three sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after experiencing delays of up to 18 months due to slow deliveries of
local and imported goods. The Closing Date was postponed on June 28, 1973
from June 30 to December 31, 1973 to allow payments of 10 percent retention
money under already concluded contracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak.
Loan 657 Telecommunications: US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Since the last project review delays in civil works have occurred
which will delay completion of the project until late 1975. With the exception
of the earth satellite station, only preliminary works have been completed. A
cost overrun for already placed orders amounting to US$5.1 million iq expected
due to currency revaluations. Expansion of the telecommunications network has
not kept pace with the demand resulting in a waiting list of 1.5 million appli-
cations.
Loan 678 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily. The completion of the proj-
ect, however, is likely to be delayed substantially beyond the present Closing
Date: the extent of this delay will be determined in the Fall of 1973.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. The Federal Government
submitted a revised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 and on
the basis of this estimate the disbursement percentage has been revised from
43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Disbursement is proceeding in line
with the revised projection.
Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions for
effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory prog-
ress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost estimate is
expected, and the disbursement percentage would be revised when more accurate
revised cost estimates are available. Disbursement under the Loan is about
one year behind the appraisal estimate.

Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million of Loan of June 18. 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After the loss of imore than one year owing to delays in making the
loan effective and in appointing consultants, the implementation of the proj-
ect experienced a further delay of one and a half months. Preliminary cost
estimates indicate that the project, if it were to be implemented as original-
ly envisaged (2,500 beds) would require approximately US$34 million instead of
US$24 million.  This increase is ma'nly due to rapid inflation but also to
realignment in exchange rates. As no additional financing appears to be forth-
coming, the project might have to be reduced to some 1,500 to 2,000 beds by
eliminating the most expensive structures with the lowest returns. The start
of construction might be delayed as the financing of primary infrastructure
(roads, electricity and telephone) is not secured and funds are lacking to
complete works at the new site of the shipyard which is presently occupying
the project site.
Loan 777  Ibar Multipurpose Wiater:  US$45.0 million Loan of June 30. 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However, the
responsible agency, the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project. It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year later
than originally planned).
Loan 782  Babin Kuk Tourism:   US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
Earlier delays in the project, caused by difficulties in mak.ing the
Loan Agreement effective and appointing consultants, were further compounded
during FY 1973 by the refusal of the local lendirng institution to make dis-
bursements to Babin Kuk for consultants' work, enginleering surveys and pro-
ect administration. Most of these difficulties have been resolved, but tois
additional delay in a period of extremely high inflation in the Yugosl-av
building industry has further increased the cost of the project. Updated.
detailed cost estimates are to be prepared and the scope of the project re-
evaluated in October 1973. The next supervision mission is planned for
October 1973.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23) 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan was declared effective on December 29, 1972. After some
delays in preparing tender documents9 bidding procedures are now under way.
A supervision mission visited the project in October,
