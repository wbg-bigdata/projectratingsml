KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the expansion of Livnica Zeljeza i Tempera
(Rikinda), one of the largest producers of iron castings and the only producer
of grinders--a machine tool--in Yugoslavia. The project is located in the
town of Kikinda, Vojvodina Province, about 130 km north of Belgrade near the
border of both Hungary and Romania. The project would increase the annual
production capacity of Kikinda from 19,900 tons of castings to 39,000 tons;
from 4,000 tons of pipe fittings to 6,400 tons; and from 350 units of machine
tools to 460 units. The estimated financing required for the project, in-
cluding interest during construction and incremental working capital, is
Din 591 million (US$38.1 million equivalent), of which the foreign exchange
component would be equivalent to Din 290 million (US$18.7 million)--about
half of total total financing required. Implementation of the project is
about to begin and is expected to be completed by early 1977.
ii.       Since 1967, the Bank has made three loans to industry in Yugoslavia
amounting to US$45 million equivalent, using the Yugoslav Investment Bank as
a channel, for the modernization and expansion of 19 industrial projects
which were individually appraised by the Bank. However, in order to maximize
the impact of Bank lending to industry in that country, the Bank has modified
its lending strategy to include direct industrial loans to large projects of
key economic importance if long-term  finance on reasonable terms cannot be
obtained from other sources. It is also envisaged that at some later date
ir.direct lending for small and medium size industrial projects would be pro-
vided through a line of credit.
iii.      It ,-s in this context that the Federal Government has asked the
Bank to help finance this high priority project which would thus become the
first recipient of a direct Bank loar, to industry in Yugoslavia.  The loan,
in the amount of US$14.5 million equivalent, would f'inance the foreign ex-
change cost of competitively - bid equipment and spares, and would be for
14 years, inchuding 4 years of grace, with ar. effective interest rate of
9% per annum, including guarantee fees to the Autonomous Province of
Vojvodina where the plant is located. Tne loan would help meet approximately
41% of the cost of the project; the remaining 59% would be financed entirely
from internal cash generation, including US$1.2 million in foreign exchange.
In addition US$3 million required for interest payment during construction
will be met from internal cash generation.
iv.       The Bank loan would finance the c.i.f. foreign exchange cost of
equipment and spares.  Since all equipment that could be procured locally
has been allocated to local currency expenditures, Yugoslav manufacturers
are not expected to bid directly for Bank-financed equipment.  For the
purpose of bid comparisons, preference would be given to local components



- ii -
of foreign bids to the extent of 15% of the price of such components or actual
customs duty on similar imported components, whichever is less.
v.        The project is linked to the anticipated expansion of industries
in Yugoslavia such as agricultural machinery, electrical equipment, building
construction, commercial vehicles and automobiles, machine tools, consumer
durables, rail wagons and shipbuilding. These industries are targetted to ex-
pand at over 8.5% per year on average during the current Five-Year Social
Plan (1971-75).  Their rapid growth would not be possible without the
availability of castings and machine tools, which would have to be imported
(under tight world supply conditions as far as castings are concerned)
if domestic output were not expanided.
vi.       Kikinda's project is export-oriented as well.  In 1972, nearly
35% of the Company's sales revenue of Din 296 million (US$19.1 million) came
from exports. By 1977, when the project is expected to be fully operational,
exports would account for more than half of total revenue estimated at Din 713
million (US$46 million). Furthermore, average net foreign exchange earnings
and savings to the economy resulting from the project are expected to be
US$17 million per year, offsetting in just over one year after project comple-
tion the entire foreign exchange cost of the project. Faced with mounting
debt repayment obligations on short and medium-term suppliers' credits, and
an increasing gap in the balance of trade, Yugoslavia has a critical need
to raise its foreign exchange earnings from exports through the expansion of
competitive industries and to save foreign exchange by import substitution.
vii.      Markets for Kikinda's products appear well assured and the Company
has established a good name for high quality, both at home and abroad. In
general, the existing shortage of castings in the world is expected to con-
tinue because, in developed countries, it is becoming more difficult to attract
labor to work in foundries and wages in the relatively labor-intensive produc-
tion of castings and machine tools have increased costs there substantially.
Kikinda's prices are generally lower than those for comparable products in
Western Europe. Even if international prices were to fall by 10% from the
levels assumed in the financial projections, most of the Company's products
would still be competitive.
viii.     Kikinda has a young, dynamic and efficient management team and is
headed by a capable General Manager, who was elected in 1971 for a four-year
term by the Central Workers' Council, the supreme management body of the
enterprise. The General Manager is supported by an Executive Board consis-
ting of eight members from the Council. In practice, the management makes
all major decisions and has the full cooperation of the Council.
ix.       The Company has a sound financial position which provides a good
base for expansion. Since a major portion of the project cost is expected
to be financed from the Company's internal cash generation, debt as a per-
centage of eqtuity plus debt is expected to remain consistently below 40%
even during the construction period. Long-term debt service coverage would



- iii -
be above 2.5 times during project implementation and reach the high level
of 3.9 in 1978, the first year of repayment of the Bank loan. Furthermore,
it is estimated that the project has high financial and economic rate3 of
return of 19% and 18% respectively and, even under foreseeable adverse
conditions, the probability is low that they would drop below 15%.
x.        Based on agreements reached during negotiations on necessary commit-
ments as summarized at the end of the report, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$14.5 million equivalent. A guarantee fee of 1-3/4% per annum
is to be paid to the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina by the Company in addi-
tion to the Bank's normal lending rate.






I. INTRODUCTION
A.   General
1.01      This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Livnica
Zeljeza i Tempera (Kikinda) 1/, one of the major castings producers and the
only producer of grinding machines in Yugoslavia. The plant is situated at
Kikinda, a town about 130 km north of Belgrade and about 5 km south of the
Romanian border, in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The project would
increase Kikinda's capacity for castings from 19,900 to 39,000 metric tons
per year (TPY); pipe fittings from 4,000 to 6,400 TPY; and machine tools from
350 to 460 units, including broadening of the product range. The project
is expected to be completed by early 1977. The total financing required,
including interest during construction and an increase in working capital,
is Din 591 million equivalent (US$38.1 million), of which about Din 224.8
million (US$14.5 million) will be for imported equipment.and spares.  The
proposed Bank loan of US$14.5 million would cover the entire foreign ex-
change cost of equipment and spares.
1.02      This loan would be the first direct Bank loan to industry in
Yugoslavia, all Bank loans in this field since 1967 having been channeled
through the Yugoslav Investment Bank (YIB). The Borrower, therefore, would
be Kikinda. Following an industrial identification mission in 1971, eight
industrial projects were submitted to the Bank for financing, of which the
expansion of Kikinda was one of the projects selected. Another selected
foundry expansion project - that of Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd (FOB) - has also
been appraised and will be presented shortly to the Executive Directors for
consideration.
1.03      The expansion programs of the Kikinda and FOB foundries are on the
Government's priority list for industrial development. They are considered
vital for the fu-rther growth of the country's engineering industries, in par-
ticular those producing machine tools, agricultural machinery, motor vehicles,
ships, electrical as well as non-electrical equipment, and consumer durables.
Some of the enterprises in these sub-sectors have already started their ex-
pansions in anticipation of the additional castings from the two projects;
the foundry projects should, therefore, be executed without delay.
1.04      The Kikinda project was appraised by a mission which visited
Yugoslavia in April/May 1973 and which consisted of Messrs. Nayar (Chief),
Glenday and Shetty of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. Paschke
(Consultant). Foundry terms and production processes are briefly described
in Annex 1-1.
B.   The Role of the Bank
1.05      In its bid for acceierated economic development, Yugoslavia has
been relying heavily on short aid mediunm-term suppliers' credits. The
1/   This Company is commonly referred to as the Kikinda Iron Foundry.



-2-
rapidly growing debt service payments over the last 5 years have been a
serious problem. To reduce its dependence on suppliers' credit, Yugoslavia
is exploring the possibility of long-term finance on reasonable terms from
foreign sources, including the Bank.
1.06      In view of past experience with three indirect Bank loans totalling
US$45 million for the modernization of 19 industrial enterprises, spreading
the impact of Bank lending thinly, the Bank has decided to undertake direct
lending to a few selected projects of national importance in Yugoslavia,
in those cases where the projects are not suited for IFC participation and/or
cannot obtain long-term financing on reasonable terms, while continuing in-
direct lending for small and medium size industrial projects through a
line of credit. As Kikinda does not require foreign joint venture participa-
tion, nor does it wish such participation - at least not at this time - to
provide technology, market strategy or market outlets, Bank participation
appears appropriate. Furthermore, the Company tried unsuccessfully to
obtain adequate external financing on reasonable terms from other foreign
sources before approaching the Bank. While Kikinda was able to obtain com-
mercial - type financing from Barclays Bank (para. 2.02), this was not
anywhere near the amount of foreign exchange credit that it is now seeking.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      Plant operations of what is now Kikinda started in 1908 with a
brick factory; production of malleable and gray iron castings was added in
1934, machine tools in 1951, and malleable pipe fittings in 1954. Since
then the enterprise has undertaken a series of expansion programs, raising
its annual production capacity to the following current levels: malleable
castings, 11,500 tons; nodular castings, 4,500 tons; gray castings, 900 tons;
finished pipe fittings, 4,000 tons; and machine tools, 350 units. Expansion
of nodular castings' capacity from 4,500 to 7,500 TPY is underway (para. 2.02).
2.02      Kikinda is one of seven enterprises which benefited from a 1967
Bank loan (504-YU) channeled through YIB. Under this loan, the Company re-
ceived the equivalent at the time of UTS$1.1 million (Din 13.8 million) to meet
foreign exchange costs for expanding the malleable foundry and for replacing
an old gray iron foundry with a new facility for both gray and nodular cast-
ings. There was a delay of one year in project completion and a cost overrun
of about Din 7 million (from Din 37 million to 44 million), mainly because
procurement was slower than anticipated, partly due to the enterprise's lack
of experience in international competitive bidding procedures and acceleration
of inflation in Yugoslavia and abroad. The project was completed in 1971 and
following it, the Company borrowed US$348,000 equivalent from Barclays Bank
of London to increase further its capacity of nodular castings from 4,500
to 7,500 tons annually by the end of 1973. This expansion program is nearing
completion as scheduled.

B.   Organization and Management
2.03      Kikinda - as is usual in Yugoslavia - is managed by its workers.
It has no subsidiaries. The self-management system is explained in Annex 2-1,
which also contains an organization chart of the enterprise. The supreme
managing body of the Company is the Central Workers' Council, consisting of
28 members elected by the workers for a period of two years. This body for-
mulates the policy of the enterprise and approves major investment plans,
annual budgets, and disposition of income.  It also elects the top management
of the Company. Kikinda's key executive is its General Manager, Mr. Pajic,
who was elected by the Workers' Council in 1971 for a four-year term. He is
eligible for a second term.
2.04      Mr. Pajic has had 12 years of experience with the Company in various
managerial and technical positions, and was Deputy General Manager before
election to his present position. The General Manager is assisted by an
Executive Board, a body drawn from the Workers' Council, and responsible for
day-to-day operations of the enterprise. The Board consists of 9 members -
8 from the Workers' Council and the General Manager. The General Manager is
independent of the Board in his functions and is responsible only to the
Workers' Council. In practice, the management takes all major decisions and
has the full cooperation of the Workers' Council.
2.05      The General Manager has delegated most of the day-to-day operational
responsibilities to his Deputy General Manager, Mr. Ruzin (who was also
elected in 1971), while he concentrates on the development aspects of the
Coompany. The members of Kikinda's management are well trained and experienced.
They constitute a young, dynamic group, whose average age is about 40 years.
Key officials are supported by sufficient qualified persons and the present
arrangement is considered effective.  According to Yugoslav law, no company
can imerge or consolidate without protecting the rights of third parties
concerned.  During negotiations, it was agreed that the Company will not sell,
Lease, Zransfer or assign its rights or assets without the prior consent of
xhe Bank.
C.   Plant Facilities
2.06      The existing facilities include a malleable iron foundry; a gray
and nodular iron foundry, a fitting finishing plant, a machine tool plant,
a quality control laboratory, and supporting ancillary facilities. They are
described in detail in Annex 2-2.  The plants are well operated and maintained.
However, several factors pose constraints on production. They include: im-
balances between melting, molding, and heat-treatment facilities in the found-
ries; partly outdated machinery, which makes it difficult to achieve the close
*         tolerance required for machine tool production; and antiquated facilities for
power supply and heating.  The proposed expansion project is intended to over-
come these shortcomings.



2.07      The enterprise has a unit responsible for safety aspects and acci-
dent prevention, but measures taken so far are less than satisfactory. As
greater emphasis is needed in this area, the Bank has been assured by the
Company during negotiations that it will improve and maintain an appropriate
safety program.
D.  Past Growth and Financial Results
2.08      As a result of previous expansions (as shown in the following table),
the Company increased its net sales from Din 115.8 million in 1968 to Din 296.0
million in 1972, an increase of 156% over a period of four years, and net
profits jumped from Din 8.3 million to 27 million during the same period
(Annex 2-3). It should be noted that during 1968-71, the Company did consid-
erably better in terms of sales and cash generation than forecasts contained
in the previous appraisal (Report No. LA-2a, dated June 29, 1967).

/1   Including revenue from machine tool servicing not shown in product
breakdown.
2.09      Kikinda has been expanding its production and sales by concentrating
on higher quality products, starting new product lines and closing unprofitable
ones (e.g. stoves and lathes). The Company has established a name both at home
and abroad for its products, especially foundry products which, in 1972, ac-
counted for nearly 60% of net sales and which have a low rejection rate of
2% or less. Furthermore, the Company's exports have been growing at an average
annual rate of 55% during the last four years; they represented 35.0% of net
sales in 1972. 1/ Capacity production has consistently been very high. As a
matter of fact, in 1972 the Company operated above its rated capacity in all
departments except the nodular foundry. In the case of nodular castings, a
newly-introduced product line, full capacity utilization is anticipated by
the end of 1973.
1/   Kikinda's export performance is described in greater detail in
paras. 3.13 and 3.14.



2.10      Net income in the above table is understated because of high depre-
ciation charges and the practice of charging to operations certain costs
associated with expansion investments. Net income as a percentage of net
sales increased from 7.2% in 1968 to 9.1% in 1972, with an intermittent dip
in 1969 and 1970 mainly due to the charging of interest during construction
and start-up expenses to operations in accordance with Yugoslav law. Kikinda's
record of production, sales, and earnings thus indicates that it is a growing
and profitable firm.
E.   Recent Financial Position
2.11      Balance sheets for the past five years (1968-1972) are given in
Annex 2-4, and the balance sheet as of December 31, 1972 is summarized below:

/1   "Equity" includes the Business Fund, Collective Consumption Fund, Reserve
Fund and Mutual Reserve Fund; they are explained in Anmex 7-3, pages
4 to 6.
2.12      It can be seen that the Company's financial stnrcture is sound,
with a current ratio of about 2.3:1 and a debt/equity ratio of 30/70.
This reflects the fact that the Company has been able to finance its past
expansions primarily by internal cash generation, and thus provides a good
financial base for the expansion project. Furthermore, net fixed assets are
likely to be understated because of the accelerated depreciation and other
write-offs mentioned above.
III. THEI MARKET
A.   Supply and Demand
3.01      A detailed analysis of the market for foundry products (castings)
and machine tools is provided in Annexes 3-1 and 3-2.



-6-
1.   Castings
3.02      There are some 250 foundries in Yugoslavia, of which about 50 ac-
count for 90% of total output. In 1972, total production of castings, in-
cluding steel and non-ferrous castings which make up some 18% of the total,
was about 453,300 tons; total iron castings output - i.e. Kikinda's line of
production - was about 373,000 tons, of which 92% was gray castings, 5% mal-
leable castings (including pipe fittings) and 3% nodular castings. Taking
into account the present expansion plans of various Yugoslav foundries, in-
cluding those of Kikinda and FOB, it is likely that the output of iron cast-
ings in the countrv will increase to 575,000 tons in 1977, or by an average
annual rate of 9%.
3.03      The following table summarizes past and projected demand and sup-
ply of iron castings in Yugoslavia through 1977:
Yugoslavia-Demand/Supply Comparisons for Iron Castings
(000 tons)
Average Annual
1968    1972    1973    1977          Growth Rate (%)
--actual---    --forecast--          1968-72  1972-77
Production             260.0   373.0   418.0   575.0             9.5       9
Imports                   4.0    14.0    15.0    25.0            37        12
Total Supply          264.0   387.0   433.0   600.0            10         9
Domestic Consumption   212.7   321.0   375.0   609.0             11        13.5
Exports                  51.3    66.0    72.5   100.0             6.5       8.5
Surplus (deficit)       0.0      0.0   (14.5) (109.0)
3.04      Domestic consumption of iron castings increased at an annual rate
of 11% during 1968-1972, reaching 321,000 tons in 1972. Considering the plans
for accelerated industrial development in Yugoslavia and based on an industry
by industry assessment of their needs for castings, consumption in the future
is likely to grow at 13.5% per year, reaching 609,000 tons in 1977. The main
consumers of castings are producers of agricultural machinery, motor vehi-
cles, machine tools, electrical and non-electrical equipment, consumer dura-
bles, and rail wagons, as well as the construction and shipbuilding industries.
3.05      Yugoslavia is a net exporter of iron castings.  Important export
markets for it have been the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy,
Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R. In 1972, exports reached 66,000
tons (about 18% of production) of which about 65% and 35% respectively went
to convertible and clearing area countries. Imports, on the other hand,
amounted to only 14,000 tons and consisted mainly of items which are not
produced in Yugoslavia. In the future, exports to convertible as well as
clearing area countries are expected to grow at an annual rate of 8.5%, while
imports are projected to increase by 12% a year from the present low base.
3.06      Based on the above projections, and as shown in the above table,
Yugoslavia is expected to have a shortage of some 9,000 tons of iron cast-
ings in 1977 to meet internal demand alone, or a gap of about 109,000 tons



- 7 -
when the export demand is taken into account. Some further expansion of
capacity beyond that already contemplated would, therefore, appear necessary
to meet the anticipated domestic and export demand. Furthermore, the ex-
port potential might well be greater than assumed here. There is a short-
age of castings in the world that is expected to continue at least in the
foreseeable future, primarily because, in developed countries, which are
responsible for about 90% of castings' output, it is becoming more dif-
ficult to get labor to work in foundries despite high wages, and stringent
pollution controls there have increased capital as well as production costs.
2.   Machine Tools
3.07      Production of machine tools in Yugoslavia did not start until after
World War II, when a limited range was manufactured in small quantities.
Since then production has been growing fast and the range of machine tools
produced has been expanded. However, as shown in Anmex 3-2, over the past
five years (1968-1972) consumption of machine tools has been increasing even
faster than production and dependence on imports has continued to increase.
It is expected that in the near future Yugoslavia will have to continue im-
porting a major share of its requirements of machine tools, as additions to
local production capacity are not expected to keep pace with growing demand.
It should be noted that the anticipated 1972-77 average annual growth rate
in machine tool consumption of 8.5% as compared to the 16% during the 1968-
72 period does not reflect a softening of demand but merely an adjustment of
the distortion in the former growth rate that was due to the extraordinarily
high increase in Yugoslavia's machine tool consumption in 1972. The average
growth rate between 1968 and 1977 would be about 12% per year, slightly higher
than it had been during 1968-71 (11%).
3.08      However, the overall market development for all machine tools is
not very relevant for Kikinda's market prospects in this area (other than
setting the general framework) since its production is directed to only a
rather specialized market segment - that of grinding machines of which, as
was mentioned previously, the Company is the sole producer in the country.
In Yugoslavia, as in most other industrializing and developed countries,
demand for grinders has been increasing more rapidly than for most other
types of machine tools. The important domestic users of grinders are the
motor vrehicle, tractor, ball bearing and machine tool industries. The
following table summarizes the past and projected demand and supply for
grinders in Yugoslavia through 1977:

/1   Includes certain types of grinders not produced in Yugoslavia.
3.10      Domestic consumption of grinders is projected to increase by 12.5%
annually up to 1975, reaching about 485 grinders in that year and thereafter
at about 8.5% reaching some 570 grinders in 1977. Domestic production of
grinders is expected to increase from 271 units in 1972 to 380 units in 1977,
equivalent to a growth rate of 7% per year, of which, however, only 240 units
are destined for domestic consumption since 140 units (37%) are intended to
be exported. The supply gap of 330 units in 1977 including certain types of
grinders (centerless and special purpose grinders) not produced in Yugoslavia,
will have to be met from imports. However, Kikinda, being the only producer
in the country, has plans for further future expansions of its grinder pro-
duction capacity to narrow this gap, closely watching changes in technology
and consumer preference.
3.11      Exports of grinders increased from 7 machines in 1968 to 78 machines
in 1971; but dropped sharply to 21 machines in 1972, partly due to the expira-
tion of the licensing arrangement of Kikinda with Fortuna, a German manufac-
turer of grinders, and the consequent stoppage of sales through Fortuna; and
partly due to the pressing needs in the domestic market. The exports of
grinders are expected to increase from the present low base to about 140
units by 1977 on the basis of contracts already concluded by Kikinda and
others now being negotiated.
B.   Kikinda's Market Position and Sales Forecasts
1.   Castings
3.12      Kikinda has become one of Yugoslavia's largest producers of malle-
able and noduj.ar iron castings, but has only a negligible position in the
country's production of gray castings, which the Company makes only to meet
its own requirements in the manufacture of machine tools. As the result of
the project, the Company will further increase its market position in malle-
able and nodular castings but stay with its present share in gray castings
as shown in the following table:

/1   The Company had virtually no production of gray castings in 1967.
/2   Production started only in 1971 with the Bank's past loan.
3.13      The table indicates that for each of the different types of cast-
ings (as was the case for all castings combined, para. 3.06), domestic pro-
duction is not expected to fill domestic demand in 1977, so that imports of
castings will have to continue, even if there were no exports of castings
from Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, Kikinda intends to export about 75% of its
incremental output, with total exports expected to increase from 7,290 tons
(55% of total sales) in 1972 to 24,700 tons (nearly 67% of total sales) in
1977.
3.14      Also while the Company's production in 1977 of malleable castings
(including pipe fittings) and nodular castings is anticipated to rise to about
two-thirds each of the country's total output of these items (against 45% and
30% respectively in 1972), due to its substantial exports, Kikinda's share in
the doamestic raarket for these products is to increase only from about 17% in
1972 to 18% in 1977. As will be described further below, the Company has
already started to negotiate medium and long-term sales contracts, as is usual
in this type of industry, for a major portion of its additional production.
2.   Machine 'cools
3.15      As was mentioned previously, Kikinda, apart from grinding machines,
also produces radial drills and in 1972 entered into a 5-year contract with
Romania to supply hydraulic parts to a company there producing "Fortuna" ma-
chines under a German license. However, radial drills and hydraulic parts
tnade up only a small portion of the Company's sales in 1972 (21% of the value
of machine tools and 5.5% of total Company sales) .nd are primar'1i: used to
fill capacity of the machine tool plant efficiently.  This will also be their
prime purpose in the foreseeable future.
3.16      Since Kikinda is the only producer of grinding machines in Yugoslavia,
the Company's market prospects are identical with those of the country, which
were discussed in paras. 3.07-3.11. It should be remembered that domestic
demand is expected to be substantially in excess of Kikinda's production
capabilities, so that even if exports were to fall short of expectations,
the Company should still find a ready market at home.



- 10 -
3.17      So far the Company has been producing only universal and surface
grinders but not special purpose, centerless and internal grinders. Kikinda
has recently entered into an agreement with the Bryant Corporation, a sub-
sidiary of the Ex-Cell-0 Corporation of the U.S. for the production of in-
ternal grinders starting from 1974. The production of these grinders is ex-
pected to increase from 10 units in 1974 to 20 units in 1977, exclusively
for sale in the domestic market. The import demand for such machines has
averaged about 25 annually during 1968-72.
3.   Sales Build-Up and Destination of Sales
3.18      Kikinda is heavily export oriented (para 6.02).  A year by year
sales breakdown is provided in Annexes 3-3 and 6-1, by product, volume and
value through 1983. The volume forecasts together with destination of sales
by currency area are summarized below for 1972 (actual) and for 1977, the
first full year of operations upon completion of the project:

3.19      Kikinda sells most of its malleable castings through long-term
contracts (5 to 10 years) with Zavodi Crvena Zastava (Zastava), the only
local car manufacturer and a beneficiary under Bank Loan 654-YU, and the
German automaker, Opel. These two customers alone will account for about 60%
of Kikinda's malleable castings sales in 1977. The Company is negotiating
with local car assemblers and foreign firms for additional supply contracts
and, on the basis of preliminary inquiries, indications are that demand for
Kikinda's malleable castings will be in excess of what it could supply in 1977.
3.20      Kikinda and the other major foundry in Yugoslavia, FOB, signed an
agreement in 1971 in which they reached a basic understanding on the demar-
cation of production. While Kikinda makes gray castings only for its own



- 11 -
machine tool production, FOB produces a wide range of gray castings primarily
for the engine-driven vehicle sector. Kikinda, in turn, concentrates on the
production of malleable and nodular castings. Priority in supply is given to
customers in convertible currency countries (predominantly Germany) and the
remainder is to be supplied to Zastava as well as TAM (a beneficiary under
Bank Loan 504-YU) and FAP-FAMOS, two commercial vehicle manufacturers. Based
on present contracts and inquiries, the Company expects to sell close to 70%
of its 1977 output abroad.
3.21      In the case of pipe fittings, Kikinda has already contracted for
6,100 tons in 1977, out of the 9,200 tons it intends to sell in that year.
Here also, some 65% of production is expected to be exported to customers
abroad, prominent among which are Locatelli (Italy) and Induco Handel
(Germany).
3.22      As for machine tool exports, the Company already has orders on hand
for the supply of 82 machines by 1977 to the following countries: the U.S.S.R.,
50; the U.S., 12; and Italy and Germany, together 20. Kikinda is currently
negotiating orders for another 38 machines to the U.S. and 20 to other countries.
4.   Marketing Organization
3.23      The Company has an efficient marketing organization with represen-
tatives in Germany, Italy, the U.S.S.R. and some other countries. In the
past, Kikinda relied largely on Invest-import and Dinava in Belgrade, iMasino-
Implex of Zagreb, and other agents for export sales. However, it is now
placing more emphasis on direct sales to foreign customers under long-term
contracts.
3R24      In the domestic market, castings are sold directly to customers
under long-term contracts except for pipe fittings which are distributed
throL.t1r 'Local wholesalers.  For local sales of machine tools, Kikinda has
field representatives in various republics. The Company plans to increase
the number of sales engineers in domestic representative offices. Further-
more, it works closely with M1asino-Union, Belgrade, in studying long-term
machine tool requirements and product development needs.
C . PzPrices and CorLpetitive Position
3.25      An international comparison of prices of castings is difficult because
of variations of castings in size, quality and intricacy.  However, there is no
doubt that Kikinda's prices of castings are on the whole very competitive inter-
nationally. :Kikinda's competitive prices coupled witn their high quality have
resulted in substantial demand by foreign customers for these products and have
placed the Company in a very favorable position. Approximate average 1972
domestic, ex-alant, price indices for selected items of Kikinda are compared
with those of German and Italian producers, also ex-plant, in the following
table (details are given in Annex 3-1 and 3-2):

/1   Compared with Blohm's Simplex-S of Germany and Alpa's RT-450 of Italy.
3.26      Kikinda's sales prices vary among domestic, clearing and convertible
area markets (Annex 6-1). Prices for the clearing area countries are fixed
according to agreements; they bear little relation to market conditions in those
countries. However, in the past, export prices to the clearing area countries
have been higher than domestic prices generally and are expected to remain so
in the future. In the case of pipe fittings 1/, nodular castings and grinding
machines, the Company's export prices for the convertible area are on average
about 15% lower than its domestic prices. This is partly because of keen compe-
tition with foreign suppliers in establishing new markets.  However, in the case
of malleable castings, a major product line of the Company, its domestic prices
are lower than export prices although this may in part be due to some differences
in quality requirements between the products exported and those sold at home.
At present, domestic prices of pipe fittings and machine tools are controlled,
whereas malleable, gray and nodular castings are free from such controls, ex-
cept general temporary controls for reasons of containing inflation.
1.   Export Incentives
3.27      The Federal Government provides export incentives, the most important
of which is the retention quota under which the exporting company is allowed
to retain 20% of its foreign exchange earnings for use without any restriction.
2.   Protection
3.28      As already noted, Kikinda's products are internationally competitive.
However, nominal protection through customs duties and taxes exists to the
extent of 25% for iron castings and about 30% for grinders. This duty shelter
is of interest to Kikinda only to the extent that it helps prevent the sale
of foreign products in Yugoslavia at marginal cost.
IV. TIE PROJECT
A.   Objectives and Scope
4.01      The proposed project is designed both to increase the capacity
of different plants and to modernize and replace obsolete equipment. It
would increase the capacity of malleable iron castings from 11,500 to 21,000
1/   In the case of pipe fittings. export prices are substantially lower
than domestic prices largely because of keen competition from Far
Eastern countries.

TPY; nodular iron castings from 7,500 to 16,500 TPY; gray iron castings
from 900 to 1,500 TPY; pipe fittings from 4,000 to 6,400 TPY; and machine
tools from 350 to 460 units annually, including the introduction of new lines
of precision and internal grinding machines. The project plans, detailed
engineering and cost estimates were orginally prepared by the Company in early
1972, and were subsequently revised in the first quarter of 1973 after consul-
tation with different equipment suppliers.
4.02      To achieve the above objectives the following major additions and
alternations are to be made: (i) expansion and modernization of the malle-
able foundry, which would include two 6-7 tons/hr hot blast cupolas, four
10-ton/hr electric induction furnaces, two flaskless molding lines, one
automatic molding line, two annealing furnaces and supporting facilities;
(ii) expansion of the gray and nodular foundry, with four 12-ton/hr electric
furnaces and core-making facilities, and one heat-treatment plant with sup-
porting facilities; (iii) expansion of the fitting finishing plant with more
specialized machines for finishing and galvanizing, and packing facilities;
(iv) expansion and modernization programs of the machine tool plant which
will include relocation of existing machines, replacement of old machines
and addition of more sophisticated facilities including numerically - con-
trolled machines and a climatized mounting room; (v) revamping of the exist-
ing utility installations; (vi) installation of modern pollution control
equipment; and (vii) a new centralized storage and materials handling
system, including a railroad connection to the plant, to streamline materials
flow and reduce handling costs. A detailed description of the project is
given in Annex 4-1 and the plant layout is shown in Annex 4-2.
B.   Observations
4.03      The proposed facilities and plant designs are based upon careful
identification of the bottlenecks in the present plants and were chosen
with the objective of further improving product quality and increasing pro-
ductivity.  1Te project can be implemented without significantly interfer-
ing with the production of the existing facilities, although in the case of
the malleable iron foundry, this will require that the expansion be carried
out in two phases. This foundry is designed in such a way that it could
be changed over to a nodular iron foundry, if required in the future by
shifting market demand, with only slight modifications and minor additions.
In the gray and nodular iron foundry, new production facilities will be added
without any major alterations to the existing facilities. Further expansion
of this foundcy beyond that contemplated by the project is not possible due
to lack of space.
4.04      Most of the existing facilities in the pipe fitting finishing plant
will continue to be utilized after the expansion. With the addition of
specialized production machines to this plant, Kikinda will be able to
produce pipe fittings of a larger range than hitherto possible (3/8" to
4' in diameter). In the case of the machine tool Dlant, the addition of
numerically - controlled equipment is essential for starting the production
of more specialized precision grinders. Kikinda has no prior experience



- 14 -
in operating these numerically - controlled machines, which require highly
skilled operators and programers; however, training facilities are avail-
able in Yugoslavia for such machines and, moreover, the Company plans to
train operators abroad with the help of its licensor, the Bryant Corporation
of the U.S., and equipment suppliers. In order to be competitive the Company
has to mechanize some of its operations. However, the Company plans do not
include the installation of sophisticated equipment to save labor.
4.05      Projected plans for infrastructure - power, gas, road and railroad
connection - development are satisfactory. During negotiations, the Company
has provided evidence that it has obtained commitments from the authorities
concerned for the timely development of these infrastructure facilities.
Further, the Company has received a formal expression of intent from Electro-
vojvodina that the latter will install at its own cost a new 35/10 KV trans-
former station near the plant site.
C.   Ecology
4.06      A new Federal law for environmental and pollution control, passed
recently, stipulates that all enterprises have to conform to certain general
pollution standards by the end of 1973 and must meet more stringent standards
by 1977. In a foundry, the major pollutants are dust and fumes, and to im-
prove the present situation at the plant and to satisfy the regulations,
Kikinda plans to install devices for dust and fume extraction in both found-
ries at a cost of about Din 10 million, representing some 10% of the cost of
the foundry equipment of the project.  Although water pollution is not a
major problem in a foundry, Kikinda, as a precaution, neutralizes water before
discharging it. Details of pollution control are given in Annex 4-3. The
measures proposed by the Company are judged to provide adequate pollution
control. The necessary equipment will be supplied locally and, therefore,
will not be eligible for Bank financing. During negotiations, the Company has
agreed that the planned environmental protection measures will be implemented
and maintained.
D.   Labor Force
4.07      At the end of 1972, there were 2,084 employees in Kikinda, including
415 persons in the machine tool plant. Details are given in Annex 4-4. Found-
ry labor productivity is currently low, as reflected by the requirement of
between 90 and 100 manhours per ton of castings. The Bank has projected the
labor productivity in Kikinda to improve to 50 manhours per ton of castings
upon completion of the project which is reasonable considering that compar-
able foundries in Western Europe require 35-50 manhours per ton. To achieve
this goal, Kikinda would need at least 30% more employees compared to the
present level and this has been assumed in the financial projections. How-
ever, the Company is rather optimistic regarding additional employment and
believes that a 20% increase in manpower would be adequate, partly because,
under the self-management system, workers are basically reluctant to hire
more labor than absolutely necessary since that reduces the surplus that
is available for distribution to them. Therefore, during negotiations



- 15 -
assurances were received from the Company that it will maintain an adequate
labor force to meet fully the needs of the project.
E.   Project Execution
4.08      Kikinda will have primary responsibility for project execution.
With several expansions to its credit, the Company management is basically
well experienced to carry out the project. The main burden of project exe-
cution will rest with Kikinda's expansion department, which is headed by a
committee consisting of directorsof operating departments. Although
their caliber is high, tnis arrangement is not considered satisfactory for
the large-scale expansion envisaged because of an apparent lack of coordina-
tion among them even at the present early stage of project implementation,
and the question whether they could devote adequate time to the project in
view of their other operational responsibilities. An expansion section
completely separate from the operating departments with well-defined responsi-
bilities and authority is essential for proper project execution. During
negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances from the Company that it will
form such a functional section with Mr. Lepedat, a well-experienced foundry
expert, as the chief and assign adequate full-time staff as required for
the implementation of the project.
4.09      Also, the Company requires assistance in the preparation of specifi-
cations for international competitive bidding and evaluation of tenders. For
this purpose, therefore, the Company, hired in September, 1973, Hayek Engineer-
ing A.G., as experienced Swiss consulting firm.
4.10      Civil construction and erection of equipment will be carried out by
Yugoslav contractors, while Kikinda's own construction department will be re-
sponsible for additions to and alterations of the existing facilities. Equip-
ment su.ppliers will provide assistarnce in erection and start-up, and provide
performance guarantees. These are satisfactory arrangements.
F. Proiect TIE'la
4. 11     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4-5.  Engineer-
ing and design of the project are well advanced; preparation of procurement
documents as well as civil construction of certain facilities have begun.
Orders for foreign equipment to be financed by the Bank are expected to be
placed during the first quarter of 1974.  Phase I of the malleable foundry
will become operational in the third quarter of 1974. Most other facilities
scheduled for completion in 1975 will become fully operational in 1976. The
delivery and construction schedules based on information provided by potential
equipment suppliers are considered realistic.
V. CAPITAL COST AIND FINANCING PLAN

/1   c. i. f. cost at plant.

5.02      Equipment cost estimates are derived from quotations received in the
first quarter of 1973 from suppliers in six different countries. The prevailing
import duties and taxes of about 27% on the c.i.f. value of foreign equipment at
the Yugoslav border have been added. Pre-operating and start-up expenses are
based on Kikinda's previous experience. Civil engineering and construction
costs are based on quotations received by the Company in early 1973. Physical
contingencies equivalent to slightly more than 10% of equipment and civil works
cost estimates are included; they are considered adequate in view of the
advanced stage of project preparation.
5.03      Furthermore, price contingencies of 6% per annum have been applied
to the cost of foreign equipment including import duties and taxes. As for
local equipment, construction and erection costs, the following rates have been
applied to cover anticipated inflation in Yugoslavia: 1973 - 10%; 1974 - 8%;
and 1975 and 1976 = 6% a year. The declining rates are based on the assump-
tion that the measures being taken to curb inflation will succeed. Total
assumed contingencies, therefore, amount to 22.7% of total fixed project cost.



- 17 -
The project cost estimates, including the physical and price contingencies,
are considered adequate.
5.04      Of the Din 591 million financing needed for the project, about
Din 290 million, or about 49%, are estimated to be required in foreign ex-
change. All equipment expected to be procured domestically has been allocated
to local currency expenditure and will be bid for only within Yugoslavia.
Yugoslav manufacturers are not expected to bid directly on the other (imported)
equipment, since it is not presently manufactured in Yugoslavia, but they are
expected to contribute local components estimated to average about 15% of the
value of foreign equipment.
B.   Working Capital
5.05      Kikinda's present working capital level is satisfactory.  Incremental
working capital requirements due to the project are estimated at Din 102.8 mil-
lion, of which about Din 10.3 million would be needed in foreign exchange;
these take into account recent Yugoslav regulations, which require the Company
to reduce its collection as well as payment periods and the Bank has accepted
the Company's target as desirable and obtainable. Details are given in
Annex 5-2. Working capital is to be financed from internal cash generation
and should actual requirements be somewhat higher than anticipated, Kikinda
is expected either to use some of its own cash generation (para. 5.07) or to
finance them with short-term credits.
C.   Financing Plan
5X06      The financing plan to cover the project's cost (para. 5.01) of
Din 591 million (US$38.1 million) includes Din 366 million (US$23.6 mil-
lion) from internal cash generation and the remaining Din 225 million
(US$14.5 million) from the proposed Bank loan.
5.07      All foreign exchange costs of machinery and equipment will be
financed by the Bank loan and the remaining costs will be met from internal
cash generation. A summary of the sources and application of funds (Annex 7-2)
during the implementation of the project follows:

5.08      The Bank loan would be for 14 years, including a grace period of
4 years, at an interest rate of 7-1/4% per annum plus a guarantee fee of 1-3/4%
accruing to the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina 1/, thus raising the total
effective cost of the Bank loan to 9%. The Bank loan will be guaranteed by
both the Federal Government and Jugobanka of Novi Sad. Strictly on project
grounds an 11-year loan, including 4 years of grace, would be adequate. How-
ever, the 14-year loan term is recommended instead to help relieve the country's
medium-term foreign exchange loan repayment obligations.
5.09      During the construction period (1973-1977), Kikinda's cumulative
cash generation is expected to be adequate to meet the project needs. How-
ever, due to a heavy concentration of expenditures on the project in 1974 and
1975, Kikinda may require short-term credits in 1975. Whatever additional
resources - foreign as well as local - might be needed to complete the project
and bring it into operations, including maintenance of an adequate working
capital level equivalent to a current ratio of at least 2:1, and independently
of whether the need for such additional funds is caused by a cost overrun or a
shortfall of cash generation, they are to be provided by the Jugobanka, on
terms satisfactory to the Bank. Assurances to this effect have been received
during negotiations.
1/ The Federal Government is the guarantor of the Bank loan. It, in turn,
is required by Yugoslav law to obtain a guarantee from the Republic or
Autonomous Province where the project is located; in this case Autonomous
Province of Vojvodina. Since Yugoslav law prevents the Federal Govern-
ment from accepting the guarantee fee, it has requested the Autonomous
Province of Vojvodina to receive this fee.



- 19 -
D.   Procurement and Disbursement:
5.10      The Bank loan would finance the c.i.f. foreign exchange cost (Yugoslav
border or port of entry) of equipment and spares. The Bank-financed items -
foreign equipment and spares - will be divided into 21 packages (8 packages for
foundries and the fitting finishing shop and 13 packages for the machines tool
plant), and will be procured following Bank guidelines.  All the 15 equipment
packages costing over US$100,000 equivalent each will be procured by interna-
tional competitive bidding. Tne remaining 6 packages costing less than
US$100,000 each (representing less than 6% of total foreign equipment cost)
would be obtained through a procedure under which contracts may be awarded
by the Company after having obtained four comparable bids from qualified
suppliers in at least three countries outside of Yugoslavia. A detailed
list of equipment to be procured under the Bank loan is contained in
Annex 5-3. It is recommended that for purposes of bid comparisons, prefer-
ence be given to local components of foreign bids to the extent of 15% of
the price of such components or the actual customs duty on similar imported
components, whichever is less.
5.11      For most of the domestic equipment (to be financed by the Company),
quotations have already been received from various suppliers. However, Kikinda
will place orders for most of the equipment only in the fourth quarter of 1973
after the procurement consultant (nara. 4.08) will have reviewed the speci-
fications. Civil construction work, for which competitive bidding within
Yugoslavia is required by law, will be carried out by Yugoslav contractors
under the direction of Kikinda. The Company has already awarded civil con-
struction contracts to two of the four Yugoslav contractors who had submitted
their bids.
5. *2     The estimated disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is shown in
Annex 5-4.  1: is based on detailed estimates of order placements, payment
schedu'les, and expected delivery times for equipment in line with the con-
struction schedule (para. 4.11).
VI. REVENUES, RAW MATERIALS, AND PRODUCTION COSTS
A.   Sales Revenues
6.01      Detailed assumptions on selling prices for each of the Company's
product lines and on aggregate sales build-up through 1983 are contained in
Annex 6-1 and Annex 3-3 respectively. As a result of the expansion project,
sales revenue from foundry products are expected to increase by about 170%
from Din 185 million in 1973 to Din 497 million in 1977, whten the project would
be fully operational. During the same period, sales proceeds from machine tools
would double from Din 81 million to Din 163 million, and revenue from various
services would rise from Din 32 million to Din 53 million. Total sales would
reach the level of Din 713 million in 1977 compared wi-th Din 298 million in the
current year. These projections assume that the foundries and the machine



- 20 -
current year. These projections assume that the foundries and the machine
tool department would operate at 80% and 75% of their respective rated capaci-
ties, based on two-shift operations. These assumptions are realistic compared
with Kikinda's past performance and the experience of comparable plants in
other countries.
6.02      Presently, exports, both to the convertible and clearing areas,
account for about 42% of total sales.  The share of exports is expected to
rise to 52% in 1977, when total sales would be nearly 2-1/2 times the 1973
level. Of the projected export earnings of Din 367 million in 1977, about
Din 288 million (78%) would be from the convertible area and Din 79 million
(22%) from the clearing area. Foundry products would account for nearly 85%
of total exports and machine tools for the balance of 15%.
6.03      Sales revenue has been calculated in current value terms and on
domestic sales exclude charges for freight and handling, which in Yugoslavia
are usually borne by customers. Selling prices (ex-factory) would continue
to vary for domestic sales, and for exports to clearing and convertible areas.
For financial projections, prices in current Dinars are assumed to rise by 4-6%
a year for all products except part of the pipe fittings to be sold locally.
B.   Raw Materials
6.04      The Company appears to be well assured of the supply of its main raw
materials, including pig iron, steel scrap, ferroalloys, coke, anthracite,
bentonite, quartz sand, resins and limestone (Annex 6-2).  Import require-
ments for all the above items are expected to be low except for ferroalloys
and resins a major portion of which need to be procured from abroad. But for
these two materials (ferroalloys and resins) also, no problems are foreseen in
meeting Kikinda's needs, especially because the foreign exchange and trade
regime gives priority to import of raw materials required for export production.
Moreover, Kikinda would have an adequate amount of foreign exchange from re-
tention quota 1/ to meet any shortfalls in domestic raw materials supply
through imports.
C.   Production Costs
6.05      Production cost estimates (Annex 6-3), like those of sales (para.
6.01), are based on 80% and 75% capacity utilizations of the foundries and
machine tool plant respectively. Present (1973) and projected (1977) production
costs on a per unit basis are given below separately for the different product
groups:
1/   Under the Yugoslav foreign exchange and trade system exporters are entitled
to a retention quota in foreign exchange equivalent to 20% of their
export revenue from convertible currency countries. This foreign ex-
change can be used freely by the companies concerned.

1977     6,182           12,484            7,341                 131,000
/1   Including costs of raw materials, supplies, utilities and labor, but
excluding general overhead expenses, depreciation, insurance and other
operating expenses.
/2   Universal grinders represent about half of Kikinda machine tool sales
in units.
6.06      It has been assumed that during the whole forecast period (1973-1983)
wage rates at Kikinda would increase by about 5% a year and raw materials
costs by 4-5%. During the period 1973 - 1977, to which the above table relates,
production cost per ton of malleable castings (at current prices) is expected
to decrease, in spite of inflation, by about 1% because of economies of scale,
rationalization, and the impact of new technology. Since the gray and nodular
foundry expansion is only in addition to the existing plant which is of rather
recent origin. the impact of new technology will not offset completely the
inflationary cost increases. As a result, per ton costs of gray and nodular
castings are expected to go up by 5%. In the case of pipe fittings, where the
ex-pansion is a relatively modest one (from 4,000 to 6,400 tons per year),
coscs per ton are expected to increase by about 11%, partly because of rapidly
risinc zinc prices. For a typical machine tool, the production cost per unit
would increase over the four-year period by 17%, partly because the Company
is ernbarking on the production of more sophisticated machine tools, which
would, of course, also demand higher prices.

7.02      Compared with Din 27 million in 1972, Kikinda is expected to show
a net income of Din 62 million in 1973, primarily due to lower depreciation
rates intended to be used by the Company from that year (1973) onward in line
with rates in Western foundries. As a result of the project, net sales are
expected to increase by Din 415 million, or by about 139% between 1973 and
1977, while net income after taxes go up by Din 75 million, or by about
120%. The fact that net income increases less rapidly than sales during the
construction period and even declines thereafter in absolute amounts is due
to the higher inflation rates assumed for production cost inputs as compared
to selling prices.  Net sales during project implementation are not expected
to drop because, as mentioned earlier (para. 4.03), the project will be
implemented without disturbing existing production facilities. Since a major
portion of net income after taxes will be needed to help finance the project,
agreement has been reached during negotiations that the Company will - until
the project is completed - distribute income to its workers only to the extent
that the annual depreciation plus the allocation to the Business Fund during
that period would still be sufficient for timely execution of the project.
B.   Financial Position
7.03      Balance sheet projections for 1973 through 1983 contained in Annex 7-3
are summarized below:
Selected Balance Sheet Items
(Din million)
1972    1973  1974   1975  1976  1977   1983
(Actual)
Net Working Capital            85.4       78    99    126   173   181    219

/1   Excluding surplus cash, which would be earmarked for further expansion.
77   Assuming no income distribution to workers.  All surplus cash allocated
to equity.



- 23 -
7.04      The long-term debt/equity ratio was satisfactory in 1972 and is
expected to remain strong during project implementation with a maximum debt
position of 38% being reached in 1975. Thereafter, the debt/equity ratio de-
clines and by 1983 Kikinda would have only 5% in debt, reflecting good pro-
fitability of the expanded plant; this is based on the assumption that
generally there will be no income distribution to the workers in excess of
5% annual increase in earnings per employee. For comparison purposes,
Kikinda's income statements and balance sheet projections, without the proposed
expansion, are given in Annexes 7-4 and 7-5 respectively.
7.05      The Company's liquidity position is satisfactory and is expected to
improve even during project implementation. The current ratio would have been
higher than shown above (and the equity build-up correspondingly slower) if
surplus funds generated had been included in current assets. A portion of
net income, except for the funds required for the project, could be distri-
buted to the workers, which is normal practice in Yugoslavia, and would then
not remain as surplus cash for allocation to equity.-In order to keep
the Company in a sound financial position, agreements have been reached during
negotiations that Kikinda will not in the course of project implementation,
without the prior consent of the Bank: (a) undertake additional capital in-
vestments or incur new debts in excess of Din 20 million equivalent in any
one year other than for the project; or (b) distribute income and/or make
other cash outlays other than for normal operations if the current ratio were
to fall below 2:1 after such income distribution and/or cash outlay. After
project completion, for any new investment or borrowing in excess of Din 20
million the Company will consult the Bank.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
7.06      The project provides a financial rate of return of 23.5% at current
value terms. ./  Detailed assumptions are contained in Annex 7-6.  Kikinda's
overall operations, which would have a rate of return of 8.4% without the
expansion project, are expected to yield 16.4% with the project.
7.07      Sensitivity tests have been conducted to determine the effects of
various events on the financial rate of return; they are shown in Annex 7-6 and
are summarized below:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Case                      Description                         Rate of Return (%)
1                         Base Case                                  23.5
2                         Sales revenue decrease 10%                 14.8
3                         Operating cost increase 20%                11.6
4                         One year project delay plus 15%
cost overrun                          9.2
5                         Sales revenue decrease 10% and
operating cost increase 5%            12.2
6                         Project cost increase 10% and
operating cost increase 10%          15.5
1/       In real terms,  the financial rate of return would be 19.3%.



- 24 -
7.08      The project has a low financial risk since the rate of return
remains above 9% even with such combinations of adverse conditions as
assumed in the above table. If revenues drop by 10% - which is equivalent
to about a 90% drop in the assumed exports to the clearing area or a 25%
decline in exports to the convertible area without any change in domestic
sales and without a corresponding reduction in operating costs - the return
would decrease to 14.8%. The return tends to be more sensitive to changes
in operating costs than capital costs (Annex 7-6). If production costs
were to increase by 5%, which would be equivalent to about a 10% increase in
the cost of raw materials, the return would drop to 21%. Since the probability
of having a serious delay in project completion and major cost overrun (the
two factors with the most adverse effect on the return) is rather low in view
of the advanced preparation of the project and its impending implementation,
the likelihood of the return falling below 15% is remote.
D.   Debt Service Coverage
7.09      Based on the projections and proposed financing plan, Kikinda's
long-term debt service coverage forecasts indicate the following:
Long-Term Debt Service Coverage Forecasts
1973    1974    1975    1976    1978 /1
Times Covered               2.5      3.7      4.2      3.3      3.9
/1   The year in which repayment of the Bank loan will begin.
7.10      Debt service coverage is satisfactory even during the implementation
of the project. However, according to Yugoslav law, the Company will also have
to generate sufficient foreign exchange to service its foreign commitments in-
cluding debt service. Funds available to the Company in foreign exchange and
its foreign currency requirements have, therefore, been analysed in Annex 7-7.
The analysis indicates that there would be enough foreign funds available to
meet projected needs, but that the position will be tight during construction,
primarily because interest on the Bank loan during that period will be paid
out of current operations and not be capitalized. During negotiations, assur-
ances were therefore, received from the Jugobanka that it will make foreign
exchange funds available to the Company, to the extent that the foreign ex-
change generated by Kikinda (through retention and depreciation quotas) is
not adequate to meet its repayment obligations in foreign exchange to the Bank.
E.   Break-Even Points
7.11      The profit break-even point in 1978, after completion of the project,
would be at about 57% of effective capacity of the plant. Due to the assumed
increases in production costs, the profit break-even would rise to 64% in 1983.
The cash break-even point in 1978 would be at about 61% of capacity. Further
details on break-even are given in Annex 7-8 .



- 25 -
F.   Major Risks
7.12      As regards the market, the sale of castings to the clearing area is,
to some extent, beyond the control of the Company. 1/ However, the Company
presently has long-term contracts - about 50% of total projected clearing
area sales-to supply castings to certain customers in the clearing area. It
is unlikely that revenues from exports to the clearing area would drop by
50% without at least some offsetting sales to convertible currency countries
or at home. But, as explained in para. 7.08, even if such a drastic decline
should occur, the project would still provide an adequate return. Another
risk in the project pertains to the technological changes occurring in
Western Europe and elsewhere with respect to the type of castings used in
automotive production. Malleable castings are slowly being replaced by
nodular castings. However, the Company is guarding against this risk (para.
4.03) by producing malleable casting with sufficient flexibility in the
design of the malleable iron foundry to change over to a nodular foundry
with only minor additions and alterations.
G.   Accounting and Audit Requirements
7.13      The Company's present accounting system follows the Yugoslav system
in which it is difficult and time consuming to transform financial statements
into a format wqhich would make them a more meaningful management tool. From
its previous association with the Bank (para. 2.02), the Company has gained
adequate experience to improve its internal accounting and is taking measures
to improve the accounting system further. Furthermore, agreement has been
reached during negotiations on the establishment by the end of 1973 of
separate accounts for the Bank project in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
7.14      Kikinda's accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting
Service (SAS), which is an autonomous government agency responsible for
financial inspection of Yugoslav enterprises. SAS annually conducts a
limited review of the statutory financial statements, primarily to ensure
that enterprises' financial transactions comply with Yugoslav law; it does
not perform an audit nor provide a report on the accounts. SAS is cur-
rently planning a training program under which its staff will be trained
by an international accounting firm in auditing methods consistent with Bank
requirements. 2/ During negotiations, agreements were reached that the Company
1/   Because agreements on exports are reached at the government-government
level in the clearing area countries.
2/   The training program would be carried out by accounting consultatLts
acceptable to the Bank and employed on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank. A few international accounting firms have sub-
mitted proposals for the training program scheduled to start in
January 1974.



- 26 -
would invite SAS to undertake annual audits of Kikinda's 1974 and 1975
accounts as a part of the SAS's on-the--sob training program of its staff
in collaboration with the international firm of accountants. In the event
that SAS is not thereafter able to achieve a consistent and satisfactory
standard of auditing, Kikinda will retain, at the request of the Bank, an
experienced independent auditing firm.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.01      The incremental economic rate of return for the project is about
18% in real terms. 1/ Prices used for this calculation are shown in Annex
7-6 and the economic sensitivity analysis is given in Annex 8-1. Export
prices (c.i.f. border) of Kikinda to the convertible currency area have
been used as the accounting prices to calculate sales revenues. All ma-
terial inputs, most of which are of domestic origin, have been valued at
international prices (c.i.f., Yugoslav border). Labor costs have been
based on market wage rates. The economic rate of return is generally
sensitive to changes in costs and benefits to the same extent as the
financial return. A decrease of 10% in revenue lowers the economic rate to
11%. A combination of 10% higher capital costs and 10% higher operating
costs would reduce the return to 12%. Thus the project has a good return
under foreseeable circumstances.
B.   Competitiveness
8.02      Kikinda is predominantly export oriented.  It is highly significant
that about 67% of its incremental revenue would be from exports. As discussed
in Chapter III and Annexes 3-1 and 3-2, ex-factory selling prices of Kikinda's
products are generally lower than prices for comparable products in Western
Europe. Even if international prices were to fall by 10%, most of Kikinda's
products would still be competitive. Yugoslavia has a nominal protection of
between 25 and 30% (customs duties and other related taxes) on industrial
products including castings and machine tools. Kikinda does not require this
duty shelter other than to be protected against products that might be sold
below marginal cost in Yugoslavia.
C.   Linkages and Employment
8.03      The project is crucial for the projected expansion of a variety of
essential industries (para. 3.04) which are targetted to expand on average
at over 8.5% per year in the foreseeable future. Their rapid growth would
not be possible without the availability of adequate castings and machine
tools. While these could, of course, be imported, Kikinda is able to help
fill this gap competitively together with very substantial savings in
foreign exchange.
1/   At current prices, the economic rate of return is 21.5%.



- 27 -
8.04      The enterprise is located in the predominantly agricultural region
of Vojvodina, whose industrial potential is yet to be fully exploited. The
project would help to expand the industrial base of the region, thus keep
additional industrial capacity away from existing industrial concentration
centers and help absorb trained personnel who presently migrate abroad.
While the direct employment benefits from this project are small since only
some 630 persons are expected to be added to Kikinda's labor force, the indi-
rect employment creation is higher at an estimated level of approximately
950 (Annex 8-3).
D.   Comparative Advantage
8.05      Kikinda as well as other foundries in Yugoslavia have substantial
advantage especially in labor costs compared with Western European foundries.
For example, at present, the average wage per manhour in Kikinda is hardly
US$0.8 as against US$3.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany.
E.   Estimated Foreign Exchange Effects
8.06      One of the most important benefits from the project is the increase
in the annual net foreign exchange earnings. The incremental net foreign
exchange earnings from the Kikinda expansion would be about US$10 million
a year (Annex 8-2) and would more than offset in two years after project
completion the total foreign exchange cost of the project estimated at about
US$19 million. The total net foreign exchange earnings of the Company after
all foreign operating costs and debt service payments are calculated to
range from US$20 million in 1977 to US$23 million in 1983 which is more than
the total foreign exchange cost of the project. Furthermore, the total net
foreign exchange impact of the project can be considered as the total value
of incremental production less its production cost at international prices,
because if Kikinda does not expand, its incremental domestic sales will have
to be met from imports. Foreign exchange earnings and foreign exchange
savings combined then would amount to about Din 264 million (US$17 million)
in 1977, the Company's first full year of operations upon completion of the
project.
8.O7      Faced with mounting debt repayment obligationas on short and
medium-term suppliers' credit, and an increasing gap in the balance of
trade, Yugoshavia has a critical need to raise its foreign exchange
earnings frorm exports.
IX. RECOMMIENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, the following principal agreements were
reached with the Jugobanka and the Company:



- 28 -
A.   Agreements that the Jugobanka will:
(a)  provide project completion and cost-overrun guarantees
(para. 5.09); and
(b)  make foreign exchange funds available to the Company,
if the latter's foreign exchange funds are not sufficient
to cover its obligations (para. 7.10).
B.   Agreements that the Company will:
(a)  not sell, lease, transfer or assign its rights or
assets (para. 2.05);
(b)  introduce and maintain adequate safety measures
(para. 2.07);
(c)  implement and maintain strict environmental protection
measures (para. 4.06);
(d) maintain an adequate labor force (para. 4.07);
(e) form a well-staffed expansion section
(para. 4.08);
(f)  pay 1-3/4% guarantee fees to the Autonomous Province
of Vojvodina (para 5.08);
(g)  allocate adequate internally generated funds for the
project (para. 7.02);
(h)  observe certain financial covenants to maintain a sound
financial position (para. 7.05); and
(i)  make adequate provision for proper external auditing
(para. 7.13).
9.02      Based on foregoing agreements, the project provides a sound basis
for a loan to Kikinda equivalent to US$14.5 million for 14 years, including
a 4-year grace period.

YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF TERMS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES
1.        In a broad sense, the art of founding may be described as making a
cavity in the sand and filling it with fluid metal. In the cold state, the
metal retains the shape and contour of the cavity and becames a metal casting.
2.        The term "iron castings" covers a wide range of iron - carbon -
silicon alloys containing from 2% to 4% carbon and 0.25% or more of silicon
in combination with varying percentages of manganese, sulphur and phosphorous,
and sometimes one or more of special alloying elements, such as nickel, chro-
mium, molybdenum and vanadium.
3.        There are various kinds of iron castings; they are roughly grouped
as chilled-iron castings, gray-iron castings, alloyed-iron castings, malleable
castings and nodular-iron castings. In general, castings are made by mixing
and melting together different grades of pig iron, foundry scrap, steel scrap
and ferro-alloys or other metals depending on the type of casting. Further
details may be found in "Cast Metals Handbook" published periodically by the
American Foundryman's Association.
A.   Types of Castings
Gray Iron Castings
4.        Gray iron castings are made of pig iron, of mixtures of pie iron
and steel, or of mixtures of pig iron, steel and other metals in smaller
amounts. They are frequently sold under trade names, such as Mechanite,
Gunite, Ermalite, Ferrosteel, Gun-iron, etc. Chemically, gray iron castings
include a large number of metals covering a wide range in composition, with
carbon varying from 2 to 4 percent, and silicon from 0.5 to 3 percent with
small amounts of other metal according to the type of product produced.
Nodular Iron Castings
5.        Nodular iron, also called ductile iron and sheroid graphite iron, is
a relatively new grade introduced around 1948 and is gaining in popularity
over malleable castings due to better economy in production. It has been used
for castings having section from 1/8 inch up to 40 inches thick. It is produced
by treating molten iron that normally would produce gray castings with magnesium
alloys. The addition of these alloys results in castings which have the carbon
present in spheroid form.  Castings so made have relatively high strength and
better ductility than ordinary gray iron. Several types of nodular castings
with varying structures can be developed by alloying or heat treating.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
Malleable Castings
6.        They are of two kinds, known as white heart, or European; and black
heart, or American; these terms indicate differences in the process and the
products and countries of origin. Malleable castings are comparatively soft
and can be bent without breaking. Malleable castings contain 2.25 to 3.0
percent carbon, 0.3 to 0.5 percent manganese, 0.6 to 1.15 percent silicon and
small amounts of sulphur and phosphorous; the exact composition, particularly
with respect to silicon, being varied according to the type of castings.
In the "green" state, these castings are relatively brittle and possess poor
mechanical properties; therefore, annealing of these castings is essential.
After annealing a metal similar to soft steel but of much coarser grain and
less ductile is obtained.
Alloyed Castings
7.        These are used most exclusively for applications where resistance
to wear, to heat (including elongation), and to corrosion; high strength of
castings, rigidity, damping of vibrations and amenability to heat treatment
are of prime importance. The alloying elements - silicon, nickel, chromium,
molybdenum, copper and titanium - are used in varying quantities depending
on the type of use. Many of these irons are patented compositions and are
sold under various trade names such as Ni-resist, Causal metal, Silal, Ni-
Crosilal. etc.
Chilled-Iron Castings
8.        These castings are extremely hard on the surface.  Cast iron with
some sections is purposely cooled so fast by chills that the carbon is re-
tained in combined form, while other sections are allowed to cool gradually,
so that the carbon is retained in the form found in gray iron. Such castings
are used for rolls and various other articles which require a hard, wear-
resisting surface.
B.   Processes of Production
9.        The products of a foundry vary in size, complexity, the metal used,
the type of castings, the number of castings produced, the techniques of
production employed, the precision of the castings and the extent to which
they are finished; these differences are most often inter related.
There are several important and quite unrelated stages in the
production of iron castings
-    Design and pattern making
-    Preparation of Sand
-    Core-Making



ANNEX 1-1
Page 3
Mold-Making
Melting
-    Pouring
-    Cleaning, finishing and inspecting.
Design and Pattern Making
10.       Design and construction of the pattern is perhaps the most important
single factor in the production of castings. Not only the patterns must be
dimensionally accurate, but full consideration must be given to making them
meet the requirements of the foundry equipment and technique. To make the sand
mold, it is first necessary to make a pattern of the part to be cast, which
will leave its imprints in the sand. There are several types of patterns,
each fulfilling a specific need. Patterns may be made of wood or metal, as
required, and used in conjunction with hand-molding or machine molding
methods, depending upon the number of castings to be made and the degree of
precision required. When a large number of castings have to be produced, a
metal pattern is made in the pattern room by skilled patternmakers.
Preparation of Sand
11.       The quality and composition of the molding sand is very important.
It must contain clay as well as silica and be sufficiently loose to allow
gases to escape during casting. The particle size of the sand is also impor-
tant as it has a bearing on the surface quality of the castings. Clay content
in the sand should be about 18-20% to achieve the necessary cohesion of the
mixture in the mold.
Core-Making
12.       A core is nothing more than a solid shape made of sand.  Sand is
rammed either by hand or machine or blown into a core box. When the core
box is filled with sand and the excess sand is removed with a straight edge,
it is turned over and the box lifted from the core thus formed. The ramming
operation sometimes includes placement of reinforcing rods, or wires, for
strengthening purposes. The cores thus prepared are baked to make them hard,
strong and smooth. There are various processes to make cores. The interior
surfaces of castings are generally formed by cores, which are inserted in
the mold after the pattern has been withdrawn. In some molding operations,
cores are used to form exterior surface of castings.
Mold-Making
13.       For making molds, the molder places a pattern on a flat plate and
then puts a molding box, or "flask", on this plate and fills it with prepared
sand. The sand is compacted by ramming and is finished by hand with special



ANNEX 1-1
Page 4
tools. Next, this pattern (first part) is removed, the molder having made
half a mold. Then he makes the second half the same way and, after removing
this pattern (second part), the two flasks are carefully put together to form
the complete mold. A channel, or "runner", is cut in the sand through which
the molten metal is poured and also other channels known as "risers" to allow
excess metal to escape. Sometimes, depending upon the type and shape of
castings, cores are placed upon the type provided for the purpose in the
main mold, before the two flakes are put together to form the complete mold.
Fundamentally, the machine-molding method differs little from the process
previously described for the manual or floor-molding operations, the main
difference being that the ramming and the removal of the patterns from the
sand are performed by machine. Also construction of gates and risers will
be performed by the machine. However, the placement of cores, patching and
finishing of the mold still remain as the chief function of the molder.
There are various methods of making molds. A relatively new molding method
known as "Disamatic molding process" - flaskless molding - lends itself to
the production of molds by machine methods without using flask.
Melting
14.       Generally, three types of furnaces are or have been employed by
foundries for melting iron. These are: (1) the cupola furnace; (2) the
pneumatic furnace; and (3) the electric furnace.
15.       The cheapest and the oldest type, and the most extensively used is
the cupola, which is, essentially, a vertical steel cylinder lined with refrac-
tory materials. Within the cupola are placed alternate layers of coke and
iron; air is forced through them and the iron is melted by contact with hot
gases. The molten metal drips down through the incandescent fuel to the
bottom of the furnace and, when the plug is removed, the iron runs into
ladles ready for pouring operations.
16.       The pneumatic furnace is used to produce certain high-grade cast
irons, because tests can be made during the melting process and because the
metal is more easy to control in it than in the cupola. The entire charge is
placed in the furnace at one time, melted down in one mass on hearth, and
tapped when the proper temperature and composition are reached.
17.       Because quality can be quite accurately controlled and higher temper-
atures secured, the electric furnace is sometimes used in melting cast iron.
The entire charge is placed in the furnace at one time. Since the cost is
ordinarily greater than in the cupola, the electric furnace is generally used
only when special quality control is required.
Pouring
18.       The molten metal withdrawn from the furnace is transferred to the
refractory ladle which is carried to the pouring bay where the metal is poured
into the molds. The casting temperature and the pouring time must be carefully



ANNEX 1-1
Page 5
controlled to avoid casting defects. Once the castings have been cooled,
they are shaken out. The gates and risers are broken off and returned to
the furnace for remelting, while the sand is screened and either thrown away
or sent back for re-use.
Cleaning, Finishing and Inspecting
19.       Adhering sand is removed by brushing or tumbling in a revolving
barrel, or by the abrasive action of sand blasting. Rough places and fins in
castings are smoothed and settled by grinding and chipping. A quick inspection
is generally made when castings are delivered to the cleaning room so that no
further time may be wasted on defective work. After the cleaning, a thorough
inspection is made and satisfactory castings are selected for shipment.
20.       Certain types of castings - nodular iron and malleable castings, -
are heat treated to make castings stronger and more resistant to shock and
fatigue. The finished castings are placed in the annealing furnace, heated
in the furnace to the desired temperature and cooled gradually to the room
temperature. The temperature at which the castings are heated and the cooling
rate depend on the type of castings.

YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
M)RKER&5 SELF-MANAGEMENT
1.        Workers' self-management is a common feature of Yugoslav enterprises.
In Kikinda, as in other "work organizations" in the social sector, this system
operates through direct as well as indirect participation of employees in
making decisions. The organizational framework of self-management mainly
consists of Work Units, Work Units Council, the Workers' Assembly, the Work-
ers' Council, the Managing Board, and the Genetal Manager.
A.   Direct Participation
Work Units and Work Units Council
2.        Economic units are departmental and functional units within the
enterprise. Chief of every Economic Unit is a member of the Work Units
Council which pays particular attention to work incentives, better utilization
of human and capital resources and improved productivity. The council has a
president and a vice-president elected by its members. In case of dispute
among the Work units, an arbitration commission is appointed whose decision
is final.
Workers Assembly
3.        The Work Units Council is responsible in its work to the Workers'
Assembly in which all the employees participate directly in making decisions
on key issues. The assembly could be convened any time under the following
circumstances: (a) the initiative of the General Manager or on its own initia-
tive; (b) when one-tenth of the workers demand it; and (c) on demand by any
socio-political organization. The Assembly is presided over by the President
of the Work Units' Council.
B.   Indirect Participation
4.        Since it is not possible for workers to make all decisions by
themselves, some of their rights and management functions are delegated to
management bodies elected by them, i.e. Workers' Council, Board of Management,
etc.
Central Workers' Council
5.        The Central Workers' Council is the most important management body.
It consists of 28 members elected for two years by the employees of Kikinda.
Nobody can be elected for two consecutive terms. Every year, half the mem-
bers of the Council are replaced by newly-elected members.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
6.        The council sets forth the policy of the enterprise.  Its approval
is necessary on major investments, annual investment plans, and appropriation
of company profits. To facilitate its operation, the council has different
committees for: investment, internal control, technical Improvement, standard
of living, personnel, discipline, work standards, waste disposal, accident
prevention and health protection, distribution of personal income, awards of
medals, petitions and complaints, and job competition and reappointments. In
addition to these standard coumitteeu, some others can be appointed to deal
with specific problems as the need arises.
Executive Board
7.        The Executive Board, a body of the Workers' Council, consists of
9 members, including the General Manager. The members are elected by the
Central Workers' Council for two years. No member can be elected for more
than one term in a row. Half the members (excluding the General Manager)
are replaced every year. The members elect among themselves the president
and his deputy. However, the General Manager cannot be elected the president
of the Executive Board.
8.        The Board has certain independence in the exercise of its functions
as laid down by by-laws or other enactments of the enterprise. It drafts
working and development plans and programs, and submits them to the Workers'
Council for approval. In general, the Board is responsible for the proper
functioning of the enterprise. It consists of mostly skilled workers and
office employees with higher education.
General Manager
9.        The General Manager is elected by the Workers' Council but he must
have the following qualifications and experience: (a) university-level
specialist's training and 6 years of experience in management positions;
or (b) high school education combined with 12 years of experience in manage-
ment positions.
10.       The Workers' Council sets up a committee to consider all applica-
tions for the position of General Manager, and proposes the election of the
candidate who best meets the prescribed conditions. The term of the General
Manager is for four years, but he is eligible to compete for a second term.
According to the Company Statute, 4 months before the expiry of the General
Manager's first term, an open competition for reappointment should be
announced. In case the General Manager does not enjoy the confidence of the
Workers' Council and the Executive Board, he could be relieved of his duty
even before the expiration of his term.
11.       The General Manager is independent in his functions and is only respon-
sible to the Central Workers' Council. He carries out the decisions of managing



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
bodies, represents the company outside, concludes contracts on behalf of the
firm, and looks after the application of legal measures. He formulates the
business policy of the enterprise and is responsible for the attainment of
good business results through increased production, economy and profitability.
12.       The present General Manager of the Kikinda Foundry is Pajic Rade
Miroslav, 39. A graduate of the School of Chemical Engineering, Belgrade,
Pajic has had more than 12 years of experience in various management positions
in Kikinda. He worked as Chief of Laboratory, Main Metallurgist of the Mallea-
ble and Nodular Castings Plants, Chief of the Production Development Department,
Director of the Malleable Castings Department, Director of the Nodular Castings
Department and Deputy General Manager before becoming General Manager in March
1971. He is an active member of many professional associations as well as
socio-political organizations. He is President of the Executive Council of
the Federal Machine Tool Producers Association (Masino-Union), Belgrade, and
also of the Credit CoGmittee of Jugobanka, Novi Sad.

ANNEX 2-2
Page 1
YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
1.        The plant is located in the town of Kikinda (population:  40,000),
about 130 km north of Belgrade near the Romanian border, and is about 76 meters
above sea level.  The plant consists of four main production facilities -
malleable foundry, gray and nodular foundry, fitting finishing plant and
machine tool plant - which are located in separate buildings as shown in the
plant layout (Annex 4-2).
2.        The malleable foundry produces exclusively black hearth malleable
iron castings for the automotive industry and pipe fittings ana has a capac-
ity of 11,500 TPY. The gray and nodular iron foundry produces gray iron
castings (mainly hand-molded) for Kikinda's own machine tool production and
nodular iron castings (mainly machine-molded) for automotive and miscellaneous
other industries. The gray and nodular foundry has a capacity of 900 TPY of
gray iron and 4,500 TPY of nodular iron castings; the nodular iron capacity
is expected to rise to 7,500 TPY in 1974, after the completion of the exist-
ing project. The present pipe fitting finishing plant has a capacity to
handle 3,800 to 4,000 TPY of fittings of 3/8" to 2" in size. The machine
tool plant presently produces about 350 units, equivalent to about 900 TPY,
of grinders, radial drills, and hydraulic parts.
3.        The existing principal facilities of the Kikinda plant are as follows:
A. Malleable Iron Foundry
Melting Plant
4.        Facilities for the production of liquid iron consist of two batteries
of cupola furnaces with furnace charging systems and liquid iron receivers.  The
melting plant which delivers liquid iron to the fitting-molding line, has a
cold blast cupola with 2 furnaces of 4-ton/hour capacity each. Thnese furnaces
work alternatively to meet the liquid iron needs. There is an electirc induc-
tion receiver (600 KVA) with a 4-ton/hr. capacity. The liquid iron is trans-
ferred to the pouring lines through hand-pushed ladles on a monorail system.
This melttng plant will be dismantled to make room for the new electric furnaces
before the second phase of the project implementation. This plant was completed
in 1961 and some repairs were made in 1970.
5.        The melting plant which provides liquid iron to the molding lines
for making automotive and other castings, consists of one battery of two hot
blast cupola furnaces of 4-ton/hr. capacity - each working alternatively, one
electric induction receiver (600 KVA) of 4-ton/hr. capacity and two 50-cycle
induction furnaces each with a 4-ton holding capacity. These furnaces are
primarily used for superheating and correcting of liquid iron.  Hand-pushed
ladles mounted on a monorail system are being used for transferring liquid
iron to the pouring line. This melting plant was constructed in 1965 and
was overhauled in 1970; it will be used even after the implementation of
the proposed project.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
Molding Lines
6.        There are two molding lines for fittings production and one molding
line for automotive castings.
7.        Molding Line No. 1:  The capacity of this line is about 4,610 TPY.
There are seven pairs of cope and drag molding machines for fittings and each
pair has a capacity of 100 molds per hour. This molding line includes a 6-
meter/minute transfer car conveyor line with core setting, pouring and cool-
ing areas. This line is provided with an automatic weighing system. Prepared
sand is transported to the mold-making machines through rubber conveyors.
There are overhead sand bins for temporary storage of prepared sand. The
flask size used in this line is 400 x 330 x (100 x 2) mm. A shakeout with
a capacity of 0.5 tons to separate castings from sand is located adjacent
to this line. Used sand is transported out of this area through rubber
conveyors. This molding line will be dismantled after the completion of
Phase I of the proposed project.
8.        Molding Line No. 2:   This line has a capacity of 850 TPY, but is
operated only part-time owing to its worn out condition. This line comprises
a roller conveyor line for mold assembly, pouring and cooling, four pairs of
cope and drag molding machines with a total capacity of 140 molds per hour
and a 0.5 ton shake-out grate. The conveyor system for the transportation
of prepared sand for molding line No. 1 is also used for the molding line
No. 2. There are separate overhead bins for prepared sand. This molding
line will also be discontinued after the completion of Phase I of the
project.
9.        Molding Line No. 3: This line is primarily for automotive castings
and has a capacity of 6,000 TPY. This molding line includes eight pairs of
cope and drag molding machines with a total capacity of 280 molds/hour, roller
conveyor lines for core-setting, mold-assembly, pouring, cooling and flask
transfer to the molding mechines. This molding line receives prepared scand
from a different source than No. 1 & 2 molding lines and the other serves
molding line No. 3. The capacity of both the sand preparation plants is
40 m3/hr. each.
10.       The sand preparation plant which provides the fitting-molding lines
with uniform sand, includes a sand-loading device (5-ton/hr), a rotary dryer
for new silica sand (5-ton/hr), a sand-preparation process line (40 m3/hr)
and a rubber belt conveyor system (40 m3/hr) for transferring the prepared
sand. The capacity of this plant will be increased during Phase II of the
project.
11.       The sand preparation plant, which serves the automotive castings
molding line, includes a sand-loading device (5-ton/hr), a rotary dryer
(5-ton/hr), a sand-prgparation process line (40 m3/hr), and a rubber belt
conveyor system (40 m /hr) for transporting prepared sand to molding machines.
During Phase I of the project, this plant will be rearranged.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
Core-making
12.       Facilities for the making of cores consist of two core rooms located
adjacent to respective molding lines. The core room near molding lines Nos.
1 & 2 comprises a core sand conveyor system (3-ton/hr), sand-preparation
equipment (3-ton/hr), necessary core-making equipment for oil sand, hot box
and shell cores, sand distribution systems, conveyor for core handling, and
chamber drying ovens for cores. Cores are supplied to the fitting-molding
line through a monorail system; a second monorail is available for the trans-
portation of cores within the core room. During Phase II of the project,
some minor alterations and modifications would be made in this core room.
13.       The core-making facilities adjacent to the existing molding line
No. 3 comprise one 2-ton/hr sand preparation equipment, core-making machines
and a rotary dryer (5-ton/hr). These facilities will be rearranged during
the implementation of Phase I of the project.
Casting Finishing
14.       To insure adequate cooling of castings, they are stored temporarily
near the shake-out grate. From this area, castings are transported to the
cleaning room by fork lifts.
Cleaning Room
15.       In this section, de-finning, finishing, cleaning and initial inspec-
tion of castings are done. This section is equipped with 16 double-end grinders,
3 large blasting machines, 4 small blasting machines, a number of benches for
manual chipping and grinding operations, 2 straightening presses and an elec-
tro-magnetic testing apparatus. Some of the cleaning room equipment was pur-
chased in 1968/69, During the implementation of Phase I of the project, this
section will be relocated.
Heat Treatment Facilities
16.       There are two elevator annealing furnaces for tempering and stress-
relieving. One has a capacity of 8-ton/charge and the other 10-ton/charge.
Apart from this, there is one low temperature continuous furnace (0.7-ton/hr),
one high temperature continuous furnace (0.7-ton/hr) and four chamber furnaces.
At the end of the continuous furnaces, oil bath and water bath facilities are
available. The continuous furnaces were installed in 1969. No changes in
this section are envisaged.
Observation
17.       The present facilities in the malleable iron foundry are well kept
and well maintained even though some of the equipment is very old and needs
replacement. The entire foundry is operated on two shifts per day (5 days
per week plus one Saturday per month) with the exception of some parts of
the cleaning room with a capacity for only one shift working per day which



ANNEX 2-2
Page 4
is sufficient for present production level, and of the heat treatment facil-
ities which are working 3 shifts per day owing to capacity constraints. The
bottlenecks which prevent higher production in the malleable plant are the
limited heat treatment and molding capacities.
B.   Gray and Nodular Iron Foundry
Melting Plant
18.       The gray and nodular iron foundry has only melting plant which con-
sists of one battery of two hot blast cupola furnaces of 4-5 tons/hr capac-
ity. These furnaces operate alternately to meet the liquid iron demand for
gray and nodular iron casitngs. In the first two shifts, liquid iron for
nodular castings is produced and, in the third shift, liquid iron for gray
castings is produced. The melting plant includes sufficient charging carts
and devices. A vibrating desulfuring unit (2 tons) is mounted next to the
cupola furnaces. Molten iron is charged into this unit where calcium carbide
is used to lessen the sulfur content and to improve the ductility of castings.
Slag is removed and base iron is added to the 4-ton coreless induction hold-
ing furnace (500 KVA) for superheating and corrections. Molten metal is
poured from this furnace into a delivery ladle; ferromagnesium is added,
under control, to the ladle if the metal is meant for nodular castings.
Bridge cranes, with a capacity of 15 tons, in the main bay, are used for
the liquid iron transfer.
Molding Lines
19.       There are three molding lines - two machine-molding lines for nodular
castings and one hand-molding line for gray castings - which are presently
operating; and one more machine-molding line is currently being installed.
20. (a) Molding Line No. 1: This line is a hand-molding line capable of
producing castings up to 900 TPY and has a slinger station for the gray iron
castings, for the machine tools. Total area covered by this line is about
460 m2. A sand conveying and ramming device of 10 m3/hr of sand capacity is
also available. Since gray iron is produced only in the third shift, this
line is operated only in the third shift. The molten metal is transported
to this line by overhead bridge crane (5.5 tons).
21. (b) Molding Line No. 2: This is a cope and drag type molding line with
two pairs of molding machines (70 molds/hr) and has a capacity of 1,700 TPY.
This line consists of two roller-conveyor lines for core-setting, mold-assembly,
pouring, cooling and flask transfer to the molding machines. Various sizes of
flasks are used in this line. The sand for making molds is transported to
this line by overhead rubber conveyor belts and is stored temporarily in over-
head sand bins. Two shakeout grates (0.5 ton) are located at the end of each
roller path conveyor. Castings are separated from the sand at these shakeout
grates and are stored temporarily at this area for cooling. The used sand
is transported out of this area through conveyor belts. This line will be
dismantled during project implementation.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 5
22. (c) Molding Line No. 3: This line has a capacity of 2,800 TPY of cast-
ings and is equipped with 2 pairs of molding machines (25 and 30 molds/hr).
This line comprises four roller-conveyor lines for core-setting, mold-assembly,
pourings, cooling and flask transfer to the molding machines. Prepared sand
is brought to the molding machines through overhead conveyor belts (30 m3/hr)
and is temporarily stored in overhead sand bins, from which the molding
machines are fed. The molten iron is poured into the molds by using an
overhead hand-pushed monorail system. Two shakeout grates (0.3 ton and
0.5 ton) are used to separate castings from the molds and the used sand is
transported out of this area through conveyor belts. Even after the comple-
tion of the project, this line will be used without any major alterations.
23. (d) Molding Line No. 4: This line under construction is expected to be
completed by the end of 1973. This is a Shell molding line and is different
from the other lines in the sense that it uses dry pre-coated sand while the
others use wet sand. Therefore, the sand preparation unit is also a part of
this line. This line also has its own cleaning room facilities. Ti,e capacity
of this line is 3,000 TPY; however, it can be increased up to 4,000 TPY depend-
ing upon the type of castings produced. In this plant, sand from a 2-ton/hr.
sand preparation process facility is transported to two shell molding machines
(30 cycles/hr) by a 2-ton/hr. sand handling elevator. There are four Shell
core-making machines (40 cycles/hr.) capable of producing up to 390,000 cores
per year. Sand fur core making is stored in four sand bunkers each with 0.7
m3 capacity. The molding line is equipped with a cooling tunnel which has a
10,000 N m3/hr gas suction device. The molds are brought to the molding line
through an overhead monorail system. Molten iron is transported to the mold-
ing line from the holding furnace by monorial. Metal pouring and initial cool-
ing is done in the molding line and the castings are separated from the mold
at a 0.5 ton shakeout grate. With the use of a 0.2 ton console crane, cast-
ings are transferred from the molding line to a cooling conveyor line which
takes the castings to a cooling tunnel. Total cooling time is about 2.5
hours. After cooling, the castings are removed from the conveyor for clean-
ing. The cleaning section of this plant has work benches for cutting of
castings, special grinding machines for cutting and grinding, double end
grinding machines, belt conveyors and electromagnetic separators. Finished
products are then sent to the storage area.
Sand Preparation Plant
24.       The sand preparation plant for the three molding lines (Nos. 1, 2 &
3) has a capacity of 40 m3/hr of sand. This piant consists of a sand loading
device (5 m3/hr.), a rotary dryer (5 m3hr.), two sand mixers (15 m3/hr. each)
and conveyor belt systems for transporting prepared sand. This plant was in-
stalled in 1969 and will continue to operate, with slight modifications, even
after the proposed expansion.
Core-making
25.       The core-making plant serves molding lines Nos. 1, 2 & 3 and is
equipped with core sand preparation devices (2-ton/hr), a 15-liter core-making
machine (50 cycles/hr.), a 7.5-liter core-making machine (60 cycles/hr.), a
roller path for cores handling, chamber dryers for cores and sufficient core
storage shelves.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 6
Casting Finishing
26.       The facilities for finishing is primarily used for castings from
the molding lines Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Cleaning facilities include a chamber
blasting machine (2 x 6 m), a continuous blasting machine for nodular castings,
console-type grinding machines, cut-off grinding machines, necessary work
benches and floor cleaning area.
27.       For the heat treatment of castings, there is an elevator annealing
furnace (12-ton/charge). The castings are charged into this furnace with the
use of a charging cart and are moved to this area by an overhead bridge crane
(2.5 ton). No changes in this section are envisaged in the project.
Observations
28.       This plant is fairly new (installed in 1969) and is well operated
and maintained. With the addition of the new molding line - no. 4-Shell
molding line - the present production constraint regarding molding capacity
will be eliminated. However, the melting shop capacity willl be a bottleneck
for increasing production beyond 7,500 TPY of nodular iron castings in two
shifts.
C.   Fitting Finishing Shop
29.       The fitting finishing shop is located in a separate building adja-
cent to the machine tool plant (see Annex 4-2). The total capacity of this
plant is about 3,800 to 4,000 TPY of pipe fittings ranging in size from 3/8"
to 2". Fitting castings from the malleable iron foundry are weighed at the
fitting finishing plant before any finishing operation is done.
Initial Finishing
30.       In this section, most of the initial cleaning and finishing work is
done prior to final machine work. This section is equipped with nine double-
head grinding machines with supporting roller paths for initial grinding work,
19 tumbling drums for surface cleaning, and one pressure testing equipment.
Final Machining
31.       After the initial cleaning and finishing, the fittings (elbows,
T-pieces, couplings, etc.) are transported by a monorail system to the re-
spective machining areas. Machines for final machining comprise 20 lathes
for final machining, 18 internal thread-cutting machines, 2 grinding machines,
10 outer thread-cutting machines, 1 elbow thread-cutting machine, 1 T-piece
thread-cutting machine, 10 column-type drilling machines, 1 tool-sharpening
machine, and auxiliary equipment. Most of this equipment will be relocated
during the implementation of the project. After the final machining opera-
tions, most of the fittings are transported to the cleaning section for prep-
aration for galvanizing and the remaining are moved to the continuous con-
servation line for black fittings. All inplant transportation is by mono-
rail systems. There are adequate facilities within the plant for semi-finished
and finished product storage.

Cleaning Room
32.       Prior to galvanizing the fittings, they are thoroughly cleaned and
dried. Equipment and other facilities included in this section are 2 caustic
soda vats, 4 water vats, one acid vat and lye vat. After proper cleaning, the
fittings are transported to the galvanizing section by a monorail. During the
project implementation, very minor alterations to this section are envisaged.
Galvanizing Section
33.       The cleaned fittings are received at the continuous dryer (0.5 ton/
hr.) which controls the capacity of this section. This unit also includes
one 40-ton zinc melting furnace, one 10-ton zinc melting furnace, zinc baths,
heated tables, console crane (0.2 ton) for loading and unloading, water vats
and a centrifuge.  Present capacity of this unit is about 1,260 TPY.  After
galvanizing, products are transported to the final finishing and packing
section.
Final Finishing and Packing
34.       This section includes two continuous varnish coating machines, con-
veyor belts for transporting the final product to the packing section, a few
roller conveyors for packing, control tables, packing tables and sufficient
space for cardboard box and finished product storage. From here, cartons
containing the finished fittings are shipped out.
Observations
35.       Present production of fittings is limited to 4,000 TPY due to the
capacity limitations of this plant. The layout of the machine tools in this
plant will have to be slightly altered to bring about an increase in produc-
tion. Even though some of the equipment and machines in this shop are fairly
old (installed in 1957) and need replacoment, these facilities are maintained
properly and operated efficiently. Due to the capacity restrictions in the
galvanizing section, the produciton of galvanized fittings, which have a
good demand, is limited.
D.   Machine Tool Plant
36.       The machine tool factory is also located in a separate building
with all essential staff departments except the quality control department.
It has its own plant management, which is responsible to the Managing Director.
37.       The layout of the machine tool factory, originally made for the
production of lathes, drills and surface grinders, was done on a functional
basis - all milling operations in one section, turning operations in another,
etc. Now that the plant has discontinued making lathes and has undertaken
the production of various types of grinders, the old layout is not suitable
for optimal material flow for the present production.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 8
38.       The following sections are in the plant:  steel storehouse, steel
cutting section, machine preparation and store for small parts, store for
large parts, tool room, casting store, sections for grinding, milling, drill-
ing, and turning operations, cleaning of castings, locksmithing and welding,
marking of casings for machining, electric fittings, hardening, painting,
sub-assembling and assembling, assembling and testing of hydraulic parts,
assembling of electric control devices, final assembly of the machines, fi-
nal painting, final adjusting and delivery. The equipment in the plant con-
sists of: 28 Universal lathes (installed in 1957-62; 10 of them would be
put out of use); 3 Revolver lathes (recently installed); 20 Milling machines
(installed in 1957-62; 7 of them would be put out of use); 5 Gear Tooth Mill-
ing Cutters (installed in 1962); 14 Drilling Machines (installed in 1957-62;
3 of them would be put out of use); 26 Grinding Machines (installed in 1958-
62; 5 of the would be taken out of service); 7 Boring and Milling Machines
(installed in 1957-62; 2 of them would be put out of use); 6 Planning Machines
(installed in 1960; 1 of them would be taken out of service); 1 Grinder for
Guide Rods installed in 1960; it would be put out of use); and 4 Cutting
Machines (installed in 1957-60; 1 of them would be taken out of service).
The machine tool plant also includes sufficient auxiliary equipment to sup-
port the present level of production.
Observation
39.       At present, in the machine tool plant there are certain problems
primarily due to the use of old machine tools which are no longer sufficiently
accurate and are not geared for mass production. Furhermore, the internal
transport of assembly parts, semi-finished products and. finished products is
also a problem since the present layout of the plant was made when the company
was producing different types of products. Therefore, to improve the efficiency
of the plant even for the present production, new machines as well as relocation
of equipment are necessary. Relocation of machine tools is envisaged in the
project.
E.   Quality Control Department
40.       The quality control department, a self-contained department directly
under the General Manager, observes strict control of all phases of production
(melting, core-making, molding, final control of products in the cleaning shop,
and material control of raw materials and supplies). The quality control lab-
oratory is very well equipped. It consists of a spectograph for 12 elements,
a wet-chemical laboratory, a physical laboratory, and necessary supporting
units. No additions and alterations in this laboratory are planned under the
project.
F.   Utilities
Electric Power and Distribution
41.       All power for Kikinda is purchased from "Elektrovojvodina' of Novi
Sad. The plant is supplied with power from a main 35/10 KV transformer sub-
station. Because of the subsequent additions of new facilities in different



ANNEX 2-2
Page 9
phases plus the depreciated condition of the transformer, the distribution
system as it now exists is hampered by overload at the transformer station.
Although the company has taken measures to rectify this situation, power is
distributed (through closed loop system) to different plants by underground
cables (10 KV) and is stepped down from 10 KV to 0.4 KV before feeding elec-
tric motors and furnaces. Sub-stations with 10/0.4 KV transformers are lo-
cated near each plant. The total installed electric power at Kikinda is
12 MVA and the annual electric power consumption is about 20 million kwh.
Considerable changes, additions and alterations to the power distribution
system are proposed in the project.
Gas
42.       Natural gas for the plant operation is purchased from NAFTAGAS,
which has its central distribution station close to the plant. From the
Gage Control station (25 atmospheric pressure) which is adjacent to the
plant, gas is brought to the distribution station through a 3-1/2" pipe-
line after reducing the pressure to 4.5 atmospheric unit. From this sta-
tion, the gas is supplied to various production plants, where the pressure
is further reduced to 1 atmospheric unit prior to distribution within the
plants. Gas is being used in the malleable iron foundry (for the heat
treatment plant and core making shop, nodular and grey foundry), for cupola
air heater and core-making shop, and fitting finishing shop (for galvanizing
lines). Moreover, gas is used for cooking and heating boilers. The consump-
tion of gas is about 1,250 NW3/h. The present gas pipe system does not ade-
quately satisfy the requirements; this problem is to be rectified under the
project.
Compressed Air
43.       The present compressor station is about 12 years old and has 5
piston compressors each with a capacity of 20 m3/hr. Apart from the expan-
sion of castings plants which operate exclusively with compressed air, the
machine tool plant expansion would also increase the need for compressed air.
The compressed air requirement has increased more than three times in the
last 10 years.  The present consumption rate is about 96 NM3/hr (at 7 times
the atmospheric pressure). The existing capacity and the distribution system
- mostly worn out due to age - is very tight for the present production. In
the project, major changes are planned for the compressor station.
Water
44.       The present water distribution system was built during the last 10
years to meet the needs of different phases of plant expansion. With the 4
existing wells, which have a capacity of 920 lit/min., most of the present
water requirements are met. By adopting recirculation systems, the water
shortage is minimized. Further, an overhead water tank (50 m3) is also
available as reserve and can provide water at required pressure. The plant
is also connected to the city water system, which supplies water exclusively
to annealing furnaces and induction furnaces. Additional water distribution
systems are envisaged in the project.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 10
Heating
45.       All plants are centrally heated by steam.  The steam boiler room
has two boilers wirth a capacity of 13 tons of steam per hour. The present
steam pipeline system needs replacement since its capacity is not adequate
to supply sufficient steam to different plants. This problem is aggravated
by the need for greater quantities of steam to compensate for the heated air
going out of the plant due to air cleaning ventilation. The present system
of heating will be replaced by hot water heating systems under the project.

ANNEX 3-1
YUGOSLAVIA; KTKtNDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
MARKET FOR IRON CASTINGS
A. Industrial Setting
1.        Yugoslavia has a dynamic industry sector which in 1971 contributed
to over 30% of the Gross National Product estimated at approximately US$15
billion. Industrial production has been expanding at a real annual rate of
about 10.5% during 1952-1971, and nearly one-fourth of total labor force
estimated at 8.3 million (1971) is engaged in the industrial sector.
2.        Unlike the case.in many developing countries, industrial develop-
ment in Yugoslavia has been outward-oriented and, on the whole, competitive.
Industrial exports have grown at an average annual rate of 14% during the
decade 1961-1971, faster than the rate of growth in industrial production.
Industry, along with mining, accounts for over 85% of the total exports of
US$$t,81O million (1971).
3.        Since widespread reforms of 1965, there has been a general reduction
in quantitative restrictions and import duties and a better alignment of
domestic prices with world prices.  By the end of 1971, only 20% equipment
imports, 25% of raw material and semi-finished goods and 37% of consumer
goods imports fell under the restrictive commodity quota and direct licensing
schemes. Between 1965 and 1971, the average duty on all imports was lowered
from about 14% to about 12% and on equipment imports from 24% to 18%, with
further reductions in 1972 and 1973. Compared to most developing countries, these
rates are quite moderate.   They are increased, however, by customs and border
taxes (together 3-4%) and, since 1971, by a special surtax of 6%. The highest
average duty protection applies to metal products (25%) and electrical
equipment (22%), two of the fast-growing subsectors.
4.        The current Five-Year Plan (1971-75) target for the growth of
industry (including mining and quarrying) is 8% a year. Crude steel pro-
duction is expected to grow at an annual rate of 14%, reaching about 5 million
tons in 1975. Equipment and durable consumer goods industry, which currently
accounts for about 26% of the total industrial output, is expected to grow
at the rate of 8.5% a year.
Main Users of Castings
5.        The main users of castings are motor vehicles, agricultural
machinery, electrical and non-electrical machinery, machine tools, construction
industry, rail wagons, shipbuilding, and consumer durables. Past trends
and future projections of production in some of these industries are shown
below:

6.        There are about 250 foundries in Yugoslavia of which approximately
50 accounted for nearly 90% of the production of castings in 1972 totalling
about 453,300 tons.  The following table shows the structure of the foundry

7.        Only 12  foundries have an annual capacity of over 10,000 tons each
(see Tables 1 and 3). Majority of the foundries (162) produce less than 500
tons a year.  An international comparison (Table 4) shows that Yugoslav
production of castings is low. For example, in 1971 the production of Yugoslavia
was only 9% of the castings output of the Federal Republic of Qermany.

C. Production of Castings
8.        In 1960, the total production of castings was nearly 231,670
tons. During 1960-1972, it increased at an annual rate of 5.8%. The
following table shows the growth of production during this period and the
projection for 1977 (see also Table 2):

9.        Considering the expansion programs of various foundries, it appears
that during 1972-1977, total production of castings would grow at an average
annual rate of about 9%, reaching 706,500 tons in 1977.
Iron Castings
10.       The production of iron castings accounted for 82% of the total
castings output in 1972. The percentage is expected to decline slightly to
81% by 1977 because of the faster rate of expansion of steel and non-ferrous
foundries. Among iron castings, gray and nodular castings are the most
important followed by malleable castings and pipe fittings.
11.       Gray and Nodular Castings:  There are 100 and odd gray and nodular
iron foundries in Yugoslavia of which less than half accounfUd for nearly 90%
of the total production estimated at 352,600 tons in 1972. Production in
the next five years is expected to increase by about 55% mainly because of the
expansion of the following five foundries: FOB, Kikindat Zrenjanin, Ilias and Store.



ANNEX 3-1
Page h
Dur;ing 1972-7 4 FOB, a leading producer of gray castings, plans to increase
its production of gray and nodular castings from 34,000 tons to 90,000 tons;
Kikinda's output of different products is expected to jump from 13,260 tons
to 37,000 tons; and the Zrenjanin foundry which produces mostly radiators
for heating buildings, plans to expand its production from 15,000 tons to
30,000 tons.  FOB and Kikinda are bound by a technical and production de-
marcation agreement signed in 1971. According to this agreement, FOB would
concentrate on the production of gray castings for the motor vehicle and
tractor industries, while Kikinda would confine its gray castings production
to meet its internal requirements to produce machine tools. In the case of
nodular castings, Kikinda would expand its production on a large scale
(from 3,310 tons to 16,000 tons) during 1972-1977 while FMB would undertake
only minor expansion from  4,150 tons to 9,250 tons.  Further, FOB would not
produce malleable and pipe fittings, while Kikinda would expand its production
of such castings.
12.       Currently, the production of nodular castings is low at 11,000
tons with Kikinda accounting for 30% of the total production. Kikinda's
production of these castings is expected to increase to 16,000 tons in 1977
when the Company would account for about 67% of the total of nodular output.
Apart from Kikinda and FOB, there are three nodular casting producers:
Store  Steel Plant  in Slovania;  Torpedo at Rijelca in Croatia;  and Dalit
at Daruvar, also in Croatia. These three plants, which also produce gray
castings, had the following production capacity in 1972:
(in tons)
Nodular.    av
Store                       2,500   12,500
Torpedo                       500    3,500
Dalit                         400    3,100
Of the above three foundries, only Torpedo has       plans to expand and double
its production of both gray and nodular castings.
13.       Malleable Castings:  There is a trend towards the use of nodular
castings in the place of malleable iron castings in the main automobile
producing countries. As a result, nodular iron castings are likely to gain
importance in the future.  However, it is very unlikely that the complete
substitution of malleable castings by nodular castings would take place within
the next decade. Currently, there is a shortage of malleable castings in
Western Europe where the production of such castings -has decreased steeply.
In this context, Kikinda, the major producer of malleable castings, feels that
the prospect for malleable castings are good at least for one decade. Under a
carefully planned expansion program, Kikincla is expanding its malleable
castings production from 9,198 tons to 19,500 tons during 1972-1977. While
doing this, sufficient flexibility would be built into the expanded facilities
to switch over from malleable to nodular and gray castings production com-
pletely if future market conditions necessitate such a measure.



ANNEX 3-1
14,.      Kikinda currently accounts for about 40% of the total malleable
castings production in the country.  Other important producers of malleable
castings are: MINEL at Topola in Serbia; Novi Zivot at Zenica in Bosnia
-- Hercegovina; and Titan at Kamnik in Slovenia. These three foundries
have the following expansion programs:
Malleable Casting s Capacity

Total              9,500  12,400
15.       Malleable-Pipe Fittings:  In 1972, Kikinda accounted for 56% of
the total malleable pipe fittings produced in Yugoslavia. Apart from this ComparVr,
which plans to expand its production from 4,113 tons to 6,400 tons during
1972-77, there is only one other foundry (Titan) which has major expansion
plans to double its capacity to 4,000 TPY.
D.  Growth of Ca3tings Consumption
16.       The main consumers of iron castings (excluding pipe fittings) are
industries prodacing agricultural machinery, motor vehicles, machine tools,
ships, rail wagons, household appliances, etc. The construction industry is
the main consumer for pipe fittings. Currently, as a result of the con-
struction boom in Yugoslavia, there is a shortage of pipe fittings and their
prices are controlled.
17.       The apparent consumption of all iron castings increased at an
average rate of 11% during the last four years, reaching 321,000 tons in
1972 as shown in the following table:

E. Demand Forecast for Iron Castings by Subsectors
18.       According to past experience in Yugoslavia, the average require-
ments of castings to manufacture one unit of the followi:g products are:
1 car, 110 kgs;  1 truck,890 kgs;  1 bus,720 kgs;  1 wheeled tractor, 885
kgs;  1 crawler tractor, 1,470 kgs;  one ton of machine tools, 830 kgs;
one ton of electrical equipment, 100 kgs; one ton of non-electrical equip-
ment, 280 kgs; one ton of agricultural machinery (excluding tractors), 100
kgs; one ton of construction machinery, 370 kgs. These normative require-
ments are used to forecast the need for castings in the various subsectors.
Motor Vehicles
19.       Car Production:  Zavodi Crvexna Zastava (ZCZ) located at Kragujevac,
near Belgrade, is the only car producer in Yugoslavia. It produces five
basic models under a license frm FIAT of Italy. It has an annual capacity
to prodace 110,000 cars. In 1972, Zastava produced 90,000 cars, with the
capacity utilization being 82%. The production of the company is expected
to increase to 225,000 in 1977. Based on the normative of about 110 kgs of
castings per car, the total requirements of Zastava would be,about 24,800
tons in 1977. The company relies mainly on the FOB (at Belgrade), Kikinda
(130 Im from Belgrade) and MINEL (at Topola) foundries for the supply Of castings.
20.       Car Assembling:  There are three enterprises which assemble cars.
They include: Industrija Motornih Vozil (IMV), at Novo iesto, operating in
collaboration with Renault of France; Tovarna Motornih Vozil (TOMOS) at
Koper which collaborates with Citroen of France; and Udruzena Netalna
Industri,ja (UNIS) at Sarajevo which has collaboration agreement with Volks-
wagen of Germary. Their total assembly production was about 20,000 in 1972. It is
expected to remain constant at this level up to 1977. Therefore, the demand for
oastings byQcar assemblers would continue to be at the 1972 level of 2,200 tons.
21.       Truck and Bus Producers/Assemblers:  The main truck and bus producers/
assemblers are FAP-FAMOS (Priboj and Sarajevo), Ikarus (Zemun), TAM (Maribor),
Torpedo (Rijeka), and Zastava. Their total production is expected to increase
as follows:
(Nos.)
1972               1977
(Actual)
Trucks and Vans              15,000             27,ooo
Bases                         4,000              6,000
22.       Assuming an average of 890 kgs of casting per truck and 720 kgs
per bus, the total castings requirements for their production/assembly would
increase from 13,770 tons in 1972 to 28,130 tons in 1977.

Tractors
23.       Wheeled Tractors:  The product:Lon of wheeled tractors is projected
to increase from 17,0t5in 1972 to 38,850 in 1977.  Assuming about 885 kgs
of castings per tractor, the total requirement of castings for the production
of wheeled tractcrs would be 33,500 tons in 1977 compared to 15_,800 tons in
1972.
24.       Caterpillar Tractors:  The output of caterpillar tractors is projected
to increase from 545 in 1972 to 1,150 in 1977. Assuming 1,470 kgs of castings
per unit, the total requirement of castings for the production of caterpillar
tractors would be 1,700 tons in 1977.
Agricultural Machinery (excluding tractors)
25.       These machinery including harvesters, combines, etc. consumed a total
of about 5,50G tons of castings in 1972. T1heir production is projected to
increase to 72,000 tons in 1977. Assuming an average of 100 kgs of castings
per ton of machinery of this type, the total requirement of castings by this
subsector would be about 7,200 tons in 1977.
Machine Tools
26.       11achine tool production in 1972 was 13,125 tons when 10,160 tons
of castings were required. The production is expected to reach 17,990 tons in
1977, when the total castings requirements, at the rate of 830 kgs per ton of
machine tools, would be about 14,900 tons.
Electrical Machinery
27.       The production of electrical machinery in 1972 was about 24,500 tons
when the total castings used in their manufacture was nearly 2,450 tons.  This
subsector is growing at the rate of about 9% a year and its production is ex-
pected to reach 37,700 tons in 1977. Assuming 100 kgs of castings per ton of
electrical machinery, the total requirement of castings by the electrical
machinery subsector would be 3,770 tons in 1977.
Non-Electrical Machineer
28.       In 1972, about 24,000 tons of castings were used to prodace about
85,700 tons of non-electrical machinery. The production of non-electrical
machinery, presently growing at the fast rate of about 10.5% a year, is
expected to reach about i41,200 tons in 1977. Assuming 280 kgs per ton of non-
electrical machinery, the total requirement of castings by this subsector would
be about 39,500 in 1977.
Construction -achinery
29.       The manufacture of ccnstruction machinery required over 16,100 tons of
castings in 1972. Assuming 370 kgs of castings per ton of construction machinery,
the total requirement of castings by this subsector would be about 29,700 in 1977
when the total production of construaction machinery is projected at 80,300 tons.



ANNE 3-1I
Page 8
Consumer Durables
30.       The production of consumer durables required about 33,500 tons of
castings in 1972. This subsector is growing at the rate of 8.5%. Assuming
the same growth rate for the castings requirements of this subsector, the
total requirement of castings would reach about 50,400 in 1977.
Other Users
31.       Other users of castings include ship building, railway rolling
stock, housing, etc. as well as the replacement market for various motor
vehicles and machinery. These users required about 185,200 tons of castings
in 1972. Looking at the projections for the growth of these subsectors, it
seems realistic to assume that their castings requirements would increase
by at least 15% a year.  Based on this assumption, their casting needs would
be about 372,300 tons in 1977.
F.   Total Demand and Supply Commarison
32.       From the above estimates, it appears that the total demand for
castings in Yugoslavia would increase between 1972 and 1977 as follows:
Total Demand for Castings by Subsectors
7   (in rO tons)
1972        1977
Car Prodaction                                      11.8
Truck Production                                    13.8         24.1
Bus Production                                       2.7          4.0
Tractor Production                                  16.6         36.0
Agricultural Machinery (excluding tractors)          5.5          7.2
Machine Tools                                       10.2         14.9
Electrical Equipment                                 2.5          3.8
Non-Electrical Equipment                            24.0         39.5
Construction Machinery                              16.1         29.7
Consumer Durables                                   33.5         50.4
Other Users                                        185.2        372.3
Total                                        320.9       608.7
The above table shows that the total demand for iron castings would grow
from about 321,000 tons in 1972 to 609,000 tons in 1977, reflecting an
average annual growth rate of around 13.5%.
33.       Currently, the shares of gray, nodular and malleable castings
(including pipe fittings) in total demand are around 91%, 3% and 6% respectively.
This is borne out by the experience in other countries as well, with minor
variations. However, by 1977, the share of malleable castings is likely to
go doiwn to 5% and the share of nodular castings would go up to 5%, with the
share of gray castings declining slightly to 90%. This change in the proportional



ANNE  3-1
Page 9
shares of the three types of castings would result mainly because nodular
castings are gradually replacing malleable castings.  Assuming these
shares, the total demand in 1977 by t;ype of castings would be as follows:
Total Domestic Demanld in 1977 by Type of Castings
tin '000 tons)
Gray                                    548 0
Nodular                                   30.5
lalleable (inclu.ding pipe fittings)      30.5
Total                               609.0
G.   Domstic Production and Demand Coa2arison for 1977
34.       As noted earlier, the total production of tron castingr would be 575,000
tons in 1977. However, the domestic demand would be higher than the production
by 34,000 tons as shown below.
Domestic Production and Demand_for Ironc0astins in 1977
(in '000 tons)
Domestic    Surplus

Total                  575.0             609.0       - 34. 0
The above table shows that the domestic production  of all types of iron castings
would fall short of domestic demand.
Inorts
35.       Yugoslavia imports certain types of iron castings (i.e. valve bodies,
large pipe fittings etc.) which are either in short supply or not made in
the country. Inports were at the low level of Ik000 tons in 1968 but they
rose sharply by 37% a year, reaching 14,000tons in 1972.  In the ftture,
they are projected to rise at an annual rate of about 12%, reaching 25,000
tons in 1977.
Exorts and Total Domestic
36.       Yugoslavia is a significant exporter of iron castings.  In 1972,
its exports reached 66,000 tons, 5 times the imLorts. The main export
markets are Germany, Italy, France, Hungary, Romania, Balgaria, and the
U.S.S.R.  Exports grew at the rate of 6.5% a year during 1968-72. Durina the
next 5 years (1972-77), they are projected to grow at an annual rate of 8.5%,
reaching 100,000 tons in 1977.  It is most likely that this export level



ANNEX 3-1
Page 10
would be reached. In that case, castings available for internal consumption
would be 475,000 tons. To this, if the projected imports of 25,000 tons are
added, the total domestic supply would be 500,000 tons compared to the in-
ternal demand for about 609,000 tons.  This reflects that by 1977, the actual
deficit between total demand and supply would reach 109,000 tons. Therefore,
foundries in Yugoslavia will have to expand at a faster rate to bridge the
widening gap between supply and demand.
H. Market for Kikinda Castings
37.       Kikinda is the largest producer of malleable and nodular castings
for cars and commercial vehicles,, and pipe fittings for the construction
industry. It also produces gray castings in a small quantity for its own
machine tool production.
38.       During 1972-77, Kikinda's production of malleable castings would
increase from 5,085 tons to 13,100 tons. During the same period, the pro-
duction of nodular castings would rise from 3,310 tons to 16,000 tons; pipe
fittings, from 4,113 tons to 6,400 tons; and gray castings from 750 tons to
1,500 tons. The following table compares the share of Eikinda in the
poroduction of various castings in Yugoslavia between 1972 and 1977:

The above table shows that during 1972 and 1977, the share of Kikinda in the
country's production would increase greatly from the already high level in
the case of malleable and nodular castings as well as pipe fittings.  But,
in the case of gray castings, Kikinda's share would continue to be insignificant.
For Kikinda's malleable castings, the main customers are the Yugoslav car
manufacturer, Zastava, as well as car assemblers; Opel AG of the German
Federal Republic; and car manufacturers in the German Democratic Republic.
Inquiries for supply of malleable castings have been received from Volkswagen
and Ford of Germany, Alfa Romeo of Italy, and also from some U.S. car pro-
ducers. For Kikinda's nodular iron castings used mainly for trucks and buses,
the main customers are the two Yugoslav truck manufacturers, TAM (a joint
venture with Klockner Hambolt Deutz, Germany), and FAP-FAMOS (a joint venture
with DMB, Germany); and the truck manufacturers Raba and Cepel in Hungary and
MAN of Germany. Further, inquiries have been received from Volkswagen (Germany)
and sone U.S. producers.
1. Malleable Iron Castings
39.       As already noted, Kikinda sells most of its castings by entering
into long-term supply agreements with major automotive manufacturers. The
Company has agreed to deliver 2,000 tons of malleable iron castings to Zastava
in 1973 and, with the projected more than doubling of car production by 1977,



ANNEX -31
Page 11
its castings requirement from Kikinda is likely to increase by at least 30%
by 1977. As for exports, the Company has a long-term contract with Cpel AG
(Germany) to supply about 5,000 tons in 1977. These two customers alone
would account for nearly 58% of Kikinda's market for malleable iron castings
in 1977. The existing contracts with several other customers in Yugoslavia
would result in the sale of an additional 2,700 tons per year. The following
table shows the agreed deliveries to and projected requirements of Kikinda's
main customers:

42.       According to the above table, the expected total demand of
19,400 tons will exceed the projected available capacity of 16,000 tons of Kikinda
by 3,400 tons in 1977.
3. Kikinda Pipe Fitti,ngs
Domestic Ma,rket
43.       Table 7 shows domestic sales of fittings according to republics.
Sales of fittings in 1972 reached 1,882 tons. The current commitment to
domestic wholesalers for 1973 is 2f,000 tons of finished fittings.  With the
expectation of increased available capacity, sales of 3,300 tons are pro-
jected for 1977. This represents a 12.5% annual average growth of domestic
sales which appears realistic as sales have grown in the past at an annual
average rate of about 15%.  This appears to be a reasonable assumption, given
the housing shortage in Yurgoslavia and the present construction boom
especially in the private and social sector apartment projects.
E,xport Markets
44.       Convertible currency ,areas:  The main export markets for Kikinda
fittings are Italy and the German Federal Republic. In May 1969 Kikinda
signed a 10-year supply contract with Locatelli, Italy, for minimum deliveries
of castings of 1,800 tons annually.  By 1977an additional 3,100 tons are
expected to be sold to foreign customers.
145.      Clearing Currency Areas: Kikinda entered into an agreement to
supply, together with the only other Yugoslav producer  (Titan) up to 1,300
tons annually to the German Democratic Republic. Agreed quantities for 1973 by
Kikinda to the clearing area were limited to 200 tons;  it is expected to
increase to 1,000 tons in-1977.

47.       As against an anticipated demand for 9,200 tons of Kikinda pipe
fittings,, the Company's production would be only 6,400 tons, this indicating a
gap of 2,800 tons in 1977.
I. Price Tariffs and Competitive Position in Export Markets
1. Castings Prices
48.       For castings (except pipe fittings), Yugoslav foundries are free to
set domestic prices taking into account the prevailing market conditions,
the international price level, the natiQnal development policy, and the stage
of development of the enterprises. The Federal Council for Prices has the
power to review the prices set by the enterprises. Export prices can also be
freely set, although in several cases, foundries enter into long-term supply
contracts with automotive manufacturers which specify the quantities required
and the minimum prices that can be expected. Table 5 shows for 1973 com-
parative ex-factory prices for some typical automotive castings. Direct price
comparisons are difficult as the casting piece weight, size and intricacy
influence the price structure of individual castings. The prices per ton of
castings, therefore, give only a very limited basis for comparison as the
product mix of one enterprise differs from another, and the price per ton
reflects such differences. This is particularly true of the Yugoslav foundries
where relatively simple castings have been chosen for price comparison with
those of export markets. However, the overall average price for the German
malleable and nodular castings pertains to more intricate castings.
49.       Kikinda has a good rating with its major export customer, Opel AG;
the rejection rate is hardly 2%.  As a result of uniformly good quality,
Kikinda exports command good prices. Its prices are on the whole internationally,
competitive.
Imports and IMport Tariffs
50.       The official customs duty of 15% on the import of unfinished iron
castings plus 10% in import taxes give an overall protection of 25%. Imports
of unfinished ferrous castings are not controlled; however, the total imports
to Yugoslavia of unfinished gray and malleable iron castings are low. Imports
of finished automotive castings by automotive assemblers are also not directly
controlled, but are allowed only on the basis of the foreign exchange retention
quota earned by enterprises.
Exports and E^,ort Incentives
51.       Exports of castings are encouraged by the Government especially to
convertible currency markets. The enterprise receives a direct incentive to
export through the foreign exchange retention quota system whereby 20% of
the foreign exchange earnings is available to the enterprise for free use.
52.       Cooperation agreements between foreign car manufacturers and Yugo-
siav assemblers require that the Yugoslav assemblers export a certain amount
of automotive components before receiving an import permit for CKD car parts.



ANN~ 31
Castings are one of the important products available for such exports
and this is one of the reasons for the German, Italian and French car manufacturers'
interest in importing castings from Yugoslavia.
Quality and Delivery Performance
53.       To ensure continuity and quality of supply, automotive manufacturers
set strict standards. The major Western automotive manufacturers give their
supplying foundries quality ratings based on their adherence to metallurgical
quality specifications and delivery schedules. Ch this basis, order sizes
and prices are set.  For instance, for foreign suppliers German car manu-
facturers allocate a maximnu per foundry of between 20% to 30% of their total
requirements of specific types of castings. Prices are set on the basis of
competitive bids, and the quality rating of a foundry determines the price
offered by the customer. Iw-rated foundries are unlikely to receive long-
term orders; hence the need for a foundry to establish good rating with
customers.
Domestic Prices
54.       Kikinda's average domestic price per ton for malleable iron castings
compared to those of its major export markets is about 30% lower than the
domestic prices of Germany and over 10% lower than Italian prices. (Table 5).
While, for reasons discussed in Para. 48, these prices are not strictly com-
parable, they do indicate a sufficient price advantage for Kikinda to expand
exports for malleable iron castings.
55.      lKikinda's average domestic price for nodular iron castings does
not have any price advantage when compared to the average price for a sample
of castings from Italy, but it is over 10% lower than the average domestic
price in the German ?ederaL Republic. Anticipated supply shortages in Italy
due to the expansion projects of Alfa Romeo are expected to increase the
domestic prices of castings and improve the export prospects of Kikinda to
that counbry.
Export Prices
56.       Table 6 shows that Kikinda's export prices per ton of both malleable
and nodular castings are tyypically lower for sales to convertible markets
than for domestic sales. This is due in part to the need to compete with other
foreign suppliers.
2. Pipe Fittings Prices
57.       Domestic prices for pipe fittings are controlled by the Federal
Government.  The last increase in pipe fitting  prices was 18% in 1971. As
for imports, the present customs rate of 12% plus 10% import taxes gives an
overall protection of 22%. Pipe fittings of very small diameter which are
not produced in Yugoslavia are imported.  Currently, as Yugoslavia is ex-
periencing a shortage of fittings, Kikinda expects that the Government will
reduce the import duty. Kikinda, therefore, projects a drop in average
price per ton of fittings froma 25,000 Dinars in 1972 to 23,500 Dinars in 1977.



ANNEX 3-i
Page 15
58.       Export prices for the clearing area are expected to rise at a higher
rate than for the convertible area due to continuing shortage conditions in
the former. Convertible mrwket prices for Kikinda are determined largely by
its sales agent, Locatelli, Italy. The 10-year supply contract with the firm
specifies minimum annual delivery quantities, but the price is to be determined
according to market conditions. While Kikinda could possibly realize higher
prices by independent sales) the sale of fittings is largely controlled by
groups of suppliers, and entry to this market is difficult.  Pricing is based
on quantity discomnts from certain recognized catalogues.
J.  Kikinmda's Marketing Organization for Castings
For Automotive Castins
59,.      For the domestic market, sales are made directly to customers.
Supply agreements are entered into with the automotive manufacturers, Zastava,
TAM and FAP-FAiqS.
60..      Export sales are now increasingly made directly to customers by the
sales staff of K*ikinda instead of depending entirely on export-infort firms
as in the past. However, such firms are encouraged to bring in new orders
and inquiries. Those firms inwclude: Invest-Inport in Belgrade for German
Federal Republic sustomers; Masino-Impeksin Zagreb, and Dinara in Belgrade
for Hungary;  FAF-FAMOS in Belgrade for Mercedes Benz, Germany;   UNIS-TAS
in Sarajevo for Volkswagen, Germany; and Kosn*S in Ljubljana for MAN,
Germany, and Alf'a iiomeo, Italy.
61.       To insure closest cooperation with export customers especially on
technical and quality matters, Kikinda maintains direct contacts with the
customers concerned. For exanple, Kikinda's resident representative (sales
engineer) in Frarkfurt, Germany, maintains close contact with their main
purchasing agent, Reinhalt Huppert, for supply to the German automotive
manufacturers.
For Pipe Fittings
62.       On the domestic market, 90% of Kikinda's fittings are sold through
wholesalers, ani the remainder directly to customers. The wholesale out-
lets are located in Novi Sad, Belgrade, Skopje, Maribor and Split.
63.       E:xport sales are made through fittings dealers such as Locatelli
(Italy) and induco Handel (German Federal Republic) and by trade agreements
to clearing markets.  Eport invoicing is handled by Invest-Iiport in Belgrade
for the German Federal Republic, and by Yetaia in Ljubljana for the German
Democratic Republic. Sales to the lebanon are handled by Zeljpohon in
Zagreb, and to Bulgaria by Unis Kormre  in Sarajevo.

MARKET FOR MACHINE TOOLS
A.  Demand and Supply
Introduction
Yugoslavia started producing machine tools after World War II.
Since then, it has emerged as an important producer of a wide range of machine
tools such as drilling machines, milling machines, lathes, semi-automatic and
automatic machines, planing/shaping machines, gear-cutting machines, grinding
machines, etc.
Machine Stock
2.        At the end of 1970, Yugoslavia had a machine tool stock of 125,000
units of which lathes accounted for the largest share of 39% of the total.
The following table shows the structure of machine stock in the country:
Structure of Machine Stock (1970)
Ty,e of Machines                               Nos.          Percentage Share (%)

Other Machines                                 185 
3.        For the exi3ting 8tock of machine tools in 1970, the replacement
demand is estimated at about 8350 units, assuming an average life of 15 years
per machine tool.
4.        Of the total machine tool stock, grinding machines (including sharpen-
ing machines) accounted for 8% of the total in 1970.  The structure of grinder
machine stock is shown separately below:

5.        Based on the same assumptions made earlier (i.e. an average 15-
year life per machine tool), the replacement market for grinders alone would be
for about 670 units.
Per Capita Consumption
6.        The machine stock in Yugoslavia is fairly high but compared to advanced
countries, its annual per capita consumption of machine tools is low as shown
in the following table:
Per Capita Consumption
of Machine Tools (in US$)l/
Switzerland                                             15.5

Federal Republic of Germany                              9.5
U. K.                                                    7.5

The above table shows that the per capita consumption of machine tools in Yugo-
slavia is approximately 1/8 of that in Switzerland and 1/6 of that of the U.S.
Structure of Demand
7.        In the field of machine tools, there is a growing trend in demand
toward more sophisticated machines, incl~uding automated machines, from simple
machines. The changing demand with respect to different machines during 1962-71
is shown below:

The above table shows that the share of lathes in total consumption has
declined sharply from 45% to 31% while the share of grinding machines has
jumped from 0.9% to 9.4% during 1962-1971. This has come about mainly because
of the need for increasing accuracy and higher tolerance demanded of machine
tools has established a trend away from turning operations to grinding
operations.
8.        According to the Masino-Union, the share of lathes and grinding mach-
ines in total demand would change in the future as follows:
--Liathes       Grinding Machines
1971 (actual)                        31.0                  9,4
1977                                 25.0                 14.o
9.        In advanced countries, the percentage share of grinders in total
demand has already reached 25% compared to 19% for lathes. In view of the
experience in developed countries, it is realistic to expect that the percent-
age share of grinders in total machine tool demand would rise to 14% in 1977
as forecast by the Masino-Union.
Trend of Consumption
100       Machine tool consumption has increased at an average annual rate of
16% during 1968-1972, reaching 25,952 tons in 1972 as shown below:
Growth of Consumption of Machine Tools.
(196b-1972)
1968                                         In Tons
1968                                         14,296
1969                                         15,309
1970                                         15,158
1971                                         19,786
1972                                         25,952
1977 (Projection)                            39,200
11.       Starting from a low base, the machine tool consumption has been grow-
ing fast in the past.  However, in the future, the consuption would grow at a
slower pace, increasing in step with the growth of the metal-transforming and
equipment industries. On this basis, Masino-Union has forecast that the demand
for machine tools would increase at the rate of about 8.5% a year, reaching
39,200 tons in 1977.
12.       As already noted earlier, the share of lathes and grinders would be
25% and 14% respectively of the total demand for machine tools. On the above
assumptions the demand for lathes and grinders in 1977 would be as follows:
lathes, 9,800 tons; and grinders, 5,500 tons. Assuming that on an average, one
grinder weighs 2.5 tons, the total number of grinders, including sharpening
machines, requaired in 1977 would be 2200 units.  Out of these, universal,



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
surface and internal grinders would account for about 570, i.e. about 25% of
the totail demand for total grinders. This is consistent with the Masino-Union
forecast that the total demand would reach 485 units in 1975 and beyond that
it would increase at the rate of 8.5% a year. No attempt has been made to
forecast the demand for other machine tools as they are not of much relevance
for assessing the project under appraisal, the Kikinda Foundry, which wants
to specialize in the manufacture of grinders while giving up gradually the
production of drilling machines. However, in the immediate future, Kikinda
would increase its drillirn machine production from 60 units to 80 units to
help alleviate tne shortage of such machines in Yugoslavia. The existing short-
age is obvious from the fact that the net imports of drilling machines reached
817 in 1972 compared to 263 units in 1968.
Production and Trade
13.       The production of machine tools is expected to increase from the level
of 13,125 tons in 1972 to 17,990 tons in 1977, representing an annual growth
rate of 6.5%. The following table shows the development of the machine tool
industry in the past (see also Table 1) and projections for the future:

During 1968-1971, exports increased rapidly, reaching the peak of 4,,055 tons in
1971 before declining slightly in 1972 because of sharp increase in domestic
demand which also resulted in steep rise in imports. The share of imports in
consumption has risen from about 51% in 1968 to 64% in 1972, and is expected to
increase to 71% in 1977, thus indicating the widening gap between supply and
demand.
B. Kikinda Machines
Production Development
14.       The Kikinda Iron Foundry is the only producer of grinders in Yugoslavia.
It started production of grinders under a license from the flFortuna"Compary of the
German Federal Repiblic, and later added grinders of its own design. Kikinda's pro-
duction program for machine tools included lathes, radial drills and universal
external grinding machines. However, partly because of changes in machine tool
technology and partly because of strong competition, the enterprise decided to



AhEX 3-2
Page 5
discontinue its production of lathes in 1969 and to widen instead its product-
ion program of grinders. Under a well thought out product development program,
it decided that the next logical step,would be to produce special external
grinders and then to start producing intarnal grinders.
15.       Though Kikinda has acquired sufficient experience in the production of
external grinders, it has no experiences in the production of internal grinders.
After careful consideration of its product development strategy, Kikinda entered
into a 10-year license agreement with the Bryant Grinder Corporation of Spring-
field, Vermont (the U.S.) in February 1973. The contract provides for know-how
and technical training required for the manufacture, sale and service of the
licensed product against an initial cash payment plus a royalty per machine
sold. Sales and services by Kikinda are licensed for most East European and
Middle East countries and all Western European countries. However, the product-
ion is expected to be initially for the domestic market only.
Past Performance
16.       The important domestic user of grinders are the automotiveAtractor-,-
ball bearing and machine tool industries. rable 3 shows the sales trend of grinders
by republics in Yugoslavia.The followi-ing table shows the growth of production of

The above table shows that during 1968-72 Kikinda production of grinders more
than doubled. As a result, imports of grinders have come down sharply in 1972
from the peak level of the previous year.
Demand for Grinders
17.       The replacement demand alone would be for about 190 grinders a year.
In addition, an additional 380 grinders would be required, thus raising the total
demand to 570 grinders annually by 1977. According to Kikinda, the share of
various grinders in total demand in 1977 would be as follows: Universal grind-
ers, 50%; surface grinders, 25%; special grinders, 20%;and internal grinders,
nearly 5%. Based on these assumptions, which seem reasonable, the demand for
various types of grinders would be: Universal Grinders, 285; surface grinders ,145;
special grinders, 115 (including centerless grinders); and internal grinders, 25.
Planned Expansion
18.       After completion of the expansion project in 1977, Kikinda will have
a capacity for -bout 460 machine tools a year. Of these, about 20% will be
radial drills,17 leaving a capacity for 380 grinders a year. (Table 2 shows
details of the projected trend of sales of Kikinda in the future.)
19.       The following table compares the demand for grinders with the estimated
production of Kikinda:
Demand and Production of Grinders (1977)

Type of Grinders             Demand        Production        Deficit
Universal                     285             190             -95
Surface                       145             100             -45

Total                   5
The deficit would be higher at 330 if projected exports of Kikinda are taken
into account. In order to meet its foreign exchange and contractual obligations,
the Comparn plans to export the following number of grinders:

Universal                   40                        25                 65

Internal            _____
1/ The Company is increasing its production of radial drills from 60 units
to only 80 units, for which there J5 adequate demand. Ultimately, Kikinda
wants to give up the production of radial drills while concentrating on
grinder production.



AM'EX 3-2
Page 7
20.       Kikinda exports a number of grinders to the clearing area, mainly
Poland and the U.S.S.R. (Table 4).  Twelve special grinding machines would be
sold to U.S.S.R. during 1973. A trade agreement with the U.S.S.R., concluded
in September 1972, provides for the supply of 50 grinders a year by Kikinda
starting in 1975. Therefore, it appears realistic to assume that grinder sales
to the clearing area countries will be on average about 15% of total grinder
production. In addition, Kikinda exports hydraulic systems for grinders to
Rumania under a 5-year contract valid until 1976. (Table 2)
21.       Exports of grinders to convertible currency countries were directed
in the past to mainly the German Federal Republic (Table 4), under a contract
with Kikinda's licensor, Fortuna, which had exclusive distribution rights in
that market. However, this contract expired at the end of 1971 and since then
Kikinda has been trying to promote exports on its own. It has signed a sales
contract with a trading companr in Frankfurt in order to gain new customers and
replacement orders. Kikinda expects to sign a similar sales agency agreement
with a trading firm in Milan, Italy. Through participation in trade fairs,
contacts with importers, and a sales agreement with a machine tool sales and
service agency in New Jersey, the U.S., Kikinda hopes to increase sples to the
North American market. An order from the U.S. for 12 grinders was received in
November 1972.
22.       On the basis of contracts already signed or under discussion the Company
plans to sell about 20 machines annually to Germary and Italy, and 50 machines a
year to the U.S.
Prices, Tariffs and CoMpetitive Position
23.       Domsestic prices (Table 5) of Kikindats machine tools are controlled
by the Government. The last price increase granted in December 1972, amounted
to 15%. Table 6 compares the prices of various Kikinda grinders with those of
two more important foreign competitors. It reveals that the Kikinda prices are
considerably lower. *While prices for the planned production of internal
grinders have not yet been set, it is expected that they would be about 30% below
the prices for comparable machines in Western Europe. Therefore, price is un-
likely to impede Kikinda's export sales effort.
240       NIominal tariff protection (customs duties and taxes) amount to about
30%. Further, import permits by the Government and permission by Kikinda are
required for their imports.
25.       Product quality has been an important Kikinda objective, and the pro-
duction of well-known licensed machine tools has helped establish this image.
The production of internal grinders under license is consistent with this
strategy.  Delivery time is agreed with the customer at the placement of the
purchase order. Universal grinding machines are typically available in 6
months, while special grinding machines require a longer period for additional
attachments and settings.
26.       Kikinda sales service in Yugoslavia and Western Europe includes a
guarantee covering parts and necessary repairs during the first year; and
repairs on a service charge are undertaken for up to 10 years after the sale.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 8
Customers usually send machine operators to the Kikinda plant to get operat-
ing instructions prior to delivery. Kikinda engineers pay regular visits to
customers to give assistance and get customers' views on the products purchased.
These services are also extended to customers in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. through
local sales agencies appointed in those countries.
Marketing Organization for Machine Tools
27.       Kikinda's sales director is based at the plant in Kikinda. Reporting
to him are the deputy director for sales also based in Kikinda, and the sales
director for machine tools based in Belgrade where the main sales office is
located. Field representatives in the various Republics of Yugoslavia report
to the Kikinda office on a regular basis. Export inquiries are handled mainly
through the Belgrade office, while technical questions are handled at the plant.
It is planned to strengthen the number of sales engineers working in the domestic
representat:Lve offices. The enterprise works closely with the Masino-Uniony
Belgrade, in preparing long-term studies on the machine tool requirement and
product development needs of the Yugoslav market.
28.       In order to secure export sales and to develop new customer contacts
Kikinda has its own sales engineers in Germany (Frankfurt) and in the U.S.S.R.
(Moscow) and agency representatives in Italy (Milan), and the U.S. (New York).
Kikinda has a fairly sophisticated sales organization and is aware of the
importance of continuous marketing efforts in developing customer relationships
Domestic import-export firms used by Kikinda for casting sales provide additional
contacts. Regular attendance and exhibits at trade fairs such as those held in
Milan, Chicago and Zagreb help develop and maintain customer contact and keep
in touch with product technology developments and price trends.

YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
PROPOSED FACILITIES
1.        The existing facilities of the Kikinda Plant, described in Annex 2-2,
include the facilities under construction which are expected to go on stream
by the end of 1973. The project which is described in this section is to in-
crease the capacitv of malleable iron castings to 21,000 TPY, malieable fit-
tings to 6,400 TPY, nodular iron castings to 16,500 TPY, gray iron castings
to 1,500 TPY and machine tool production to 460 units (equivalent to 1,500 TPY).
A.   Overall Concept
2.        The main factors that characterise the expansion program of Kikinda
are the following:
(a) Increased production of fittings and automotive and other
castings in the malleable iron foundry by replacing some of
the old equipment, by using electric induction furnaces, the
most modern automatic molding lines (Disamatic), and continuous
processing in heat treatment, and by increasing the capacity of
the existing sand preparation, core-making, and cleaning facili-
ties. The present plant building will be expanded to accommodate
some of the new facilities to be installed under the program;
(b) Increased production in the gray and nodular iron foundry by
replacing one molding line; and by installing electric induc-
tion furnaces, a mechanized new molding line and supporting
sand preparation, core-making and cleaning facilities. In
order to install these new facilities the present building will
be expanded;
(c) Expansion of the production capacity of the machine tool plant
by changing the present plant layout and material flow; by
replacing old and obsolete machines; and by installing more
accurate and sophisticated machines, including numerically-
controlled machines. After the expansion, Kikinda plans to
produce more specialized external grinders as well as internal
grinders. The present machine tool building will be expanded
to have a new plant layout and a climatized assembly room for
high-precision assembly and testing;
(d) With the installation of more specialized machines and some
changes in the layout of the existing plant, the capacity of
the fitting finishing shop will be increased to 6,400 TPY.
The project also envisages new machines to produce an assort-
ment of fittings from 2-4 inches in size which are not produced



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
at present. Galvanized fittings production will be increased
by adding new galvanizing facilities; and
(e)  General revamping and remodelling of the existing auxilliary
facilities and material handling facilities will eliminate some
of the present production bottlenecks and also help improve
general working conditions in the plants.
3.        Since the expansion of all the existing plants is envisaged, the
details of the proposed facilities contained in the expansion program are
dealt with on a plant by plant basis. Details of the expansion program of
the malleable iron foundry, gray and nodular iron foundry, fitting finishing
plant, machine tool plant, raw material handling facilities and utilities,
are given below.
B.   Malleable Iron Foundry
3.        In order to avoid production drops during the implementation of
the project, this foundry will be expanded in two phases. In Phase I, two
Disamatic molding machines, a melting plant, and sand preparation and core-
making facilities will be installed between the existing heat treatment plant
and the No. 3 molding line. A new continuous annealing furnace will also be
installed near the old annealing furnaces and some additions will be made to
the cleaning room facilities. A major portion of the building extension work
will be carried out during Phase I. After completion of this phase, the
molding lines, Nos. 1 and 2, and the supporting cold blast cupola furnaces
and changing systems will be dismantled for Phase II of the project. The
capacity of this foundry after the completion of Phase I would be 12,500 TPY.
Under Phase II, a new moldilI line in the place of the old No. 1 and 2 molding
lines as well as four electric induction furnaces in the place of cupola
furnaces will be installed. Remodelling of the existing sand preparation
and core-making facilities for molding line Nos. 1 and 2 and addition of a
new malleabilizing furnace are also planned in Phase II of the project.
After the completion of Phase II, total capacity of the malleable foundry
would be 21,000 TPY.
Phase I
The following equipment will be installed during Phase I:
4.        Melting Plant:  A new battery of two hot blast cupola furnaces,
each with 6-7 tons/hr. capacity, will be installed to work alternately.  This
melting plant will have its own raw material storage facilities:  six pig
3                              3
iron and steel scrap bunkerc (200 m ), one coke storage bin (30 m ), one
limestone storage bin (20 m3), and one charging car to transport raw materials.
Charging of the furnace is completely mechanized. The capacity of the melt-
ting shop is calculated on the basis of the average weight of cast per mold
(15.6 kg/mold), number of molds per hour (400 molds per hour) and 90% ef-
ficiency in cupola furnaces.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
5.        The molten iron is discharged into a holding furnace for temperature
correction. There will be two electric induction heated channel furnaces -
one to serve as a standby while the other works - and each has a 6 ton (500 KVA)
holding capacity. Electric power consumption for 100C temperature correction
would be about 50 KW. The molten iron from the holding furnace will be trans-
ported to the automatic pouring devices - two of them, one at each of two Dis-
amatic molding machines - by 1-ton ladles connected to monorail systems (one
for each molding machine). The automatic pouring devices on the machine have
1.3 ton capacity each.
6.        Molding Lines:  There will be two similar Disamatic molding lines for
the production of fittings. The capacity of both molding lines would be 7,900
TPY on a 2-shift operation. Disamatic molding facilities, developed by a firm
in Copenhagen, Denmark, is unique in this field since it is a continuous row
of vertical molding system without mold boxes. It is well suited for mass
production lines because of its high molding capacity, mold rigidity, and
easy core placement and fully automatic working. The Disamatic mclding machine
proposed in the project will have a steel band length for 88 mold parts for
600 x 400 x 3/300 size molds and the cooling time at 200 molds/hour will be
about 22 minutes. Capacity utilization of this line is assumed to be 80% based
on the average weight of casting per mold of 5.58 kg and 28.8 pieces of cast-
ings per mold. Assuming 8% scrap and 2% oxydation and other liquid iron losses,
the total yield would be about 40%. There would be two shakeout grates (0.5
ton) and the castings would be transported by a monorail system to the shot
blasting machines through a long cooling tunnel. In order to facilitate the
erection of the new Disamatic molding lines, some minor modifications will be
made to the existing molding line No. 3, thereby reducing its annual produc-
tion capacity to 4,700 TPY.
7.        Sand Preparation Plant:  Based on the molding capacity of 240 molds
per hour and the mold size of 600 x 480 x 300 (0.085 m3), molding sand re-
quirement would be about 40 m /hr. A safety margin of about 20% is incorporated
in this calculation since the3assumed production of mold is only 200 mold per
hour. There will be two 20 m sand mixing and preparation units, 5 m3/hr.
rotary sand dryer, four sand bunkers (300 m3), one 2-ton crane for loading
sand into bunkers, one sand loading device for sand mixers, and three used
sand bins (180 m3). Prepared sand is transported to the new Disamatic molding
lines by sand conveyors and used sand is moved out of the molding facilities
by rubber belt conveyors.
8.        Some alterations and remodelling of the existing sand preparation
plant for the present molding line No. 3 is also planned. Sand storage
facilities - four bunkers with 300 m3 capacity - will be installed. A 2 ton
crane will be installed to load the bunkers with sand and a new charging device
is also planned for the sand mixers. There will be two new (20 m3 each) sand
mixers and a new 5 m3/hr. rotary dryer. By relocating the present conveyor
system, prepared sand will be transported to the existing molding line No. 3.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
9.        Core-making:  Hot box process will be used for making cores for the
new Disamatic molding lines. Core-making will be semi-automatic and automatic
and the cores will be transported to the molding machines by conveyors and will
be placed in the molds by automatic machines. Core-making machines' capacity
calculations are based on 19.5 cores per mold for 7,900 TPY production of cast-
ings, 80% machine capacity utilization and 5% breakage of cores. There will be
four 2.5 liter core shooters for fittings under 1" in size and two automatic
core shooters for special fittings. Two 2-ton/hr core sand preparation facili-
ties will also be installed. The core-making shop will also have sufficient
core storage facilities.
10.       Casting Finishing:  The castings from the vibrating shakeouts of
the Disamatic molding lines will be transported to the cleaning room by a
cooling conveyor which will pass through a cooling tunnel. Time required for
cooling of castings is about 3 hours and the speed of this conveyor would
be 0,5 meters/minute (length of conveyor cooling system will be 90 meters).
11.       Cleaning Room:  the casting and initial cleaning of castings will
be accomplished by two continuous shot blasting machines. Degating, knock-
out and inspection of castings will be done on two roller conveyor type
work tables (19 meters in length). For final cleaning, three automatic
grinders and two conventional double-wheel grinders will be added to the
existing facilities. The present cleaning room layout will be modified to
suit the increased production and material flow.
12.       Heat Treatment:  Based on 7,900 TPY of fitting productions, 100%
capacity utilization and three-shift operation, the capacity of the new con-
tinuous annealing furnace is calculated to be 1.4 tons/hr. Heating of this
furnace will be by natural gas and final temperature control will be by
electric power. Since annealing is accomplished at a temperature of over 860C,
the whole process will be carried out in a protective atmosphere against
nitrogen. A protective gas generator will be installed to supply sufficient
nitrogen.
Phase II
13.       After the completion and successful operation of items installed
under Phase I, the existing molding lines, No. 1 & 2, and the melting plant
supplying to these molding lines will be dismantled. Under Phase II of
the project, the production capacity of automotive casting will be increased
to 13,100 TPY for which the following equipment will be installed.
14.       Melting Plant:  The existing two cold blast cupolas will be replaced
by four electric induction furnaces with 10-ton (2.1 MW) capacity each, of which
one furnace without electrical connection will serve as a reserve. This melting
plant will be equipped with storage facilities (12 bunkers with 15 m3 capacity)
for raw material, 5-ton loading crane for loading the storage bunkers, scrap
preheating furnace (300'C) to reduce melting time and three sets of electrical
equipment for the induction furnaces. The melting time required for each furnace



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
is about 40 minutes since 60% of the charge will be preheated prior to charg-
ing. The molten iron from the furnace is discharged into 3-ton pouring ladles
which are connected to a monorail system for transporting molten metal from the
melting plant to the molding line. The capacity of the melting plant is based
on the production of 8,430 TPY of good castings assuming 10% scrap and 2%
oxydation and other liquid iron losses in the induction furnaces.
15.       Molding Line:  The new automatic molding line with a capacity of
8,430 TPY will replace the existing molding lines, No. 1 & 2, and will be
designed to produce automotive and other similar castings. The molding line
will be capable of handling 250 molds per hours with an average weight castings
per mold of 17.8 kg and will have 140 molds on the 100 meter long (speed 4
meter/min.) horizontal type conveyor. The flask size in this molding line
would be 630 x 500 x 2/300 and one mold will contain on an average about 6.75
pieces with an average weight of 1.61 kg/pieces, and the cooling time at 250
mold/hr would be about 17 minutes. Capacity utilization of this molding line
is assumed to be about 80% and total yield about 42% (mold yield 47%). This
molding line wlll also have two high-pressure presses (one for the lower
half and the other for the upper half), flask transport conveyor system,
two sand storage (3 m3) and fitting equipment, and one 1-ton shakeout grate.
The castings from the shakeout is transported to the cleaning area by the
cooling conveyor through a cooling tunnel.
16.       Sand Preparation Plant:  The existing sand preparation plant will
be reconstructed and extended to provide sufficient sand for the new auto-
motive casting molding line. Based on 250 molds/hr with mold size of
630 x 500 x 2/300, the capacity of the sand mixers is estimated at 60 m /hr;
2 new 30 m3/hr sand mixers will be installed, with 20% safety margin. There
will be 4 molding sand storage bins (300 m3/hr) equipped with a 3-ton crane
for loading sand, a new sand dryer with a capacity of 10 m3/hr will be
installed to dry the sand prior to charging into the mixers. Prepared sand
will be transported to the molding lines by belt conveyors and the used
sand will be transported from the molding area to three 50 m3 used sand bin
by a separate belt conveyor system.
17.       Core Making:  The core-making plant will serve the existing mold-
ing line No. 3 as well as the new automatic modling line. Semi-automatic
shell process will be used to make cores. New equipment to be installed in
the core-making shop are two sand mixing machines (3-ton/hr) for core sand,
one 5 m3 sand storage bin, core sand transportation carts, three 5-liter
capacity core shooters for small cores, two 7.5 liter core shooters for medium-
site cores, two 1.5 liter core shooters for large cores and core transport
conveyors for transporting cores to the molding lines. The capacity utiliza-
tion of the core-making plant would be 80% and core breakage is assumed to
be about 5%.
18.       Casting Finishing:  Casting from the shakeout would be carried by
a cooling conveyor through a 90-meter long cooling tunnel at a speed of
0.5 m/min. to the cleaning section. The time required for cooling is about
three hours.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
19.       Cleaning Room:  Two continuous blasting machines will be used for
initial cleaning and two roller-conveyor-type work bench will be used for
degating, knock out and inspection. For panel cleaning, the following
new equipment will be added to the existing facilities: 20 grinding machines,
7 cleaning benches and 6 straightening presses.
20.       Heat Treatment Plant:  One two-channel continuous annealing furnace
(1-ton/hr) with high and low temperature sections, will be installed in the
new part of the foundry. This furnace will be heated by natural gas, and
electric power will be used for final controls. The furnace operates (at
860C) with a protective nitrogen atmosphere and the required nitrogen will
be supplied by the protective gas generator. The capacity of this furnace,
based on 3-shift operation and 100% efficency, would be 5,600 PTY. This plant
will also have facilities for an oil bath, one water bath, and necessary stotage
for semi-finished and finished products.
21.       Observations:  The extension of the malleable foundry can be
implemented without disturbing the present operations. The equipment for the
processing of fittings can be erected on an area which is not used at present.
With proper operation of facilities under Phase I, the plant will have suffieient
capacity to meet its commitments to customers even when the existing cold
blast cupola and molding line No. 1 & 2 are dismantled.
22.       The proposed plant layout is favorable with regard to utilizing
the existing facilities as well as for the future material flow. Internal
transport of materials and castings is expected to be mechanized to the
extent necessary to improve productivity. The planned equipment and tech-
nology are up-to-date and well suited for the manufacture of the intended
products.
23.       Melting Department:  The cupola furnaces for fittings have a capacity
of 6-7 tons[hr, whith is about 21% above the average required amount of liquid
iron for the Disamatic molding line. Further, there is a possibility for
storing 12 tons of liquid iron in the two induction holding furnaces for peak
requirements. Therefore, the melting capacity of the cupola is sufficient.
24.       The melting capacity of electric induction furnaces for automotive
castings is 6 tons/hr, whereas the average liquid iron requirement is about
5.4 tons/hr, i.e., there is only 11% reserve in the melting shop. Further,
in order to avoid waiting time for liquid iron when castings which are above
average in weight are produced, proper production control is essential.
25.       Molding Plants:
(a) Fittings production line calculations are realistic. Although
the assumed efficiency of 80% is achievable, 75% efficiency
assumption would have been more realistic.
(b) Automotive casting molding line: The required number of molds
and the mold capacity have been calculated correctly. However,



ANNEX 4-1
Page 7
the efficiency of 80% for this molding line is rather optimistic.
Doubling the present flask size to 1,00 x 630 x 2/300 would
provide more flexibility and improved efficiency.
26.       The capacities of sand preparation plants, core-making facilities,
and cleaning room facilities are adequate for the proposed expansion.
27.       A slight modification to the present layout of the heat treatment
section is presently being considered, to make it more suitable for further
plant expansion.
C.   Gray and Nodular Foundry
28.       The expansion project is an extension of the existing facilities
with minor modifications to the present facilities. Since expansion will tot
affect the production of the existing plant, it will be carried out in one
phase.
29.       Melting Plant:  No changes or modifications to the existing melting
plant are envisaged in the project. A new melting plant consisting of four
electric induction furnaces, with a capacity of 12 tons per furnace, 2 melting
circuits (2.6 M) and two holding circuits will be installed in the extended
part of the building. This plant will be equipped with 8 raw material storage
bunkers (150 m3), 8 steel scrap storage bins (300 m3). one 5-ton overhead crane
for loading new materials, one charging device including a 5-ton crane and
sufficient electrical equipment for the electric furnaces. A scrap preheating
(200-300'C) furnace to reduce the melting time by 10 minutes will be installed.
The furnace melting capacity would be 5.1 tons per cycle and the capacity
of the melting shop would be 10 tons/hr. The molten iron from the electric
furnace would be discharged to a 3-ton pouring ladle for transport to the mold-
ing line by a monorail system.
30.       Molding Line:  The existing molding line No. 2 (see Annex 2-1) which
has a capacity of 1,700 TPY will be dismantled and the existing building will
be extended to install a new automatic molding line with a capacity of 10,700
TPY. This molding line will be capable of producing 250 molds/hr. and the
flask size will be 860 x 730 x 2/350. At the rate of 250 molds/hr, the cooling
time would be 16 minutes. The design of this molding line includes two high
pressure presses - one for the lower part of the line and the other for the
upper part of the line, three transverse chassis moving devices and a continuous
molding conveyor for molding, pouring and initial cooling. The capacity
utilization of this machine is assumed to be 80%. Total yield, assuming 10%
scrap and 2% oxydation and other furnace losses, would be about 54% (mold yield
61%). The castings will be dumped into a 1-ton shakeout grate where the cast-
ings would be separated from the sand. With the use of a 0.2-ton jig crane,
castings will be loaded to a monorail cooling conveyor system which transports
the castings to the cleaning room through a cooling tunnel.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 8
31.       Sand Preparation Plant:  A new sand preparation plant will be
installed for the new molding line. Based on 250 molds/hr, flask size of
860 x 730 x 2/350 and 20% safety factor, the sand preparation capacity required
would be about 95 m3/hr.  There will be two sand mixers with a capacity of 50 m3/hr
each. This plant will also have the following machines: a sand loading device,
an elevator (10 m3/hr) for loading sand into a conveyor (10 m3/hr) which will
feed the sandmixers and dryer, a 10 m3/hr sand dryer, a prepared sand conveyor
line (100 m3/hr), one storage bin (10 m3)3at each of the molding presses, a
"used sand" conveyor system and four 90 m  "used sand" storage bins.
32.       Core-Making:  The core-making shop is intended to serve only the
new molding line. The hot-box process will be used for the core-making. A
number of core-making machines and their capacities are designed on the basis
of 80% capacity utilization of the facilities plus 5% core breakage. The
plant will have the following facilities: two 10 m3 core sand storage, two
2.5-tons/hr core sand mixing units, a core sand transportation cart, 7 hot box
shooters (two 5-liter, 80-cycles/hr shooters, three 7.5-liter, 60-cycle/hr
shooters and two 15 liter, 50 cycle/hr shooters), sufficient storage space for
finished cores and a conveyor system to transport to the molding line.
33.       Casting finishing: As mentiorred earlier, castings from the shakeout
will be brought to the cleaning area through the cooling tunnel by a monorail
conveyor system. This section of the foundry will be on two different floors.
Most of the initial cleaning will be done on the lower floor and the final
cleaning, inspection and heat treatment on the upper floor.
34.       Cleaning Room:  This section will have a continuous cleaning machine
for initial cleaning, one 1.6 in diameter table blasting machine, work places
for degating, hoppers for scrap metal, 8 special grinders, 6 simple grinding
machines, 12 work places for final cleaning, inspection and control, and a few
conveyor systems for material handling.
35.       Heating Treatment:  The heat treatment plant capacity is based on a
3-shift operation with 100% efficiency. An annealing furnace (14 tons/charge)
with charging device will be installed. A protective gas generator (40 m3/hr)
for the supply of nitrogen to the furnace will be installed. The heat treatment
time in this furnace would be between 16-24 hours and the capacity of this furnace,
based on a 3-shift operation, would be about 4,600 TPY.
36.       Observations:  The expansion of this foundry can be carried out
without disturbing the production of the existing facilities. All the
existing equipment with the exception of the molding line No. 2 and some old
machines in the core shop and cleaning shop will be used even after expansion.
37.       The layout of the foundrv with regard to the existing and future
facilities and flow of material is favorable. Further expansion of this
foundry will not be possible due to lack of adequate space and heat treat-
ment facilities. However, the production could be increased by about 10%
with minor alterations and additions to the facilities. The intended
facilities and technology are suitable for the production of nodular iron



ANNEX 4-1
Page 9
casting, with the exception of cooling line which is too short in length
for adequate cooling; a longer cooling line would be more appropriate. The
capacitv calculations of all the facilities are reasonable and the planned
number of machines and capacities are adequate for the proposed production
increase. The internal transport will be mechanized as far as possible to
increase productivity.
D. Fitting Finishing Plant
38.       The existing fitting finishing plant will be expanded to accommodate
additional equipment to increase the production capacity to 6,400 TPY of which
about 4,300 PTY would be for galvanized fittings. Near this plant, sufficient
storage space for raw fittings will be provided by installing 300 containers
(1 x 0.8 x 0.6 m) for fitting castings, 40 containers (1 x 0.8 x 0.6 a) with
fish mouth lids.
39.       Initial Cleaning:  No major changes are envisaged for this section
excepting the installation of a new drum for greasing. The existing 19 tumbl-
ing drums are adequate for the increased production level.
40.       Final Machining:  The present layout of this section will be altered
to suit the proposed production level. Moreover, the following new machines will
be added to the existing facilities: six special automatic machines for elbows
and "T" pieces, four automatic machines for couplings up to 1", three automatic
machines for couplings pairs 1" to 2", 6 lathes for automotive casting, 7
work tables for joints, 7 fittiWg testing equipment, and sufficient inplant
storage area for work-in-process. New monorail systems will be installed to
improve the internal material transport.
41.       Cleaning Room:  Additional equipment to be installed in the exist-
ing cleaning room are: 13 preheating chambers, one caustic soda vat, water
vat, one lye vat and the extension of the existing monorail system.
42.       Galvanizing Section:  A new galvanizing section (1.7-ton/hr) will
be added to this plant. Machined fittings will be transported to this new
section by a monorail system. A 1.2-ton/hr continuous dryer for drying the
fittings will be installed. This section will also include 4 sets of zinc
smelting furnaces (15 tons of melted zinc), 0.2-ton dipping crane, 1.5 x 2 m
heated table, 1.5 m3 water vat and 0.2-ton centrifuge. The capacity of this
galvanizing section would be about 3,100 TPY.
43.       Final Finishing and Packing:  Four new surface finishing lines and
one additional packaging facility will be installed, and the existing surface
finishing and packaging lines will be relocated. For the final finishing lines,
four 1-ton loading equipment, 4 surface finishing lines (varnish coating
machines), 2 new belt conveyors and 2 new tunnel type dryers are planned. The
new packaging line which will be very similar to the existing line, will have
a roller type conveyor system, control tables for counting and final checking,



ANEX 4-1
Page 10
packaging tables, labelling equipment and sufficient storage area for cardboard
boxes and finished products.
44.       Observations:  The layout of this plant is satisfactory for the
material flow and the utilization of the existing as well as proposed facilities.
The calculation of machine and plant capacities are based on the experience df
Kiki-nda with its present facilities and are considered realistic. Most of
the existing facilities will be utilized even after expansion. With the instAl-
lation of fully automatic machines and mechanized internal transport systems,
the productivity of this plant is expected to increase.
E.   Machine Tool Plant
45.       In the expansion program of this plant, major emphasis is given to
the production of grinding machines (universal, flat, special and internal
grinders) with better precision and automation and also to better quality and
productivity, increased production capacity and better material flow. In order
to achieve this, the machine tool plant will be extended and modernized with
more sophisticated facilities; some of the existing machines which are inaccdrate,
old and unproductive will be replaced with new machines, and the present laybut
will be altered by relocating some of the machine tools for better material flow.
46.       The production capacity of this plant will be increased to 460
machines which would include more specialized and automatic grinding machines.
The selection as well as the numbet and3caiacity of machine tools are based
on careful calculations of required machining time, accuracy and capacity
utilization of machines.  The layodt of    A)>*%nt, which would basically be
on a functional basis, will have some fle'xbi1Rty for adding new products to
the proposed product mix.  T", general plant layout, main sections and machiiie
,rouns are shown at the end of this Annex.  This plant is expected to work
2 shifts per day and its approximate overall capacity utilization would be
about 75%, which is considered satisfactory for the type of work Kikinda is
planning.
47,       The following unproductive and inaccurate existing machines will
be replaced with new machines: 10 universal lathes, 7 milling machines, 3
drilling machines, 1 planing machine, 1 special grinding machine, 2 boring
machines, 1 grinding machine and t cutting machine. These machites will
either be used in the maintenance shop or sold depending on the condition
of the machines and the maintenance shop requirements.
48.       Kikinda plans to add numerically-controlled boring and grinding
machines to its production line to increase the productivity in mass pro-
duction of assembly parts.  It will also have a new temperature and humidity-
controlled insulated area for the mounting of fine and precision grinders.
The following new machines and equipment will be added: 4 boring and drilling
machines (of which 2 boring machines will be numerically controlled), 13
milling machines, 11 grinding machines (of which one wlll be numerically



ANNEX 4-1
Page 11
controlled), 1 planing machine, 1 horning machine, 1 lapping machine, 11
lathes, 2 sharpening machines, 1 cutting machine, 1 annealing furnace, 3
special furnaces, 1 washing device, 1 shot blast cleaner, various tools
and devices for production and control, and necessary spare parts.
49.       Observations:  The basic calculations with regard to the plant
capacity, number of machines and required area are satisfactory. The
selection of machine types and facilities as well as the plant layout for
the proposed production were done carefully. The only exception might
possibly be the numerically-controlled machines; Kikinda has no prior ex-
perience in operating such machines which require high-skilled operators
and programmers. However, facilities are available in Yugoslavia to train
people to operate such machines. In the case of the plant layout, suf-
ficient flexibility is incorporated to alter the product mix if needed and
to add new product lines similar to what Kikinda plans to produce. There
is ample space available for further expansion.
F. Utilities
50.       Electric Power and Distribution:  After the completion of the project,
the installed electric power would increase threefold from 12 MW to 36.2 MW,
while the power consumption would increase from 19.5 million kwh in 1972 to
60 million kwh in 1977. In order to meet the additional power requirement,
the present distribution system will have to be modified. According to an
agreement reached between Kikinda and the electric distribution company,
Elektrovojvodina, the latter will install a new 35/10 KV main transformer,
which would replace the existing main transformer station which is expected
to be installed by Elektrovojvodina, will be completed by early 1975. With-
in the plant site, the present distribution system will be reconstructed and
additional distribution lines and transformers will be installed by the
Company. In the malleable iron foundry, the three existing transformer
sub-stations will be expanded and a new one will be added. In the grey and
nodular iron foundry, in addition to the existing sub-station, three new
transformer sub-stations will be installed. One sub-station will be erected
for the new compressed air station. Further, the machine tool factory will
have a new sub-station in addition to the existing one. Expansion of the
existing sub-station in the fitting finishing plant is also envisaged in the
project. For lighting the plant site, the existing sub-station will be
enlarged and modifications will be made to the closed circuit line by installing
a 10,000 volt line. Most of the 10 KV distribution lines from the main trans-
former station to the sub-stations will be replaced by new cables. The power
distribution lines inside the plants would be underground. The cost of the
electric distribution system and installation within the plant site is included
in the project.
51.       Gas:  The heat treatment facilities in both the foundries use gas.
With the installation of additional heat treatment furnaces, the gas consump-
tion would increase. Moreover, the expansion of the existing buildings would



ANNEX 4-1
Page 12
also increase the gas consumption, since the boiler at the heating plant operates
with gas.  The total3gas consumption would increase from the present rate of
about 3.9 million Nm to 7.1 million Nm3 after the completion of the project.
According to an agreement reached between Kikinda and Nafthagas, the latter
will provide sufficient gas to meet the former's needs.
52.       An additional 3-12/" pipeline will be provided to transport gas
from the gage control station to the distribution station within the plant
site.  Additional distribution lines will be provided to supply gas to the
malleable iron foundry and the gray and nodular iron foundry. By extending
the existing line to the fitting finishing shop, the new galvanizing plant
will be supplied with adequate gas. The existing distribution stations will
be reconstructed to handle the increased gas needs and some of the old dis-
tribution pipelines will be replaced by new ones.
53.       Compressed Air:  Most of the facilities in the existing compressed
air station were built in the early 1960's. The compressed air requirement
would double upon completion of the project. After exploring the possibility
of expanding the existing system with two more small compressor unit (20 m3/mln),
Kikinda has decided to install a new compressed air station adjacent to the
fitting finishing shop, with four 40 Nm3/hr compressors (including one as a
standby), and there is provision for installing one more, if needed. This would
give Kikinda more flexibility and an assured supply of compressed air for the
proposed production. The new compressors will work in conjunction with the
existing ones to meet the plant requirements. The compressed air is mainly
used in the pneumatically-operated molding machines (which are run exclusively
by it), pneumatic hand core machines, pneumatic lifting devices and blasting and
cleaning machines. The compressed air requirement would increase from the pres-
ent rate of 95.5 Nm3/hr to 183.8 Nm3/hr (at 7 times the atmosDheric pressure)
after completion of the project. The total installed capacity of compressed air
would be about 260 Nm3/hr. Some of the existing distribution lines will be modi-
fied and additional lines will be installed to meet the expected increase in demaFd.
54.       Water:  Water consumption is expected to triple from 78 m /hr at
present to 205 m3 /hr after the project completion.  This would require complete
reconstruction of the existing water distribution systems. A new 12" well
will be drilled to obtain water from 200 meters below the ground level and
the water (1,400 liters/min.) will be pumped into the water tower. The new
well plus the existing four wells would be adequate for supplying necessary
water for plant operations.  The main water distribution will be by underground
concrete pipes and the network distribution will be by ferrous pipes with corrosion
protective coating. There will be automatic Ph meters, a water neutralization
unit and a unit for separation of solid particles for purifying the water
before circulation. A recirculation system will also be installed to minimize
the water intake. Before the used water is discharged to the Kikinda town
sewage system, it is neutralized to avoid corrosion of the sewage pipes.
As for drinking water, it is received from the Kikinda town water supply system.
55.       Heating:  The present system of water heating for steam will be
replaced by a new water heating system. Since most of the existing plants



ANNEX 4-1
Page 13
will be expanded, the heating requirement would increase from the present
rate of 7.9 k cal/hr to 13.1 cal/hr on completion of the project. In order
to meet this increased demand, a new 8-ton/hr gas-heated steam boiler capable
of supplying 5.6 k cal/hr, will be installed. The present steam heating
distribution system will be modified and replaced because most of the exist-
ing lines are small to carry warm water for the proposed heating system.
56.       Central Storage and Material Handling Facilities:  A large control
storage for all major raw materials required for the foundries will be built
in an area south of the malleable iron foundry. A number of existing build-
ings will have to be demolished for the construction of this facility. The
storage bins made of concrete will be 200 meters long and 35 meters wide.
This bay will be served by three overhead gantry cranes, which will feed
the melting shop bins with raw materials as well as unload raw materials
into central storage bins. One central sand drying plant and pneumatic delivery
system to serve both the foundries will also be installed.
57.       Ttandportation:  The present Belgrade - Kikinda road is being re-
constructed and the road near Kikinda plant is planned to be re-routed by
the Province of 'Vojvodina and the work is expected to be completed by 1974.
Once the road is re-routed, Kikinda will construct a railroad track connect-
ting the existing railroad track and the plant site. The cost of these
installations is included in the project.
58.       Under the urban development plan of Kikinda town, a new river
port, about 1.2 km from the factory, on the branch of the Dunav-Tisa Canal
network is being constructed and it is expected to be completed by the end
of 1973. In case of emergency, Kikinda plans to use this facility for
transporting raw materials and finished goods.

YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
ECOLOGY
A. General Standards and Conditions in Yugoslavia
1.        According to the Yugoslav law on protection against air pollution,
it is obligatory for all manufacturing enterprises to obtain certification
of the provincial administrative body responsible for pollution control as
to whether the required conditions for protection against air pollution have
been met. According to the Cmpany management, the Kiki.nda town authorities
are in full agreement with the current plant location and proposed facilities
for the expansion program.
2.        A new environment control law has recently been passed.  This law
stipulateAs that all new projects as well as existing plants should conform
to certain minimum pollution standards by the end of 1973 and all set
standards by 1977. A summary of the main conditions and standards, which
are still rather general as set by the law is given below.
(a) Temperature:
Work Room       lhC (min.)
Offices          200C
(b) Permissible concentration of harmful matters:
Mineral dust with over 50% free SiOo  -- 175 particles/cm3
Dust over 70% free SiO2                -- 1 mg/m3
Dust 10 -70% free SiO-2                   2 mg/m
co                    '                 - 0 cm3/M3W
sO2                                    -- 5000 om3/m ppm
2                                    --4 mg/re3
Fe2 03                                 -- Max 15 mg/m3
(c) Lighting:
For simple work        50 - 100 Lux
For moderate work     100 - 600 iLx
Precision work        500 - 1000 Izx
There are no clear classifications of the nature of the work.
(d) Noise:
Permissible noioe in production area 50 - 80 db
Permissible noise in office            4o - 50 db
(e) Air Pollution:
Plants are not permitted to release air containing harmful matter
into the atmosphere above the following concentrations:



ANIaE 4-3
Page 2'
Average daily       Individmal
Concentration       Concentration
Sulphur dioxide             0.5                  0.15
Soot                         0.5                 0.15
Carbon monoxide              1.0                 3.0
Arsenic                      0.003
Ash and inert dust         300 mg/m3
The provincial administrative body in charge of health determines the maxi-
mum permissible concentration depending on the type of indastry, location
and climatic conditions.
B. Pollution Control Devices in Kikinda
3.       Certain facilities in the Kikinda plant, as they exist now, may
not satisfy the present legal requirements.  However, with the facilities
proposed under the project it is judged that Kikinda will be in a position
to satisfy the conditions set by the new environmental law. The Company
plans to have the most up-to-date facilities for pollution control at a
total cost of about Din 10 million accounting for about 5% of the total
project cost. The major facilities would includes
Dust and Fum Extraction
4.       Effluent gases from all (existing and new) cupola furnaces in the
miialleable as well as the gray and nodular foundries w:il pass through 'LIBX-
Scheible'1 filters; these will be procured locally from a Yugoslav firm Which
is manufacturing this equipment under a license from ELEB of Switzerland.
The gas is then purified by e7traction units before being discharged into
the atjaaibhre.
5.       The sand preparation plants will use wet cust separators; the air
extracted from these plants will be released through filters, which separate
the sand fines, into the atmosphere. All major pollution sources - such as
mold pouring, cooling tunnel and shake-out - will have local extraction units.
Core-making shops, cleaning rooms, painting and varnishing and heat treat-
ment sections 52l also have localized extraction and f     i    stems for
purification of thLe air.
Water PLftication
6.       Water pollution is not a major problem in a foundry because the
discharged water does not contain any harmful materials. Nevertheless, the
water is neutralized before discharge into the Kikinda town sanitary sever.

1/  These items are charged to incaiie statement since, according to Yugoslav law,
interest during construction and start-up expenses cannot be capitalized; and
the Compar   also charges preoperating and engineering expenses to the income
statement.
2.        The cost estimates prepared by the Comparn  are based on the latest
information available to it as well as its past experience. These estimates
were reviewed by the Bank and are considered realistic.  Details of calculations
of each cost item are given below:
B. Building and Civil Construction (item 1)
3.        The building construction cost estimates are based on total new area
to be constructed and remodeled as well as the cost per unit area. The follow-
ing are the areas to be added, reconstructed, and dismantled during project
implementation:

4.        The cost per unit area (m2) varies from plant to plant and it ranges
from about 1,600 Din//m2 in the fittings department to about 2,400 Din/rn in the
central storage department. The differences between various facilities are due
to the amount and complexity of concrete work required in each plant. For
example, concrete bins will be needed in the central storage area whereas the
fitting finishing plant will require only a minor amount of concrete and build-
ing works.  Another reason for cost differences is the differing needs for in-
plant installations and foundation work. Taking these differences into account,
it has been calculated that the average Cost per m2 would be about 2,000 Din/m2,
compared with the prevailing rate of about 1,500 Din/r2 in Yugoslavia.  Based on
the above, the total cost of building and civil construction is estimated at
Din 36.4 million and its breakdown is as follows:
Total Building & Civil Construction Cost

Phase I                        6,343

Total                                   36,371
5.        The Company has already received quotations from four Yugoslav con-
struction firms. These quotations based on fixed-price contracts indicate that
the total cost could be lower. But in Yugoslavia fixed-price contracts are not
strictly followed because the contractor could increase his price if the Govern-
ment allows higher construction costs. This being the case, the cost estimates
given in the table are considered realistic.
C. Equipment Cost (item 2)
6.        For most of the equipment and machinery, Kikinda has received written
tenders from 3-6 suppliers from different countries. Most of the quotations
are from suppliers in Germany, Italy, the U.K., Sweden, Denmark, and the U.S.
The Company has also received quotations from at least three local suppliers
for domestic equipment. The quoted prices from different suppliers vary on
the average by about 25%. For foreign equipment, in most cases, price quotations
were received between January and March 1973. These prices have been used for
cost estimates; however, the Company feels that, under international competitive
bidding, the actual delivery prices would be about 15% lower than those quoted.
However, it should be noted that foreign equipment prices, in dollar terms,
have increased by about 20% in the last two years. The following are the cost
estimates for foreign (CIF Yugoslav border) as well as local equipment, includ-
ing spare parts:                            Din  Million

7.        Of the total equipment cost of Din  218 million, about 45% will be
for the malleable iron foundry and the fitting finishing plant, about 20% will
be for the gray and nodular iron foundry and about 25% for the machine tool
plant. About 20% of total equipment in value would be procured locally.
D. Duty and Taxes (item 3)
8.        Duty and taxes are calculated based on the prevailing tariff rates
(which came into effect on February 26, 1973) for machines and equipment. The
present customs duty for foundry equipment varies from 15% to 19% of the CIF
value (Yugoslav border) and for machine tools from 19-21%. For the project-
ions, 17% duty for foundry equipment and 20% duty for machine tools have been
assumed. In addition to the customs duty, there are other taxes to be paid for
imported equipment.  In addition to the customs duty, a total tax of 9% on the
CIF value (Yugoslav border) - 3% import tax and 6% special tax - have to be
paid for all imported items. Customs duty and other tax calculations are
summarized below:

E.  Transport Cost (item 4)
9.        Transport cost estimates including insurance and handling are based on
tne tonnage quoted by various suppliers and the prevailing transportation cost
per ton of machinery; they were calculated separately for foreign and local equip-
ment. The transportation cost for foreign equipment is from the Yugoslav border
to the plant; this cost, including insurance per ton of equipment, is assumed to
be 4.0 Din/km. An average distance of 700 km from the Yugoslav border to the
plant for foreign equipment and an average distance of 600 km for domestic equip-
ment are assumed. Based on these assumptions, total Cost of transportation,
including insurance and handling, is estlmated at Din 3,568,0oo broken down as

F. Erection atld Installation Costs (item 5)
10.       Costs pertaining to these two items were separately estimated; the
installation cost estimates are based on the bill of materials plus related
assembly costs and the erection cost (including only final mounting and assembly
costs) estimates are calculated as follows: (1) For the two foundries, 4% of
total equipment value for major eqluipment and 1% of value for small pieces of
equipment; and (2) for the machine tool plant, the fitting finishing plant and
the auxiliary equipment, 2% of value for major equipment and 1% for minor equipment.
11.       The installation and erection cost estimates on a plant by plant basis
are as follows:

The total installation and erection costs add up to Din 21.6 million.
G. Contingency (item 6)
12.       To the total cost estimates based on a detailed breakdown into faci-
lities and equipment, a 10% contingency (for foreign as well as local costs)
has been added to account for minor scope changes and omissions of equipment
and civil works. Considering the advanced stage of preparation of the project,
this contingency provision is considered more than adequate. This item also includes
Din 3.8 million in foreign exchange, resulting from rounding or the Bank loan.
H. Price Escalation (item 7)
13.       During the past two years, equipment (local as well as foreign) and
civil construction costs have been increasing at an annual rate of about 10%,
In order to account for future price and construction cost increases, price
escalations have been added to the project cost. In view of the steps being
taken by the Federal Government of Yugoslavia, the domestic inflation rate



ANNEX I5-1
Page6
is expected to drop in the future.  Assuming that the measures taken to
control inflation will succeed, the following domestic inflation rates have
been assumed: 1973, 10%; 1974, 8%; and 6% per year afterwards. With regard
to foreign equipment, a 6% inflation rate per year has been assumed. Based on
these assumptions, total price escalation is estimated at 59,886,000 Dinars
(9,561,000 Dinars on domestic cost and 30,325,000 Dinars on foreign exchange
costs) about 14% of total project cost.
I. Pre-operating and Start-Up Expenses (item 8)
According to Yugoslav law and the Company practiceithese exper8ses are not
capitalized; they are charged to the incmie statement as they are incurred. Due to
the pecaliarity of the accounting system, a clear picture of these costs has not
been obtained. Of the estimated total expenses of Din 16.0 million pre-operat-
_nrg costs would be about Din 12.0 million, including approximately Din. 5.0
n illion for training of personnel.  Of the total expenses about Din  4.0 million
^-s expected to be in foreign exchange primarily for travel and training abroad.
Start-up expenses, estimated at Din 4.0 million, pertain only to the initial
start-up of the facilities.
J. Engineering (item 9)
...,     Since the Company lacks experience in preparing tender specifications
and evaluating international bids, it plans to appoint a technical consultant
for this purpose. The Cost for this service is estimated to be about 5.0 million
Dinars in foreign exchange. This expense will also be charged to income state-
ment.
K. Incremental Working Capital (item 10)
16.       Details of calculations and underlying assumptions are given in Annex 5-2.
L. Interest During Construction (item 11)
17.       interest during construction is calculated on the basis of the expected
disbursement. All foreign interest charges relate to the Bank loan and the smalI
amount of local interest is due to the need for the Company to borrow short-term
funds in 1975. All interest is charged to the income statement as required by law.
M. General Comments
The cost estimates on the whole have been well prepared on a plant-by-
JL, fnt basis and are considered realistic.  However, the investment cost per ton of
malPeable castings(US$104. /ton).appears high compared to international cost stand-
ards which range from US$750-850/ton. Major reasons for the difference are the
needs for: (i) replacement of some existing facilities; tii) revamping of certain
ifaciities; (iii) heavy investment in heat treatment equipment; and (iv) additional
i,aterial handling and pollution control fac-lities for the existing plant.
Investment costs per ton in the gray and nodular foundry and in the
L-ting finishing plant, estuimated at US$626/ton and uSMO/ton respectively,
K1 Based on the axchange rate U

Page 7
appear to be about in line with those of Western Europe.
20.       In the case of the machine tool plant, an international comparison is
difficult beQause of the differences in the range of products between plants.
However, the investment cost for this plant is also considered realistic since
the number of machines and facilities as well as the cost of machines and build-
ing construction have been estimated carefully.

ANNEX 6-2
YUGOSLAVIA - KIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
RAW MATERIALS AND UTILITIES
A. Raw Materials for Foundries
1.        The supply situation regarding the main raw materials for the
production of castings and machine tools is not expected to be a bottle-
neck for Kikinda expansion as reflected in the followiing account.
2.        Foundry Pig Iron:  There are three steel plants wh.ch produce,
among other items, foundry, pig iron. Their production in 1972 is shown
below:
Foundra Pig Iron Production in 1272
(in Tons)
Zenica (Bosnia-Herzegovina) 140.,000
Store (Slovenia)             35,000
Sisak (Croatia)               5,000
Total              10,0 00
3.        By 1975, the three steel plants are expected to increase their
foundry pig iron production to 2,000 tons and the existing steel plant at
Smederevo (Serbia) has plans to start producing 100,000 tons of foundry pig
iron a year, thus raising the annual Yugoslav production to 300,000 tons.
4.        In 1972, Yugoslavia consiwed 220,000 tons of foundry pig iron of
which 40,000 tons (19% of the total) were imported, mainly from the Soviet
Union, Canada and West Germany. With the expansion of the local production,
however, the country is expected to be self-sufficient in foundry pig iron
*by 1975.
5.       In the case of Kikinda, its requirements of pig iron are met partly
from the Store Steel Plant and partly from imnports. Kikinda officials expect
that the Store Steel Plant, after its expansion, would be able to meet all pig
iron needs of Kikinda by 1975.
6.        Scra: The total scrap consumaption by Yugoslav foundries in 1973 is
expected to be 180,000 tons of which 10,000 tons (5.5% of the total) would be
from imrports. According to the Foundry Association of Yugoslavia, imHports of
scrap for foundries would not grow in the future, because of the availability
of more foundry pig iron. For the industry sector as a whole, scrap imports
are expected to decline from about 490,000 tons in 1973 to 230,000 tons in 1975.-1
7.        In the case of Kikinda, the plant is not expected to. encounter
problems in getting adequate scrap supply for its expansion program. In March
1972 it signed a 10-year contract with Otpad, a scrap supply company of
Zrenjanin, near Belgrade, to meet approximately 70% of Kikinda's annual needs.
1/ According to Yugoslav Steel Producers' Association.



ANNEX 6-2
Page 2
Other sources of scrap for Kikinda are: Ferrotex, a scrap supplying company
of Kragujevac, near Belgrade; and the Zastava Auto Plant.
8.        Coke:  Annual coke consumption by foundries in Yugoslavia is at
present about 130,000 tons of which about 40,000 tons are imported mainly
from Czechoslovakia, Poland, West Germany, France and Holland. Yugoslavia
has plans to build two new coke plants at the following locations: Baker
(a 800,000-ton/year plant) on the Adriatic Coast; Zenica (a 1.4-million-ton/
year plant) in Bosnia. Further, the capacity of the only existing coke
plant at Lukavac is expected to be increased to 1.4 million tons by 1975-76.
When these projects are completed, no further coke imports, particularly for
foundries, are expected to be needed.
9.        The lukavac plant is the major source of coke for the Kikinda
Foundry. However, it has not been able to meet the foundry's needs fully.
Kikinda has, therefore, invested some funds in the expansion of the lukavae
plant so that the latter would be able to meet a larger part of the former's
requirements.
10.       AnthracIte; A local firm is able to meet all the anthracite require-
ments of Kikinda. The firm has plans to expand its production in line with
the expansion of Kikinda.
11.       Quartz Sand:  Currently, Kikinda is able to meet almost all of its
requirements of quartz sand from four domestic suppliers. However, these
suppliers would not be able to meet Kikinda's needs fully after its expansion.
Therefore, Kikinda is encouraging the opening of a new mine by the Yugoslav
firm, Radnici Nemetala Valjevo. Kikinda has offered to sign a long-term
contract with the firm to purchase sand from the new mine.
12.      Lmstone:   The local mine, Veljko Dugosevic at Kucevo, would continue
to be able to meet all the limestone requirements of Kikinda.
13.       Bentonite:  Production of bentonite by the local firm, Bentomak,
would continue to be adequate to meet Kikinda's needs.  However, this firm is
showing more interest in exporting than in selling at home because local
bentonite prices are lower than export prices due to Federal price controls.
Kikinda has approached the Federal Government to allow the local bentonite
prices to rise to the level of export prices.
14.       Resins: Resins are mostly imported from West Germany.
15.       Ferroalloys:  Kikinda would continue to cover part of its ferro-
alloy needs from the local supplier, 8 Mart, at Ada.  Eikinda provides technicaI
assistance to this supplier and also has a three-year supply contract with it.
Part of the ferroalloy needs have to be met by imports.
16.       Zinc:  Most of the zinc requirements of Kikinda are met by the local
firm, Zorka, with which Kikinda has a 10-year contract. Kikinda has also
invested Din 1 million in the expansion of Zorka. No bottleneck is foreseen
in the zinc supply to Kikinda.

B. Raw Materials for Machine Tools
17.       All the gray castings required for macl4ne tools would be provided
internally by the foundry at cost. Apart from gray castings, machine tool
production requires mainly various steel productsi including flat steel and
steel pipes as well as electrical equipment (e.g. electrical motors, switches,
wiring, etc.)  In the case of grinders, in 1972, on an average about 13% by
value of their needs of steel products and 40% of their requirements of
electrical materials were imported. These percentages are expected to decline
to less than 10% and 25% respectively by 1976 with the expansion of steel and
electrical equipment industries in Yugoslavia.
18.       At present, there are 8 steel plants in Yugoslavia with a total
capacity of about 2.6 million tons per year of crude steel equivalent. Their
capacity is expected to increase to about 5 million tons by 1975, and 7 million
tons by 1980. As for electrical equipment, this is a fast-growing industry
in Yugoslavia. It shows one of the mnost successful and profitable performances
mainly because of the achievement of economies of scale, cooperation and
trading agreements with some leading international producers, creation of a
number of research and development centers, strong domestic demand and fav-
orable raw material costs (e.g. copper and lead prices are lower than world
prices).
C. Raw Material Import System
19.       Raw material imports are allowed under three main systems:.  (a)
the GDK system; (b) the RE system, and (c) the LB system. Under the GDK
system, companies which export are allowed to inport about 25% of their
requirement of raw materials for export production. Under the RK system,
imports of specific items (steel scrap, ferroalloy briqueette4pig iron, foundry
coke, etc.) are allowed to be imported in quantities approved by industrial
associations. Under the LB system, no limits are imposed on the import of
specific items such as limestone, quartz sand, coal dust, zinc, etc. In
addition, companies which export can use their retention quota to import
freely the things they need. This quota amounts to 20% pf the annual total
exports of a company. However, the depreciation quota'cannot be used for the
import of raw materials.
20.       The following table shows the customs duties on the import of
main raw materials by foundries and the import system under which they fall-.

at the National Bank to import equipment and spares, and also to repay
foreign credits.

D. Utilities
21.       Electricity:  The Company has already held negotiations with the
electric power distribution agency, Electrovojvodina, to ensure adequate
power supply for the expansion. The agency has agreed to meet all the
power requirements of Kikinda by installing a new transformer station at
its own cost.
22.       The power requirements of Kikinda are expected to increase three-
fold daring 1973-77 as shown below:

23.       Gas: The existing gas line has a flow capacity of 2,450 Nm3/h.
The Companyplans to install a new gas line to supplement the existing one
and raise the capacity to 3,750 Nm3/h, including a 20% stand-by. These
expanded facilities would be adequate to meet the need of Kikinda after
expansion.
24.       Water:  The excisting wRter supply system would be supplemented with
additional facilities so that the needs of the expansion program estimated
at 905 m3/hr could be met fully.

PRODUCTICN AND PRODUCTION COSTS
A. Production
Production in the various foundry units of Kildknda is expected
to increase as follows:

1/ Excluding castings for pipe fittings.
Excluding losses from machining.
~ Exclusively for internal production of machine tools.
The table shows that, as a result of the proposed expansion, production of
malleable castings for the automotive and other industries mould increase
by over 2 times; pipe fittings by about 1_ times; nodular castings for
automotive and other industries by more than 2 times; and gray castings by
about 1 times.
2.        Output figures have been calculated on the basis that at full
production, the various foundries could operate at 80% of rated capacity;
and the machine tool department at 75% of rated capacity. These assumptions
are in line with results achieved by Kikinda and the experience of similar
plants elsewhere. Further, the following assumptions have been made regarding
yield in various departments:
Average Yield
(in percentage)
1972          1977
(Actual)    (Projected)
Malleable castings      41             42
Pipe fittings           36             4O
Nodular castings        50             54
Gray                    76             76
The average yield in a foundry depends on the size and complexity of castings
produced. The yield is higher in the case of large castings than in the
case of small ones.  As gray castings produced by KNkinda for its machine
tool production are large, their yield is higher than in the case of other
types of castings. As a result of the expansion program, the yield in the
malleable and gray foundries is not expected to increase; however, in the
case of pipe fittings and nodular castings, there would be significant yield
increases mainly because of better material handling. In pipe fittings, the
yield increase is also due to the installation of the Disamatic molding line
and the proposed production of larger fittings.

B.  Principal Production Costs
3.        Production cost forecasts for Kikinda are cumbersome mainly
because of the following factors: (a) peculiarities of the accounting
system; (b) a vide range of products produced; and (c) lack of effective
cost centers. However, based on the Company's past experience, the
following cost projections have been made:
Foundry Products
4.        Major raw materials required for foundry operations are pig iron,
steel scrap, ferro-alloys, coke, sand, limestone and resins.  On the average,
prices of metal groups are expected to increase annually by about 5.5%; of
coke by 3%; of sand by 8.5%; of limestone by 6% and of resins by about 7%.
During 1972-77, the consumption of major raw materials, based on the pro-
jected production volume, would be as follows:

Machine Tools
7.        The main raw materials required for the production of machine
tools are castings, various steel products, electrical equipment and acces-
sories. and small assembly parts such as bearings, screws, etc. The
entire gray iron castings produced by ICldnda are meant for internal sales
at    cost         for the manufacture of machine tools.  Price increase of
raw materials for machine tools are also expected to increase at a rate of
5.5% per year - gray castings 6% per year, steel 4% per year, electrical
equipment 3.5% and other materials 4% per year. Based on the quantities
required per machineJ, which is based on Kildnda's past experience, and the
projected price increaee, the following direct material costs per machine
have been calculated:

A. Assets
1.        CashiJ includes cash in hand, bank doposits and special funds for
small inve-slnt (e.g. for repairs and maintenance, etc.)
2.        Receivables2/ include receivables from domestic customers (includ-
ing those under I2Fiation), and advance payment for imports not covered by
commercial bank credits, and prepayments for maintenance, workers' travel,
etac Receivables from foreign buyers, and from products sold locally on
credit for two or more years are not included because they are covered by
cownrcial bank credits at 4% interest per annum.
3 .    Invento2zuincludes raw materials, semi-finished products, finishkd
products and stores. On December 31, 1971, inventories were revalued as
part of the general revaluation of assets.
4.        Gross Fixed Assets include land, buildings, machinery and equipment,
fixed assets under construction, license fees, etc. Under the Yugoslav
accounting system, preoperating and start-up expenses are not capitalized;
they are shown as cost items and deducted frm sales revenue in the income
statement.  On December 31, 1971, there was a complete revaluation of fixed
assets (excluding land).
S.        Depreciation: The legal minimwm depreciation rate for machinery
in Vojvodina Province continues to be 7%. But since 1969 companies have been
allowed to use higher depreciation rates. With the modification of the law,
the Company used a straight line depreciation of its fixed assets at the rate
of 20% a year daring 1971 and 1972. Eurther, on December 31, 1971, when
there was a general revaluation of assets, the aecumulated depreciation was
also revalued.
6.        "Other Assets" include collective consumption assets (e.g., cash
from rent, credit to workers for housing, current value of assets such as
canteen, business office, etc.) and reserve fund assets (e.g. cash, tim
deposits for over 5 years, etc.)
7.        Financial Assets include investments in other enterprises, batas
and chambers of c erce as well as time deposits for more than 13 months
and I4utual Reserve Assets.
B. Liabilities
8.        Accounts P ablesi/ include payables to suppliers, and short-term
credit from IotErienterprises.  Credits from commercial banks to cover

receivables from foreign buyers as well as to make advance payments on raw
materials imports for export production, are excluded. (These items are
netted out from both sides of the balance sheet.)
9.        "Other Payables" include overdue payments (to employees, banks,
etc.) at the end of a year to be paid in the early part of the following
year.
10.       Current Portion of Long-Term Debt includes repayment of principal
due within the9next t-2 months to reditors - both domestic and foreign.
11.       Long-Term Debt includes all outstanding debt (domestic and foreign)
excluding current -ma-tuties.
12.       Reserve Fund could be used to cover losses; to pay wages and
salaries to employees -when the comparn is faced with liquidity problems; and
to comply with court decisions to pay overdue debts. Every year, an amount
equivalent to 2% of "lDahodak" (i.e. net sales minus cost of naterials,
supplies and utilities as well as depreciationT is allocated to the Reserve
Fund from the net income ("Dobitn).
13.       Collective Consumption Fund is mainly used to build houses and
recreational  aciIties for workers, to meet travelling expenses during
vacation, to defray hospitalization charges, and to pay scholarships to
attend Workers' universities, etc. However, the company can borrow without
interest from this Pund up to one year for the following urposes: (a) to
pay wages and salaries in times of liquidity problems; (b) to comply with
court decisions to pay off overdue debts; and (c) to finance inventories
and short-term credit sales in case of working capital shortage.  In cases
of borrowing from the Fund, the company has to contribute 2% of the amount
to the Fund for the Development of Underdeveloped Regions. Every year at
least an amount equivalent to 4% of the gross personal income of the employ-
ees is to be allocated to the Fund from net income ('Dobit"). The rate could
be'ligher depending on the decision of the Workers' Council of each enter-
prise. In the case a company earns low profit, it has to appropriate money
first to the Collective Consumption Fund. Then comes the Reserve Fund
appropriation. If the cacpa:ny suffers losses, no appropriation is obligatory
to any Fund.
14.      Mutual Reserve Fund is meant to cover the losses of the company.
Until 1970, the annual a;location to the Fund was a kind of Federal Tax.
Since then, it is treated as a loan to the Provincial Goverment to be repaid
every third year with about 4% interest. The annual contribution to this
Fund is calculated on the following basis: (Net Profit - Reserve Fund Alloca-
tion) x 4.5%. As the contribution to the Fund is recoverable since 1970, it



ANNEX 7-3
PWe 4 
is considered as part of the Business Pund.
Each Republic in Yugoslavia sets the rate of annual contribution
for the Mutual Reserve Fund. In Vojvodina, out of 4.5%, 4.0% goes to the
local com=e and the rest to the Province of Vojvodina.
When a compary faces a severe workilng capital shortage and/or
-when it cannot get adequate resources from outside for expansion, it could
approach both the local commune and the Republic/Provincial governments for
loans.  However, credit is not available from the Fund to cover losses.
In 1968, Kikinlda sought and received a loan of 1 million Dinars
from  the cormwne of Kildnda to construct a building for machine tools.
15.      Business Fund: After making allocations to the Reservre, Collective
Consumption., ER Nit  Reserve Funds, the remaining amount from the net
profit is allocated to the Business Fund which constitutes the main part of
the equity of companies in operation. At the end of 1971, Business Fund was
also revalued along with fied assets.
16.       Interest (Tax) on Business Funds was in force until December 1971.
It amounted to 3.5,% of tha Business Fund.
17.       Contribution for The Developh ent of Underdeveloped Regions: Since
1971, the Interest on Business Funds has been replaced by an         loan to
the Federal Goverrxient for the development of underdeveloped regions. It
amounts of 1.95% of the Business Fnd. The loan is to be repaid over 8 years
at an interest rate of 4% a year, with part of the repayment starting after
3 years.  his Fund is considered as a part of the Business Fund.
Contribution for the Developmnt of Disaster-Hit Areas: The Cora-
pany has to contribute annlly an amount eqUiMent to Q.75% of the gross
personal income for the development of disaster-affected areas.
C. Income Statement

1970  - 10%
1971  - 20%
1972  - 20%

Machine Tools           (Prices given in Annex 6-1)   Kikinda export prices
to convertible area
(c .i .f .Yugoslav border)
2/ In the case of pipe fitting export prices are lover than domestic prioces
largely because Kki.nda exports mostly low-quality black fittings mhile
using the better qu.ality fittings at home. The use of black fittings is
not allowed in Yugoslavia.
*  As KYdinda produced a wide range of castings and machine tools of different
sizes and intricacies, it is diff'icult to find strictly comparable products
in other countries and hence the determination of international prices is
rather cumersoms. Moreover, most items of the tnxP produced by iWdnda
are not i.spcrted to Yugoslavia. Therefore, Kikinda's output has been valued
at export prices(C.I.F., Yugoslav border) of the Compaz as these prices
are the best approximations available to international prices.

ANNEX 8-3
JYUGOSLAVIA: EIKINDA IRON FOUNDRY PROJECT
INDIRECT EMPLOYMENT GENERATION
1.       The Kikinda Iron Foundry produces iron castings and machine tools
for about 30 major enterprises, using various raw materials and semi-products
from over 20 companies.  The proposed expansion of Kikinda will have a ripple effect
on the production programs of those 50 and odd Yugoslav enterprises. An attempt
is made here to get an approximate estimate of the jobs likely to be created
upstream in the supplier industries, and also in the transportation and elec-
tric power sectors as a result of Kikinda expansion.
2.       The latest data for incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) and
incremental capital labor ratio (ICLR) for industry in Yugoslavia are avail-
able only for the period 1962-70, expressed at 1966 prices. Such data for
selected sub-sectors are given below:

3.       Kikinda uses a variety of raw materials and semi-products in the
prodciction of castings and machine tools. However, the incremental produc-
tion of Kikinda is not likely to stimulate the production expansion of all
supplier enterprises. But it is conceivable that firms producing items such
as pig iron, steel scrap, coke, anthracite, quartz sand, electrical goods,
metal products, and electricity would be expanded considerably as a result
of the Kikinda project.  In the case of coke, anthracite, and quartz sand
supply, Kikinda has invested or is planning to invest funds in the main
supplier enterprises to increase production to meet the needs of the proposed
project.
4.       It is estimated that Kikinda's incremental requirement of the
following items because of the project ,would be:  pig iron, 7,375 tons; steel
scrap, 14,500 tons; coke 680 tons; anthracite, 690 tons; quartz sand, 40,130
tons; electricity, 40.5 million kwh. It is most likely that these requirements
would be met entirely from domestic sources considering the expansion program
of various supplier industries. Based on 1966 prices, the value of incremental
raw material requirements for Kiidnda's expansion of castings production would be:

5.       The total incremental electric power requirements for castings as
well as machine tool production expansion of Kikinda  is estimated at 40.5
million kwh, each unit costing 0.185 Dinars per kwh (at 1966 prices). On
this basis, the value of incremental power needs of the project would cost
7.5 million Dinars.
6.       For machine toclproduction expansion, two important groups of out-
side semi-products required are electric goods (i.e. electric motors and
components, fuses, wiring, etc.) and metal products 1/ (i.e. ball bearings,
fastening parts, jigs and fixtures, forgings, non-ferrous and steel products,
etc.). In 1972, the weighted average value of requirements of electrical
goods and metal products at 1966 prices per machine toolwere 10,800 Dinars
and 32,800 Dinars respectively. Assuming the eame requirements per machine
for the future, the total incremental requirements of Kikinda would amount
to about 1.4 million Dinars for electrical goods and 4.3 million Dinars for
metal products.  It is likely about 80p of these requirements would be met
from internal sources while the rest would be imported.  Based on this
asFurnption, the incremental needs of Kiki.nda for local electrical goods and
metal products would cost 1.12 million Dinars and 3.5 million Dinars, respec-
tively (at 1966 prices),
7.       Using the employment coefficients stated earlier for various sub-
sectors and the estimated requirements of raw material and semi-products for
Kikinda s expansion, the incremental employmental generation in the supplier
industries is shown below:

Employment Effect on Transport Sector
8.       Kikinda expansion will also have considerable employment effect on
the transport sector. It is estimated that the total traffic generated from
Kikinda expansion would be nearly 26 million ton Ikm, taking into account the
transportation of various raw materials, semi-products and finished products.
Assuming that one person is required for every 56,000 ton km of transportation,
the incremental production at Kikinda would result in about 465 jobs in the
transportation sector.
Total Job Creation
9.       Thus Kikinda expansion would result in the creation of aDout 950 jobs
indirectly in the supplier industries, and electric power and transportation
sectors alone, without taking into account the jobs created in the user indus-
tries which are difficult to pinpoint. This estimate also excludes employment
generation likely to be triggered by increased consumption of goods by those
benefiting from the project.
Negative Effect
10.     Currently, a total of about 34,000 persons are employed in Yugoslav
iron found ries.  Of them, less than 10  are engaged in the operation of 100
and odd small foundries with less than 500-ton annual capacity each. It is
conceivable that some small, inefficient foundries may be adversely affected
by Kikinda expansion. But it is difficult to foresee with any degree of
certainty what effect this would have on the present employment in small
foundries.
