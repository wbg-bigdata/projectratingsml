APPRAISAL OF SECOND CORINTO PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Nicaragua is the largest of the Central American countries.  Trade
with its neighboring countries increased rapidly in the 1960's with the es-
tablishment of the Central American Common Market. Nevertheless Nicaragua's
economy remains principally dependent on exports outside of Central America
and on seaborne trade, eapecially with the United States, Europe and Japan.
Pxpulation and economic activity are concentrated along the Pacific Coast
waiere Corinto, the country's only seaport with de!pwater berths, is located.
ii.       The port, which is operated by the autonomous Government-owned
Ccrinto Port Authority (CPA), was expanded and modernized around 1960 with
the assistance of a Ba_k loan (143-NIC). The project was carried out satis-
factorily. The resulting facilities and the irstitutional improvements
carried out during the same period helped to make Corinto an excellent port,
efficiently run and financially viable. CPA recently completed construction
of a new berth for mechanized handling of boxed cargo (principally bananas)
from its own resources. Certain installaLions which were built over 60 years
ago now require replacement, and the capacity of the port needs to be increased
to handle increasing traffic, Also, the time is appropriate for establishing
container-handling facilities at Corinto to handle both Nicaraguan and non-
Nicaraguan traffic, which would produce substantial benefits to the Nicaraguan
econoomy.
iii.      Land access to the port by both road and rail was satisfactory,
but both the rail line and the highway are threatened with destruction by
erosion from the sea. In fact, rail access is now frequently disrupted
and isr maintained only by continuous emergency repairs.
iv.       The pro'cct appraised in this report is designed to:
(a) satisfv present and projected traffic demands up to
about 1985, by replacing and augmenting inadequate
lnstallations;
(b)  permit establishment of container-handling facilities;
and
(c) protect road and rail access.
Specifically, the project comprises:
(a)  construction of a new 240 m wharf with 40 ft depth
(MIWST) alongside and various buildings, storage
areas and utilit.es;



- ii -
(b) purchase of container-handling equipment;
(c) channel dredging;
(d) coastal defense works;
(e) consultants services; and
(f) staff training.
v.        The total estimated cost of the project is 99.1 million Cordobas
(US$14.16 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of 77.0
million Cordobas (US$11.0 million equivalentj.  Retroactive fiaancing of
approximately US$250,000 is recommended for expendi:ures on consulting ser-
ices incurred after November 1, 1971 and for expenditures on coastal defense
works incurred after January 1, 1973.
vi.       The project is economically justified with rates of return of 14%
on the conve.ational port facilities and 19% on the container-related facilities.
The coastal defense works are justified as the least-cost means of preserving
essential land access to the port.
vii.      During the past five years, CPA has had satisfactory earnings and
nas maintained a strong financial position. Some adjustments are needed
in iLs tariff structure to relate rates and charges to costs. CPA is ex-
pected to remain financially viable in the future. The loan vwll cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs of the project and will be made to CPA,
which should be able to contribute the local currency costs of the port works.
Since the Government is responsible for the coastal protection works, it will
provide the local currency costs of such works and will sarvica that portion
of the loan made for these works.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$11.0
million to CPA for a term of 24 years including four years of grace.



NICARAGUA
APPRAISAL OF SECOND CORINTO PORT PROJECT
I, INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank's involvement in the improvement and expansion of the
Port of Corinco began in 1956 when it made a loan (143-NI) of US$3.2 mil-
lion to the Corinto Port AuthoP!ty (CPA) for the construction of two berths
and tran.it sheds. The project was completed satisfactorily in 1961 after
about two years' delay aue to construction difficultlis.
1.02      On March 13, 1967, the Bank made a grant to CPA for an engineering
and economic study to determine the feasibility of further expansion of the
port. This study, carried out by LIVSET (a loint venture of Livesey and
Henderson of London and SETEC of Paris), was completed in 1968 ano recom-
nended construction of new wharves and ouildings, land acquisition and
hydrographic studies of channel deepening. CPA carried out a land acquisi-
tion program based on LIVSET's recommendations.
1.03      In 1969-70, the Bank conducted a Central American Ports Scudy which
.dentified the high priority investments needed in the seaports of the region.
The srudy report recommended that three additional berths be constructed at
Corinto. It also included a prelininary analysis of the potential for con-
tainer traffic in the region.
1.04      Based on the LIVSET study, in 1969, the Government requested the
Bank's assistance in financing extension of the port installations. The
project then appraised (draft report PTR-39, January 26, 1970) consisted of
berth construction, buildings, equipment and dredging at a total estimated
cost of US$8.05 million equivalent and a foreign exchange component of US$5.25
million. This loan was deferred pending the implementation of fiscal reforms
by the Government of Nicaragua.
1.05      In November 1971 the Government renewed its request to the Bank
for assistance in financing expansion and improvement of Corinto Port. The
resulting project appraised in this report incorporates much of the 1970
proposal as well as certain additional elements. It consists of a new 240 m
wharf, various buildings, open storage area, utilities, channel dredging,
container-haudling equipment, coastal defense wo,rks, consultants' services
and training with a total cost of US$14.16 million equivalent, including .
foreign exchange component of US$11.0 million.
1.06      Ihe appraisal report is based on:  (a) results of studies by con-
sultants, Frederic R. Harris (USA and Netherlands), Cisneros y Conrado
(Nicaragua), Santos & Heilemann (Nicaragua) which in turn were based partly
on the LIVSET and Bank studies (paraes 1.02 and 1.03), and (b) the findings
of a Bark appraisal mission to Nicaragua in July 1972 consisting of Messrs.
Parthasarathi (Economist), Newman (Engineer) and Chandler (Financial Analyst/
Consultant). The report was edited by Mr. J. Zedalis and Miss V. R. Fo3ter
(Technical Editors).

II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Nicaragua is the largest couatry in Central America, bordered by
Honduras on the north and Costa Rica to the south. It has coastlines on
both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and a land area of 118,000 km2,
besides 9,000 km2 of lakes (Map IBRD No. 10139).
2.02      The 1971 population of Nicaragua was just under 2 million with an
estimated annual growth rate of about 3%.. The population is concentrated
in the Pacific Coast region. The swampy plain east of the inuntains contains
60% of the land area but only 7% of the population.
B.   Economic Setting
2.03      The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current market prices in 1971
was 6,490 million Cordobas (US$927 million equivalent) and had grown in real
terms at an average annual rate of over 7%' since 1960; per capita GNP was
US$430 in 1970.
2.04      The most important sector of the economy is agric>lcure, which
accounts for about 24% of GDP and 71% of export earnings. The country's main
agricultural exports are cotton and its by-products, coffee, meat, sugar, and,
since this year, bananas.
2.05      Manufacturing is the most dynamic sector of the economy with a
1965-70 growth rate of 9.5%, compared to 1.5% for agriculture. Since the
markets for its products are largely within the Central American Common
Market, and reached by land transportation, manufactured produ_ts will not
directly increase seaborne commerce but will provide a substantial source
of demand for seaborne import of raw materials.
2.06      The main region of economic activity is the Pacific coastal area,
close to Corinto, which is the main export outlet for agricultural products.
The country's main imports are consumer goods, raw materials and capital
goods for industry, and petroleum products.
C.   Transport Sector
2.07      Nicaragua's transportation network is concentrlted in the Managia-
Corinto region and surroundings; the main highways, the only railroad, the
only international airport and the only deepwater port with.alongside
berthing facilities are all located there.



-3-
Highways
2.08      Nicaragua's land transport is based on its highways wh'ch carried
over 97Z of the land cargo tonnage in 1970. The roal network totals 13,000 km,
of which 1,300 km are paved roads. The road network is relatively dense in
the Pacific Coast area where it is connected to the neighboring systems of
Honduras and Costa Rica. There is no direct road link to the east coast.
Railways
2.09      The Government-owned Ferrocarril del Pacifico de Nicaragua operates
from Cc.into to Granada on Lake Nicaragua via Leon and Managua. The total
route length of 319 km is paralleled by good paved roads. Traffic has been
steadily decreasing; only 123,000 tons of freight were carried in 1971, of
which approximately 80,000 tons were to or from Corinto. The railroad operates
at a financial loss with annual revenues of 4.0 to 4.5 million Cordobas and
operating expenses of cver 6.0 million Cordobas.
Air Transport
2.10      There is one interna.lonal airport at Managua and two other air-
fields at Puerto Cabezas and Bluefields, both on the east coast, to which
scheduled air flights are operated. There are also several landing strips
for small aircraft.
Lakes and Waterways
2.11      There is some passenger and cargo traffic on Lake Nicaragua; the
total cargo handled is less than 5,000 tons per year.
2.12      The Rio Escondido is navigable with depths usually over 20 ft from
El Bluff on the east coast to Rama, some 80 km upstream. From Rama a road
connection exists to the Pacific area. Oceangoing ferries operate between
Rama and Miami, U.S.A., carrying cargo in trailers. In addition, a small
amount of cargo moves on the river between the El Bluff-Bluefields area an6
Rama. Improvement of the road to Rama is under way and some improvement of
the ferry terminal is planned.
2.13      There are several other navigable rivers in the eastern region, Rio
Grande, Rio Prinzapolka, Rio Curinwas, Rio San Juan and others, but very little
traffic moves on them as the area is sparsely populated and economic activiLy
is low.
Ports
2.14      In addition to Corinto, which is described in Chapter III, there
are two other Pacific Coast ports (Puerto Somoza and San Juan del Sur) and
three ports on the east coast. Puerto Somoza, about halfway between Corinto
and Managua, in 1970 handled 85,000 tons of dry cargo by lighterage and
670,000 tons of petroleum products through an offshore buoy and pipeline.



-4-
San Juan del Sur near the Costa Rican border handled 41,000 tons by lighter-
age. Development of deepwater, alongside berths at Puerto Somoza does not
appear to be feasible. San Juan del Sur has a small natural hiarbor, but has
several disadvantages, including its remoteness from the main area of ecor.omic
activ,4ty.
2.15      Except for the road-waterway link to El Bluff, the east coast ports
are isolated from the region of 1mportant economic activity in Nicaragua.
Total cargo handled by the three ports (Puerto Cabezas, Puerto Isabel and
El Bluff) amounted to 103,000 tons in 1971. Government policy favors develop--
ment of the east coast area and various proposals to induce economic and
demographic growth in the area are being considered. Thesa include a high-
way link to Puerto Cabezas from the Pacific area, an intra-coastal waten:av
from Puerto Cabezas to El Bluff, and improvement of the harbor at El dluf:.
which is now being studied by consultants (Livesey and Henderson).
2.16      Th.e ports of Corinto and Puerto Cabt-zas are operated by CPA;
Puerto Somoza and Puerto Isabel are privately owned; San Juan del Sur and
E1 3luff are Government-owned. A ferry terminal at Potosi on the Gulf of
Fonseca to serve highway traffic to El Salvador will be operated by CPA.
Except for the Corinto project appraised in this report and the El Bluff
study, there are no plans for any major improvements at Nicaraguan ports.
III. PORT CRGANIZATION, INSTALLATIONS AND OPERATIONS
A.   Present Organization
3.01      The port of Corinto is administered by the Autoridad Portuaria de
Corinto (CPA) which was established as an autonomous entity under Decree No.
64 dated January 24, 1956.
3.02      Policy-making is the responsibility of the Board of Dire_tors com-
posed of six members: the Minister of Development and Public Works (Chairman
of the Bo3rd), the Mlinister of Finance, a representative of the National
Chamber of Co:-merce and Industry, a representative of the Agricultural and
Livestock Association, a representative of the shipping industry, and a rep-
resentative of the minority political party. The Board has the authority to
establish ope,-ating budgets and to set and amend taritfs, rates and charges.
The Board is assisted by economic, technical and legal advisors. CPA's perfor-
mance is satisfactory.
3.03      The CPA organization at Corinto is. headed by a Manager appointed by
the Board of Directors. The Manager attends all Board meetings, dealq with
all administrative and operational matters, and is assisted by the Chiefs of
the three main departments: uperations, Administration, and Maintenance;
there is also a small Personnel section. CPA has extensive control over all
operations performed within the port area.



-5-
3.04      In 1968, CPA was made responsible for the management and adminis-
tration of Puerto Cabezas on the Atlanric coast by Government decree. Puerto
Cabezas has a separate Manager and accounts. CPA has recently been given
responsibility for manapement of the ferry port at Potosi, from which a ferry
service to El Salvador is soon to begin operation.
B.   Existing Installations
3.05      Corinto Bay, situated at the mouth of the Realejo estuary, provides
natural eeepwater anchorage and is protected from the ocean by Cardon Island
and the Castanones Peninsula (see Map IBRD No. 10140). The harbor entrance,
known as the Cardon Channel, has a depth limitation of about 24 ft at MLWST,
over two bars.  The tidal range of about 7 ft pe-rits vessels up to 2i ft
draft (about 10,000 to 12,000 dwt) to enter and leave the harbor under favor-
able sea and weaLher conditions.
3.06      Under Bank Loan No. 143-NI, two modern reinforced concrete berths,
having a total length cf 370 m, were built south of the old pier, along with
two transit sheds havin, a total floor area of 11,760 m2 and paved open
storage area of 10,000 m2. In 1972, CPA completed construction from its own
resources of a pier for mechanical loading of boxed -argo, principally bananas
(see Map IBRD No. 10141).
3.C0      The existing facilities also include the old timber-decked pier to
the north of the existing berths, 160 m long and 16 m wide.  rhe project
includes replacement of this pier which !.3 obsolete and structurally unsound.
Further information on existing port fac±lities Is provided in Annex 1.
C.   Operations
3.08      CPA's functions include pilotage, maintenance and upkeep of channel
marking buoys and lights; berthing and unberthing of vessels; conservancy;
the provision of wharves, transit sheds, open storage areas, road and other
shore facilities; provision of tugs, forklift trucks, trailers and light
cargo-handling equipment; regulation of the port; registration of ships; ard
the enforcement of shipping laws.
3.OQ      The Operations Department undertakes cargo-handling both on board
ship and on shore. Cargo-handling is fully palletized; shore operations are
by mechanical cargo-handling equipment. All operations are efficiently run.
D.   Labor
3.10      The pilots, crew, transit shed personnel, forklift operators, and
security and timekeeping staff are employees of CPA.  The stevedori;.g gangs
are employed on a contract basis and provided by the local stevedore unlion.
Employment conditions are as agreed in the contract between the union and
CPA. Relations between CPA and the workers are very good and no labor dis-
putes have been recorded in recent years.



-6-
3.11      There is a two-shift system of working, tctallir-g 87 hours per week.
Overtime, for which additional charges are made, is worked as required. There
is no labor shortage. The Customs Office works seven hours a day, six days
a week. There is no delay of cargo by the Customs; most of the cargo is
cleared on the wharveE.  On tne modern wharf, productivity on general cargo
averages 25 to 30 tons per gang-hour, and about 1,200 tons per year per meter
of berth; these figures are very good.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Description
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to replace an existing timber-decked pier and other
obsolete installatiors in order to meet present and
projected traffic demands up to about 1985;
(b) to provide equipment and deepen the harbor to permit
establishment of container-handling facilities; and
(c) to protect road and rail access threatened by sea
erosion.
4.02      The project consists of:
(a)  construction of a new 240 m berth with 40 ft of water
alongside at MLWST;
(b)  construction of a new administration building, minor
service buildings, service and storage areas and
utilities;
(c) purchase of container-handling equipment;
(d)  harbor and channel d:tdging and navigation aids;
(e) coistal defense works;
(f)  consultant.' services for (a) to (e) above; and
(g) staff training.
A morenr detailed description of the project items is given in Anex 2. The
layout of the 2ronosed por, installation is shown ii 14ap No. ,.0141 and Lhat
of the coastal defense works in M1ap No. 10140.

4.04      The costa are based on estimates prepared by the consultants on the
basis of preliminary engineering and are generally based on recent bids or
actual prices for similar work in Nicaragua adjusted to reflect local differ-
enco.s in construction costs.  For the coas-;1 dvfenscz works, estimates wert,
based on bids received December 4, 1972, noie :4 whic, -Ip7ear to De acceptable.
Container-handling equipment prices and dredging prices are based on recent
international experience. Prices for consultant services are based on actual
contract prices. Contingency allowances include 10% for physical variations
on all civil works. For port works, allowance has been made for a possible
6Z annual price escalation. No price escalation lhas been provided for the
coastal defense works since the contract is to be awarded within two or three
months and will not permit price escalation. However, a special contingency
allowance has been included, since experience has shown that contractors'
evaluations of the risks involved laad to substantially higher bids than ouid
be expected on the basis of engineering estimates. It was agreed during
negotiations that any part of the special contingency not needed to permit
award of the contract vill be cancelled. In addition, a 10% physical
contingency has been included to allow for quantity overruns aad unforeseen
construction difficulties. The estimate includes no customs duties since
supplies and equipment specifically required for the project will be imported
duty-free according to existing laws.
C.   Project Execution
4.05      CPA would be responsible for carrying out the project with the
assistance of the consultants, Frederic R. Harris (USA) - Cisneros & Conrado
(Nicaragua) - Santos & Heilemann (Nicaragua). With respect to constructing
the coastal defense works, CPA will act as agent for the Government (Ministry
of Public Works). CTA with the assistance of the consultants has the capa-
bility to carry out both parts of the project. Upon completion, CPA would
be responsible for maintenance of the port works, the Government for the
coastal defense works; confirmation of this was obtained during negotiations.
D.   Project Financing
4.06      Bank financing would meet the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the project (US$11.0 million). Since the coastal defense works are thie respon-
sibility of the Government while CPA is responsible for the port works,
consideration was given to making separate loans to the Government and to
CPA in order to establish the most direct relationship with each of the
responsible entities. However, in view of the additional administrative
burden on both the Bank and the potential borrowers and the reduction of
flexibility in the use of contingencies and savings wnich two loans would
involve, it is preferable to combine the finrancing of the ooastal defense
and port works in a single (US$11.0 million) loan agreement with CT)A.  The
guarantee agreement between the Bank and the Government provides that the
Government will furnish to CPA the funds repayable to the Bank for the
portion of the loan pertaining to the coastal defense works (estimated at
about US$2.0 million). The local currency cost of the port works in the
project would be financed by CPA and that of the coastal defense works by
the Government. Assurances on the financing of local currency costs were
obtained during negotiations.



-9-
E.   Procurement
4.07      All contracts for civil works and container-handling equipment would
be procured by international competitive bidding in accordance witlh Bank
Guidelines. Althoughi the contract fc;r the coastal defense works is expected
to be awarded about March 1973, there is a Dossibility thait it might be
awarded in January 1973. Bid documents for the civil works part of the port
works would permit bidding either for the entire work or for individual items
such as dredging, wharf, buildings, paving and utilities. It is probable
that local contractors will perform part of the civil works either as direct
contractors for smaller items or as sub-contractors, or in joint-venture on
major contracts. Since no regional suppliers are expected to bid on the
container-handling equipment, provision for Central American Common Market
preference would'not be necessary.
F.   Disbursement
4.08      A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 2; it is
based on the project schedule in Annex 6. Disbursements would cover:
(a) 77% of the total cost of civil works related to the
port works;
(b) 82% of the total cost of civil works related to tne
coastal defenses;
(c)  the actual c.i.f. cost of the container-handling
equipment;
(d) the foreign exchange component of consultants'
services; and
(e)  the actual foreign exchange costs of staff _.zaining.
Tt is recommended that any savings in the Bank-financed project items be
used to finance additional coastal defense works, if any are found to be
necessary by further studies and observations of the erosion-accretion
pattern in the Paso Caballos area; otherwise the unused portion of the loan
would be cancelled.
G.   Retroactive Financing
4.09      Because of the urgent need to protect rail and road access to the
port, the studies, preparation of the plans and bidding documents for the
coastal defense works, as well as the studies to define the requirements for
port works, required the assistance of consultants, with whom a .ontract was
signed in November 1971.  This action was taken after consultatl"n and in
agreement with the Bank. It is recommended that payments made after November
1, 1971 to cover the foreign exchange costs of the consultants' services, and
after January 1, 1973 to cover any expenditures on coastal defense works, be
eligible for retroactive financing. The total amount involved in such fi-
nancing would not exceed US$250,000, assuming loan signing to be the end of
January 1973.

H.   Road Access to the Port
4.10      Although a good highway connects Corinto with Managua, the road
access to the port through Corinto is congested and the largely unpaved
streets are in poor condition. During negotiations, the Government agreed
to provide suitable access to and from the port area.
I.   Ecology
4.11      The proposed project would not adversely affect the ecology of the
Corinto area. On the contrary, the coastal protection works included in
it would help to preserve the environment which is threatened by the sea.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Introduction
5.01      The economic evaluation of the proposed works at Corinto required
a step-by-step approach with respect to both traffic forecasting and cost-
'enefit analysis. As a conventional general cargo port, Corinto will almost
exclusively serve Nicaraguan traffic. The first step in traffic forecasting
was, therefore, to forecast Corinto's traffic as a solely Nicaraguan port.
Since the proposed project also includes establishment of facilities and
deepening the channels for container ships which would make Corinto a poten-
tial regional container port, the next step was to forecasL the volume of
container traffic expected to use Corinto's new facilities, ir-iuding non-
Nicaraguan traffic which would not normally use the port.
5.02      Thie cost-cenefit analysis involved step-by-step increm.ental analyses
as follows: (a) evaluation of the additional conventional facilities on the
basis of the benefits to anticipated Nicaraguan traffic; (b) evaluation of the
proposed container facilities against the anticipated container traffic of
both Nicaraguan and non-Nicaraguan origin; the benefits to Nicaraguan (con-
tainer) traffic considered here would accrue over and above those referred
to in (a); and (c) final evaluation of the project as a whole, except for the
coastal protection works, which are the lowest-cost solution to protecting
access to Coriuto port (see Section D below and Annex 4).
5.k      Tshe various benefits of the project are described in detail in
Section C following. Savings in cargo handling and land transport costs and
additional income generated by the provision of container services to non-
Nicaraguan traffic will benefit the Nicaraguan economy directly. Savings in
ship time will benefit the economy indirectly by avoiding or postponing in-
crtas-r in freight rates.  Furthermore, a portion of the benefits will be
:Pcaptured through the berthage charges on ships to be introduced in 1974
(para 6.12). The coastal defense works are necessary to prevent the loss
of L'ie use of the port facilities whiichi would have to bereplaced elsewhere
t a grCater cost.

B.   Traffic Forecast
Present and Past Traffic
5.04      Due to a slowdown in the Nicaraguan eccnomy caused mainly by failure
of the cotton crop, traffic at the port of Corinto has been under 600,000 tons
in the past three years. However, it is showing sigrs of picking up in 1972,
when total traffic is expected to be 663,000 tons (483,000 tons of general
cargo, 75,000 tons of liquid bulk, 60,000 tons of dry bulk, and 45,000 tons
of bananas). Corinto's principal exports are cotton and its by-products,
coffee and sugar. Imports include wheat, fertilizers and manufactured goods.
Future Cargo Traffic
5.05      CPA's consultants, Frederic R. Harris Engineering Corporation
and its associates, made a traffic forecast to help determine the scope of
the proposed project. This was reviewed and updated by Bank staff. The
revised traffic forecast, shown in detail in Table 3 and summarized below,
indicates that traffic will almost double between 1971 and 1981, i.e., an
annual growth of about 6.5%.
Actual
('000 tons)
Exports                                     1971       1972      1976       1981

Sub-total:  Exports                         292        356       498        524

5.06      The main feature is the .appesrance of bananas as an important
export from 1972 onwards. The increase in future exports is largely in
bananas; on the other hard, the increase in imports will be more broad-based.
A detailed explanation of the traffic forecast is given in Annex 3.

Container Traffic Forecast
5.07      The container trafiic forecast for Corinto was developed as follows:
(a)  Estimate of potentially containerizable traffic from the
volu.e presently using the port, with projections of such
traffic up to 1981.
(b)  Estimate of potentially contaiTnerizable traffic of
neighboring Central American countries (Costa Rica,
Honduras and El Salvador) which would use Corinto's
container facilities in preference to other ports
(Atlantic and Pacific) which might develop container
facilities of their own, on the basis of total transport
costs. These estimates were projected to 1981.
(c) From the above, the volumes likely to be actually con-
tainerized were estimated and are as follows:
('000 tons)
Nicaraguan        Non-Nicaraguan         Total
Container           Container          Container
Year            Traffic             Traffic            Traffic

1977              160                 70                 230
1978              170                 90                 260
1979              180                110                 290
1980              190                130                 320
1981             200                 150                 350
The forecast of non-Nicaraguan container traffic at Corinto given above is
conservative. A detailed explanation of the forecast is given in Annex 3.
C.   Cost-Benefit Analysis
Improvement of Existing Facilities
5.08      The construction of a concrete whazf to replace the old timber-decked
pier and related investments would produce the following benefits: (a) savings
in waicing time for ships using the port; (b) avoidance of cargo diversion to
other ports at additional cost; (c) lower cargo-handling costs; and (d) faster
turnaround for all ships which would otherwice have used the old timber-decked
pier.
(a)  Savings in ship waiting time:  The proposed replacement of
the timber-decked pier by a longer concrete wharf will enable
the port to handle five ships simultaneously, compared with
three to four at present. In 1976, this would result in a
saving of 245 ship-days in time spent waiting for berth,



- 13 -
valued at about US$540,000; by 1981 these savings -'ould
increase to 400 ship-days valued at US$880,000 per year.
Although these benefits would initially accrue to the shipping
companies, Nicaragua will benefit from avoidance or postpone-
mant of freight rate increases which would otherwise have
occurred.  This is true also of benefits dis^ussed in para-
graphs 5.08(d) and 5.10(a) and (c).
(b) Avoidance of cargo diversion: Without the proposed works,
the forecast traffic growth for Corinto would raise berth
occupancy to unacceptable levels by the late 70's and
ensuing delays to ships would result in diversion of
cargo to other ports, such as Puerto Somoza, San Juan del
Sur and El Bluff. Such diversion could involve 20,000
tons of cargo by 1981, rising to 160,000 tons in 1985
and to 400,000 tons in 1990. This could result in
additional costs, in the form of port cargo-handling
costs and/or land transport costs, of US$0.60 to US$4.30
per ton of cargo depending on the origin and destination
of the cargo. The additional annual cost is estimated at
US$40,000 in 1981, rising to US$350,000 in 1985 and to
US$840,000 in 1990. The project will help Nicaragua avoid
these cos L
(c) Savings in cargo-handling costs: The replacement of the
timber-decked pier would reduce cargo-handling costs for that
portion of total traffic which otherwise would have used
this pier, by improving access and operating costs of mobile
cargo-handling equipment and eliminating double handling.
At present, cargo-handling costs at the old pier are estimated
at US$1.95 per ton, compared with US$1.30 per ton at the
adjacent modern deep-water berths. Cargo-handling costs at
the proposed new berth should approximate the latter figure,
resulting in a saving of US$0.65 per ton on about 80,000-
120,000 tons of dry cargo. The savings to Nicaragua would be
about US$55,000 in 1976, rising to US$60,000 in 1981 and
progressively thereafter.
(d) Savings in ship-time at berth: Owing to the faster
cargo-handling rates that would ba possible at the new
berth for ships which would otherwise have used the
timber-decked pier, time at berth loading/discharging cargo
could be reduced by about 40%, resulting in a saving of
30 ship-days annually in 1976, rising to about 35 ship-
days annually by 1981, valued at US$66,00n and US$77,000
respectively.
5.09      Together, the above savings would amount to about US$660,000 in
1976, US$1,060,000 in 1981 and higher thereafter, yielding a first-year
return of 82 and an economic return of 14% over an assumed 30-year useful
economic life for the facilities.



- 14 -
Provision of Container Facilities
5.10      The principal benefits to Nicaragua of providing container-handling
facilities at Corinto, over and above those discussed in paragraph 5.08, would
be: (a) faster turnaround of ships with consequent savings in ship time in
port, primarily time at berth loading/discharging cargo; (b) savings in cargo-
handling costs which contain-rization would bring; (c) elimination of aelays
to ships waiting for high tide, which would arise from dredging the channel
in order to accommodate container ships; and (d) benefits to the Nicaraguan
economy which the handling of non-Nicaraguan container cargo would generate.
The investment needed to produce these benefits would be mainly for container-
handling equipment and deepening of the harbor ai2d access channels.
(a)  Savings in ship time in port:  The rate of cargo-handling
with the proposed container facilities would be approximately
six times that of conventional general cargo. This would
result in savings in ship time loading/discharging cargo
(for containerized cargo) of 150 days in 1976, rising to
200 days in 1981, valued at US$330,000 and USS440,000
respectively.
(b)  Savings in cargo-handling costs:  For Nicaraguan cargo
that would be handled in containers, the cor.sultants
estimate savings of US$1.10 per ton, which would directly
benefit the national economy by about US$165,000 in 1976,
rising to US$220,000 a year by 1981.
(c)  Elimination of delays to ships waiting for high tide:
The chlannel dredging that would be undertaken in -rder to
enable container ships to enter and leave Corintc will also
eliminate delays to general cargo ships on account of
waiting for highi tide. Such delays to ships leaving
Corinto amounted to 15 days in 1971; although very few
such delays to arriving ships were recorded, it can be
expected to amount to another 15 days, making a total of
30 days.  In 1976, such delays are forecast at about
33 days per year valued at about US$75,000, rising
gradually thereafter. The proposed deepening of the
channel would eliminate these delays.
uj)  un non-Nicaraguan cargo that would be handled in containers
and which would not use Corinto without the proposed facil-
ities, the benefits to Nicaragua would be in the form of
net incoma generated within the country through the provision
of the service. The annual direct net income likely to be
generated in the form of wages, salaries, profits, etc. is
estimated at about US>300,600 in 197b, US$350,000 in 1981,
and higher thereafter.



- 15 -
5.11      The above benefirs amount to about US$0.9 million in 197b rising to
US$1.1 million in 1981 and further thereafter. These benefits yield a first-
year return of 13% and an economic return of 19% over an estimated 20-year
useful life for the container-handling facilities.
Conclusion
5.12      A cost-benefit evaluation of the project as a whole yields a first-
year return of 11% and an economic return of 15%.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.13      An analysis to test the sensitivity of the rates of return to
changes in the various parameters was carried out. The results show that,
even if the project costs were to exceed the estimates by 15%, the rates of
return would decline to 1I% and 16,. For a 25. drop in benefits, the recturns
would decline onlv to 11% and 14%, and the project would still be justified.
(See Table 4 for details.)
D.   Justification for Coastal Defense Works
5.14      Coastal defense works in the vicinity of Paso Caballos, four miles
northeast of the Port vf Corinto, are needed to prevent destruction of rail
and road access to the port. Without land access, the port is likely to
cease to be useful resulting in loss of port facilit:es involving an invest-
ment of several million dollars, which may have to be replaced by constructing
another deep-water port on the mainland at an even greater cost. Since access
will be lost if prompt corrective measures are not taken, three ..'ternative
schemes of maintaining access were considered:
(a) Relocate the highway so that it crosses from the isla-nd
to the mainland outside the area of active erosion
and either abandon or similarly relocate the railroad.
(b) Construct coastal defense works to protect the highway
in its present location, either abandoning the railroad
or relocating it to the general alignment of the highway.
Cc) Construct coastal defer.ses along the present shoreline,
maintaining both road and rail access.
5.15      Preliminary cost estimates indicate that alternative (c), at an
estimated capital cost of USS1.75 million, would be less expensive than
either alternative (a) or (b), estimated to cost US$2.38 million and US$2.54
million respectively. If the rail line were also to be relocated under
the latter two alternatives, their cost would be even higher and alternative
(c) even more attractive. Further details are given in Annex 4.

VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      This chapter deals with the financial position and results of
Corir.to and Puerto Gabezas only.  Operations at Potosi have not yet started
and in any case are so small that they are not expected to have a significant
effect on CPA's overall financial situation.  In the past Live years, CPA has
had satisfactory earnings and has maintained a btrong financial position.
rhe adoption of an explicit financial and tariff policy was agreed with CPA
during negotiations. CPA is not expected to have problems in rpmaining fi-
nancially viable in the future.
B.   Accounts, Audit, Budgets and Insurance
6.02      The accounting system was designed by an interrationally-known
accounting firm which also audits the Authority's accounts. Existing audit
arrarqements are satisfactory. The accounts and statistics are computerized
and well produced. CPA proposes to rent a more advanced tape model computer
to enable a full cost accounting system to be introduced together with ex-
tension of management information and personnel records. It is proposed that
any surplus capacity of the rented computer will be taken up by the Customs
Department. The accounts and statistics for Puerto Cabezas are also preparea
at Corinto, and are consolidated with those of Corinto Port. It was agreed
during negotiations that CPA will continue to -roduce consolidated financial
statements, including Potosi, once it becomes operational, with supporting
accounts for eazh port.
6.03      The annual budget is prepared in considerable detail and control
is exercised through monthly cash budgets; daily cash budgets are also being
prepared at present. The introduction of cost accounting and full budgetary
contro] should not be difficult as the accounting system includes provision
for expansion into tlese fieldu. The CPA's Board of Directors is authorized
to approve or amend annual operating expenditure budgets, but the further
approval of the President of the Republic is required for improvement or de-
velopment projects and the raising of loans.
6.04      CPA carries adequate insurance against fire, theft and other risks
and assurances were obtained during negotiations that adequate insurance would
be maintained in the future.
C.   Past Earnings
6.05      Details of operating revenues and expenditures from 1969 to 1971
are shown in Table 5. Results for 1971 are summarized as follows:

o.06      Recently there has been a slight decline in tonnages which has re-
sulted in falling receipts.  Costs have been controlled mainLy because the
largest item of personnel expenses, stevedoring, has been contained; governed
by two-year labor contracts, payments are based on tonnage handled. Payment
for outside services has shown a considerable rise. The operating ratio, 83%
in 1971, is still satisfactory. Cash generated from operations, although
declining, has provided ample sums for the relatively low debt service require-
ments and the reducing net operating revenue has resulted in a more reasonable
rate of return on average net fixed assets in service.
6.07      In the past, CPA has maintained the navigational aids at Corinto
for which the Customs Department has levied dues. During negotiations, the
Guverament confirmed that, effective January 1, 1973, CPA will collect and
retain such dues on ships calling at Corinto. This is satisfactory.
D.   Present Financial Position
6.08      Comparative halance sheets for 1969 to 1971 are shown in Table 7.
As at the end of 1971, CPA had net fixed assets of 37.6 million Cordobas
(US$5.4 million) and substantial investments of 13.1 million Cordobas
(US$1.9 million). The fixed assets are valued at cost, and are depreciated
on a straight line basis over acceptable life spans. The fixed assets should
be revalued to reflect replacement cost and it was agreed during negotiations
that this would be done by January 1, 1974. Investments at the end of 1971
(13.1 million Cordobas, or 23% of total assets, which have been invested in
deposits earning 6 to 8% per annum in a public savings agency and a local
Development Bank) are well above the normal accumulation of funds for ports
where large capital expenditures are required at intervals. However, an
estimated 7.3 million Cordobas of the funds will be used in 1972-1976 for
CPA's capital expenditures, including the project.



-18-
6.09      CPA's capitalization is mostly equity, with a debt-equity ratio
at the end of 1971 of 13:87. The outstanding long-term debt is the balance
of IBRD loan 143-NI, which will ba entirely repaid when repayment of the
proposed loan begins, and a small debt on t'e books of Puerto Cabezas to
Instituto de Fomento Nacional. Working capital has been maintained at an
adequate level with reasonable cash balances.  The current ratio was 3.5:1
at the end of 1971.
E.   CPA's Financial and Tariff Policy
6.10      CPA's strong financial position has been built up over the past
five years by sound financial management; it has not had to pay any income
tax and has not distributed surpluses. Article 26 of the law creating CPA
requires final profits to "form part of the general revenue of the State"
but this "shall not ... be applicable while substantial loans remain out-
standing". IBRD loan 143-NI has provided the legal basis for retention of
surpluses. Article 33 of the law makes CPA liable to income tax; however,
CPA accounts showed no income tax liability at the end of 1971 and the 1971
audit certificate was qualified, the auditors estimating a potential CPA
income tax liability of 4.4 million Cordobas. However, this liability has
apparently been offset by capital expenditures in 1972 which can be carried
back against the taxable income of the precediag year.  Oa O.i  iry h, 17(3,
the Minister of Finance wrote to the Bank that CPA did not have ar., tax
liability as of th't date.  Pecause of its investment orogram, r'A is not
expected to have tc pay income taxes until about 19Q0.
6.11      As any public undertaking managed and operated on commercial lines
to provide services to users at the least cost, CPA's objectives should be
to: (a) operate its facilities efficiently and exercise adequate control
over costs in order to minimize charges on users; and (b) earn an adequate
return on its assets in order to be able to meet its financial obligations,
including payment of income taxes to the Government. During the construction
period of the proposed project, CPA will need all the. cash it generates
internally to finance the local currency costs. T'ereafter, in 1977 and 1978
it expects to make other investments (para 6.17) which will absorb much of
its internally generated funds. It will be sub4ect to income taxes commencing
in about 1980, unless it embarks upon another expansion program. Agreement
on the following financial and tariff policy for CPA was reached during
negotiations: rates and charges shall be related to costs at each port and
set at such a level as to generate revenues sufficient to (a) cover operating
expenses (excluding depreciation but including adequate maintenance); (b)
meet debt service requirements; (c) finance a reasonable portion of capital
expenditures; and (d) pay taxes, including income taxes, to the Government.
6.12      A table of present rates and charges is shown in Annex 5.  The
Corinto tariff was last revised in September 1968, and rates at that time
were considered high in comparison to those of other ports in the region.
There are no charges against ships for berthage, all costs being recovered
from cargo for which there are two main categories of ctarges, i.e., wharf-
asge and stevedoring. Rates for stevedoring make some contribution to fixed



- 19 -
costs but do not cover filly distributed costs: accounting losses on steve-
doring are made up bN profits on wharfage. Overall, exports are more pro-
fitable than imports. The charges for tugs and pilJLage do not recover
long-run variable costs and should be increased to a level where, as a mini-
mum, a contribution is made to fixed costs. A charge against ships should
also be introduced for berthage. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that by January 1, 1974 the tariff structure would be revised along the above
lines so that rates and charges will be reasonably related to costs. The
proposed timing for the tariff revision would enable CPA to use the results
of a study of rates and costs to be undertaker shortly in conjinction with
A.ajutla Port, El Salvador, w,.th the assistance of a former chairman of the
port of Houston, U.S.A.
F.   Financing Plan and Future Cash Flow
6.13      A detailed cash flow forecast up to 1979 is shown in Table 6.
During the disbursement period of the proposed loan (1972-76), funds re-
quired, and the sources of such funds, may be summarized as follows:

6.14      The proposed project, including coastal protection, accounts for
the bulk (81%) of the funds required. Other capital expenditures include
normal annual expenditures (0.7 million Cordobas a year) for small additions
and replacements, an estimated 9.55 million Cordobas spent in 1972 for the
new banana loading wharf and associated preparatory wo-'  necessary co use
the wharf for other commodities also, and 10.0 million Cordobas in 1976 for
bulk-handling equipment, the acquisition of which is now being studied.
6.15      CPA should be able to finance with its own funds about 34% of the
total capital expenditures. Should there be a shortfall in the gross internal
cash generation, CPA's contribution could, to some extent, be maintained by
converting more investments into cash.
6.16      The financial forecasts are based on the assumption that the
proposed Bank loan would bear interest at 7-1/4% p.a. and would be for a
term of 24 years including four years of grace. The loan would be made to
CPA; the Government will provide the local currency cost of the coastal
protection works and will service that portion of the loan made for these
works. The financing plan for the project is satisfactory.
6.17      Beyond 1976, annual capital expenditures will be limited to small
amounts (0.7 million Cordobas per year) for miscellaneous additicns and
replacement of equipment. Provision has also been made for the construction
of a small breakwater (costing an esrimated 5 million Cordobas) to reduce
maintenance dredging, the purchase of additional container-handling equipment
(1.8 million Cordobas) and a pilot boat (0.5 million Cordobas) in 1978. CPA
should be able to finance those limited requirements without additional
borrowings.
G.   Future Earnings
6.18      A forecast of revenues and expenditures up to 1979 is shown in
Table 5, and is summarized below for some selected years:
1973           1976           1979
(Cordobas million)
Operating revenues                   33.0           42.7           48.7
Operating expenses                   25.9           37.1           40.6
Net Operating revenue                 7.1            5.6            8.1
Net income                            7.0            1.4            4.7
Operating ratio                      78%            87°            83%
Rate of return                       16%             5%             7%
Times debt service covered            4.7            1.8            2.6



-. 21 -
6.19      The forecast of operating revenues is based on the traffic fore-
cast discussed in Cha er V, taking into account the changes in the tariff
recommended in paragraph 6.12. Forecast of operating expenditures does not
include an allowance for increases in prices on the assumption that any future
inflationary increases in costs will be compensated by increases in rates and
charges. Productivity improvements arising from the project have been taken
into account. Starting in 1975, a provision is made each year towards the
cost of maintenance dredging to be carried out once every three years.
6.20      The financial forecast indicates that CPA should be able to main-
tain a satisfactory level of earning3. During the construction period of
the prcject, the achievement of a level of internal cash generation of the
magnitude assumed in .he projections is essential to enable CPA to meet
the local currency costs of the project; thereafter, a return of about 7%
would be sufficient to enable CPA to comply with the financial policy spelled
out in paragraph 6.11. It was agreed during negotiations that CPA will not
reduce the overall level of its rates and charges during the construction period
of the project without the prior approval of the Bank and that CPA will earn
a return of at least 7% on the value of net fixed assets in operation except
in 1976, 1977 and 1978 when a return of 5% wi.l be achieved.
i.   Future Financial Position
6.21      Forecast balance sheets of CPA are shown in Table 7.  CPA should
be able to maintain a strong financial position, and in particular the
maintenance of working capital and cash balances at adequate levels should
not present any problems. CPA would have scope for additional borrowings
if required. However, to ensure that in the future, CPA will limit its
borrowing to reasonable amounts on reasonable terms, it was agreed during
negotiations Lhat CPA will not, without the prior approval of the Bank,
incur any long-term debt unless its net cash revenue is at least 1-3/4 tines
its maximum future debt service requirements.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACliED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agree,nent was reached on the following:
(a)  with the Government and CPA:
(i)  provision of local currency costs (para 4.06);
(ii) financial and tariff policy for CPA (para 6.11);
(iii) rate covenant (para 6.20);
(iv) debt limitation covenant (para 6.21); and
(v)  maintenance arrangements (para 4.05).



- 22 -
(b) with the Government:
(i) improvement of road access to the port (para 4.10); and
(ii) CPA to collect and retain dues for navigational aids at
Corinto (para 6.07).
(c) with CPA:
(i)  preparation of consolidated financial sLatemeats for
CPA (para 6.02);
(ii) revaluation of fixed assets (para 6.08); and
(iii) revision of tariff structure (para 6.12).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$11.0 million
to CPA for a term of 24 years including four years of grace. The Government
will service that part of the loan made for the coastal defense works.
7.03      Retroactive financing of approximately US$250,000 is recommended
for expenditures for consulting services and coastal defense works (para
41.09).

Existing Port Facilities
1.   Channels and Basin
The Port of Corinto is located on the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua
at thle mouth of a tidal inlet protected bh  a rocky offshore island.  The
aprroaci' chainnel has been stable without dredging to a derth of approximately
24 ft at 1."ST oprmittitnf access to ships withi 20 ft draft at low tide and
27 ft at highi tide.  Within the harbor, the natural depth generally exceeds
3C ft ov r an area sufficient for maneuvering and anchorage.
2.   Wharves
(a)  A timhlr-declzed pier constructed earlv ir this century provides
1A(! m of berth vith an alongside depth of abotut 23 ft at VTWUST.  The pier,
althou!'h used regularl-, is in an advanced stage of decay; its narroct widtl
(12 r-) and uneven surface inhibit efficient cargo-handling orerations.  The
project includes renlacercnt of this structure.
(b)  A modern wfharf 370 m long provides two berths with alon-side
water dertbs of 33 ft at '-L1'ST. Rail service at shipside is available.
(c) A banana loading pier corpleted in August, 1072, consists
of hreastin5- and me^rih, dolphins and conveyor system for 1bading boxes
of bananas at a design maxirmum rate of 16,000 boxes (4nC tons) per hour.
It can also he used for loading other boxed or barged cargo.
3.   Transit Sheds and Open Storage Areas
There are two transit sheds, 117 by 50 m along the modern wharf.
Open storage area amounts to 10,000 sq m.
4.   Car'o-Hardling Equipment
Fork lift trucl;s owned by CPA are used to handle almost all export
cargo and mu:chi of the import. Loose bulk cargo is unloaded f::om ships' holds
by consignees' equipment including clam shell grabs, hoppers and vacuators
directly-to consignees' vehicles or rail cars. On the old pier are liquid
cargo pipelines connected to storage tanks outside the port area.

5.   Floating Equipment
CPA owns and operates one 1,090 HP tug and one pilot boat.
6.   Land Access
Good highways connect Corinto with the major regions of population
and production around Managua and Leon. Rail service to these areas is also
available alt:iough obsolescence and poor condition of equipment and track
reduce its effectiveness. About 80,000 of the 500,000 tons of cargo moving
through the port anrually are handled by the railroad. Road access through
the streets of Corinti suffers from congestion and the generally poor condi-
tion of the largely ungaved streets. Both road and rail access front the
city and the port to the hinterland proceed northwest along the length of
Corinto Island to Paso Caballos wherc they cross to the mainland. Progressive
erosion of the ocean shore in the Paso Caballos area threatens immediate
destruction of the railway. Once the railway is breached the highway will
be in similar danger.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND CORINTO POPT PROJECT
Corinto Traffic Forecasts
A.   Exports
Exports overall are expected to grow about 6% a year between 1971
and 1981, mainly in bananas which just began to be exported in 1972. The
principal commodities are discussed briefly below:
1.   Molasses:  A bv-product of sugar refining, molasses is used
as animal feed as well as a raw material in the production of industrial
chemicals. The export forecast is based on anticiDated sugar production and
allows for anticipated Nicaraguan and regional requirements.
2.   Bananas:  The forecast is based on known plans of the Standard
Fruit Company which expects to have 10,000 ha planted by 1975, producing
over 200,000 tons of bananas annually, nearly all for export. Exports will
go primarily to the Western U.S.; some exports to Japan are also anticipated.
3.   Cotton:  Anticipated cotton exports in 1972 showed a remarkable
recoverv from the very lou level of 1970, which was caused bv poor domestic
agricultural practices. Future exports are expected to show only a modest
gain, reflecting the slow growth in world demand.
4.   Cotton Linters:  A by-product of cotton ginning, linters
exports will move in step with cctton exports.
5.   Cotton Seed, Oil and Case.:  Cotton seed exports have ceased
with the establishment of adequate oi  pressing facilities in Nicaragua.
Oil exports are also expected to cease by 1975 since domestic demand will
absorb production. However, some oilcake will continue to be exported to
the extent supply is in excess of domestic and regional requirements.
6.   Sesame Seed:  A small quantitv of sesame seed exports to the
11.S. is expected to continue.
7.   Coffee:  Coffee exports are expected to grow modestly up to
1975, when, with the expected improvement in port facilities on the east
coast, some decline in Corinto's share is projected.
8.   Sugar:  Virtually all of Nicaragua's sugar exports Lo to the
U.S. under a special trade arrangement. Total sugar exports from Nizaragua are
forecast to grow at 3% p.a. comnared with the U.S. population growth of about
2% p.a.  Because of the high level of exports in 1971, forecasts are based
on the "normal" exports of 1969. Therefore, a decline up to 1975, followed
by a steady increase, is expected.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
9.   Meat:  A 50% increase in frozen meat exports between 1971 and
1975 is forecast in view of the expansion of private cold storage capacity
which is taking place to eliminate the constraint on exports.
10.   Lumber:  Lumber exports using Corinto originate in northern
Nicaragua which is in the natural service area of San Lorenzo port in Honduras.
The additional land transport cost to Corinto makes this an economically
unstable situation and lumber exports are expected to use San Lorenzo
increasingly; by 1975 such exports through Corinto are assumed to cease
altogether.
11.   Other General Cargo:  A small, steady growth is forecast.
B.   Imports
Imports are projected to grow about 7% p.a. The principal commodi-
ties are discussed below:
1.   Petroleum Prod'icts and Solvents:  Includes -viation gasoline
and asphalt which are not produced at the refinery in Managua, Nicaragua.
Imports of aviation gasoline are forecast to rise about 12% p.a. and of asphalt
at about 9% p.a. Future imports of chemical solvents are dependent mainly on
their requirements in the use of fertilizers and insecticides, and the
forecast is based on this.
2.   Wheat:  NicaraFua's entire requirements of wheat will continue
o be imported through Corinto to feed the flour mills in Chinandega and
Granada. Based on observed relationships between growth of per capita income
and wheat consumption, as well as population growth, wheat imports are
projected to grow about 7% p.a.; the forecasts are also based on discussions
with the millers.
3.   Fertilizers and Insecticides:  Imports were projected to
reflect the requirements of major commercial crops, such as bananas, cotton,
sugarcane and ccffee. A portion of the fertilizers would be imported in
bulk for the production of mixed fertilizers, while the rest would be
imported in packaged form.
4.   Motor Vehicles:  Compared with a past long-term growth of 10%
p.a. iu t.ocor vehicle registrations, imports into Nicaragua have been
proiected to grow about 8% p.a., in view of the economic slowdown in the
last few years. Imports through Corinto are expected to grow more slowly
since Puerto Somoza is attracting a substantial portion of automobile imports,
and improvements in port facilities on the east coast could cause some
d1vcrqion of car imports from the U.S. away from Corinto.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
5.   Machinery and Equipment:  Growth in imports of about 8B  p.a.
up to 1975 and about 32 p.s. thereafter is projected.
6.   Other Iron and Sreel Products:  Imports are projected on the
basis of anticipated construction industry requirements.
7.   Other General Cargo:  A modest growth of 2% p.a. is projected
in this category which includes consumer goods.
C.   Container Traffic
1.        The container traffic forecast for Corinto was developed on the
basis of prior studies and discussions with shippers and shipping lines,
including SEALAND, which plans to establish container service to Corlnto if
container-handling facilities are provided.
(a)  Estimates of potentiallv containerizable cargo for 1969 were
prepared for each Central American country.
(b)  Projections were then made of potentially contaix.crizable
exports and imports.
(c)  Based on transport and port cargo-handling costs, the
proportion of potentially containerizable cargo which
would use Corinto was then estirmated, assuming the
possibility of other container facilities on the Pacific
Coast (in El Salvador) as well as on the Atlantic coast.
(d) From the above, the actual volume likely to be containerized
was estimated.
2.        A review of the traffic handled at the Central American ports (by
country) indicates that in 1969, out of a total traffic of about 7.60
million tons, some 1.37 million tons were containerizable. Containerizable
traffic is forecast at 1.77 million tons in 1975 and 2.19 million tons in
1980, as follows:
(I?illion tons)
1969   1975   1980
Nicaragua                   0.23   0.33   0.40
Costa Rica                  0.28   0.37   0.49
Honduras                    0.24   0.33   0.43
El Salvador                 0.27   0.32   0.37
Guatemala                   0.35   0.42   0.50
Total                       1.37   1.77   2.19

3.        Of the above, it is assumed that only a portion of the containcrizi-
ble traffic would in fact be containerized initially and that this proportion
would gradually increase, having regard to the desirabilitv of a reasonably
balanced use of containers in the export and import trades; also it would
take soue time before the use of containers becomes widely accepted. Almost
all of Nicaragua's container traffic, and a portion of the traffic of Costa
Rica (about 15%) and Honduras (about 40%) could be expected to use container
handling facilities at Corinto because of savings in total cargo-handling
costs, including ocean shipping aad land transport costs. If no other
container facilities on the Pacific Coast of Central America are established,
a major portion of El Salvador's traffic would also use Corinto's container
facilities. This, however, has not been taken into account in the evaluation
cf the proposed investment, although the single berth provided would have
more than enough capacity to handle the additional traffic.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND CORINTO PORT PROJECT
Coastal Defense Works
General
1.        Coastal defense works in the vicinity of Paso Caballos are needed
to prevent destruction of rail and road access to the Port of Corinto.
Benefits from prevention of loss of access and consequent loss of the use-
fulness of the port and of the town, which depends on the port for its
existence, obviously justify an investment of several millions of dollars,
far exceeding the cost of maintaining access. Thus, the works are justified
if it can be shown that:
(a) Access will be lost if prompt corrective measures are not taken.
(b) The proposed works constitute the least costly means of
preserving access.
The Problem
2.        The town and port of Corfnto are situated at the southeast end of
Corinto Island (Map 10140). Within the town and along the ocean side, the
island is essentially a sand bank with elevations a few m above high water.
The remainder of the island along Estero Paso Caballos is a low lying tidal
mangrove. In the past the sand part of the island was considerably wider
than at present, especially in the vicinity of Paso Caballos where in 1884
the shore was over 500 m southwest of the 1972 shoreline. Gradual erosion
by action of the ocean has now reduced the width of the rhreatened section
to a few m. Just north of the railroad bridge joining the island and the
mainland the sea has actually broken through and cut a gap 300 m wide in the
island,
3.        The railway, which originally ran well to the southwest of its
present alignment, has been relocated several times to avoid the advancing
sea. At present active erosion of the railway embankment is taking place
despite emergency measures to keep the line open. Waves break over the
temporary protection, either washing out sections of the track or burying it
with sand. Itaintenance and repair efforts, although continuous and expensive
(US$20,000 per month), will not be sufficient to prevent a major breakthrough
and loss of a section of the rail line.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        In the event of washout south of the railway bridge (as occurred
north of the bridge) the mangrove area between the railroad and the highway
would be open to immediate attack from the ocean waves. The area is so low
that it would offer little resistance to wave action and erosion of the high-
way embankment could be expected to begin soon after the breach of the rail
line.
Alternatives
5.        Three alternative schemes to protect access to the port were
considered:
(a) Relocate the highway so that it crosses from the island to the
mainland outside (southeast) of the area of active erosion
and either abandon or similarly relocate the railroad.
(b) Construct coastal defense works to protect the highway in its
present location, either abandoning the railroad or relocating
it to the general alignment of the highway.
(c) Construct coastal defenses along the present shioreline.
6.        The -ailroad, a section of Ferrocarril del Pacifico de Nicaragua,
is of considerably less importance to the port than the highiway which carries
four times the tonnage of the rail line. The entire rail system operates at
a financial loss, is generally in a poor state of maintenance ond .my not
represenc an economically viable operation. A study of the desirability of
abandoning the rail connection to Corinto has not been made and it is not
known whether the railroad should be relocated in the event alternative (a)
or (b) were to be adopted.  Since the cost of either of these alternatives
withiout relocation of the railroad is greater than alternative (c) (as shown
below), the question of the need for continuation of operation of the rail-
road need not be answered.
7.        After consultation and agreement with the Bank, the Government
proposed to proceed with the construction of the coastal defenses as soon as
practicable and to finance them from the loan retroactively. In response to
international bidding procedures, three bids were received, on December 4,
1972, from two firms (one firm bid on two alternate means of carrying out
the works). The only technically acceptable bid was for US$2.62 million, but
the other two bids, although probably not acceptable technically, indicate
that it is probable that the works could be carried out by a contract at
about US$1.75 million. However, experience on this tendering as well as for
coastal defenses elsewhere has indicated that contractors include a large
r.lowance against difficulties likely to arise during construction.
ince the amount of such a risk allowance is based largely on the judgment
of the individual bidder, it is impossible to estimate accurately.
;S.       Estimated costs of the three alternatives are as follows:



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(a) Relocate highway out of threatened area:
Highway on good soil, 2.5 km           S  500,000
Highway in swamp area, 1.5 km             600,000
Highway bridge, 200 m                     800,000
Interim Maintenance of present
shoreline                            480,000
2,380,000 1/
(b)  Coastal defense along present highway alignment:
Coastal defense, 1,800 m               $2,060,000
Interim maintenance of present
shoreline                            480,000
2,540,000
(c) Coastal defense of present shoreline:
Coastal defense, 1,600 m                 1,750,000
9.        Future expenditures will be required to maintain and probably to
extend the coastal defense works included in any of the alternatives. Recur-
ring maintenance costs for all three would be about the same. The extent of
additional works which may be required is difficult to predict, but -._uld
probably be no greater for alternative (c) than for either (a) or (b).
10.       Construction of coastal defenses alcng the present shoreline is not
only the least costly alternative, but it also has the following advantages:
(a) It preserves the greatest amount of firm land. -
(b) It protects an ecologically valuable mangrove area
from destruction.
(c) It is the least disruptive to the overall erosion-accretion
regime in the area and hence the least 'Likely to produce
radical changes in the overall pattern of beach lines and
channels.
1/   In the absence of coastal defense works, progressive erosion of Corinto
Island will probably make major coastal protection necessary in any
event. Relocation of the highway would merely postpone such work for
a period which cannot be accurately predicted.
