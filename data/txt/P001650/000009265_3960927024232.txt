MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL MARESTING AND ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Malawi for SDR14.2 million (US$18.3 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval.. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and would help finance an agricultural marketing and estate development
project.
2.       Background.   Malawi is heavily dependent on agriculture which supports
about 85? of the population of over 7.5 million people, and in 1986 accounted
for 37? of total GDP and 912 of all exports. Smallholders cultivating customary
lands produce 80? of all agricultural output, mainly maize, groundnuts and
cassava for domestic copsumption. The estates cultivating freehold or leasehold
lands produce tobacco, tea and sugar, largely for the export market. After two
decades of impressive growth, agricultural production stagnated in the 1980s in
both smallholder and estate sectors. Growth in smallholder output slowed due to
increasing land pressures, poor price incentives and marketing inefficiencies in
ADMARC, the Government's market parastatal. Also, existing techniques and farm
services have been unable to sustain the productivity gains needed to keep pace
with population growth and increased land scarcity. As a result, rural incomes
have declined, many farm households are in food deficit, and malnutrition is
pervasive. Growth in estate output, especially in smaller estates, is also
disappointing due mainly to poor land utilization and a lack of credit and
extension services.
3.       In the medium to long-term, Government's objectives are to: ti) raise
nutritional levels, improve income distribution and ensure national food self-
sufficiency through increased smallholder production of food crops; (ii) improve
the balance of payments and lessen Malawi's heavy dependence on tobacco through
the expansion and diversification of agricultural exports.; and (iii) improve
efficiency of resource use by strengthening the role of the private sector in
marketing domestic and export crops and improving the viability of ADMARC. For
the first objective, Government is focussing research priorities on developing
acceptable improved maize varieties. Until these packages are ready, Government
is continuing efforts to raise productivity of existing varieties through
adequate price incentives and expanded access to credit and fertilizer,
particularly for those in food deficit. To meet the second objective,
Government will strengthen estate performance through better land policies, the
establishment of estate extension services and increased credit availability.
For the third objective, Government will continue development of a multi-channel
marketing system and review ADMARC's role in price stabilization and other
development functions; as part of its Structural Adjustment Program the
Government is encouraging greater private sector participation in the marketing
of smallholder produce. The private sector responded enthusiastically to the
liberalization of smallholder marketing.
4.       The Bank supports the Government's agricultural strategy through its
existing and planned operations. Other donors, as well, lend strong support.
The USAID, EEC, FRG, ODA, AfDB, and IFAD provide significant support to the
National Rural Development Program (NRDP) and national level institutions and
services. In addition, the UK, USAID, FRG, the Netherlands and Japan provide
co-financing for the Government's Structural Adjustment Program. In-the past,



the Bank and other donors focused on the NRDP which has been the main Gover.ument
channel for developing smallholder agriculture. Projects under NRDP are arsa
oriented and though they provide smallholders with extension, research,
marketing, inputs and credit services, these projects reach only a small number
of farmers due to shortcomings in the provision of these services. Recently
there hat been a change in the emphasis away from area development projects
under the NRDP program to nationally oriented projects. These include projects
in extension. research, credit, and now marketing and estate development and are
designed to meet a larger number of farmers and provide better planning,
coordination, monitoring and funding of these services. Also, an in-depth
review of the ongoing area oriented projects under NRDP is now being conducted
and will provide recommendations for making'these projects more effect4ve. The
present project, along with the proposed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit,
would.build on earlier initiatives launched under SAL III in support of improved
efficiency and increased private sector participation in agricultural marketing.
It also continues the Bank's efforts under the Industrial and Agricultural
Credit Project to promote estate development.
5.       Proisect Obiectives.  The proposed project is designed to improve the
marketing of smallbolder crops by supporting the Government's efforts to develop
a multi-channel marketing system through encouraging increased private sector
participation in agricultural trade. During the first year of the
liberalization program, 3 major constraint were observed: (i) lack of adequate
financing; (ii) lack of marketing infrastructure and institutional support;
(iii) lack of an appropriate regulatory environment, including adequate
inspection of agricultural exports. The project aims to strengthen Government
market support and policy analysis and to improve efficiency in agricultural
marketing by removing impediments to increased participation by private traders.
It would develop mechanisms for financing private marketing and processing of
smallholder crops. Another objective of the project is to improve resource
utilization and productivity in the estate sub-sector by providing support for
sub-projects aimad at intensifying and expanding estate production and, where
possible, diversifying the export base. The project would be complemented by
Government plans to establish an estate extension service, which is expected to
begin operations in 1989.
6.       Proiect Description.  The Project would be Implemented over a seven-
year period and would include: (a) funds to be channeled through the commercial
banks, INDEBANK, and the Small Enterprise Development Organization of Malawi
(SEDOM) in support of estate development and agroprocessing and marketing
subprojects, including a pilot credit for rural traders; (b) support to the
Government, including technical assistance, training, and equipment to improve
its market information, quality control and regulatory systems; and (c)
financing for improvement of rural marketing infrastructure and training for
private traders.   The support for estate development would follow the US$4.5
million IBRD loan under the Industrial and Agricultural Credit Project which
will soon be fully utilized. Unlike that facility, whose proceeds went almost
entirely to large estates, this component would be targeted to smaller estates
that now have limited access to credit. Funds would be provided for expanded
cultivation, irrigation, improved infrastructure, and farm machinery. The
credit for agroprocessing and marketing would support processing, storage, and
transport. The pilot credit for rural traders would also provide working
capital in addition to funds for small-scale storage, transport, and processing
subprojects in rural areas. SEDOM, a Government trust with funding and
technical assistance from KFW and EEC, will handle the pilot because of its
expertise in assisting small enterprises.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's involvement in the project is
required to strengthen the process of policy reform begun under the Government's
Structural Adjustment Program. The proposed project deepens the market reform



- 3 -
effort initiated under SAL III by :.urther developing Government's capacity to
support and monitor private sector participation in agricultural marketing. IDA's
support is also required to help the existing rural credit system expand lending to
the estates and to develop mechanisms for lending to market enterprises. Finally
IDA involvement in the project is an important element of the coordinated program
of donor assistance in support of the Government's strategy for agriculture.
8.       Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, agreement was reached that: (a) two
Coordinating Committees to oversee the marketing component and the estates and
agro-industries component would be established as a condition of credit
effectiveness; (b) four existing vacancies of the Planning Departmsent of MOA would
be filled by March 31, 1989; (c) the Halawi Bureau of Standards would assume tull
responsibility for agricultural export quality control by October 31, 1989;
(d) MOA would undertake an analysis of the impact of its market reform measures,
including the effects of existing regulations. The results of this analysis would
be reviewed with IDA and agreed changes in the regulations would be implemented by
March 31, 1990; (e) any subsequent proposals to change market regulations would be
reviewed and agreed with IDA prior to their implementation; and (f) at least 502 of
the credit proceeds earmarked for estate development would be targeted to small
estates (less than US$200,000 in annual turnover). The credit lines would operate
as followss the loans to participating banks would be in Kwacha and would have a
duration similar to the sub-loans being financed. Interest rates have been
recently deregulated and are now market determined. Sub-loans would carry market
interest rates, which are currently 162. The spreads between the sub-loan interest
rates and the rates at which the participating Banks would borrow project funds
from tae Government would be maintained at 52 for larger estates and agroprocessors
and 7Z for smaller estates. SEDOM would borrow from Government at 3.0X, which is
consistent with costs of operating the pilot scheme. Annual reviews of on-lending
rates to the banks and final borrowers would be conducted to ensure consistency
with the overall interest rate structure.  Each bank would be required to sign a
subsidiary loan agreement with the Government as a condition of disbursement to
that bank.
9.       Justification and Risk.  The Project would contribute to increased
production, higher export earnings, and improved rural incomes through efficiency
gains in agricultural marketing and increased estate productivity. The potential
risks include the ability of Government to implement its market reform program
effectively. So far the Government has demonstrated firm resolve in impflementing
market reform measures but it is concerned about the impact of the program,
particularly on vulnerable groups. The institutional component addresses this
concern by improving Government's capacity to monitor market developments, and
implement appropriate measures. Another risk for the marketing support element of
the project is the ability of participating banks to identify and finance viable
subprojects, especially for raral traders. This risk has been covered by including
a pilot component to test subprojects aimed at rural traders. -he technical
assistance to the Government will help to guide the implementation and design of
the pilot. For the estates, a potential uncertainty is future price levels for
estate exports. Bank forecasts show prices for Malawi's export crop as holding
steady in the medium term. Also the subprojects financed by the credit are
expected to make the estates more productive and better able to withstand price
declines.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
