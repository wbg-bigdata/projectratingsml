MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A BWDB SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to the People's
Republic of Bangladesh for SDR40.8 million (US$53.9 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with a maturity of 40 years, and help finance a Bangladesh Water Development
Board (BWDB) systems rehabilitation project. Parallel grant financing for the
project would be provided by the Government of the Netherlands for improved
operation and maintenance (O&M) and technical assistance (US$12.6 million
equivalent) and by the European Economic Community (EEC) for rehabilitation
and improvement works, improved O&M, technical assistance, and training
(US$14.9 million equivalent).
2.       Background.  With a per capita income of US$170, Bangladesh remains
one of the poorest countries of the world and over 70X of its population of
110 million continues to live in conditions of absolute poverty. Agriculture
accounts .or about one half of GDP and about 60Z if employment and exports.
Developing a capability for self-sufficiency in food grains has been the
central objective of the Government's strategy for agricultural development
since the country gained its independence in 1971. However, production of
food grains still falls 10%-1SZ short of requirements and imports vary between
one and two million m ton in most years. Particularly during the last three
years (FY87-89), growth of agriculture value added has been disappointing,
i.e. about 1.7X compared with about 32 during FY81-86. One reason for the
decline was the major floods of 1987 and 1988 which caused extensive damage.
Other reasons include a reduction in the share of agriculture and water
resources in the development budgets and a slow-down in minor irrigation
development in recent years. Experience of the last decade indicates that
about two thirds of the increase in the production of food grains came from
dry season cropping. This confirms the critical role of irrigation, together
with flood cor.trol and drainage development, and expanded use of fertilizers
and improved seeds, in helping the country progress towards food self-
sufficiency. The potential exists to more than double the present irrigation
coverage of about 2.3 million ha using relatively inexpensive minor irrigation
equipment to exploit readily available ground water and surface water re-
sources. At the same time, flood control and drainage facilities, now
covering about 2.5 million ha, should be expanded where technically and
economically viable, to help limit pre-monsoon damage to dry season crops and
intensify the production of monsoon season crops. Development of the irriga-
tion potential mainly depends on initiatives by the private sector while
public sector support should be largely limited to providing a favorable
policy context to stimulate sales of agricultural inputs and equipment,
improving the quality of agricultural support services, and providing
essential infrastructure for flood control and irrigation. Consequently, the
Government is considering substantial increased investments in water control
infrastructure and has taken steps to further encourage private investments in
minor irrigation.
3.       Attainment of adequate growth (3Z-4Z) in the agricutural sector



- 2 -
requires not only investments in new irrigation and flood control facilities
but also a major emphasis on rehabilitation and improved O&M of existing faci-
lities in order to maximize their effectiveness. The Bank's 1989 Public
Expenditure Review confirmed that many parts of the Government's recurrent
budget continue to be underfunded, particularly for O&M of existing infra-
structure. While scarcity of local funds is an important factor, the low
priority given to O&M in the planning process (as compared to new in-:estments)
also has proved to be a major constraint. It is estimated that the
Government's allocation under the revenue budget for O&M of about 400 existing
public flood control, drainage, and irrigation projects has consistently
fallen some 30Z-40Z short of requirements in recent years.  At the same time,
cost recovery from beneficiaries of irrigation projecta has been negligible
due _o complicated assessment and collection procedures and insufficient
efforts to enforce existing legislation.  As a result, most projects suffer
from lack of regular maintenance and many have deteriorated to a stage where
major rehabilitation works have become necessary. Other factors which limit
the effectiveness of past investments in water resources infrastructure,
include weaknesses in the procedures and practices for O&M, deficiencies in
BWDB's organization and staff capabilities, and insufficient involvement of
the beneficiaries. Lack of regular maintenance not only reduces the effecti-
veness of the projects so that their potential benefits cannot be fully
realized but it also increases the risk of major flood damage, particularly
during severe floods such as occurred in 1987 and 1988. Emergency rehabi-
litation works following the floods of recent years are underway under several
projects financed by IDA, the Asian Development Bank and other donors. The
Bank is also leading an international effort aimed at designing an Action Plan
to control annual flooding in Bangladesh.   Rehabilitation of facilities which
have deteriorated due to insufficient maintenance, has started in only a small
number of projects, often in conjunction with investments for new projects.
In order to be effective and sustainable, rehabilitation works must be
accompanied by actions to improve funding for O&M, introduce better O&M
procedures and practices, upgrade staff capabilities and motivation, institute
effective cost recovery arrangements, and increase the involvement of the
beneficiaries.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  During the last decade IDA has worked
closely with the Government to devise a comprehensive strategy for developing
the country's water resources and has financed a number of BWDB's flood
control, drainage, and irrigation projects. This project forms an integral
part of that strategy. It is a national program which focusses on improving
the services provided by existing flood control, drainage, and irrigation in-
frastructure. Such improvements are critical for securing the full benefits
from earlier investments. They are also critical for establishing a sound
basis for the longer term development of Bangladesh' water resources which is
a prerequisite for continued growth of the agriculture sector. The envisaged
improvements of O&M procedures and the increased participation by the farmers
deviate from present practices and require the technical and financial backing
of an institution like IDA to succeed. Given IDA's past involvement, it has
comparative advantage to lead this initiative and to mobilize support by other
donors.
5.       Project Objectives. The project's main objectives are to protect and
increase agricultural production and incomes and to raise the standards of
living, particularly those of landless persons and women, through rehabili-



tation and improved O&M of BWDB's existing projects. Several subsidiary
objectives would be pursued in order to attain the main objectives. These
include (a) increased financing and more efficient use of funds for 0 M.
through better planning and reduction of costs, where possible, (b) in.prove-
ment of skills and better motivation of BWDB staff for O&M tasks, and (c)
increased involvement of the farmers in planning, construction, and 0&M,
particularly for on-farm develcpment works.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project would support a series of
interrelated actions designed to upgrade the level of services provided by
BWDB's existing irrigation, flood control and drainage projects.
Specifically, the project would finance (a) rehabilitation and impro;ement
works, followed by improved maintenance, in about 80 subprojects covering
about 600,000 ha, (b) introduction of improved O&M programs for all BWDB
projects, starting in three major irrigation projects and seven small flood
control and drainage schemes, covering about 100,000 ha, which do not require
rehabilitation works at this time, (c) implementation of on-farm development
works in two representative subprojects, covering about 17,000 ha, in order to
encourage farmers to make better use of the infrastructure provided, par-
ticularly for irrigation, (d) training of BWDB staff and beneficiaries,
emphasizing improved O&M of the subprojects, and (e) technical assistance for
planning, design and monitoring of construction of rehabilitation and improve-
ment works, and for planning and implementation of improved O&M, on-farm
development works, training, and benchmark and evaluation studies. The
project would be carried out over seven years and provide funds for civil
works, engineering and administration, incremental cost of operation and
maintenance, equipment and vehicles, training, and technical assistance.  The
total cost is estimated at US$111.0 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$12.5 million (11Z). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project pr^cessing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8093-BD, dated February 6,
1990, is being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Conditions of effectiveness for the IDA credit would
be (a) effectiveness of the co-financing agreements between the Government of
Bangladesh and the Government of the Netherlands, and between the Government
and EEC, (b) issue of Board Orders by BWDB designating the Director General
for Training and Staff Development, the Chief Engineer for O&M, and the
Directors for Rehabilitation and for O&M, (c) promulgation by tnle Government
of the amendment to the Irrigation Water Rate Ordinance, and (d) approval of
the project proforma by the Government.  A condition o. disbursements against
expenditures for O&M would be the submission of firm staffing plans for three
major irrigation projects and one BWDB O&M subdivision. Other agreed actions
include (a) selection of subprojects in accordance with agreed criteria, (b)
acquisition of land for construction in accordance with an agreed time table,
(c) increase of allocations for maintenance works, electricity and fuel costs
of BWDB's existing projects by at least 1OZ per year, in real terms, (d)
adoption of improved O&M procedures in all BWDB operation and maintenance
divisions in accordance with a schedule to be submitted by June 30, 1994, (e)
appointment of all consultants by July 31, 1990, (f) submission of draft
annual O&M programs and budgets, and finalized annual work programs and



- 4 -
budgets for the entire project, at specified intervals, (g) establishment of a
subproject committee before implementation of each subproject, and (h)
promulgation by the Government of the revised Irrigation Water Rate Rules by
December 31, 1990.
8.       Justification.  The project would prevent losses of up to 160,000 m
ton paddy per year due to timely rehabilitation and would also increase
production by about 240,000 m ton paddy per year from the present level due to
rehabilitation and improvement works. Average incomes of about 700,000
families, including landowners, sharecroppers and landless laborerd, would
increase by about 25X. Employment would increase by about 25,000 man-years
per year for on-farm activities. The additional employment created during the
rehabilitation and O&M of the projects is estimated at 100,000 man-years and
would mainly benefit landlesE men and women. The economic rate of return of
the project is estimated at 37Z. Since most physical works consist of
rehabilitation and improvement of existing infrastructure, the project would
improve the environmental conditions by providing added security against flood
damage, better access to properties, better drainage of areas with excess
moisture (an important public health benefit), and, for irrigation sub-
projects, improved groundwater replenishment. Any potential adverse effects
of the works would be assessed during the feasibility studies to be carried
out for all subprojucts and provisions would be made to remedy these effects,
where necessary.
9.       Risk3.  Delays in project implementation due to pre-construction
delays are a risk facing the project. However, because the project comprises
a large number of subprojects, eventual delays should affect only a limited
number of those. Also, the designs for rehabilitation and improvement of the
first group of 16 subprojects to be implemented during the early project years
already have been prepared and land acquisition requirements for these
subprojects are minimal. The project strategy to further reduce this risk
includes technical assistance for planning and design of the remaining
subprojects, monitoring of rehabilitation and improvement works, and training
of BWDB staff and beneficiaries in nerforming their tasks. A second risk is
the possible shortage of local funds for rehabilitation and O&M of project
facilities. In order to reduce this risk, the financial contribution by the
Government has been kept at a minimum during the initial post-rehabilitation
years and external donors would finance a large part of the incremental O&M
costs of the subprojects. Furthermore, the Government has agreed to increase
its allocations for O&M of existing BWDB projects by 102 per year until all
requirements are fully financed. Special emphasis would also be given in the
project to reducing the cost and improving the standards of O&M.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
