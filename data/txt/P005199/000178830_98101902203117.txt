REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE GOVERNMENT
OF IRAN FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Government of Iran for the equivalent of US$16.5 million to help
finance a population project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, includ-
ing five years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Iran" (R71-129) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1, 1971.
An updating Memorandum (R73-74) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
March 26, 1973. The next economic mission is expected to visit Iran in
September 1973. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Over the past decade, Iran has given strong emphasis to the estab-
lishment of a diversified industrial base, the introduction of new institu-
tional and on-farm development practices in agriculture, the creation of
urban centers and the application of modern technology in capital formation
and distribution. Iran's achievements in these areas have succeeded in
bringing about a fundamental transformation of the whole production complex.
4.        The structural change was accompanied by rapid and sustained econom-
ic growth. Real GNP has doubled in the course of seven years and continued
high growth can realistically be projected. The development process, sustain-
ed by fast growing oil revenues (which increased to an estimated $2.5 billion
in 1972), has affected all sectors. Ambitious public and private investment
programs in construction, water and power, transport and communications, as
well as considerable diversification and expansion of the industrial sector,
have not only generated uninterrupted growth, but have also changed the social
and economic profile of Iran. In the process, a number of structural problems
associated with rapid growth and technological progress have arisen. These
are elaborated below and their effects on some of the major socio-economic
indicators are being monitored by the Government with a view to introducing
such adjustments as may be necessary.
5.        Rapid economic growth in Iran has been achieved at a high foreign
exchange cost. Wvhile GNP has been rising at around 11 percent per annum,
imports grew at 19 percent annually during 1963-71. This is mainly owing to
the high import content of investment and production, primarily in industry.
In order to meet the rising import bill, Iran pursued a policy not only of
maintaining low foreign reserves but also of taking advantage of its enhanced
creditworthiness to borrow abroad on a large scale. Until 1970, its foreign
reserves represented a few weeks' imports, resulting in short-term exchange
crises of varying degrees of severity. However, following the new oil agree-
ments in 1971, Iran has been able to build up higher levels of foreign re-
serves, which in February 1973 amounted to $970 million, or over four months'



-2-
imports at the 1972 level.  Nevertheless, imports are expected to continue
to grow and the Government is watching the foreign exchange situation close-
ly notwithstanding the 16-17 percent annual growth of oil revenues.
6.        In the Fourth Plan and, to a larger extent, in the Fifth Plan
(1973-77) greater emphasis is being given to the processing and produc-
tion of domestic inputs and to capital goods, as well as to more effective
industrial linkage policies. The Government already has under way a number
of major projects to substitute imported intermediate and capital goods
(e.g. steel, machine tools, engineering and agricultural machinery and
chemicals) and the private sector is also embarking on a number of industrial
ventures in this sub-sector. These projects can be economically integrated
with the user industries if their output is priced competitively. The Govern-
ment's role in adjusting the protection system and in helping to establish
the necessary industrial infrastructure is crucial in inducing further in-
dustrial growth. These problems were highlighted in the Bank report on "Iran
Industrial Policies and Priorities" (R72-76) and are the subject of a continu-
ing dialogue with the Iranian authorities.
7.        Continued adjustment of industrial development policies, however,
while necessary, is not sufficient. Industries need markets, either within
the country or abroad, and the domestic market for intermediate and capital
goods depends to a great extent on the market for doraestically produced
consumer goods. This market has largely been made up of the urban population,
whose demands are unlikely to increase at the rates experienced during the
1960's. Since the development of foreign sales by modern manufacturers is
still in its infancy, the continued expansion of sales of consumer goods
requires an increase in the real incomes of the poorer urban dwellers and
the 18 million people still living in the rural areas.
3.        The dynamic growth of industry in recent years, contrasted with
low rates of growth in agriculture, has created a social imbalance as the
income gap between Iran's urban and rural population widened. Because of
this the Government has decided to give high priority to acceleration of the
development of the agricultural sector in the Fifth Plan, with a four-fold
increase in the resources being allocated to that sector during the next
five years. Intensive efforts are currently under way to work out a
comprehensive strategy aimed at maximizing production through cooperatives
and farm corporations as well as agri-businesses. The Fifth Plan includes
projects designed to achieve more efficient use of irrigation facilities,
expansion of the agricultural extension corps, and wider distribution of
credit, fertilizers and improved seeds. It should be recognized, however,
that given the scarcity of irrigation water in Iran, the agricultural sector
cannot provide higher incomes and gainful employment opportunities for all
those living at present in the rural areas (60 percent of the population),
iet alone for a growing rural population. The urban drift, which has
accelerated over the past decade is, therefore, expected to continue.



-3-
9.        This urban drift is an important element in reducing the degree of
underemployment in the rural sector and a recognition of the physical constraints
on agricultural growth. The Government is,therefore, concerned with balancing
this migration with new employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas.
While it is not realistic to attempt a projection of the urban employment
potential in Iran, the record so far has been impressive. Despite
an annual growth rate of urban population of over 5 percent during the past
decade, there are no major signs of open unemployment in the larger cities.
This observation is supported by the rising trend of wages (which, neverthe-
less, are still low for the unskilled workers) and by the rapid expansion of
employment opportunities in industry, construction, public utilities and
services. Nevertheless, at the anticipated rate of urbanization, the urban
labor force would grow from some 3.7 million workers in 1972 to 4.7 million
workers in 1977. The capital cost of employing one million new entrants in
the urban labor market (plus 400,000 in rural areas) over the next five years
will be high, but the Fifth Plan calls for creation of a total of 1.8 million
new jobs, and therefore aims not only to accomodate new entrants but also to
reduce under-employment.
10.       Pressures on urban facilities (e.g. housing and mass transportation)
are increasing rapidly in the major cities where development over the past
decade has tended to concentrate. Current projections indicate that continued
urbanization at present rates would mean a two-fold expansion in the size of
the major urban centers. To face these problems, Iran is intensifying its
efforts to decentralize development away from Tehran by creating "poles of
development" in key provincial areas, and also to reduce the overall rate
of population growth by the wider use of family planning techniques. Con-
tinued success of these policies requires substantial growth in expenditures
on infrastructure facilities in and between provincial towns and cities, as
well as on health and medical facilities. The Government's greater emphasis
on the social aspects of development is clearly indicated by the sectoral
allocations under the Fifth Plan. Although a reduction in the rate of po-
pulation growth can only be expected over the long-term - as the additions
to the labor force over the next fifteen years have already been born - it
has now become an essential part of Iran's strategy for the development of a
modern, advanced economy.
11.       There has been a rapid increase in Iran's external debt in recent
years, and as of March 31, 1972, $5.1 billion was outstanding (of which only
$2.9 billion had been disbursed). Of the total debt, including the undis-
bursed amount, about 43 percent was held by governments (some 18 percent by
the USSR and 11 percent by the USA, the two largest creditors), and about
10 percent by the Bank. The rest is private debt owed to foreign suppliers
and private financial institutions. There have been some changes in the
nature and source of loans which Iran has received in the past few years.
The most significant of these is the increase in short-term indebtedness
to financial institutions since 1969. The improved reserve position of the
Central Bank allowed the funding of a portion of these short-term loans in
1971, as well as the accumulation of an additional $500 million in foreign
reserves. A long-term projection of Iran's external position shows that a



- 4 -
substantial gross inflow of capital would still be required to meet the in-
vestment program of over $36 billion envisaged in the Fifth Plan. Prelimin-
ary estimates indicate that about 10 percent of this investment will be
financed from foreign sources, requiring gross inflows of some 1.6 billion
annually. This, however, is not likely to raise the debt service ratio
beyond 20 nercent during the Fifth Plan period. Nevertheless in view of the
underlying strength of the balance of payments and of the fact that other
elements of creditworthiness, such as diversification of the economy and
rapid economic growth, are likely to develop favourably, Iran may be consildered
creditworthy for substantial borrowing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAN
12.       The Bank has made 24 loans to Iran, amounting to $774.1 million
(net of cancellations), of which $433.3 million has been disbursed and
$207.7 million repaid by the end of March 1973. Annex II contains summary
statements of Bank loans and IFC investments in Iran as of March 31, 1973,
and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects.
13.       Since 1957 when the first loan was made to Iran until 1969, Bank
lending had been mainly for roads, irrigation and industrial credit. In
the last three years, however, it has been diversified to cover also power,
telecommunications, ports, pipelines, agricultural credit and education.
As spelled out in Annex II progress in the execution of the ongoing projects
is generally satisfactory despite some delays in procurement and the appoint-
ment of consultants.
14.       During the initial phase of Iran's industrial development, IFC's
activity was moderate. A first investment was made in 1959 ia a ceramic
tile plant, which was followed only in 1969 by a second investment in a
steel products company. Recently IFC's activity in Iran has expanded and
since June 1971, IFC has made four investments (i.e. in pulp and paper,
carbon black manufacturing, synthetic fibers and food products). As of
March 31, 1973, the IFC had invested an amount of $27.6 million.
15.       The Bank's lending program for the next few years is intended to
support the high levels of investment and social welfare expenditure re-
quired if Iran is to maintain the growth rate of 10-12 percent annually which
it has set as its target for the Fifth Plan covering the five year period
which commenced on March 21, 1973. While the program will provide for con-
tinued investment in infrastructure and in industry, special emphasis is to
be given to agriculture and the social sectors in accord with the Government's
policy. In this context discussions with the Government have a'lready started
on the content of a second education project, and it is hoped that the pre-
paratory nutrition study under the proposal before you will lead to a loan
for a nutrition project. Urban transport, water supply and sewerage projects



-5-
are also being considered for Bank lending. Furthermore, the special Task
Force which has been established by the Bank and the Government to deal with
the complex problems of agriculture and rural development is expected to
develop specific plans for investment in the rural sectors.
PART III - IRAN'S POPULATION
16.       Iran has a population of about 31 million people.    It has an area
of 1,648,000 k1m2, the fourth largest in Asia and equivalent to the aggregate
size of the countries of the European Common Market. Although the overall
density is about 19 persons per km2, the population is mainly concentrated in
the north and west of the country. For every km2 of agricultural land, there
are about 111 persons. Of the arable area, only about one-tenth is presently
irrigated, and it is the inadequate supply of water which is the major cons-
traint to the long-term development of agriculture.
17.       Demographic data from civil statistics are incomplete and must be
derived from censuses and sample surveys. Between the censuses of 1956 and
1966, the population grew at an annual rate of about 2.9 percent and is now
growing at about 3 percent. At this level the population will double in
about 23 years. The high growth rate is the result of high fertility and
relatively low mortality. The crude birth rate is now estimated to be about
45 per 1,000 persons. Fertility appears to have been sustained, while the
estimated crude death rate has dropped from 24 per 1,000 persons in 1956 to
about 15 at present mainly due to the success of campaigns to eradicate
malaria, smallpox, and other endemic diseases, and to the general improvement
in health and nutrition standards.
18.       The population of Iran is,,comparatively young; the proportion of
those under 15 years of age increased from 42 percent in 1956 to about 47
percent in 1972. This young age structure, with a mortality rate which is
expected to maintain its decline, will tend to sustain the high natural growth
rate for at least 10-15 years, despite a possible reduction in fertility.
It appears that the average Iranian woman marries when she is about 18 years
and bears about 7 children during her reproductive cycle.
19.       The demographic and socio-economic implications of such high
fertility are serious. If fertility remains unchanged and mortality
continues to decline, a population of about 37 million could be expected by
the end of the Fifth Plan in 1978, and some 61 million by 1991; the annual
growth rate then having reached as high as 3.9 percent. It is the Government's
intention to slow down the growth of the rural population and the agricultural
work force by maintaining the already rapid annual urbanization rate. Unless
fertility is curbed, the rapid growth rate will severely strain the capacity
of the Government to provide the social infrastructure and industrial economic
opportunities needed to maintain its urbanization policy.



-6-
20.       The population problem and its consequences have been recognized by
the Government, which has been committed to a policy of limiting population
growth since 1966. In that year a Deputy Minister for Population and Family
Planning was appointed in the Ministry of Health to plan and introduce a na-
tional family planning program. The first three years of the program were
primarily devoted to establishing an organization, developing awareness of
the population problem, and providing services through the Ministry of Health's
facilities mainly in the urban areas. Further recognition of the long-term
economic and social effects of a rapid population growth rate was prompted
by analyses of data from the 1966 census, and led to the adoption of a more
aggressive population policy in 1971. The declared aim of reducing the annual
growth rate to 1 percent by 1991 is desirable but perhaps over-ambitious.
21.       The results of the national program show a steady if not spectacular
rise in the number of new acceptors since its inception. In mid-1968 there
were only 200 clinics; in 1970, this had risen to over 1,300 and in March 1972,
tiiere were over 1,600 clinics. The average number of family planning clients
in a month has risen from about 34,000 in 1968 to around 400,000 in 1972.
Ilowever, the average number of new clients per clinic declined from over 50
per month in 1970 to about 34 by 1972. There are presently an estimated
additional 100,000 women practicing contraception who are not covered by the
official program. Nevertheless, only about 8 percent of about six million
women in the reproductive age group (15-49) are covered by the official and
private sector family planning programs.
22.       About 80-90 percent of new acceptors take oral contraceptives, while
IUD insertions account for only 3-4 percent, and conventional contraceptives,
mainly condoms, account for the remainder. Heavy reliance on oral contracep-
tives means that motivation has to be effective and sustained. There is,
however, evidence that continuation rates are low - probably as low as about
22 percent annually - and that the growth of the program has been due to
the provision of more service points rather than to an improvement of clinical
performance.
23.       The Health Ministry has set the reduction of the crude birth rate
to 40 per thousand by 1978 as its objective for the Fifth Plan. This means
that the number of family planning clients will have to be increased to one
million by 1978. The program is presently being carried out mainly in the
large urban areas. lIowever, of the women in the reproductive age group, about
60 percent live in the 66,500 villages of Iran and a further 12 percent in 248
small towns of under 50,000 population. Expansion of the program into small
towns and villages, particularly when about 40,000 of the villages have a
population of 250 or less, is relatively difficult administratively and
demanding financially. To meet the demands of this extended program, its
management must be made more effective, the quality of staff and facilities
improved, the number of delivery points increased, and the promotional aspects
of the program considerably strengthened.



-7-
24.       The budgetary allocation for family planning has increased from
$0.5 million in 1967 to $9.2 million in 1972. The Government has a total
program under the Fifth Plan estimated at $100 million for family planning,
ill addition to about $400 million for the expansion of the health services
and $300 million for rural health and medical services. There has been con-
siderable foreign assistance. In 1971, the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) signed an Agreement with the Government providing US$1.6
million for several family planning activities. They included pilot projects
for a post-partum program, and family planning information and education,
transport, training, and support for non-government agencies. The Population
Council has helped with evaluation work and family planning communications
projects. Foreign assistance is estimated at about $300,000 in 1973.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The project for which the Government of Iran has requested financing
has been prepared by the Government with assistance from the Bank. It was
appraised by the Bank in August/September 1972. Negotiations for the pro-
posed loan were held in Washington from March 28 to April 4, 1973, with
an Iranian delegation led by His Excellency Dr. Amir Mansour Sardari, Deputy
Minister for Population and Family Planning, Ministry of Health.
Obj ectives
26.       The main objectives of the proposed project, to be implemented
between 1973 and 1976, are (a) to provide some of the basic physical facilities
needed to extend health and family planning services to the smaller towns and a
study for subsequent extension to the rural areas; (b) to assist in overcoming
the present organizational and administrative shortcomings of the program
resulting in part from the multidisciplinary nature of the population problem
and the concomitant large number of government and non-government bodies
concerned with various implementation aspects; (c) io increase the number
and improve the quality of training of family planning workers; and (d) to
prepare for a subsequent nutrition project.
Description
27.       The principal elements of the project are indicated below, together
with their cost:
a.   the construction, equipping and furnishing of 78 health
centers to assist the Government in extending the quantity
and quality of its services to smaller urban areas, ($20.3
million); and a related study to investigate the subsequent
optimum extension of health and family planning services
to rural areas, ($50,000);



-8-
b.   the construction, equipping and furnishing of nine regional
family planning training centers, ($7.9 million) and seven
behyar (assistant nurse-midwife) training schools, ($4.0
million);
c.   a management study leading to a more effective organization
and administration of the population and family planning
program, ($250,000);
d.   provision of 150 vehicles to extend the delivery of family
planning and for the training centers and schools, ($0.8
million); and
e.   a nutrition study which could serve as a basis for a
subsequent project, ($150,000)
28.       During the preparation of the project, consultations were held with
the UNFPA to coordinate objectives and activities. The project components
complement those of the UNFPA 1971 Agreement (see para 24) and together
support different priority areas of the national program. Particularly close
coordination with UNFPA is planned for the management study included in the
Bank project. Agreement on the substance of this study has been reached by
the Government, the Bank and UNFPA.
29.       In preparation for a possible subsequent nutrition project, pro-
vision has been made for a nutrition study component estimated to cost about
$150,000. The study would focus inter alia on developing a pilot program at
the provincial level to test the effectiveness of nutrition policies and plans
and a national staple food fortification program.
30.       A Loan and Project Summary has been included in Annex III.    The
Appraisal Report No. 85a-IRN dated April 23, 2973 is being circulated sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors.
Cost and Financing of the Project
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $33.4 million, the
foreign exchange component of which is $9.2 million. The proposed Bank loan
of $16.5 million represents approximately 50 percent of total costs, and
would cover all the foreign exchange costs and local costs amounting to $7.3
million equivalent. The relatively small foreign exchange component, which
is typical of social projects, means that the Bank must assist with the
financing of local expenditures if it is to make an appropriate contribution
to the financing of the project. The Governments participation in the project
will involve a substantial increase in its expenditures on family planning
both to meet its 50 percent share of the investment costs and to finance
recurrent expenditure necessary for utilization of the facilities provided
under the project.



-9-
Procurement and Disbursements
32.       Contracts for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of
$50,000 or more, and for vehicles, would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Domestic vehicle manufacturers would be accorded a margin of preference
equal to the existing rate of customs duty or 15 percent of the CIF costs
of competing imports, whichever is the lower. Procurement of equipment and
furniture, which is unlikely to be of international interest because of the
amall size of the packages, will be by competitive bidding locally; a wide
range of overseas suppliers are represented on the local market. Contracts
for civil works estimated to cost less than $50,000 will also be awarded in
accordance with local competitive bidding procedures.
33.       The loan would be disbursed to meet (a) 50 percent of total expendi-
tures on civil works; (b) 100 percent of CIF costs of directly imported
vehicles or 100 percent of the ex-factory price if manufactured locally; (c)
50 percent of the total expenditure on equipment and furniture; (d) 100 per-
cent of the total expenditure on technical assistance in view of its import-
ance in developing the national program and future project possibilities;
and (e) 50 percent of the total of professional fees. Retroactive financing
of the fees of the executive architects in an amount not exceeding $250,000
is being provided for.
Implementation
34.       Responsibility for overall project coordination will be that of a
Project Coordinator. The Government intends to designate the Deputy Minister
for Population and Family Planning in the Ministry of Health as the Project
Cordinator. Day to day responsibility for the technical supervision of the
civil works component of the project, (including planning, design, and super-
vision of construction) would be assigned to a unit within the Ministry of
Health, headed by a full-time Project Architectural Manager (PAM) with sup-
porting staff. His appointment is a condition of loan effectiveness. The
PAM would report to the Project Coordinator.
Project Justification
35.       The project would contribute to the alleviation of Iran's long-term
population problem and hence to the enhancement of social welfare in the
country. In making provision for a management study the project addresses
itself to the organizational and administrative improvements required for
the effective implementation of an expanded national family planning program.
It will provide information from which the Government will be able to assess
how best its population and family planning program can be planned and imple-
mented by coordinating and supervising the contributions of several Ministries,
and other public and private agencies.



- 10 -
36.       In conjtlnction with the assistance programs of the UNFPA, the proj-
ect will assist in accelerating the extension of family planning activities
(now concentrated mainly in the larger urban areas) to the small towns and
rural areas. The health centers will provide the necessary technical and
administrative bases from which services could be delivered and supervised;
the vehicles will increase mobility, thereby facilitating motivation and
supervision; and the training schools will increase the numbers and improve
the quality of staff available for family planning work.
37.       The project will provide the basis for further Bank loans during the
next five years. The preparation of such loans will be expedited by the
study providing information on the most effective methods of extending health
and family planning services into the rural areas of the counties covered by
the project.  This and forthcoming projects will assist the Government in
achieving the target set for the Fifth Plan of averting an estimated 1 million
births by increasing the number of new acceptors of family planning to about
a million a year as compared with the current level of around 400,000. This
in turn will help the achievement of the Government's long-term policy
objectives of reaching full employment in both the urban and the rural areas,
raising income levels and providing adequate educational, health and social
welfare facilities for the population.
PART V - TEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between Iran and the Bank, the report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Agreement
conforms to the pattern normally used by the Bank for population projects.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
40.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 410; Roads III; US$28.0 million Loan of April 28, 1965;
Closing Date: September 30, 1973
$4.0 mi.llion was cancelled in July 1969 when two road sections were
deleted from the project. The original Closing Date, September 1,
1969, was first postponed to September 1, 1961, and then to December
31, 1972. The five roads have been almost completed and, in order
to ensure that final disbursements could be made, the Closing Date
has been postponed a third time to September 30, 1973.
Loan No. 517; Ghazvin Development; US$11.0 million Loan of October 17, 1967;
Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The progress of construction, pace of development and crIality of super-
vision under the Project are generally satisfactory. The Loan amount
was reduced by half in 1971 due to the reduction in the scope of the
Project and more local procurement than had been originally anticipated.
On completion of Stage II, which is now being carried out by the
Borrower with its own resources, a total of 52,o00 ha (including 26,000 ha
under Stage I) will be fully developed.
Loan No. 594; Dez Irrigation; US$30.0 million Loan of April 18, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Progress of construction and the quality of supervision under the Project
are generally satisfactory. Irrigation facilities are available for
55,000 out of the 57,000 ha, but irrigation efficiency has been affected
because of the delays in land levelling and as the agribusiness imple-
mentation schedules have not been adhered to. Moreover, the area reserved
for improved traditional farming, for which the Project Authority was
to provide land levelling, farm machinery and other supporting services,
has been reduced substantially as the result of the allocation for devel-
opment by farm corporations of a larger extent than had been originally
anticipated.
Loan No. 602; Fifth EFC - IMDBI* US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 197K
In December 1972 IMDBI prepaid, with Bank approval, $31.1 million
of the $31.3 million disbursed and outstanding under this Loan.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

the minimum. level of its sub-loans from US$33,000 equivalent (previously
us$66,000 equivalent) to US$13,000. The Closing Date which was

Closing Date: June 30, 1975
There have been delays in arranging for consul-tants to carry out stud-
ies on transport coordination, and road mainteniance. It is understood,
however, that contracts for both studies have now been signed and that
work will commence shortily. The Tehran Urban Transport Study was begun
in March 1971, and the consultant's Immediate Action Program submitted
in July 1972 has formed the basis of a project recently appraised.
Disbursement, which had been slow, has accelerated since work on road
construc-tion began in the summer of 1972.

Loan of December 18, 1970; (.losing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is proceeding satisfactorily but there has been some delay
in the execution owing to the Tehran Regional Electricity Company's
(the executing agency) unfamiliarity with the procurement procedures
required for Bank loans. Following the recent joint review of these
problems by the Bank and TREC, procurement is improving and disburse-
ments are expected to accelerate.

transfer of the telecoonianications assets of the Ministry of Posts,
Telegraph and Telephones (PrT) to the Telephone Company of Iran (TC) to
form the new Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI) did not take
place on schedule, but these steps have now been con=1e,tg(
Procurement of telex/gentex items under the PTT component of
-this project has been delayed by a decision to retender. However,
good progress is being made with exchange installations in the Tehran
area and the targets may be exceeded; works for provincial exchanges
and telex networks are behind schedule by about a year. Although dis-
bursements under the loan had been somewha-t slow, a substantial amount
has been committed.

Department of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the contract
for the construction of the Rey-Tabriz oil pipeline and the contract
for the Ahwaz-Rey crude oil pipeline were awarded in March 1973. How-
ever, due to the review of requirements for the Rey-Mashad section,
work on this line has been delayed and the NIOC is considering alter-
native proposals for expansion of the Rey-Mashad system to cope with
the demand in North-Eastern Iran.

The Loan became effective on September 25, 1972 and by February 28,

disbursements will also be made faster than originally projected. No
major problems have been encountered and none is expected.
