MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION QUALITY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$146.4 million to help finance a primary
education quality project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable- interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including a five year grace.period.
Background
2.    Peru has one of the highest rates of enrollment in primary education in Latin America. The
share of 6 to 14-year-olds attending school increased steadily from 78 percent in 1972 to 89 percent
in 1991. 'Me high proportion (97 percent) of each age cohort who enroll in first grade on time
(between ages 6 and 7) suggests that parents are committed to sending their children to school.
However, during the last three decades, this increase in educational demand has been accompanied by
declining financial resources and mismanagement of the sector. The conflict between a dramatic
expansion of enrollment and a decrease and misuse of resources has seriously affected the quality of
education.
3.    Expenditures on education have experienced a continuous decline in real terms, causing Peru
to lose its leadership role in educational investment in Latin America. In the early 1970s, educational
expenditures as a percent of GDP in Peru were slightly above the LAC regional average (3.5 percent
vs 3.4 percent), but by the beginning of the 1990s they were significantly below that average (1.9
percent vs 3.5 percent). The decline in real expenditures, coupled with expanding enrollment,
resulted in a sharp drop in real per student spending after 1985, from US$175 per student to about
US$80 per student by 1989-90.
4.    Parallel to this growing tension between increasing demand for education and decreasing
resources, a series of management changes weakened the Government's institutional capacity. These
changes included the creation of school clusters to strengthen rural schools in the early 1970s, and the
transfer of key educational responsibilities to regional authorities in the late 1970s. Although well-
intentioned, the measures were poorly conceived, planned and implemented, leaving the Ministry of
Education (MOE) with little capacity to manage daily operations or to enforce and implement national
policies. The situation was aggravated by the 1989 regionalization law which gave the Ministry of
Finance (MEF) authority to negotiate the education budget with each region. By controlling resource
allocation, MEF was left in a better position than MOE to influence educational policies at the
regional level and MOE lost all control over the provinces.
5.    Financial difficulties have also affected the physical conditions of the schooling environment.
Only about 30 percent of the classrooms are in good condition, 57 percent require immediate repair
and approximately 13 percent of the classrooms are unsalvageable. Furthermore, schools in poverty-
stricken rural and urban areas lack basic furniture, and only 2.4 percent of rural schools have access
to water, sewerage and electricity.
6.    As part of the preparation of the Primary Education Project, the Government recently
completed the preparation of a long-term plan to improve the quality of primary education and to
increase access among ethnic minority children to this education level, and is formulating a more



-2-
comprehensive long-term strategy for the entire education sector. Recently, the Government
produced a draft of this strategy in a document entitled Long-Term Education Development Plan
(1995-2010). The main objectives of this strategy are to increase coverage at the preschool and
primary school levels, to improve the quality of education at all levels in order to meet the challenges
of technology-driven economic development, and to strengthen the institutional framework and the
man&jement capacity of the educational system. Implementation of the Long-Term Education
Development Plan would be financed by the national budget as well as by resources from the
privatization program,- loans from multinational and bilateral organizations such as the World Bank,
the Inter-American Development Bank, and KfW, and contributions from bilateral donors (e.g. Spain
and Germany).
Rationale for Bank Involvement and the Relationship of the Project to the Bank Country
Assistance Strategy -
7.    This operation is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on
November 22, 1994 on the basis of the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President dated
October 28, 1994 (Report No. 12997-PE) which includes improvement of primary education as one of
the strategies lursued by the Bank to help develop Peru's most important resource, its human capital.
The proposed project would help achieve this objective by improving school teaching conditions as
well as quality of teaching and school management, and by reducing repetition and drop-out rates.
The project would also foster better resource utilization and more effective service delivery by
modernizing educational management and increasing public school autonomy and accountability.
Proect Objectives and Description
8.    The project's major goals are to improve the quality of primary education and to strengthen
the manaement capacity of the MOE at the central, regional and school level. Specifically, the
project would improve teaching conditions by rehabilitating dilapidated classrooms and by distributing
teaching materials and training teachers on tde use of these materials. Educational management would
be strengthenied through the modernization of current management practices and the transference of
key management functions to schools.
9.    The proposed project has three main components. An Educational Qualiy component
(US$88.1 million, or 35 percent of total base costs) would reduce repetition and dropout rates, and
increase educational attaintment by improving the availability and quality of textbooks and
instructional materials; enhance teaching competencies of primary school teachers; and improve the
curriculum's scope, sequence and adaptability. A Modernization of Educational Administration
component (US$44 million, or 17 percent of total base costs) would strengthen the management
capacity of the education sector at the central, departmental and local levels by transferring various
budgetary and management functions from the MOE, and USES to the schools; develop information
management capabilities at the central, departmental, and local levels; and establish a modern student
assessment system. An lnfrastructure Improvement component (US$121.8 million, or 48 percent of
total base costs) would support the improvement of teaching and learning conditions by rehabilitating
and replacing school infrastructure in rural and urban poor areas. The resources will primarily be
targeted at financing the rehabilitation and replacement of classrooms in thirteen departments where
the proportion of unsalvageable classrooms is above the national average, the proportion of student



-3 -
enrollment is below the national average, and the proportion of population living under extreme
poverty conditions is above the national average.
10.   As part of its long term education strategy, the Peruvian Government has also asked the Inter-
American Development Bank (1DB) to flnance a parallel loan to the education sector. The main
components of that proposed loan are: (i) expansion of access to preschool education; (ii)
improvement of secondary educatien; (iii) reform of vocational and technical education; and (iv)
strengthening the capacity of the MOE for strategic planning. The GOP has also requested from the
German Government financial support to implement the teacher training component of the current
project and technical assistance for the preparation of a project tO reform pre-service teacher training
and a bilingual education program. To ensure that these projects complement each other, IDB, KfW,
GTZ and World Bank staff have been in close contact throughout the project preparation period.
Project Costs and Flnancdng
11.   Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$298.6
million. Foreign exchange costs, local costs excluding taxes, and duties and taxes amount to US$22.1
million (7 percent), US$234.4 million (78 percent) and US$44.3 million (15 percent) of total project
costs, respectively. Base costs are estimated at US$253.9 million (US$19.5 million in foreign
exchange costs, US$189.7 million for local costs excluding taxes, and US$44.3 million for duties and
taxes). A breakdown of project costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of up to US$14.6 million equivalent would be provided for expenditures made
in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines since July 5, 1994 (project appraisal), to ensure that
technical assistance and civil works necessary for the timely implementation of the project begin with
sufficient lead time. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Peru are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report NO 13426-PE, dated
November 14, 1994, is being distributed separately.
Project Implefnentation and Sustainability
12.   Implementation. The project would be executed within the existing organizational structure
of the MOE supported by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and with the participation, via
implementation agreements. of the National Institute for Educational and Health Infrastructure
(INFES) and National Training Center for the Construction Industry (SENCICO). To carry out their
obligations, MOE, INFES, and SENCICO would be directly responsible for contracting out services
for implementing the different components of the project and for ensuring that the components
achieve project objectives.
13.   The PIU, reporting directly to the Minister of Education, would coordinate project activities
which would be undertaken by the MOE's directorates of Education Technology, Educational
Research and Training, Supervision, Infrastructure, and Planning. The PIU would be responsible for
consolidating the yearly work plans, coordinating activities among participating agencies, providing
administrative backup services, and carrying out project monitoring and evaluation. To ensure
efficient and timely implementation of the project the Government has agreed to set up a Special
Account in U.S. dollars in a commercial bank with an initial deposit of US$7.0 million equivalent,
corresponding to about four months of project implementation costs.



4-
14.   Sustainability. The effect of the proposed project on total educational expenditures and the
ability of the GOP to finance these, has been carefully examined in the context of Government's
overall commitments to education. The Government prepared a long-term plan outlining its strategy
to improve the quality of primary education in Peru and projecting the financial needs of the sector
until 2010. According to the plan, the Government needs to increase annual public spending in
education from the current level of 14 percent in 1994 to 16 percent by the year 1999. The long-term
plan's overall budgetary estimates and the corresponding project's budget line items, would be used as
the basis for annual discussions with the Government on budget allocations for the fbllowing year.
15. - To ensure long term sustainability of the investments associated with the project it is
important that the MOE be in a position to assume some of the expenditures linked to the
implementation of project activities after project completion and integrate them as part of the sector's
recurrent costs. The additional annual recurrent expenditures at the end of the project are estimated at
about US$24 million in 1994 prices, representing about 3.3% of the MOE's recurrent budget for
1994. The estimated increase in recurrent expenditures will consist mainly of educational materials
(textbooks, teacher's guides) and teacher training.
LAssons Learned
16.   The lessons from the Primary Education (Second Education) Project (Loan 2465-PE) in Peru
and from Bank experience with education projects in other countries have been examined and have
influenced the proposed strategy for this project. These lessons relate to issues of sustainability,
effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and sector specific issues such as textbooks and
instructional materials and teacher training.
17.   The proposed project takes these lessons into consideration by: (i) financing programs for
upgrading teachers and supporting the development of a separate strategy for revamping the teacher
certification system; (ii) financing training programs that are practice-oriented and are linked with the
new textbooks and instructional materials; (iii) stimulating local implementation of training programs;
(iv) conducting a national project launch workshop which would be followed up by a series of similar
regional workshops; and (v) conditioning disbursement for civil works to the achievement of
previously agreed targets for textbook distribution and teacher training.
Agreed Actions
18.   At negotiaticns, it was agreed that the MOE would: (a) operate and maintain, during the
execution of the project, the PIU with an internal structure, functions and staffing satisfactory to the
Bank; (b) operate and maintain, during the execution of the project, a high level Advisory Council;
(c) submit to the Bank, not later than December 31 of each year of project implementation, progress
reports on the Project including, inter-alia: (i) information on the progress achieved in the
implementation of the project and on the achievement of its objectives based, inter-alia, on the agreed
monitoring indicators; (ii) assessment of the problems and issues derived from the implementation of
the project; and (iii) information on the compliance of INFES and SENCICO with their respective
participation agreements; (d) furnish to the Bank, for its review and approval, not later than
December 31 of each year of project execution, a proposed annual investment plan providing for the
activities, implementation schedule, and proposed budget for each component of the project during the
upcoming year; (e) submit to the Bank, no later than December 31, 1995, a copy of the Bilingual
Education Plan; (f) submit to the Bank not later than December 31 of each year of project execution,



-5 -
starting in 1996, reports on the progress in the achievement of the goals of the Long-Tenn Education
Devetopmeit Plan; (g) hold annual reviews jointly with the Bank not later than January 31 of each
year of proje  execution, starting in 1996; (O) conduct jointly with the Bank, 30 months after
effectiveness, a mid-term implementation- review of the project to analyze project implementation
experience and possible project impact, and progress in the achievement of the goals of the Bilingual-
Intercultural Education Plan; (i) maintain through the PIU a consolidated account of all expenditures
under the project. These accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank. The audit reports would be forwarded to the Bank no later that six months after the end of
each fiscal year; and 0) require that INFES -uses a system of standard regional unit prices, acceptable
to the Bank, to guide the negotiation of contracts for civil works implemented through direct
contracting. This system will be rfviewed twice a year by the Bank, MOE, and INFES to assess how
adequate are the prices been used.
19.   Agreement have also been reached on: a list of monitoring and evaluation indicators including
the definition of implementation targets for civil works, school furniture, teacher training, and
textbook distribution; a system for tracking project implementation using the monitoring indicators;
the final list of the departnents that would participate on the school rehabilitation program; and a
commitment that INFES would not finance infrastructure related to primary schools in the targeted
schools included in the annual project plan approved by the Bank. The Government and the Bank
have further agreed that: disbursement of loan proceeds for the construction, rehabilitation,
improvement, furnishing or provision of office furniture would be reserved for targeted schools
included in the annual plan approved by the Bank. The number of targeted schools to be included in
the annual plans would be determined on the basis of the achievement of the annual implementation
targets for textbooks distribution and teacher training to be agreed at negotiations; and withdrawals
ior technical assistance for implementing the recommendations of the management audit studies would
be conditioned to an agreement between the MOE and the Bank on a concrete action-plan for
upgrading management capacity.
20.   As condition of loan effectiveness the MOE would: adopt the Operational Manual comprising
a description of procedures for project implementation satisfactory to the Bank; amend its agreements
with FONCODES, requiring FONCODES to not finance community based projects for the
rehabilitation of any of the targeted primary schools classrooms covered in the annual project plan
approved by the Bank; appoint the planning specialist, the procurement expert, and at least three of
the educational specialists required by the PIU; sign the subsidiary agreements with INFES and
SENCICO; and establish the Advisory Council with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Poverty Category
21.   Consistent with the Bank assistance strategy for Peru, the project contributes to human
resource development and poverty reduction through investing in the rehabilitation of targeted primary
schools and classroom specific interventions aimed at raising educational attaintment among the less
advantaged groups of the country.
Environmental Aspects
22.   Since the project would only finance replacement of deteriorated classrooms, it is not expected
that it would have any adverse environmental impact.



6 -
Program Objective Category
23.   This project consists of activities included in the categories of poverty reduction, human
resource developreat and economic management.
Participatory Approach
24.   The project was identified during a week-long seminar attended by representatives of the
MOE, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, teacher training institutes, universities, NGOs, research
institutes, and donor agencies. The seminar resulted in a consensus on the main problems and
priorities in primary education. To facilitate project implementation and to gain support from
stakeholders, the MOE will organize a four day project launch workshop at the national level with the
participation of MOE staff and regional coordinators. lThis workshop will be followed by regional
workshops conducted by the regional project coordinators for MOE regional staff, teachers,
principals, and educators of universities and teacher training institutes.
Benefits and Risks
25.   Benefits. The main benefits of the project would be improvements in the quality and internal
efficiency of primary education which would result in: (i) increased graduation rates; (ii) reduced
resource wastage by reducing repetition and dropout rates; and (iii) improvements in the learning
achievement of primary students. Other benefits would be increases in equity among regions and
between urban and rural areas and improvement in the MOE's capacity to formulate policies that
respond to local needs, to monitor school quality, and to assist local level education authorities in
improving the efficiency and quality of their systems.
26.   Risks. Main project risks are associated with: (i) the lack of capacity at the central (MOE)
and departmental level to implement policies and programs, (ii) possible opposition of departmental
and local authorities to the decentralization strategy proposed by the Central Government; and (iii)
possible changes in government priorities, resulting from the inauguration of a new administration in
1995. To strengthen MOE's capacity to implement large scale national programs the Bank has been
providing during project preparation, technical assistance to the MOE's project preparation team on
computerized project management (CPM) techniques. The financial support of a Japanese Grant
allowed the MOE to procure training for the staff of the Project Preparation Unit is these techniques
which were used for the preparation of detailed project implementation plans. During
implementation, the project will support the creation of a small Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
responsible for providing project management support and technical assistance to the MOE's
operational departnents. This unit would develop and implement standard procurement, monitoring,
evaluation, and accounting procedures to be used by the project and the MOE for the procurement of
good and services. Also the project would finance training on project management, monitoring and
implementation of the staff of the MOE's departnents responsible for instructional materials, student
assessment, teacher training, planning, and school infrastructure. Although the risk of opposition of
local governments is more difficult to control, the project would try to overcome this obstacle by
promoting early involvement of departmental and local educational authorities both in the initiation of
each activity and in its implementation.
