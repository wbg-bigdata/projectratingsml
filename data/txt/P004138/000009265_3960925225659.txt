PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
FOURTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 2549-RO)
EVALUATION SUMHARY
Introduction
The project both overlapped and contributed to the success of
government's Sixth Five Year Socioeconomic Development Plan. Particularly,
it assisted increasing the production of fruits and vegetables meeting
rising consumer demand and improving the income of small farmers through
intensification and diversification. The project was highly successful and
followed three successful similar Bank-assisted projects.
Oblectives and Rationale
The project focused on agricultural credit as a means to promote
agricultural development through financing small farm, private sector
investments covering a wide range of agricultural production and rural
income diversification activities.    The project was also designed to
Improve  the  National  Agricultural  Cooperative  Federation's   (NACF)
profitability,  and resource mobilization.   Government was to assist in
reviewing NACF's financial conditions (NACF had incurred losses during 1982
and 1983) and to propose measures to improve its efficiency and financial
condition.
Implementation. Results and Sustainability
The project was very successful.   It contributed to increasing
agricultural production, particularly of fruits, vegetables and special
crops,   and   fostered   diversification,   intensification,   income  and
employment.   However,  foreseen investments for non-farm investments by
farmers and cooperatives, including marketing facilities, were not financed
to the expected. It seems that NACF hesitated to promote such lending for
lack of experience and a certain conservatism.   NACF, however, was more
progressive in supporting diversification activities such as special crops
and a multitude of fruits and vegetables, mostly through simple,
unsophisticated greenhouse culture.
A total of 18,440 subloans were made. This was more than twice as
many (8,500) foreseen since more expensive non-farm and marketing loans
were neglected and not financed as planned.   The average loan size was
about US $2,500 equivalent.  About 70% of project beneficiaries had less
than 1 hectare of land.  There was a cost overrun of some 30% which was
financed by higher contributions from investors (36% versus 30X) and
Government/NACF (272 versus 25%); the Bank Loan eventually financed 372 of
cost as compared to 45% foreseen.



- v 
But more importantly, greenhouse and special crops investments
again (as in the Third Project) were much higher than planned, due to very
high demand both from investors and from consumers. This negated fears of
market and price risks.   A total of 62% of loans went for greenhouse
investments and 18S for special crops, with orchard development (82) and
on-farm storage (41) being much less important. A total of only 81 went
for irrigation, beekeeping and non-farm investments.   The project was
completed in less than three years, instead of four years foreseen of 1988,
when the loan was fully disbursed, one year ahead of the original Loan                     F
Closing Date.
Financial and economic rates of return of investments were high,
varying between 13% and over 502, very similar to apprai3al estimates.
Project investments created about 8,000 additional man-year employment
permanently.
NACF's financial conditions and efficiency improved. There were
small net earnings (after 1982 and 1983 losses) for the year 1984 through
1987. Government provided PACF with 21.9 billion won to protect NACF and
the foreign exchange risk of the loan.  This loan bears interest at 102,
versus an onlending rate of 8%. It has thus provided temporary liquidity,
rather than a long term remedy to the problem of foreign exchange risk.11
Government also provided the sub-borrowers from NACF with loans covering
the difference between farmers' contributions/World Bank loan and total
project cost. These loans were for a 12-year period, including two years
grace, at 72 p.a. NACF was thought to need a 32 interest rate spread to
cover its costs and a 122 interest rate was charged to farmers during the
early part of the project during 1985 and 1986.  However, this rate was
reduced to 11.52 as of January 1, 1987, and to 82 as of March 16, 1987,
with government compensating NACF for incurred losses.   After project
completion, government announced that all outstanding loans could be put in
grace for five years with ensuing 7-year repayment regardless of its
original terms. Again, government coumitted itself to compensate NACF for
incurred losses due to that. However, farmers would need to apply for this
loan extension and, eventually, 611 of subloans made under the project was
applied for. This new development may erode the high repayment discipline
of MACF borrowers and threaten NACF's financial viability in the future.
NACF had 10.61 of its Fourth Project loans in arrears, but this was of no
corcern at this point of time; NACF's financial position is very sound.
Only 41 of all loans outstanding made under the four projects were in
arrears by December 31, 1987. At the same time, NACF's total outstanding
loan portfolio was about US$7.5 billion equivalent; US$60 million loans
were delinquent, less than one percentage point. However, the independent
auditor reported that government was delinquent to NACF for payments, some
of which for 15 years, totalling about US$1.7 billion equivalent. This is
of some concern.
1/ In 1989 NACF has had to reduce lending by 252 due to scarcity of long
term funds.



- vi 
Sustainab.litv
Sustainability of farm investments look robust, provided Korea's
economy continues generating high consumer demand for fruits and
vegetables. NACF has developed into a technically highly competent
institution, hence its institutional health depends on government's
agricultural policy, including its interest rate policy.
Findinfts and Lessons
a) NACF strengthened under the project and benefited from its
association with the Bank which it holds in high regard.
b) SiAce NACF had to carry the FE risk for this Bank Loan, it has
so far refrained from seeking a follow-on Loan. This is because government
dictetes an interest rate to farmers below market rates, without
compensating NACF fully for its losses due to such policy.
c) Small farm greenhouse investments proved to be highly
profitable investments for small farmers.
d) NACF managed its affairs conservatively and lacked enthusiasm
for non-farm investment fianmcing. Therefoire, investments foreseen (302 of
project exp'cted) like handicrafts, weaving, machinery repair shops, inland
fisheries, tourism facilities, and wood and metal workshops were not
financed. This is regrettable.

Preface
This report presents the result of execution of the Project, its cost and
benefit derived from it, in accordance with section 2.10 of the Project
Agreement.
The report has been prepared by the Technical Unit (TU) of the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) for the achievement and evaluation
results of the Project for which the World Bank provided US$ 25 million
equivalent  W 21,467 million to the Government of Korea under the Loan Number
of 2549-KO, signed on June 25, 1985.
The Project was carried out successfully by the Technical Unit of NACF, under
the Project Agreement between IBRD and NACF dated June 25, 1985.
The information and data have been collected and obtained from two categories
by TU : one from a survey of farm fields for which TU had made many field visits
and one from periodic reports by the loan appraisal officers of the Froject
Participating County Offices of NACF.
This report is the Project Completion Report as well as the Project Evaluation
Report.
On this opportunity, we wish to express our deep gratitude to the Bank for the
cooperation and kind advice by specialists concerned for the successful
completion of the Project.

B. Project objectives
2.02          The objectives were to finance NACF subloans to farmers and its
member cooperatives so that it would contribute to increasing the fanm productivity,
creating off-season employment, and thus help to expand rural income.
Th. implementing period, overlapped in part with Korea's Sixth Five-Year
Socioeconomic Development Plan (1987 - 1991)
The important strategic points of the Government's Agricultural Development Plan in
the Five-Year Plan are :
1. To adjust the agricultural production system for steady supply of food grains
for nation.
2. To improve the agricultural structure for expansion of agrlcultural productivity.
3. To maintain prices and balance supply for demand of agricultural products.
4. To develop agro-industrial districts in the country so as to improve rural income.
5. To assist young farmers
6. To activate the rural economy and develop rural potential through improved
supporting systems such as financing and bether tax system.
2.03         The target of agro-economic growth during the new Five-Year Plan is
2.4% growth on the average annually, and increase farm income by 7.5% on the average
annually.
To support the Socioeconomic Development Plan, NACF provides medium and long term
investment credit for farmers to increase farm production . In a word, the
objectives of the Project matched very well with government's Five-Year Plan of
Korea in every sector.
-7-



C. Project Description
2.04          Under the Project NACF assisted in :
1. Promoting agricultural development through private investments, covering
wide range of agricultural production and marketing activities : and
2. Strengthening farmers' financial capabilities.
2.05          The Project consisted of the following parts
1. NACF subloans to farmers for their private investments in :
A. Agricultural production facilities.
B. Farm machinery and equipments.
C. Marketing and storage facilities.
D. Input manufacturing and supply.
E. Agroprocessing facilities and other rural business
opportunities to expand off-farm income sources.
2. Measures to improve NACF's profitability and resource mobilization.
During the Project, NACF financed farmers for their farm business investments
such as above mentioned category A,B,C, and E, except D.
As to the part D, no farmers wished to invest their money in this part during
Project period.
TU devided investment items of each subproject into two parts, that is, fundamental
items and additional items.
The difference between fundamental items and additional items is :
A. Fundamental item      items that are important and necessary
for the subprojects basically.
B. Additional item  : items that are not neccessary absolutely
but conveniont if farmer have one.
-8-



2.06     The actual percentage of each subproject
was as follows :

C. Implementation Guideline
3.06          Guidelines for lending and ijplementation.of
the Project were formulated annually by TV for the purpose of effective
implementation and fund management. In 1985, the beginning year of the
Project, Tu recammended basic directions on sane important policy and
institutional matters and got the approval of NACF management and MAFF.
The major directions were as follows :
(a) The interest rate charged to subborrowers was 12% p.a. at the start-
ing point. But the interest rate was changed as follows
Starting             : 12%
From JAN. 1, 1987 : 11.5%
Fran MAR. 16, 1987  :  8.0%
NACF reduced the interest rate under projects from the previous 11.5% to 8%
p.a. as of March 16, 1987, in accordance with Government policy.
Government ccmpensated NACF for 3.5% interest gap.
(b) TU was responsible for the selection of new subprojects,
(c) Under the First and the second Project, participating cooperatives
selected the subborrowers within the allocatdd-,mount..fo1 each subproject
in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). But underthe Third and the Foaith
Project, TU gave COs a package ceiling as much as possible without sub-
allocation by subptojects.
(d) The minimum financial rate of return to the subproject should be
over 10%

(e) Uhder the Project,the methc9s and procedures of appraisal on farmer's
loan applications and supervision of subloans were adjusted to the increased
volume of subloans and diversities of subprojects. The main adjumstments
were as follows :
1) For the patternized subprojects, individual financial analysis was
not required, LAD assumed the same rate of return to all similar subprojects
and applied the same period of repayment to all subloans as the patternized
standard farm models developed by TU or regionally developed by LAO. But LAD
took responsibility to appraise all the investment plans and subloan amounts
o an individual basis even under the patternized-analysis .system.
2)  The individita-l analysis was required for the applications for the
non-patternized subprojects
3) LAO assessed the applicant's credit worthines. according to the
methods and prcedures generally applied in NACF credit operations.
(f)  The amount  of a subloan was limited to not exceeding 70% of investment
cost.
D. Training and education activities.
3.07          Ton6ar the Fburth Project, TU provided a series of training
program for LAOs every year.             During the period of 1985-1987,
total participanting LAOs of participating county branch offices were 319
persons - 95 in 1985, 113 in 1986, 111 in 1987. The contents of the training
included i) each years project implementation plan and loan regulations
ii) project implementation guidelines by subprojects ; and iii) loan appraisal
criteria and methods which enhanced LAO's ability and enabled them to
implement the Project in good order.
3.08         During the same period, NACF provided farmers with up-to-date
farming technology for cash crops such as greenhouse, mushroaus, floral farming,
fruits, livestock, medicinal herbs etc. under the Farming Technique Assistance
Program. Many of these cash crops are the same kinds of subprojects under the
Fourth Project.
-22-



These training courses, called the New Farmers Technical College, have been
contributing to the rapid diffusion of high farming. technology and the enhance-
ment of farm income The participants by courses during the Project period were

E.  Project Monitoring
3.09       Mboitoring is the 'provision of information and the use of infor-
mation, to enable management group to assess 'progress of implementation and
to take timely decisions to ensura that progress keeps according to schedule.
For this purpose, during the Project implementation period, TU collected
necessary reports on project implementation progress as follows :
-23-



TU  collected :
1) Annual survey report on farmers' loan demand to know how may farmers want
what kinds of investments (subproject) and to gather information for preparing
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and discuss the PIP with MAFF, and t1a Bank
if necessary.
2) Semimonthly reports on the Project progress to know number and amount of
loans made and to apply to the Bank for withdrawal of the Bank loan.
This report was collected by NACF's on-line(EDPS) system.
3) Monthly reports on progress of the Projects under Foreign Loan Office of
NACF from COs, which mentioned all kinds of Projects by foreign loan including
Project by the Bank Loan.
3.10          To achieve the purpose of efficient Project implementation
of Project participating COs and technical extension services for individual
fanmers, TU members visited 1,212 farms and a total of 130 participating COs of
NACF to check their progress, TU also held regional seminars on farming
technique during Project implemntation period as follwos

3.11         The proper provision of extension services was an essential
element in ensuring reasonable investments and operation on the farm, But
county offices did not have, in general, an extension worker for technical
services for farming. The technical and extension services to farmers in
Korea are under the responsibility of the Office of Rural Development
(CRD) Korea. However,special coops.and a limitted number of primary
coops      provide their nember farmers with more intensive extension
support in horticulture and a certain kind of farming work, using their
own specialist staff member. Even though county offices had not their own
staff-member for technical servies, they were requested to help farmers
through proper extension services with a budget that was earmarked annually
for the extension services for participating farmers.

-- The financing plan provides for a Bank loan of USS 25 million, amounting to 45% of Project costs equivalent to W 20,000 million
estimated by average foreign exchange rate (USS1= w 799), but actual disbursed amount reached W 21,467 million by each actual
foreign exchange rates (US$= W859 in average)   and this extra amount made NACF can afford more financing for famers eventually.
On the other hand, GoR lent NACF W15,437 million while Subborrowers contributed W21,030 million for the Project. All these
made it possible that NAaF loan more mony for farmers. And so tlhw total cost was oerrun.

IV Project result and evaluation
A. Information collecting system
4.01        For collecting available information on the Project result to
evaluate Project performanceju decided to use a sample survey method and
reports submitted by LAOs of county offices of NACF.
According to the data collected fran reports by county offices of NACF,TU cal-
culated and analysed the volume of input and output of the Project result.
And in order to get actual Project effect, TU calculated and analysed the data
collected by sample survey method.
Sample survey method
4.02         In consideration of the available manpower and cost, TU decided
to use sample survey method like the post evaluation report of the
Third Agricultural Credit Project previously submitted to the Bank by TU.
For sampling, TI selected number of sampling farms first,to survey in orde:
to evaluate the actual effect of the subprojects and then divided the whole
fixed number of sampling farms into two parts, one is the part where TU visited
every farm directly to collect information, the other is the part where TU
collected information by questionnaire which were sent to farmers by mail
and vice versa. The number of sampling farms were settled by the statistical
sampling method that used as a fonrula for the sample survey in the pre-
vious evaluation report of the Third Agricultural Credit Project 1974-KO.
The formula is .
N
n =
1 + N ( gD 2
N     Total farm households (total number of subborrowers)
n  : number of sampling farms
K  : 2 (constant when the credit worthiness rate represents 95%)
D     0.05 (relative discrepancy)
C  : 0.26 (variable coefficient)

D. Financial and economic analysis.
4.07          TU calculated financial rates of return(FRR) of each subproject
to measure the financial viabilities of farm investments in 1987.
And also economic rates of return (ERR) of subprojects were calculated by
adjusting financial prices to economic values.
In adjusting financial prices to economic values, TU used the standard conversion
factors calculated according to the procedures of appropriate adjustments for
shadow price of foreign exchange, opportunity cost, taxes and subtidies.
The results of analysis on the subproject are as follows :

V. The performance of the parties concerned
5.01         NACF has been able to implement the Project successfully thanks
to its long term experience, its member farmers' aggressive efforts
forward the establishment of high income and welfare villages and especially
the faithful performance of duties by all three parties - NACF, the government
of Korea and the Bank - as follows
A.  NACF
5.02          Semiannual Progress Report: In accordance with the provision
-of section 2.07(b) of the Project Agreement, NACF regularly furnished to
the Bank the report at semiannual intervals covering the progress of
Project implementation, activities of T.U., Project implementation plan,
the operational news of NACF and all the other information in detail.
5.03         Maintenance of Technical Unit (TU) : Established under the
First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan no. 335 KO), the Technical Unit
has been maintained under the structure of NACF and will be maintained
even after the IBRD Loan has been fully disbursed.
5.04         Audit Report : Pursuant to section 4.02 of the Project Agree-
ment, NMACF has its accounts and financial statements and the Special
Account audited by independent auditors three times for the fiscal year
1985 , 1986, 1987. Each time, the audit reports on the statements of
Project account and financial statements and supplementary information
have been furnished to. the Bank within the required time limit.
-48-



5.05     The measures for inproving financial condition : NACF were to implemnt the
measures for improving its financial condition in accordance with Section 4.03 of
the Project Agreement. However,-the main reason for financial losses in 1982 and
1983 was that the government had reduced interest rates on loans and deposits but
the reduced rates applied to all outstanding loans and only to new deposits. These
negative spread on lendipg had been gradually solved according to the flow of time
acdNACF's financial condition had been improved as follows without special measures

Sources : Audit report by the independent auditors
B. The government of Korea
5.06          The support for NACF's financial condition : Pursuant to
section 3.04 of Loan Agreement and section 4.03 of Project Agreement, the
borrower, in consultation with NACF, informed the Bank, on December 26,
1986, that the financial condition of NACF had been iniproved signifi-
cantly in its recent history, so further government support for NACF was
unnecessary at this time. The Bank accepted, on February 13, 1987, that
proposal on the condition that should there be an adverse change in NACF's
financial condition, the Government would carry out a comprehensive review
and discuss appropriate measures with the Bank. As there has been no ad-
verse change since that time, additional government support for NACF has
not been necessary by now.
5.07     The measures against the foreign exchange risk of the Loan : The government
provided NACF with 21.9 billion Won for the purpose of protectiong NACF and sub-borr
owers against the foreign exchange risk of the Loan in accordance with Schedule 4 of
the Loan Agreement.
-49-



5.08      The cleartnce of the foreign exchange risk of the Loan : The foreign ex-
change risk has been cleared semiannually(June 15, December 15) by the interest
accrued from the above mentioned government fund - 21.9 billion Won. The amount of
the foreign exchange risk of the Loan incurred and cleared by year is 156 million
Won in 1986, 183 million Worn in 1987 and 186 million Won in 1988 Cas of june 15)
respectively.
5.09      As reported through our first semi-annual Progress report in 1987, the
government took comprehensive measures on the rural community's debt problem as of
March 16, 1987  in which the interest rate of the subloans to farmers under the IBRD
Loan of    NACF has been reduced to 8% per annum. The losses to NACF incurred in
1987 due to this measures amounted to 2,315 million Won, all of which has already
been campensated by the government in 1988. The losses to NACF incurred every year
in the future will be coapensated every next year by the government.
5.10      The government also took the additional measures as of December 9, 1987,
in which the sub-borrowers under the IBRD Loan of NACF have been allowed to repay
their loans in installments over a period of seven years after a five-year grace
period. According to this additional measures, NACF had received the sub-borrowers'
application of a five-year grace period and a seven-year repayment by September 30,
1988 and thereby 22, 602 million Won, 61% of the total subloans, was asked to be
post poned by 12, 013 subborrowers in the end.
In Response to those measures, the government allowed NACF to repay the government
fund in installment over a period of seven years after a five-year grace period in
the same condition as subloans.

C. The World Bank
75.11         A wide range of assistance and cooperation between the Bank
and NACF has been made during the Project implementation period. Further-
more, the Bank sent mission to NACF four times during the implementatlon
period of the Project and wide exchange of views and extensive discussions
took place in amicable atmosphere.
5.12          The first mission, Mr. Deshpande and Mr. Earwaker, visisted
NACF fran October 16 to October 18, 1985 to supervise the implementation
of the Project. They reviewed the survey of subloan demand, a Project
familiarization program for Loan Appraisal Officers and detailed guide-
lines on subloan appraisal etc. and were satisfied with those preparation.
The mission were much, interested in the proposed governm. - loan to caop-
ensate NACF for the estimated foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan and
enphasized Korean government should, in consultation with NACF,carry out
a csoprehensive review of MACF's financial condition and propose measures
to improve its financial performance according to Loan Agreement.
.5.13          The second mission, Mr. Earwaker, visited Korea from June 23,
to July 5, 1986. He discussed with TU staff the matte'rs arising fran the
Project including estimated disbursements of loan and government loan.
We had also talked about the possibility of the new loan for the new
agricultural project.
5.14          The third mission, Ms. Hill, visited RUCF fran Decenber 4
to December 12, 1986, to supervise the implementation of the Project.
The mission evaluated that Project implementation was going well and NACF's
financial condition continued to improve. We also discussed the reduction
of interest rate fran 12% to 11.5 % per annum
-51-



5.15          The fourth mission, Mr. Berg, visited NTCF  frcim Novenber
19. to November 29, 1987, to supervise the Project implementation. The
mission discussed with T.U, staff on various matters arising from the
Project and performed a widespread field trip to look into the progress
of the Project in the field. After supervising the Project progress, the
hi
mission was fully satisfied with the performance in managing the Preject.
He also discussed with EPB, MOF, ?AFF, KREI etc. to prepare new project
on the agriculture and rural development. It was proposed that IBRD would
provide assistance in preparing and formulating i) a comprehensive 4-5
year rural development project ii) appropriate investme,nt policies
iii) feasibility studies and a financing plan and iv) a medium term
policy and development plan for further investments.

VI. Recovery Of Loan From Beneficiaries
6.01         The objective of this chapter is to describe how much amortized
loans from beneficial farmers could not repay is and compare the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th loan and revolving fund each other. We,the NACF, have calculate the
delinquent loan ratio by way of getting divided the total balance by the
delinquent loan. But.the Bank wanted us to calculate it by being divided
the due loan by the delinquent loan and we admit it as reasonable in order
to compute the loan fallen due which sub-borrowers cou'd not repay during
the year.
6.02         As shown in 6.03 chart, the delinquent ratio of the 4th loan,
3.6%,is lower than that of the lst,2nd,3rd loan and revolving:.fund,31.9%,
47.6%,10.6%,5.6%, respectively. The reason why the amortized loan is much is
because the sub-loan from beneficiaries was amortized prematurely. The
reason why the lst,2nd,3rd loan's delinquent ratio is higher than the 4th
and due payrent of those is more than that of the 4th project. High delinquent
ratio of the lst,2nd loan is attributed to the much delinquent loan before
1986. Even though apprehending the high delinquent ratio of the 4th loan with
the lapse of;time as much as other loans, because financial ststus of farmers
has been much improved, we anticipate the amortizing wishfully.

VII. overall assessment
7.01         In consideration of the experience under the previous
agricultural credit Projects,it was expected that the Bank Loan would
be disbursed by the end of June,1989.
According to the estimated disbursement schedule of the Staff Appraisal
Report of the World Bank , disbursement of the Bank Loan should be
carried out by the 2nd semester of 1989, and The Loan Agreement pro-
vided that the Loan disbursement closing date should be March 31,1989.
However the Project have been performed favorably and completed earlier
than expected completion date. NACF thinks this residtee fL.n the
Bank's assistance,the help of Government and NACF's exp -iences
of previous Bank-assisted Projects.
7.02         NACF subloaned to farmers and primary cooperatives
for their investments in agricultural production facilities,farm
machinery and-equipFent,storage facilities and other rural busi-
ness opportunities to expand off-farm income sources. On the other
hand there were various lacking for agro-business such as input
manufacturing and supply,and agro-processing facilities because
there was no farmer who wished to do such a venturous unknown
agro-business.It seems that farmers' most favorite business is
greenhouse development which was also very popular in the three
previous Projects.And NACF also thinks that small farmers or un-
experienced primary coops would not want to try input manufacturing
and supply business or invest in agro-processing facilities.
7.03         The lending procedure and the way county  coop select
subprojects are the same as they were in the previous Third Agri-
cultural Credit Projects. The subloan appraisal for investment
projects have been carried out by LAOs in the same way as the
previous Third Project. That is, WAOs surveyed and appraised every
-55-



investment project according to the representative models of 35
subprojects prepared by TU, In representative models, TIU divided
project investment items into two parts, one is fundamental
items that are necessary for the subproject essentially and the
other is additional items that are convenient for the subproject
but not essential.
7.04         For the type of investment models different fram
the representative models,TU prepared LAO send that model to TU
for approval. After appraising the technical feasibilities and
financial validity of the model substantially,TU informed LAO
the appraisal result. Finally LAO financed the subproject or not
by the result from TU.
7.05         During the implementation period  of the Project.
125 county offices (90%) among 139 offices participated the Project
and many primary cooperatives were involved in the Project as
would-be cooperative offices which recommended farmers for the
subprojects and check the progress of each investment and pay-
ment of the subloan to subborrowers according to the progress,
collect the interest of subloans and provided technical gui-
dance. For these cooperation county offices often payed one
percent of interest received from subborrowers in the respective
region to primary coops concerned to cover their cost.
7.06         Nowadays we Koreans have plenty of vegetables on
our tables at mealtime notwithstanding the season due to the
Bank's help which enabled farmers to build sufficient greenhouses
that grow every necessary vegetable for Koreans. Financed by the Bank,
greenhouse subprojects as well as other subprojects have diversified
rural income sources up to the present and they will continue in
the future.

VIII.   Lessons learnt
8.01         Under the Project, the beneficiary farmers had two access
way to the fanming technique guidance. One was through organized
seminars for participated beneficiary farmers directly by PCOs,and the
other was through the use of guidance" channels held by NACF whichl
was extended to all farmers through "The New Farmers Technique College.
Now and then, TU discovered some cases which participating farmers
could not reach the full-fledged management level because of inade-
quate farming techniques and information.
Afterwards the guidance program should be enlarged,especially through
field seminars organized by PCOs and their cooperation agencies
such as primary cooperatives and local governments,which has been
assessed as a very efficient guidance system for the maximization
of the Project effect.
8.02         Actually,TU could not find a chance to finance farmers
who work for marketing facilities or input manufacturing and supply
fields. So,next time, TU should make efforts to find way to help
farmers who work in these fields and make many member cooperatives
to participate in the future projects too.
8.03         TU also made efforts to spread the Bank'4 advanced loan
appraisal techniques " The Financial Analysis of Agricultural Project
over 15 years.
We have learned that staff of NACF is interested in this advanced
technique developed by the Bank.
And in the near future, we believe, this advanced loan appraisal
terlnique would be a regular subject for farmers and staff of coops
in the training .institutes of NACF.

REVIEWING THE DRAFT REPORT SENT TO US, I UOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON
IT AS FOLLOWS:

21.9 BILLION WON FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING NACF AGAINST THE
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF THE LOAN AND ALSO THIS FUND HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROJECT VOLUME EVENTUALLY.
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK HAS BEEN FULLY CLEARED BY THE INTEREST
GAP ACCRUED FROM THE GOVERNMENT FUND UHICH HAD BEEN FINANCED TO
FARMERS. (REF. NACF PCRVB PAGE 49-50)
ACCORDINGLY, LINE 11-13 ON PAGE VI IN YOUR EVALUATION SUMMARY
UDIJLD BE REVISED IN DUE EXPPESSION.
BB) THE FCREIGN EXCHANGE RISK IS NOT THE ONLY BLOCK TO A FOLLOW-ON
EvalatonLOAN.
3na;uatlon        IN ADDITION TO THE FE RISK FOR THE LOAN, THERE COULD BE SUCH
Sary         EASONS NOT TO PROCEED A FOLLOW-ON LOAN AS A SLIGHT GAP BETUEEN
8PCT INTEREST RATE OF SUBLOANS AND S3ME 7.7PCT INTEREST RATE OF
THE LOAN, THE NECESSITY OF INFLATION CONTROL AND THE
POSSIBILITIES OF MOBILIZATION OF DOMESTIC CAPITAL UNDER THE
RECENT BLANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS IN BLACK ETC.
IN THIS CONNECTION, FINDINGS AND LESSIONS B)ON PAGE VII IN YOUR
