F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The original Program Development Objective (PDO) was to address vulnerability by protecting
the poor and supporting greater human capital development, while improving competitiveness by
alleviating a selected set of private sector and governance constraints. The DPO series supported
the government’s reform program under two pillars:

       Address vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital
        development to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not unduly affected by the global
        crisis and to improve the quality of labor resources in the long-term by strengthening the
        effectiveness and efficiency of social nets, improving the overall quality and management
        of higher education and enhancing the preschool system, and providing more affordable
        health services by reforming health financing and expanding service delivery by
        strengthening non-communicable disease interventions.
       Strengthen competitiveness for sustained post-crisis growth by providing a more
        favorable private sector environment and strengthening governance to remove regulatory
        barriers to enterprise start-up and operations and strengthen competitiveness and
        efficiency through private sector-led growth by improving the business environment,
        strengthening the regulatory environment in infrastructure, promoting sustainable use of
        energy and improving public sector efficiency.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
In the course of the DPO series, the program development objectives did not change. Some
adjustments were however made within the pillars in view of emerging fiscal pressures and some
reforms getting subsumed under other projects.

       DPO1 supported reforms in the following policy areas: social protection, education and
        health under the first pillar and private sector development, public financial management
        and public sector management under the second pillar.
       The policy areas under DPO2 remained the same. However, under education, instead of
        dealing with the preschool education system as a whole, the government decided to focus
        only on a specific component of it because of fiscal pressures. In addition, under public
        financial management, greater specificity and clarity was introduced to tax and customs
        administration in view of fiscal pressures and an ambitious initial agenda under customs
        which envisaged a fully functioning ‘green channel’ in DPO2.




                                               vii
       In DPO3, the policy areas did not change. However, there were some additions, deletions
        and modifications within some of the policy areas to provide greater clarity to the triggers
        and streamline and consolidate the operation which was thinly spread out in several areas.
        Most of the changes were under private sector development and public financial
        management.

To reflect changes within the policy areas of the DPO series, the key outcome indicators were
changed.

1.   Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The main purpose of the Armenia Development Policy Operation (DPO) series was
to provide support to the government in the context of the global financial crisis and to
strengthen competitiveness for rapid growth in the post-crisis period. With a newly formed
government under President Serzh Sargsyan, Armenia launched its second-generation reforms in
2008 to strengthen global competitiveness. However, due to the global financial crisis, the
economy contracted by 14 percent in 2009. This negatively impacted revenues and the
government faced the specter of a 20 percent across the board cut in expenditures. The crisis also
brought to the fore the binding constraints to growth which included weak conditions for fair
competition, high administrative and regulatory costs to firms, insufficient and low quality
infrastructure and under-investment in human capital. The DPO series was initiated against this
backdrop to help the government tide over the crisis and as part of a longer term engagement on
growth and competitiveness.
2.       When the first operation (DPO1) was appraised in May 2009, Armenia was reeling
under the impact of the global economic crisis. There was output contraction and a current
account deficit in excess of 11 percent of GDP in 2008. The peg to the dollar was abandoned in
March 2009 resulting in a 20 percent devaluation of the dram. However, the financial system was
well capitalized, the fiscal deficit was low at 1.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and public and publicly
guaranteed debt was also low at 17.8 percent of GDP. The government confronted a challenging
reform agenda related to the need to protect social expenditures in the face of declining revenues
and spur growth by focusing on infrastructure development and alleviation of private sector and
governance constraints. In this context, DPO1 focused on protecting the poor and laying the
groundwork for strengthening competitiveness. This included measures to increase funding for
social safety nets, strengthening of the financial sector, reduction in costs of business registration,
improved public financial management and enhanced public sector efficiency.
3.        By the time the second operation was appraised in October 2010, a fragile recovery
was underway with growth of 2.8 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 but Armenia
still confronted difficult social and economic realities. Nearly 40 percent of households
suffered from lost or reduced wages, farm income and remittances. The incidence of poverty rose.
The crisis impact also revealed the urgency of improving competitiveness, especially in the
tradable sectors. In addition, lower revenues because of the economic downturn coupled with
fiscal stimulus spending led to a widening of the fiscal deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and
to an increase in government debt to 40.2 percent. With economic recovery, medium-term fiscal
consolidation was required while safeguarding crucial social and infrastructure programs. Thus,
DPO2 continued support for government measures to maintain social spending and strengthen
competitiveness to revitalize growth prospects. The operation supported greater human capital
development, formulation of a new mining code, modernization of telecommunications, and
improvements in tax and customs compliance.
4.       When the third operation was appraised in December 2011, recovery was underway
and growth was expected at 4.6 percent during the year. However, the recovery remained
fragile in the context of Armenia’s vulnerability to the Eurozone crisis, with trade, remittances
and FDI inflows serving as the main channels for transmitting turbulence. Some progress was
made on fiscal consolidation with the deficit declining from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to
4 percent in 2011. However, this was achieved by reducing expenditures with limited
improvements in revenue collection. Both poverty and inequality also increased significantly in
the wake of the crisis. Consequently, DPO3 continued supporting the reform program under the



                                                  1
two broad pillars of enhancing social and human capital expenditures and improving conditions
for post-crisis growth and recovery. In particular, it built on the approved pieces of legislation
including the Mining Code, Competition Law and Law on Public Service.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     The original Program Development Objective (PDO) was to address vulnerability
by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital development, while improving
competitiveness by alleviating a selected set of private sector and governance constraints.
The DPO series supported the government’s reform program under two pillars:

        (i)    Address vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital
               development to ensure that the poor are not unduly affected by the global crisis and
               to improve the quality of labor resources in the long-term. This would be enabled
               by strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of social nets, improving the
               quality and management of higher education and enhancing the preschool system,
               and providing more affordable health services by reforming health financing and
               expanding service delivery.
        (ii)   Strengthen competitiveness for sustained post-crisis growth by providing a more
               favorable private sector environment and strengthening governance. This would be
               achieved by improving the business environment, strengthening the regulatory
               environment in infrastructure, promoting sustainable use of energy and enhancing
               public sector efficiency.
The main outcome indicators focused on:
Address vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital
development
        (i)   Share of social protection and pensions in total spending increased to 27.2 percent
              in 2011 from 26.2 percent in 2008.
        (ii) Coverage of the poor by the Family Benefits (FB) program increased to 50 percent
              in 2011 compared with 34 percent in 2007.

        (xviii) 10 percent of civil servants compensated according to performance-based criteria
                by end-2011 from zero in 2008.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

6.      In the course of the DPO series, the program development objectives did not change
though some adjustments were made within the two pillars. The overarching PDO for all
three operations was to address vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human
capital development, while improving competitiveness by alleviating a selected set of private
sector and governance constraints. The two pillars also remained relevant through the three
operations, although some adjustments were made within the pillars in view of emerging fiscal
pressures and some reforms getting subsumed under other projects.
    (i) The DPO series supported reforms in the following policy areas: social protection,
          education and health under the first pillar and private sector development, public
          financial management and public sector management under the second pillar.
    (ii) The policy areas under DPO2 remained the same. However, under education, instead of
          dealing with the preschool education system as a whole, the government decided to focus
          only on a specific component of it because of fiscal pressures. In addition, under public
          financial management, greater specificity and clarity was introduced to tax and customs
          administration in view of fiscal pressures and an ambitious initial agenda under customs
          which` envisaged a fully functioning ‘green channel’ in DPO2.
    (iii) In DPO3, the policy areas did not change. However, there were some additions, deletions
          and modifications within some of the policy areas to provide greater clarity to the triggers
          and streamline and consolidate the operation which was thinly spread out in several areas.
          Most of the changes were under private sector development and public financial
          management.

7.      To reflect changes within the policy areas of the DPO series, the key outcome
indicators were also changed. The final key outcome indicators of the DPO series included the
following:

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

Social Protection
8.       The DPO series supported the government’s objective to protect the poor and
vulnerable through strengthened social safety nets. The global crisis had a sizeable impact on
the poor in Armenia through sharp contractions in growth, employment and remittances.
Increased funding for social safety net programs, including FB and pensions, and improvement in
the functioning of the FB program was intended to ensure that the poor and vulnerable were not
overly affected by the global crisis. Improving the targeting efficiency of the FB program was
also intended to increase budget savings so as to expand coverage of the poor. The DPO series
supported these objectives by increasing or maintaining the shares of social safety nets, pensions
and priority social expenditures in total spending.
Education
9.       Through legislative changes, the DPO series supported the government’s efforts at
improving pre-school and tertiary education. Access to education and quality assurance,
especially at the preschool and tertiary level, are key challenges in the sector. Reforms in these
two sub-sectors are crucial for enhancing pro-poor outcomes and for improving workforce skills.
The DPO series supported these objectives through legislative changes to cover recurrent costs
for the one year school readiness program and state accreditation of tertiary level institutions and
academic programs in the country.
Health
10.      The DPO series enabled changes in the health sector to address the problems of high
out-of pocket payments and high incidence of non-communicable diseases. The high out-of-
pocket payments were essentially the result of low level of government health spending. Reforms
in this sector were intended to further invest in human capital to improve workforce skills. The
DPO series enabled this through the issuance of a decree on non-communicable diseases, a
comprehensive policy for copayments, and the launch of the performance based contracting
system at the primary health care level.
Private Sector Development
11.      The DPO series supported the development of the private sector in an effort to lay
the foundations for strong post-crisis growth. Improving Armenia’s international
competitiveness and deepening domestic competition were key priorities as spelt out in the
government’s sustainable development program. This was needed to lay a strong foundation for
post-crisis growth in a context where medium-term growth was at risk due to the global crisis.
The DPO series supported these objectives through key actions in the financial sector, business
registration and inspections, and a strengthened pro-competition institution. Efforts were also
aimed at improvements in information and communication technology, especially broadband
Internet, infrastructure and sustainable use of energy and natural resources.




                                                 5
Public Financial Management
12.      The DPO series supported the government’s efforts at reducing the administrative
burden on businesses of complying with tax and customs rules. This would contribute towards
an improvement in the overall climate for doing business. The DPO series supported these
objectives through the approval of a Public Finance Management reform strategy, implementation
of e-filing of tax returns and operationalization of a fully-functional ‘green channel’ under
customs.
Public Sector Management
13.     The DPO series supported the government’s efforts at improving transparency in
public service. Prevention of conflict of interest in public service was crucial because of the
business interests of several public sector officials and decision makers. This was again an effort
to improve the business environment by increasing transparency. The DPO series supported this
by approving a Law on Public Service.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

14.    There were no changes to the policy areas across the three operations supported by the
DPO series.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

15.    There were no other significant changes in the design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements and schedule or funding allocations.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

16.      This DPO series was delivered in a timely manner and responded well to
government needs in light of the crisis and thereafter. As the DPO series advanced, the scope
of the second and third operations were streamlined in response to evolving government needs
and constraints. While the number of prior actions for DPO2 remained the same, the scope for
some of them was changed. In addition, for DPO3, the number of prior actions was reduced from
10 to 8. The first operation had eight` prior actions (Table 1 and 2).
17.     There was some variation between the triggers proposed initially and the actual
prior action for subsequent operations. The triggers were adjusted to make the program more
manageable and focused on government priorities in the face of increasing fiscal pressures. The
government continued to advance structural reforms to address mitigation and recovery in the
aftermath of the global crisis.
18.     In the case of DPO2, three changes were made to existing triggers. These included:
        (i)    On education, the government preferred to focus on just a component of preschool
               education instead of the whole in light of fiscal pressures. While this action
               reduced the scope of the original trigger, the sub-component that was chosen was
               deemed to have the largest social payoff.
        (ii)   On tax administration, the original prior action was revised to introduce greater
               specificity and clarity to the measure by decomposing it into specific steps
               identified as essential for full achievement of targets under DPO3. This change



                                                6
              however did not affect program performance. However, the piloting of the data
              processing center was dropped due to fiscal pressures and was to be supported
              through an investment operation.
        (iii) On customs administration, the prior action on the introduction of the ‘green
              channel’ was modified to ensure that all legal pre-conditions were in place for full
              implementation. The prior action on a fully functional green channel was moved
              from DPO2 to DPO3 because it proved to be too ambitious for DPO2 essentially
              due to delays in the procurement of the required software.
19.    For DPO3, five triggers were dropped, three new triggers were introduced and
modifications were made to an additional two triggers. As a result, the total number of triggers
was reduced from 10 to 8.
        (i)   Two triggers were dropped because they were no longer perceived as priorities by
              the government. These included the legislative package detailing a regulatory
              framework for public-private-partnerships (PPP) and implementation of program
              budgeting. The trigger on the social protection management information system
              was dropped because it was being supported by another Bank sponsored project.
              Fiscal pressures deterred the government from going ahead with piloting the
              performance based remuneration system in selected ministries. In addition,
              regulations for enhanced competition in the telecommunications sector were well
              under implementation and therefore the government wanted to focus on another
              area where reforms were needed but not much progress was made.
        (ii) To further improve the business environment, the authorities requested for the
              introduction of two new prior actions: the first was to make the one stop shop for
              business registration fully functional in Yerevan and the second was to submit to
              the National Assembly amendments to the Law on inspections. Another trigger was
              added on the mining sector to make it more attractive for FDI.
        (iii) Under tax administration, it was difficult to operationalize the data processing
              centers due to fiscal pressures. Hence, the data processing centers were to be
              supported through an investment project on tax administration.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Relevant Program Content
20.     The program focused on areas of strategic importance and where the Bank had an
established track record of strong technical capacity. The consolidation and refocusing at the
time of the second operation helped streamline the program and was well justified. Despite the
streamlining, focus on the key policy areas identified earlier was maintained.

Strong Analytical Underpinnings
21.      The design of the DPO series was based on substantive and wide-ranging economic
and sector work. For the first operation, these included the poverty and social assessments
(2006-08), the economic report (2007), and the programmatic PERs conducted between 2005 and
2008 which focused on public expenditure management, infrastructure investments, energy
efficiency and the efficiency of health expenditures and social protection programs. Sectoral
reports and client-driven policy notes (2007-08) were also instrumental. These included reports
on taxes and subsidies in energy, corporate governance reforms, competition policy and conflict
of interest, customs, tax policy and tax administration reforms, public expenditure management
and education sector reforms. These policy notes also informed the preparation of the
government’s own sustainable development program. For the second and third operation, the
program also drew on ongoing analytical work on poverty, results from the Doing Business report
and BEEPS survey and programmatic public expenditure reviews and other fiscal work. This
analytical base was crucial for selecting reform areas to be supported by the DPO series and
informing the design of policy reforms. In addition, several technical assistance efforts were
initiated or completed to inform policy dialog in DPO related areas. The Armenian government
also requested project preparation advance (PPA) for DPO2 which was used to support policy
development and implementation in key areas of the program.

Political Stability and Government Ownership and Partnership
22.     For all the three operations under the DPO series, the same government was in
place and there was political stability. Government ownership was crucial for the success of
reforms, especially in a program which required several legislative changes. Emphasis on reforms
which were critical for the government facilitated political ownership. The DPO series also
effectively responded to the changing needs of the government and was well aligned with the
government’s own development agenda.

Global Economic Crisis
23.      The crisis introduced a sense of urgency for undertaking reforms to support
recovery. This enabled faster implementation of prior actions. Armenia was affected by the
global economic crisis mainly through three channels — trade, remittances and FDI and the
economy contracted by over 14 percent in 2009. The crisis also exposed weaknesses in the policy
and institutional spheres like those in infrastructure provision, regulatory environment, public
financial management, revenue mobilization and economic competitiveness. Had Armenia
capitalized more on its growth dividend of the early 2000s, it could have weathered the effects of
the crisis better.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

24.    Monitoring of the DPO series was based on continuous dialog with government
counterparts to assess progress and address potential bottlenecks. The whole process was


                                               10
very collaborative and flexibility at both ends eased the process. With Bank team members in the
field, monitoring was done on an on-going basis and supported by TA and AAA activities.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

25.     Discussions on the next DPO series are already underway. The new series will span
three operations covering the period 2013-15 and will focus on strengthening competitiveness and
ensuring sustainability for growth and prosperity. The new DPO series will support Armenia’s
growth agenda through inspection reforms, move towards e-governance, civil service reform,
export development, environmental sustainability and reforms in public financial management.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

26.      The DPO’s focus was aligned with the CPS. The CPS for FY09-12 was prepared in the
context of the global economic crisis and its impact on the country. It therefore focused on the
need to mitigate the adverse poverty effects of the crisis and lay the foundations for medium-term
competitiveness and growth. The DPO series was a central instrument of the CPS to continue and
reinforce the policy dialog. The CPS progress report reaffirmed the strategic focus and relevance
of the two pillars. A new CPS is expected to be prepared by September 2013.
27.      The main objective of the DPO series and the pillars were highly relevant to the
government’s own development strategy. The government’s development strategy, the
Sustainable Development Program (SDP) of October 2008, underwent significant change because
of the global crisis and had to be refocused on crisis mitigation and recovery. The unexpectedly
large contraction of the Armenian economy in 2009 put into question the usefulness of continuing
to implement the government’s SDP, originally focused on growth and competitiveness. The
government therefore refocused its efforts at crisis mitigation and growth recovery which were
also reflected in the two pillars of the DPO series. With recovery under way, the government has
resumed long-term policy planning and is finalizing the Armenia Development Strategy (ADS). It
is intended as a more operational document to guide policy decisions in the medium to long term.
The program’s objective is to reduce poverty through sustainable and accelerated economic
growth. Hence, focus on the two broad pillars continues.
28.     The design and implementation arrangements for the DPO were also adequate. The
design was based on prior analytical work while implementation arrangements benefited from
previous experience with Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs).

3.2    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Achievement of Objectives:
Rating: Satisfactory
29.      On overall achievement of objectives, performance of the Armenia DPO series was
satisfactory. The satisfactory rating takes into account the completion of all prior actions for all
the three operations, progress on most of the outcome indicators under the first pillar of social
protection and human capital development and significant progress under the second pillar of
enhancing competitiveness for growth. Majority of the reforms are still in place and some of them
like civil service and mining sector reforms are being advanced in the next DPO series.


                                                11
30.      Government efforts to maintain public spending on social protection and to improve
targeting of safety net programs helped avoid worse social outcomes. In 2009, poverty would
have increased from the actual 34.1 percent to 51.7 percent in the absence of social safety net
transfers. The increase in 2010 would have been to 54.2 percent instead of the actual 35.8 percent.
Hence, poverty was substantially lower than what would have occurred in the absence of public
policy measures. While the amount of financial resources contributed through the DPO series was
only a fraction of the total social spending of the government (annual government spending on
social protection and pensions was about $630 million in 2011 compared with a total amount of
$165 million for the 3 operations under the DPO series), an added benefit was the ability of the
government to get additional donor support because of the program with the Bank.
31.      Armenia’s growth recovery suggests that the government managed to strike the
right balance between crisis management and structural reform. The recovery from the 2009
recession is on track, but at risk from possible renewed instability in the global economy. Real
GDP expanded by 4.7 percent in 2011, and growth reached 7.2 percent in 2012, mainly supported
by the mining sector and agriculture. High prices for base metals have supported growth. Increase
in exports contributed to improving external balances but FDI inflows remained weak, in
particular those from Russia. Fiscal consolidation took place at a faster-than-expected pace. The
fiscal deficit declined to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011, well below the initial target of 4.1 percent.
This was achieved mainly through expenditure compression in areas other than social spending,
(primarily capital expenditures), while tax revenue collections kept up with the targets.
32.     Policy reforms supported by the DPO series have contributed to the government’s
success during 2009-12. In particular they have:
           Contributed to improved social outcomes in the face of economic slowdown
            (maintained social safety net spending (DPO1, DPO2 and DPO3) and improved
            targeting of the FB program (DPO1 and DPO2)).
           Improved the overall business environment (reduced cost of business registration
            (DPO1), revised competition related legislation (DPO2) and made one stop shop
            fully functional (DPO3)).
           Reduced the administrative burden of compliance with tax and customs rules
            (operationalized risk based audits and implemented e-filing of tax returns (DPO3)
            and made the customs green channel fully functional (DPO3)).

Recent Macroeconomic and Fiscal Trends

33.     Economic growth in Armenia rebounded strongly to 7.2 percent in 2012 from
4.7 percent in 2011. The real value of Armenia’s output has now almost reached its pre-crisis
level. Output in most sectors surpassed the 2008 level, and only the construction sector is lagging.
Despite headwinds from the subdued international economic environment, external balances
improved, and inflation remained low (Table 3). However, the 2010-12 economic recovery was
buoyed by high international prices for copper and good weather conditions for agriculture.
During 2012, significant institutional, structural and economic reforms were targeted at
improving the business environment, promoting exports, preparing for the introduction of the
second pillar pension scheme, and improving tax legislation and administration.

34.    Fiscal policy was contractionary in 2012 leading to greater fiscal consolidation than
envisaged. Revenue collections were close to the revised target. However, capital expenditures
were lower because of delays in investment projects. The estimated under-execution of capital
expenditures was 0.8 percent of GDP and this helped reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of
GDP instead of the planned 3.1 percent.

Social Safety Nets

36.     The DPO series supported measures aimed at initially increasing funding for social
safety net programs and later maintaining that expenditure as a share of the total. Other
measures included restoring funding for selected priority programs for the poor in health,
education and agriculture and improving the targeting efficiency of the FB program. The
government has been able to broadly maintain social safety net expenditures at the 2008 level but
could not meet the DPO series target of 27.2 percent of total spending because of emerging fiscal
pressures. However, the government is committed to adhering to its Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) targets on social safety net spending.
37.      Progress has also been made in strengthening the management and monitoring of
social safety net programs to improve targeting efficiency. Cross-checking of data declared by
the families registered in the FB system is underway by comparing them with the data available
in the databases of other ministries. From January 2011 a requirement was introduced to produce
a reference from the state registry of population for determining family composition in order to be
registered under the FB program. Changes to the registration process have led to improved
targeting as a result of which leakage of FB resources reduced to 25.6 percent in 2011 from 28.8
percent in 2007. This was however below the targeted level of 20 percent. Families of deceased
military personnel were removed from the FB program in 2011 and were instead paid from

veteran benefits. If one excluded these families, coverage under the FB program would fall to
33.6 percent.

Education

38.     Armenia continued its efforts at improving human capital by addressing the two
weakest links in the education sector – preschool and tertiary education. In preschool
education, DPO2 supported the adoption of financing mechanisms to cover recurrent costs for the
one year school readiness program for 4.5-5.5 year old children. DPO3 supported efforts aimed at
the accreditation of tertiary level institutions and academic programs.
39.      On preschool education, the objective was primarily to increase the enrolment rate
which had decreased to about 20 percent in the 1990s. As a result, most of the children were
coming to primary schools without any prior preparation or social skills. The law supported by
DPO2 enabled the provision of budget allocations for funding preschool education in rural areas
and small towns. As a result, the enrolment rate increased to 45 percent in 2011 and the target is
to reach 80 percent by 2015. Budget allocations in this area have been sufficient to cover costs,
mainly salary payments. Government spending on preschool education has increased but was a
little under the target of AMD 10.9 billion.
40.     Governance and quality assurance in tertiary education are weak and lead to
pervasive corruption. This affects access to tertiary education as well as the suitability of the
graduates to the requirements of the job market and mobility in other European countries. The
law supported by DPO3 set in motion the process of institutional and program accreditation.
There are 22 public and 40 private universities in Armenia. The accreditation process, which
takes two years, has been completed in five universities so far – three state and two private. The
Armenian National Quality Assurance Agency (ANQA) is taking a lead on this initiative and this
is an on-going exercise.

Health

41.     The DPO series supported reforms in the health sector which aimed to provide
more affordable services to the poor and increase access. There were three important reforms
which included strengthening of efforts aimed at prevention of non-communicable disease (NCD),
launching of the performance based contracting system and introduction of copayments. DPO2
supported the adoption of a protocol on NCD and launched performance-based contracting at the
primary health care level. This was intended to reduce the incidence of NCD and reform health
financing. DPO3 supported the adoption of copayments in an effort to reduce out-of-pocket
spending and increase resource availability for the health care system. Alongside, the government
has also increased health spending from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.7 percent in 2011.
42.     The adoption of the protocol on NCD has resulted in strengthening preventive
interventions in the areas of diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases and oncology. All primary
health care centers have guidelines on the required interventions for screening for these diseases,
including blood tests that are needed. The government is in the process of expanding screening on
NCDs to a nation-wide level and this will be implemented over the next 3-4 years.
43.     The performance based contracting system was initiated in 2010 with health care
centers being evaluated on the basis of 10 indicators. This was increased to 30 in 2013. The
system has increased the reporting requirements of health centers which need to give monthly
updates but the incentives are working well. At the end of the year, those institutions which
perform well on the indicators get additional budget funding which results in a 10-15 percent




                                                15
increase in salaries of health care professionals. Around 60 percent of primary care physicians got
bonuses in 2011 and the number increased to 94 percent in 2012.
44.      The DPO supported the system of copayments which increased government
revenues, salaries of health care professionals and non-budget funding of healthcare
institutions. Copayments of about 50 percent were introduced for emergency and gynecology
programs in 2011 and coverage was expanded to oncology and sexually transmitted diseases in
2012. To avoid the impact of copayments on the poor, some of them (those with a score of 36 in
the FB program, or about 3 percent of the population) were exempted. While the original
outcome indicator could not be calculated, data on the lowest consumption quintile shows that
healthcare utilization by this group largely stagnated between 2008 and 2011. Outpatient
healthcare utilization rate by the lowest quintile was 10.4 percent in 2008 and 10.7 percent in
2011. Inequality in health care utilization in Armenia is the second highest in the ECA region.1
45.      However, introduction of copayments was done under the DPO series without
sufficiently protecting the poor. There was a long-standing policy dialogue around a proposal to
expand the exempt population (e.g., by changing the eligibility score from 36 to 30, which would
have raised the exempt population to about 10%), but ultimately no changes were made. As a
result, some of the poor (with a score between 30 and 36 in the FB program) had to pay their
share of copayments. In order to exempt all the poor from copayments, coverage might be
enhanced to a score of 30 in the FB program under the new DPO series. In addition, one of the
outcome indicators–utilization of health services by the poor–could not be calculated because
neither the government nor the bank team was aware of the baseline definition and calculation.
Hence, the figure could not be replicated for 2011/12.

Pillar II: Strengthen competitiveness for sustained post-crisis growth by providing a more
favorable private sector environment and strengthening governance

Rating: Satisfactory

46.     On the second pillar under the DPO series, performance was satisfactory. The
country made significant improvements in its business climate, adopted a new mining code and
enhanced public financial management. Targets for some of the indicators (Table 4) were not met
but progress was made.

Economic Competitiveness

47.      Strengthening competition, both international and domestic, is an integral part of
the government’s development strategy to support medium-term growth prospects. The
DPO series supported this agenda through various actions in all the 3 operations. DPO1 ensured a
fortified financial sector and reduced costs of business registration. DPO2 enabled revisions to
competition related legislation while DPO3 made the one stop shop for business registry fully
functional and supported amendments to the law on conducting inspections.

48.     In the wake of the crisis, DPO1 sought to strengthen the banking system through
increased surveillance, enhanced reporting requirements and frequent stress tests. In the
current environment, with the crisis behind them and recovery underway, the frequency of these


                                                            17
reporting requirements and stress tests has gone down. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) which
was targeted at 27.5 percent in 2012 was however on the higher side. As the economy recovered
and credit off-take improved, the CAR decreased. Credit growth was 40 percent in 2012 and the
CAR was 17.4 percent in October 2012 which was close to the central bank targeted level of
17 percent. In addition, increased loan-loss provisioning and higher risk weights were imposed on
foreign exchange loans to stem the rapid pace of dollarization in the economy.
49.     The revisions to competition related legislation under DPO2 strengthened the
autonomy and enforcement capacity of the State Commission for Protection of Economic
Competition (SCPEC). Fines for anti-competitive practices were increased and capacity
building and outreach efforts are underway for journalists, businesses and civil society
organizations. However there are some outstanding issues in terms of the powers of SCPEC to
carry out full-fledged inspections, technical capacity of the staff and inadequacy of resources
allocated to the agency.
50.      Over the course of the DPO series, the government made improvements in the
regulatory environment for businesses. DPO1 enabled the removal of minimum capital
requirement, seal requirement and charter approval while DPO3 operationalized the one-stop-
shop for business registry. All companies registered through the one-stop-shop in 2012. As a
result, Armenia’s ranking on ‘starting a business’ improved. DPO3 also supported amendments to
the law on inspections, the implementation of which has not been very successful. There has been
significant opposition to the implementation of risk-based inspections by the 18 inspection
agencies. Development of the risk criteria requires an extensive database and methodology and is
different for each inspection agency. Checklists are currently under preparation and the
frontrunner in risk based audits has been the tax agency where the system has been implemented.

Information and Communication Technology

51.     DPO2 supported improvements in the regulatory environment and infrastructure
provision in the area of broadband internet access. This increased competitiveness in the
sector with significant gains for the end-users. New wireless broadband service providers used
more advanced technologies and expanded coverage, resulting in a significant reduction in costs.
The coverage of broadband has increased to 98 percent of the population who can potentially
have access. Subscriptions have increased to nearly 13 per 100 inhabitants and the cost of internet
access for 1 Mbps has come down from US$98 in 2008 to US$10 in 2012.

Mining

52.      The DPO series supported the government’s efforts to change the mining code in an
effort to improve competitiveness in the sector. The second and third DPO helped develop and
approve the new mining code which provided for appropriate licensing and fiscal, environmental
and social regimes. Most of the legwork in terms of developing and drafting the mining code was
done under DPO2 with significant TA from the Bank while the approval took place under DPO3.
The simplification and clarification of processes resulted in an increase in the number of new
exploration licenses issued. The mining department is however facing an uphill task
implementing the new code which requires supporting secondary legislations, capacity building
for implementation and training within the government and for key stakeholders. 60 supporting
legislations have already been adopted and around 10 more are in the pipeline. The government
needs additional TA and financial resources for implementation of the new code. It has run into
problems with some of the provisions of the code or lack thereof. For example, the new mining
code does not address the issue of treatment of existing licenses. In addition, the environmental
impact assessment (EIA) law that was passed was considerably watered down during discussions


                                                18
in Parliament due to which the new DPO series includes triggers to pass a new EIA law and
operationalize a one-stop shop for mining licenses in line with environmental and social
guidelines. It also seeks to amend the law on waste to reflect provisions in the new EIA law.

Public Financial Management

53.      The DPO series supported measures aimed at reducing the administrative burden of
tax and customs compliance and better public financial management. DPO1 supported
reforms in the State Revenue Committee (SRC) and preparation and publishing of the PEFA.
DPO2 furthered SRC reforms and supported streamlining of tax registration procedures,
development of risk based audit and amendments to procedures on the review of high risk tax
refunds. It also enabled legislative approval for the improved functioning of the customs green
channel and the Public Finance Management Reform Strategy. DPO3 operationalized risk based
audits, e-filing of tax returns, and ensured a fully functioning customs green channel.
54.     Reforms in the SRC, while slower than envisaged, were satisfactory. Improvements
are underway to increase the efficiency of business processes and simplify tax administration,
improve and harmonize the standard of the tax inspectorates and increase the level of services.
The number of inspectorates has been brought down to 24 currently and there is an effort to
reduce it further. Several processes have been automated and nearly 99 percent of tax returns are
now filed electronically. 11 service centers are in operation in the country out of which seven are
in Yerevan and these centers cater to tax and customs needs of businesses. As a result, there has
been significant improvement in the ease of paying taxes though the total tax rate target could not
be met. The tax compliance cost survey will be undertaken only in 2014 and we do not have any
measure of current performance.
55.      The second and third operation under the DPO enabled a fully functioning green
channel by default in customs. Amendments made to the Customs Code under DPO2 supported
operationalization of the green channel under DPO3. To reduce the interface between trade
operators and customs officers, the government also upgraded the customs Trade World Manager
(TWM) software to allow for on-line submission of customs declarations. Amendments to the
TWM software functionalities facilitated the green channel by default including e-payment and e-
filing applications though e-signature is still not functional. This reduced the time required for
customs formalities thereby improving customs administration. These efforts have resulted in
significant improvement in Armenia’s ranking in ‘trading across borders’ though it fell short of
its targeted ranking by a small margin. Further efforts are intended in the area of improving the
post-release verification process, assessing cost effectiveness of physical inspections and
simplification of border crossing.
56.    Progress continues on the public finance management reform strategy adopted
under DPO2. The government is essentially focusing on moving towards program budgeting and
monitoring and assessment of program performance.

Public Sector Management

57.     The conflict of interest legislation supported by DPO1 was intended to increase
public sector transparency and governance in an effort to improve the business
environment. It was submitted to the National Assembly under DPO1 but was adopted only
when DPO3 was under preparation. It faced stiff opposition from vested interests in public
service and hence took a long time and persuasion to be finally adopted but with modifications. It
limited the scope to 500 top ranking officials and did not specify consequences for failing to
declare. Disclosure of income and assets is now required from the top 500 political officials and



                                                19
their close relatives and is monitored by the ethics committee. Declarations were made by all
these 500 officials in 2012 with the exception of two.

3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
58.      The program development objective set at the time of approval of the first operation
still remains highly relevant. The overall DPO series has achieved satisfactory progress in the
areas targeted. Despite the uncertainties in the global environment, the reform agenda of the
government was not compromised. Some adjustments were made to the scope at the time of the
second operation which were well justified in the face of emerging priorities and constraints. The
program was largely implemented as planned and the foreseen program outcomes were achieved.
59.      Overall, the DPO series has satisfactorily addressed various reforms under the two
pillars. It has supported protection of the poor and greater human capital development. It has also,
to an extent, strengthened competitiveness for sustained post-crisis growth. While the outstanding
reform agenda is still significant, the institutional and policy foundations for future reforms
appear stronger in each of the pillars.

3.4   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     Notwithstanding significant progress during the last decade, poverty reduction will
continue to be one of the most important goals for Armenia in the medium term. The poor
and vulnerable rely heavily on government transfer programs. Public transfers account for
60 percent of the income of the extreme poor either in the form of pensions or FB program. Some
of the gains in poverty reduction over the past few years were reversed as a result of the crisis
with the poverty rate increasing from 27.6 percent in 2008 to 35.8 percent in 2010 despite support
through the DPO series and from other donors.
61.    The DPO series attempted to address the poverty and human capital growth agenda
by supporting the following:
        (i)    Measures aimed at increasing and then maintaining social safety net expenditures
               as a percent of total spending;
        (ii)   Undertaking reforms in health and education to support greater human capital
               development (preschool and tertiary education, NCD interventions, copayments
               and performance based contracting);
        (iii) The government’s policies which addressed crisis mitigation and growth recovery.
              The government also undertook fiscal consolidation which is crucial for a
              sustainable recovery of growth. These efforts will in turn facilitate employment
              creation and poverty reduction over time.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.      Technical assistance activities under the umbrella DPO series have had a more
direct impact on institutional development than the loans per se. The DPO series supported
several reforms aimed at institutional strengthening across the three operations and the two pillars.
The Bank (including IFC) has provided technical assistance in key areas (Table 5), such as social
protection, public financial management (including revenue administration), mining taxation and



                                                20
private sector development. In addition, several Bank investment projects or donor supported
programs are helping with institutional capacity building in key policy areas covered by the DPO.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

63.     The DPO series provided continuity to and strengthened Bank-government
relations in the area of policy based lending. It also helped the government tide over the crisis
through monetary support and technical assistance. The DPO series also laid the groundwork for
the next DPO program and some investment loans in the area of tax administration, health and
education.

3.5    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Economic risks
64.     The impact of the global economic crisis on growth in Armenia was a significant
risk for DPO1 and DPO2 but it moderated during DPO3. The government’s policy responses
to the deteriorating macroeconomic situation proved to be an important mitigating factor. In
addition, the government actively sought donor assistance and intensified macroeconomic
monitoring. In the context of the global crisis, the economic risks were to a large extent beyond
the government’s control. Nearly 50 percent of Armenia’s exports are to the EU and Russia is an
important source of remittances for the country. A worsening in the external environment would
therefore adversely impact trade, remittances and FDI and thereby slow down growth.
Political risks
65.      Throughout the DPO series, political risks were moderate. The key risks arose from
the possibility of opposition (to reforms) by vested interests gaining political support. Program
outcomes could also be undermined if key pieces of legislation were not approved or were
changed substantially during Parliamentary discussions because of business interests of key
politicians. This was essentially mitigated through increased outreach efforts by the government




                                                     21
to gain political support for the reforms. These efforts were targeted at beneficiaries (poor and
middle class), parliamentary commissions and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).
Institutional capacity risks
66.      The risk of insufficient institutional capacity that would impede the reform process
in Armenia was moderate. Reform efforts could be compromised by weak implementation
capacity (particularly at the middle management levels of the civil service) or if the
legislative/regulatory changes were not followed up by proper institutional building in
implementing agencies. Sometimes technical and administrative capacity in some line ministries
was weaker than desirable. Despite this, progress on reforms was sustained. The DPO series
helped to strengthen technical/administrative capacity through analytic and advisory services and
through technical assistance. It also helped bring in other donors who helped the government in
specific areas.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
67.     The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory and was aided
by several factors. These included strong analytical underpinnings, continuous policy dialog and
technical assistance. The work was also well coordinated within the Bank’s multi-sectoral team.
However, the original results framework was quite ambitious and had to be pared down in
subsequent operations. The Bank team nevertheless managed to flexibly adjust the program to
changing government priorities and constraints. As a result, the DPO series was delivered in a
timely manner.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory
68.      Supervision was embedded in the preparation of each DPO and this was the reason
why all prior actions were completed before the operations went to the Board. The
groundwork for subsequent DPOs entailed continuous dialogue with the Government and follow-
up on triggers, which served as the de facto focus of supervision. With team members in the field,
monitoring of progress towards outcome indicators was done on a relatively continuous basis.
The process was supported by various ministries and data was provided by the authorities when
requested. In addition, the dialogue with the government was supported by technical assistance
activities directly or indirectly supported by the DPO series.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
69.      Bank performance both at entry and supervision benefited from the close linkages
with the government’s own priorities. As a result, there was strong ownership of reforms which
limited the scope of delays and deviations. This was complemented with a responsive and flexible
Bank team.




                                               22
5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
70.     The government’s performance was satisfactory and was driven by a sense of
ownership and commitment to the implementation of the reform program. Prior experience
with PRSCs had helped establish the machinery for implementation and monitoring arrangements.
The technical capacity of higher level staff was adequate and key counterparts at the Ministry of
Finance facilitated communication with other ministries and followed up with other units on the
status of triggers and for purposes of monitoring. There was also support from the political
leadership, especially the prime minister, who took active interest in the progress of the DPO
series.

(b)   Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
71.      The Ministry of Finance was the key implementing agency and played a consistent
and effective role in maintaining progress on the triggers. The Ministry also used the DPO
series to strengthen inter-ministerial coordination. Nevertheless, the performance of
implementing line agencies was mixed. While some agencies were very responsive, others were
less so. There were also differences in the technical capacity of staff in the different line agencies.
However, the overall performance was satisfactory.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
72.    The government was attentive to the prior actions needed for each operation and
cooperated with the Bank on progress and monitoring. As a result, the operations were
completed without any major obstacles and the Bank and the borrower worked closely through
the DPO series.

6.    Lessons Learned

73.     Meaningful reforms may take years to complete and need to be followed up with
continuous policy dialog. The development and adoption of the mining code in Armenia, for
example, was an integral part of DPO2 and DPO3. However, there is still a big outstanding
agenda on the implementation of the new code and as a result it is a core component of the new
DPO series as well. Similarly, the Law on Public Service was submitted to the Parliament at the
time of DPO1 but was approved only when DPO3 was under preparation. Hence, continuous
follow-up and technical assistance, if needed, is required to ensure sustenance of difficult reforms.
74.      Outreach efforts can be effective in overcoming opposition to crucial reforms. The
government of Armenia used it very effectively while trying to get the National Assembly to
adopt the law on ‘conflict of interest’. These outreach efforts were targeted at beneficiaries (poor
and middle class), parliamentary commissions and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and
finally led to the adoption of the law.
75.    A well-designed development policy operation can be effectively used to garner
additional donor resources. In the wake of the crisis, Armenia’s engagement with the Bank in



                                                  23
2009 under the DPO series helped it to get additional funding and technical assistance from other
donors like the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission, and the United States
Agency for International Development.
76.      Result indicators need to be measurable, relevant, and with an appropriate level of
ambition. Using international rankings is inappropriate because rankings are determined by
relative performance and do not depend solely on the individual government’s efforts. In addition,
result indicators should be monitorable on an annual basis and should not be based on periodic
surveys. This was the case for the cost of tax compliance survey which was undertaken in 2009
and is now scheduled for 2014. Indicators should also be clearly defined (what do we mean by
‘poor’) and realistic – maintaining an existing CAR in the banking sector is understandable at the
time of crisis but targeting a CAR of 28 percent over the medium-term is not very realistic.

7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/Implementing agencies

                    Development Policy Operation (2009-2012)
                         Implementation Completion Report
                                     (January 21, 2013)

        The large-scale economic crisis of 2009 was followed by gradual recovery of the
Armenian economy in 2010-12. In 2010, the real growth was 2.2 percent, while in 2011 it
speeded up to almost 4.7 percent. Such speedy growth lasted in 2012 - a 7.1 percent annual GDP
growth is expected. The growth of 1.9 percent in the service sector had the largest contribution to
the recovery, the second is the industrial sector with its 1.6 percent growth. Increased demand for
mining products and the improvement of the competitiveness of the economy have contributed to
the growth of the mining industry. In 2011-12, high agricultural growth also significantly
accelerated the recovery of the economy. The recovery trends started in the construction sector in
2012, facilitated by construction works carried out at the expense of the population as well as
companies. During nine months of 2012, the consumption was restored by 9.0 percent, however,
the investments of 2011 keep on decreasing (12.8 percent).

         Having started from a strong position at the beginning of the crisis, the Government
initiated policy relevant timely actions to adapt to the global crisis. In 2009, following the budget
deficit and increase in debt, the Government adopted a significant fiscal consolidation program,
which was successfully implemented, and its continuity was reflected in the MTEF 2013-15.
Moreover, a budget deficit of 2.0 percent is anticipated by the end of 2015. The Strategic
Program of RA Government Debt Management for 2013-15 includes the strategy for involving
loan funds required for financing the state budget deficit as defined in the RA legislation and the
Economic Development Programs of the Republic of Armenia Government, as well as the
resulting modification change in the burden of public debt, and risk management. The
management of the government debt targets at continuous cooperation with bilateral and
multilateral partners. Moreover, preference will be given to enhancing the cooperation with
creditors offering soft loans, as well as to loans offered at freely convertible currency and fixed
interest rate, loans with at least five years grace period, with consideration of the groupings of
repayment of the IMF and Russian credits. Special attention is paid to coordination between the
fiscal and monetary policies.

        The process of fiscal consolidation was mainly conditioned by gradual termination of
countercyclical expenses. The total budget deficit decreased from 7.6 percent in 2009 to 1.5
percent of GDP in 2012, according to preliminary estimations (Table 3). The large portion of the
mentioned decrease took place in the expenditure budget line, while basic level of expenses for
the social security net was maintained. Still, the improvement of the rate of tax revenue collection
also contributed to the reduction of the deficit. However, the level of tax collection still cannot be
assessed as adequate.

       DPO series have assisted the Anti-crisis Action Plan of the Government, as well as
supported the Government Agenda on strengthening the competitiveness and growth.
During the recession, they constituted the major part of donor assistance provided to the
Government. It ensured contribution into the Anti-crisis Action Plan of the Government approved


                                                 29
by Resolution No 1016-A of December 17, 2008, aimed at mitigating the impacts of the crisis on
the economy and providing fiscal incentive to the real sector. Within the context of policy
discourse supported by the DPO, the Government reviewed and strengthened the legal framework
for civil actions, which jointly with the increase of the budgetary funds allocation for the
mentioned program, had a positive effect on the livelihoods of the disadvantaged and vulnerable
layer of the population. The fiscal policy of the Government is reflected in the 2012-14 Mid-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF was suspended in 2009, when the Government
focused on the crisis management, and resumed in 2010 with the midterm strategy of debt
management. Under conditions of absence of the MTEF, the DPO provided for the social
expenses and saved the budget from de facto sequester despite the crises.

         The programmatic DPO series are the focus of the current Bank Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which was prepared against the background of the global economic recession of
2009 to support the Government efforts to eliminate the vulnerabilities caused by the crises and
the strengthening of the competitiveness to ensure post-crisis growth. DPO 1 (approved by the
Board on July 2, 2009) targeted the elimination of vulnerabilities revealed through the 2009 crisis
and aimed to protect the disadvantaged, while paving way for strengthening the competitiveness.
DPO 2 (approved by the Board on January 11, 2011) focused mostly on actions to improve the
post-crisis growth and the conditions for recovery, while continuing to maintain the expenditures
for the social security net, since the impact of the crises on the disadvantaged was extended.

         The third Development Policy Operation (DPO-3) of 80 million USD supported the
Reform Program through (i) mitigating the vulnerability by protecting the disadvantaged
groups and supporting greater development of the human capital and (ii) ensuring
favorable environment for the private sector and strengthening the management to increase
the competitiveness. DPO-3 supported activities covered the expenses of the basic social
security net, along with improving the targeting, and the access and quality of basic social
services for the preschool and hospital services. The Program supported increased investments for
actions to establish the one-stop-shop for the business ledger, amend the Law on Inspections and
achieve greater transparency, to introduce the green line as the major approach of the customs
clearance and adopt regulations for the enforcement of the new Mining Code. The funding of
DPO 3 was increased to assist the Government efforts to better prepare for possible negative
impact of the Eurozone crisis. Within the scope of DPO series, the Reform Program had
appreciable and already achieved results. Moreover, the economy of Armenia was very
vulnerable against deeper crises of the Eurozone, which may include irregular state defaults –
failure to fulfill debt obligations and ubiquitous economic decline in the EU. Given the above-
mentioned considerations, as well as the appreciable progress achieved under the first two
Operations of this series, the funds for DPO 3 were increased from the IDP initial 30 million USD
planned for in the CPS progress report for 2009-13 to IDP 50 million USD plus the IBRD
30 million USD. The proposed funding is in line with the request of the Government to
strengthen the fiscal position in a situation of anxious external environment.

        Substantial results have been achieved through DPO series. For instance, the share of
social protection and pension expenses in the total expenditures increased from 24.8 percent in
2008 to 31.7 percent in 2011, even under implementation of the fiscal consolidation program.

        Although the coverage of family allowances decreased from 33.8 percent in 2008 to
26.3 percent due to failure to include families which did not meet the agreed criteria, the outflow
of the resources for family allowances to the non-disadvantaged decreased from 34 percent in
2008 to 24 percent in 2010. New funding was allotted to the one-year pre-school preparation
program for children of 4.5-5.5 ages. The ratio of healthcare expenditures in the GDP also


                                                30
increased: as compared to 1.4 percent in 2008 it is expected to be 1.7 percent. As to the tax and
customs administration, the number of electronic filing has increased during 2008-2011 from 0 to
20 percent, while the share of customs clearance through the green line (the ratio against all
declarations) has increased in the same period from 0 to 15 percent. In the “Doing Business?
Report, Armenia has improved its rating for the “Cross border trade? criteria to 104th position in
2011 as compared to 143rd position in 2008.

        The Government Reform Program was not limited to the prior actions of the New
DPO. For instance, in addition to the new Mining Code, the Government has reviewed the Law
on the Environmental Impact Expert Assessment in order to ensure the compliance of the latter
with the new Mining Code and to reflect the international good practice. The amendments to the
RA Law on Nature Protection and Nature Utilization Payments (which define the royalties for the
mining industry) focus on the metal minerals, in accordance with the DPO, have been replenished
by Government Resolution, according to which the rate of royalty for the metal minerals was
increased pursuant to the RA Law on Nature Protection and Nature Utilization Payments. In the
sphere of tax administration, since January 2012 Armenia has introduced the risk based audit
selection criteria, which should reduce the number of audits to a level lower than two percent of
the taxpayers. Moreover, the amendments to the RA Law on Inspections are entering a phase of
full enforcement. From the social point of view, the Government has drafted a new Concept
Paper which reflects the international best practice, and after its adoption will improve the
efficiency of expenditures for the disability program.

        The DPO series may also provide information for the new strategic development
program. The Government aims to prepare strategic development plan to define the policy
directions until 2020 and focus on job creation, acceleration of revenue growth, poverty reduction
and strengthening of competitiveness to ensure progress. DPO series may also provide
information for the Government Strategic Development Program, since they list the achievements
and reveal the development barriers in various key areas.

         Significant technical action and policy discourse focus on the areas of DPO prior actions
and launching mechanisms. This action and discourse are relevant for the macroeconomic and
fiscal sustainability, tax administration reform, improved social security nets, increased use of
healthcare and educational services especially by the disadvantaged and the vulnerable,
strengthening the financial management strategy, more reliable management of conflict of
interests, more advanced regulation of the infrastructure, including the telecommunications,
public-private partnerships, and ensuring a more favorable environment for the private sector,

continue to be the key instrument to assist the Government Reform Program.

Dear Mrs. Melkumyan,

       Reference to your letter WB-78/13, dated 16.04.2013, on 2009-2012 draft DPO 1-3
performance report, please note:

           “Doing Business? indicators provided in the report are different from data on
            various years included in the WB Doing Business report. In particular, annual cost
            of business in terms of time spent by taxpayers in 2008 was 581 hours (instead of
            958); in 2008 the share of taxes within total income was 38.6 percent (instead of
            36.6) and in 2012 it was 38.8 percent (instead of 40.9 percent);
            Given that the aforementioned indicators are regularly updated in the Doing
            Business reports (including the last year report), it would be feasible in terms of
            their dynamics to replace 2012 indicators with those for 2013;
           There is a need to clarify the time periods when the number of tax inspectorates
            was set as 72 and 26 (as currently there are 24 inspectorates);
            In Table 5 of the draft (paragraph 49) target and actual figures are provided, from
            comparison of which it follows that some of the targets were missed. Given that
            Doing Business reports and DPO 1-3 papers do not establish the targets provided
            in Table 5, it would be good to provide sources of those targets together with the
            content and methodology of estimation of “Performance indicator on logistics?.


                                          Yours sincerely,

                            Comments by the Ministry of Finance on
       Report “Implementation Completion and Results? (Report) delivered by the World
                     Bank on April 16, 2013 (Letter Re. No 78/13)

       Concerning figures provided in Table 3 “Selected Economic Indicators 2010-14? of
the Report, we recommend to introduce certain changes, in particular:

          Replace 2012 Current account/GDP figure of -10.8 by -10.6;
          Replace 2012 Exports of Goods and Services (mln US$) figure of 2,700 by 2,491.
           We think, that the same figures in 2013 and 2014 projections should be revised,
           given that due to the government policies aimed at fostering exports, trends on
           growth of exports of goods and services will most probably continue in 2014 as
           well, furthermore growth rate of exports in 2014 will surpass that for 2013;
          Replace 2012 Imports of Goods and Services (mln US$) figure of 4,880 by 4,896-
           ով;
          Replace 2010 outstanding public debt vs. GDP figure of 37.2 by 34.7, and for 2011,
           36.6 by 36.4;
          Replace 2011-2012 GDP nominal indicators of AMD 3,776 and 3,981 billion by
           AMD 3,778 and 3,998 billion, respectively;
          Replace 2011-2012 GDP nominal indicators (million US$) of 10,138 and 9910
           10,142 and 3,998 (AMD billion), respectively;
          Replace 2010-2012 investment figures of 33.8, 27.7 and 26.6 by 32.9, 27.9 and 23.8,
           respectively;
          Regarding incidence of broadband Internet among population, the Report states
           that as of December 31, 2012, actual number of broadband Internet subscriptions
           per 100 people totaled 4.98. However, according to statistical data, the actual
           number of broadband Internet subscriptions per 100 people totaled 13.39,
           excluding subscribers of 3G broadband Internet by mobile phone, and 32.64
           including subscribers of 3G broadband Internet by mobile phone.

Dear Ms. Melkumyan,

In response to your letter dated April 16, 2013 No. WB-78/13, please find below the comments
from the Ministry of Health on the draft Implementation Completion and Results Report for the
Programmatic Development Policy Operation (DPO 1-3).

    1. Paragraph 43: the number of indicators in the evaluation system reached 30 in 2013
       rather than 40 in 2012 as indicated in the document. As a result of performing on the
       indicators in the introduced evaluation system, additional funding was made available
       only to primary care physicians, i.e. family doctors, therapists, pediatricians rather than
       health care professionals.

    2. Paragraph 44: “a score of 30? should be substituted for “a score of 36.0?. As far as the
       healthcare utilization is concerned, it should be noted that while there was no significant
       increase for families with a score of 36 and higher covered in the Family Benefit Program,
       for those in the vulnerable and special groups the utilization rate increased by 42 % in
       2011 compared to 2008.
