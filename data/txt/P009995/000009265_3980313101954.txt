Government of Andhra Pradesh
Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
The State Govenmment has taken up preparation of Detailed Engineering for
the proposed Andhra Pradesh State IHighways Project to be taken up with the
World Bank loan assistance. The Bank has agreed for inclusion of 1400 kTns of
road network under the project. The cost of the Project will be about R3s.1100
crores. The work is proposed to be taken up in Two Phases. The road network of
400 kms under Phase-I and the balance 1000 kms under Phase-Il. The Detailed
Engineering for the Phase-I of 400 kms is already completed and the Detailed
Project Report is also finalised. The Detailed Engineering for Phase-TI roads is
being taken up. The roads included in the Project are as under;
Phase-I
I)    Tadfipatri - Cuddapah road
iu)    Varkepalli - Addanki road
if )    Raipatnam - Karimnagar - Warangal road
Phase-II
I)    Kurnool - Guntur road
a)    Kurnool - Atinakur road
b)    Atmakur - 7hokapa1Li road
c)    7hokapalli - Guntur road
ii)    Cuddapah - Renigunta - Puttur State border
iii)   Nallajerla Palacollu road
iv)    Ko-vur - Bhimadole road
v)    Tadipatri - Gooty road

a)    Aadanapalli - Chandrgiri road
b)    Chandraggiri - Renigunta road
c)    Renigunta - Naidupeta road
2.    All the above roads indicated above are the existng State Highways and the
Major District roads.  The Improvement proposals is the Project consists of
Widening and Strengthening of the existing cariageway.  At a few places,
geometric improvements are proposed and the re-alignment is planned accordingly.
However, this re-alignment is within the existing Right-of-Way only
Project Roads passing in Forest area/Sanctuaries / National Parks.
3. Out of a total length of 1400 kins a length of about 90 kms of roads are passing
through the forcst arca. The details of tlhc roads strctchcs are as undcr:
* Atjakur - 7thokapalLi (Ku-rnool - Guntur road)
, Mlfadanapallv- Cliandragiri- road (3fadanapally Chandragiri Naidupet)
* Cuddapah - Renigunta road (Cuddapalh-Renigunra-Puur State Border)



-2-.
These roads are existing since ages. The present improvement proposals
are limited to existing Right-of-Way only. No forest land is needed  for this
purpose.
Environmental Analysis Report & PCCF Recommendations:
4.    As per the Ministry of Environment & Forests' guidelines (vide Forest
Conservation Act, 1980, Amended on the 25th October, 1992) the proposals were
submitted in the required Format to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests,
Government of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, giving all the details of the Roads that
are passing through the Forest-land, Wildlife Sanctuaries/ National Parks etc.
These applications were examined by the concerned District Forest Officers, the
Conservator of Forests and recommended the proposals to the Principal Chief
Conservator of Forests, Govt.of A.P. Hyderabad. The Prl., C.C.F. also forwarded
to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt.of India, through the State
Govemrnment for according approval / clearance needed under Forcst Conservation
Act, 1980.
S.    The above Report also covered the Wildlife Sanctuaries located on one
side of the following roads.
1) Kurnol - Guntur road (in beween Afrnakoor-Thokapally)-
(NagarjunaSagarSrisailamTiger Sanctuary.)
2)    Afadanapalli - Pileru - Chandragiri road (Sri Venktdeswia
Sanctuary and National Park)
6.    The Prl. Chief Conservator of Forests, and the Field Director, Project
Tigcr, Srisailam have accepted the mitigation measures suggested by the
Department (for the roads passing near Wildlife Sanctuaries) and recommended
for according approval for the same.
7.    In addition to the aboNv, and as per Bank's guidelines and Ministry of
Environment and Forests Regulations, for Highway Projects, the Environmental
Impact Assessment duly indicating the mitigation Plan need to be prepared. In
order to satisfy these guidelines and Rules, the Department has undertaken through
Consultants, viz MWs Snowy Mountains Engineming Corporation Ltd, Australia,
the Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment along with mnitigation
measures.
8.    The Consultants have already prepared the Environmental Analysis Report
afler conducting Detailed Study and also consulting with Experts in the field. Copy
of the Report along with Questionnaire for the Environmental appraisal required to
be furnished to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govermnent of India, has
submitted in T.O Lr no:35578 1 WB / EIA / 96   datcd:ll-09-96.in the earlier
proposals.
9.    As can be seen from the Report it is clear that there are no major
environmental problem-Ls all along the road network of 1400 kns included in the
Project. The following rmitigation measures are taken care and built-in the contract
document.



-3-
* Suitable Construcion Contract provision as per IRC IFIDIC for the
Restoration of Borrowv Pity
a Seeding of Bather Slopes! Tree Planting as part of Contract
a Provison for safety measures
a Location of Camps and depots outside the forest area
* Equipment Selection- Maintenance and Operation
* Water Pollution /lurbidity
*  Construction of High Bridges at required Location for the passage of Mid
life
All the above measures are to be built into contract and will be taken
care during the implementation of the proposed project.
World Bank Condition for Appraisal:
10.   The Bank has made it a condition to fulrnish Environmental Clearance from
the Government of India, for appraising the project.
Expert Committee Meetilgs & Folilow-up:
11.   The Expert Committee on Infrastructure Development and Miscellaneous
Project met on 3rd December 96 and the following observations were made.
a) Authonitative Opinion of Wild Life Institute of India, Dehradun on
the Tiger Reserve of Kumool-Guntur Road.
b) Clarification on Bye-Passes
c) Clarification on Watcr-logging/Borrow-pit area! Soil erosion etc.
d) Clarification on New culvrt allas and drains etc.
A detailed reply on the above points in the forn of a supplementary report
is already submitted to MOEF vide this office Lr Dated: 10 Jan'97.
12.   After the Second meeting of the Expert Commnittee on 22-Jan97, the MoEF
in their Letter No. J-21012J12/96-IA-I11, dated 29-01-1997 has requested to send
a revised proposal clearly indicating the roads which do not pass through the
ecologically sensitive areas may be submitted to the Ministry and also requested the
availability of Right-of-Way and the proposed bypasses.
13.   It is reiterated that the present proposals are mainly to improve the ridmig
quality, of the road along with making up deficiency of the road crust to cater to the
needs of the present day axle-loads and not for improving the capacities of the
road.
The roads passing through sensitive areas of the Project Road are as
follows:
a) Atmakur-Tokapafli Secton of the Kurnool Guntur Road where the
Nagarjunasagar- Srisailam    L-d life Sanctuary is locted on one
side of the road
b) Mafdanapally- Chandragin Secton where the SriVenkateshwara
Sanctuary and Naional Park cxists on one side of the road



*  Street lights are also provided at junctions and village limits. as per
Drg.No.212
* Bell-mouths are provided at junctions to allow traffic freely. Parking facilitics
are provided as per the IRC norms
c Bus-Bays, utility services like highways telephone, first-aid ports, Speed-
barriers informaton signs et, are incorporatedfor enhancing the driving
environment
BYPASSES
19.   The Detailed Engineering of first 400 Kms of the Project Roads is
completed . In many Towns because of mixed traffic ie. Rickshaws, Autos,
Bullockcarts etc., the speed will not be more than 10 km per hour. Further the
speed Regulating Measures such as Speed Breakers , Traffic Signals etc. will
restrict the speed of motorised vehicle. Based on the results of detailed engineering
carried on the Phase-I roads of 400 kms, the following criterion 's are framed for
providing the bye-passes to the villages / Towns.
Villages:-
* The existing right of way in all the viliages is varying from 22 M to 30 M.
The village wise Right of Way is indicated in Annexure-1. The carriage way
width is 7.00 Nt In addition the project proposal provides hard shoulders
on either side and also bus bays. Drains are provided on either side of the
Road. The cross section as proposed Is indicated in Fig.  . In  major
villages separate service lanes are also provided.
Towns: -
* In Towns, urban section has been provided which consists of dual
carriageway along with hard shoulders etc. The proposals for providing
bypasses were considered in detail and If the Right-of-Way available within
the town-limits is adequate to accommodate dual carriageway, service
roads along with foot-paths and drains, the improvement to the roads are
proposed through the town only by improving the existing road to full
Urban section. Wherever the Right-of-Way within the town-limits is not
adequate to provide full Urban section, bypasses proposed to relieve
congestion and also to avoid accidents. Suitable speed regulating
arrangements are also provided in the Design to have full safety to the
Public.
20.   Following are the major villages / towns through which the roads are
passing.
Raipatnam,  Karimnagar,  Huzuraba4   Warangal,  Khammam,
Bhimadoke, Nandik-oAr, Abnakur,  Vmukond4, Narasarop4   Guntur,
Tadipatri, Kamalapuran, Cuddapah, Rajmapet, Renigunta, Puttur, Nalgonda,
AiWryalguda, Pidugaralta, Mladanapalih, Vayalpadu, h-rupati, Chandragin, Sri
Kalahasti, and NVaidu pet



-6-
21.   In the following Towns the existing Right of Way (ROW) is sufficient to
provide dual carriageway along with Bus Bays etc. as indicated in the figure. In
these Towns because of mixed traffic ie. Rickshaws, Autos, Bullockcarts etc., the
speed wfill not be more than 10 km per hour. Further the speed Regulating
Measures such as Speed Breakers , Traffic Signals etc. will take care of Safety
aspect.
1) IHuzurabad
2) Piduguralila
3) Madanapally
4) Tirupathi
5) Naidupeta
6) Raipatnam
7) Chandragiri
22.   The World Bank Environmental Specialist and the Sociologist have also
inspected the roads and they have gone through the above proposals and expressed
their satisfaction with the Consultant's proposals. As such, the proposals will satisfy
all the requirements of guidelines of World Bank also.
23.   With the criteria indicated in  above paras , the following bypasses are
provided in the first Phase roads i.e., 400 Km based on detailed engineering where
the ROW is inadequate to provide the proposed Urban section.
* Nalgonda
* Miryalaguda
* Karimnagar
* Cuddapah
24.   For the sccond Phase, the Base line survey is completed to identify the
Project affected persons in R&R . Based on this study the Bypasses are planed for
the following towns. However all the Villages & Towns will be analysed based on
the criteria indicated above and decided where the bypasses required after
completion of detailed Engineering.

.;      Witliout aerial phioLographis it was extrciely clifficult to review  optiolis for bypasses. Site
inspection did reveal, however, that options arc limited anld have been based on rcsLricting the
bypass to agricultural and fallow lanid only. Tlhc doicstic consultants hiave estimated thiat 40 ha
of agricultural land and 12 lia of fallow land will be required. Th ree optiolis for the bypass of
Nalgonda were investigated, two to the east of the town beside tihe railway line and onle to thle
west (Figure 2.4.4).
Thlie western route leaves the existing road at the railway overpass at kmil 14 niorthi of Nalgonda
and rejoins the existing road at kml 3.0. This route passes to the west of tlie twini h)ills. The two
ca.steri bypass optionis bothLi utilise the clearedc land beside the railway linic. IThe Iona iol problem
with this route was its 13km. lenigthi.
'IIlie bypass to the wvest of tela railway linie (Eastenii Option 1) is tIre miosL ciesireable of the tihee

The route will cross the railway line via an overbridge and rejoin tlhe existing road at kmi 2.4. The
total length is around 7km. Because of its proximity to the railway line, the use of an existing
road for part of its length, and the use of agricultural land and unused residential plots, the route
does not have any significant environmental problerms. T'hree large culverts will be required to
match those of the railway but apart from these there are no expected alterations to the regions
current hydrology. The route has already been extensively cleared of vegetation so no significant
species or habitats are found nearby.
