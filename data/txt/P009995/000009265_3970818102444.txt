3. Benefits and target population:
(a) Lower freight and passenger transport costs, with resulting benefits in fares, the price of goods, marketing of
products, and the reduction of transport bottlenecks affecting economic development. This will have direct
benefits for the traveling public, agricultural and industrial producers, consumers, and local communities having
improved access to health and education services.
(b) Improved physical environment along project roads, and improved attention to environmental and social
impacts of road works. Roadside communities and non-motorized road users are expected to benefit from
improved shoulders, planting and drainage.
(c) More effective management and sustainable maintenance of the state's road assets, including better
utilization of existing traffic capacity, improved value-for-money of state spending on roads, and better
connectivity of rural roads to state and national networks.

4. Insitutional and implementation arranyements
Implementation period: 5 years
Executing agencvy The state Roads and Buildings Department (RBD) will have overall responsibility for
project implementation. During the project, actions will be taken to reconfigure and equip the RBD for
strengthened management of the road network. This will ensure more widespread benefits from the project's
introduction of new approaches and technology.

Country: India                                                 Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
Project coordination: The RBD will establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) reporting to the Engineer-in-
Chief. A Project Coordinating Consultant (PCC) engaged for project preparation will remain in place during
implementation to assist the RBD in further design, procurement, and project management activities.
Project oversight and policy guidance: The Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) has established an
empowered Implementation and Tender Committee (ITC) to oversee project implementation, consisting of
Principal Secretary, Transport, Roads and Buildings, Principal Secretary, Works and Projects, Secretary,
Finance, and Engineer-in-Chief, Roads and Buildings. The functions of this committee are to (a) approve
contracts based on the recommendations of the PIU, (b) ensure inter-departmental coordination within GOAP,
and (c) facilitate high-level government decisions when required. A similar committee arrangement was used
for the Bank-financed AP Cyclone Relief Project, with considerable success.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: To provide efficient financial management
information, in accordance with the Bank's Operational Policy 10.02, RBD will establish and maintain a
computerized Project Financial Management System for the project. This will show actual versus budgeted
expenditures and method of procurement, and generate the Schedule of Withdrawal of Proceeds and Statement
of Expenditure forms required for Bank processing of withdrawals from the loan. The project accounts will be
audited by the Accountant General, Andhra Pradesh, who is recognized by the Bank as an independent auditor.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The PIU, assisted by the PCC, will prepare quarterly reports in
accordance with the format described in the Project Implementation Plan covering the physical and financial
progress of the project. Specific monitoring of environmental and resettlement aspects of the project will be
included in the implementation plan and quarterly reports. These reports will be forwarded to the Bank and
copied to the ITC. GOAP will also, within 6 months of the closing of the project, prepare an Implementation
Completion Report. A Mid-Term Review will be held after 24 months to review procurement and
implementation progress against agreed schedules and assess implementation capacity.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives supported by the project
Improved infrastructure is critical to the growth of India's economy. This is recognized in the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy Report discussed by the Executive Directors on June 20, 1995 and the Progress Report
discussed on September 5, 1996, which notes the importance of overcoming transport and power bottlenecks.
The CAS stresses the need to link investments in infrastructure with reforms in public sector policy and
management at both central and state levels. In the road sector, emphasis is placed on increased investments in
high-return projects, strengthened public sector planning and project management, and increased use of private
sector engineering capacity and modem road design and construction technologies. It also advocates a stronger
link between road user charges and road expenditures. All of these features have been incorporated in the
project, with up-front commitment of GOAP to policy and institutional changes, and substantial use of private
consultants and contractors.
The CAS also notes the growing potential for private investments in infrastructure in India. This has so far had
little impact on the road sector, and is not expected to play a major role in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless,

Country: India                                                   Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
investmnent opportunities are being developed and expanded, and the project includes actions to strengthen the
policy environment and prepare specific candidate projects for possible private investments in state roads.
Reflecting similar themes to the CAS, a Bank report on "The Indian Transport Sector - Long Terrn Issues"
(Report No. 13192-IN, March 1995) highlighted the need for "difficult reforms' in the introduction of (i) private
sector engineering services; (ii) international competition for large civil works packages; and (iii) more
sustainable road funding linked to road user charges. These issues are all addressed under the project.
s and  over nent strategy
The demand for intercity freight transport in India is expected to double every twelve years while the demand
for passenger transport is expected to double every eight or nine years. The share of total demand going to
roads has been growing steadily since 1950, to the point where roads now carry 60 percent of freight and 85
percent of passenger traffic, with the railroads carrying the balance. During the same period the core system of
paved National and State highways expanded over eight-fold, from about 19,800 km to about 156,000 km. The
rapid expansion of the network was only made possible by spreading available resources as widely as possible
through the construction of primarily single-lane and intermediate-lane (5.5 m) State and District roads with
thin, structurally-deficient pavements. The arterial road system has become extremely congested and of poor
riding quality, leading to high cost and low quality services for users.
The State of Andhra Pradesh (AP) with a population of approximately 70 million is the fifth largest State of the
Union. The highway network of the State consists of a total of 164,000 km of highways of which 2,950 km are
classified as National Highways (NH), 8,775 km as State Highways (SH), and 34,695 as Major District Roads
(MDR). Even though the SH/MDR network carries over 60% of the State's traffic, 53% of SH and nearly 90%
of MDRs are still single lane. Vehicle registrations have increased by approximately 16% per annum during the
last five years and traffic is projected to grow at least at 7-8% per year for the foreseeable future.
The poor quality of roads in India and in Andhra Pradesh is due primarily to (a) a declining share of budget
allocations and (b) limited implementation capacity. These are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Budget Allocations
The following table shows the average annual spending on roads in AP for 1992-96. Allocations for capital
works for roads are generally less than 4% of overall State Plan expenditure, and have been declining.
Maintenance allocations have been low relative to norms established by the Ministry of Surface Transport and
Planning Commission, but have increased significantly in recent years.

The Roads and Buildings Department is responsible for state highways and major district roads, and some
special programs. Capital expenditures have been dominated by externally-aided assistance under the Bank-
financed AP Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project, which closed in 1995, and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) First Highway Project, which will close in mid-1997. Peak RBD capital expenditure was 158
crore in 1993/94, of which 124 was externally aided. GOAP allocations to RBD for road maintenance have
been steadily increasing from Rs 75 crore in 1990/91 to 272 crore in 1996/97 and a proposed 378 crore in
1997/98. These represent 58%, 66% and 88% respectively of estimated network maintenance needs based on
national norms. The tables do not include spending on National Highway capital and maintenance works,
which are fully financed by GOI but implemented by the RBD.
The Panchayat Raj Engineering Department is responsible for village and district road works, which are partly
implemented by local governments. Of the allocations shown in the following table, approximately Rs 100
crore/year were provided for road works through the Employment Assurance Scheme, of which 80 percent was
financed by GOI. The externally aided component was provided through the Bank-financed AP Cyclone
Emergency Reconstruction Project.
The next table shows expected future spending for roads under the responsibility of RBD. In addition to
continuing GOAP and GOI funding, future road investment plans include the Bank-financed road works under
the proposed Third AP Irrigation Project and proposed AP Cyclone Project, and a loan from the National

To improve long-term funding for road investment and maintenance, GOAP is planning to establish a dedicated
road fund which would earmark a portion of user charge revenues generated by the road sector to fund part or
all of its expenditures for the network. Road users are currently generating substantially more annual revenues
(approximately US$ 310 million) than are being spent on capital and maintenance (approximately US$ 100
million) for the road network.

Implementation Capacity
The previously-cited Bank report on "The Indian Transport Sector - Long Term Issues" found that
implementation capacity of state Public Works Departments (PWDs, sometimes also known as Roads and
Building Departments) has been limited by their almost monopolistic public provision of engineering,
construction supervision and maintenance services. With little exposure to effective international competition,
local consultants and contractors have had little incentive or opportunity to develop the technical and
managerial skills required to become an efficient alternative to PWDs. While considerable transport sector
reform has been accomplished in private trucking operations in India, little progress has been made in reforms
involving the provision and maintenance of physical infrastructure.
Andhra Pradesh road management capacities, while relatively good compared with other Indian states, are still
to be improved in their organization and resources for effective performance. Technical, administrative and
financial responsibilities for the sector are presently dispersed across the Transport, Roads & Buildings portfolio
and other GOAP agencies, resulting in limited accountability for results and poor focus on sector needs and
priorities. The basic operational and business management practices of the RBD are not strong, and the
agency's processes, systems and technology need to be updated. The state's policies for the sector, while
recognizing the need for increased provision of major road infrastructure, have not resulted in adequate
financing, particularly in respect of road maintenance.
GOAP has been progressively making increased use of private contractors and consultants, and has now fully
endorsed the need for major change, in particular towards improved road maintenance financing and the
strengthening of the RBD's role as manager of the State's road infrastructure responsibilities rather than just
provider of road infrastructure services. With the assistance of international consultants, GOAP has completed
a "Review of the Institutional Priorities for Management and Financing of AP Road Transport Infrastructure"
with the participation of major road sector stakeholders and a wide cross section of RBD staff. The main thrust
of the proposed reforms is to manage roads as a business and provide them largely on a fee for service basis. Its
recommendations include actions to: (i) affirm and strengthen the RBD as the principal state agency for road
infrastructure management; (ii) target key areas of the RBD's basic business practices for structural and policy
improvements, training, process enhancements and strengthening of support resources; (iii) raise sector
financing capacity to sustainable levels through dedication of selected road user charges to financing of roads;
(iv) introduce rationally-based and economically sound methods for prioritization of maintenance and
investment needs; and (iv) facilitate more effective stakeholder participation in road planning and expenditure
decision-making.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
A three-year Institutional Action Plan has been prepared by GOAP for progressive implementation during the
project. Short term actions are being taken to restructure the agency and establish a Corporate Management
Group. Consulting services will be invited from a road agency in a more developed country to provide an
Institutional Reform Specialist, training programs and short-term experts in key areas of business efficiency,
planning and investment development, financial, procurement and contract management, road maintenance
policy, road safety and network asset management. The plan seeks to shift the focus of the RBD from provision
of road assets towards a management and policy role, and includes:
a) establishment of a Road Trust Fund for improved road sector financing;

b) development of legislation (Road Act) to endow the RBD with comprehensive responsibility and
authority for the management of major state road infrastructure; and
c) development of improved policy, processes and opportunities for private investment in state roads.
Details of the action plan objectives, expected outcomes, terms of reference, resources and implementation
schedule are incorporated in the Borrower's Project Implementation Plan.
Further management and institutional issues which need to be addressed by GOAP include relative priorities for
spending on different road types (e.g. highways and rural roads), and the productivity of the large labor force
employed by RBD for road maintenance. The project does not directly address these issues, but will assist RBD
with strengthened planning and management processes which will indirectly help in broader decision-making
for the sector.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The widening and strengthening component of the project focuses on the busiest state highways and major
district roads, as these are experiencing substantial bottlenecks and the state's rural roads are relatively well-
funded. National highway priorities are being addressed separately in the Bank's dialogue with the central
Ministry of Surface Transport and National Highways Authority of India. Road projects at the state level
provide an opportunity for the Bank to work with state governments which are ready to address institutional
issues, and are closer to project implementation and road users.
Selection of specific road sections for the project began with a Strategic Options Study undertaken by GOAP in
1994 to provide an overall assessment of the existing traffic bottlenecks, expected traffic growth and investment
needs for the state's busiest roads. This provided a basis for agreement between GOAP and the Bank on an
initial identification of high-priority roads for further study, based on traffic congestion, expected economic
returns, network connectivity, links to expected economic development, and project packaging. GOAP then
undertook feasibility studies of the candidate roads, and integrated the results in an overall prioritization process
under the management of the PCC consultants. In addition to earlier selection criteria, the feasibility reviews
took further account of potential environmental and resettlement impacts, and sought to avoid or minimize these
in project selection.
The GOAP review of institutional needs in the sector identified a possible longer term alternative of developing
a new independent road sector agency for introducing improved sector management. GOAP decided that
greatest medium term progress could be achieved by strengthening of the RBD for the capacity-building
objectives of this project, aiming the RBD progressively at full 'sector management agency' status and
capability. This will minimize the risk of delays to the overall implementation of this project and should allow
earlier achievement of benefits from institutional interventions under the project, without prejudice to future
structural and organizational options.
The potential for private financing of state roads is being explored by GOAP with assistance under this project,
but its potential is considered to be small relative to investment needs. Variations to the scale and timing of the
project were considered, and the final size was determined to match GOAP's implementation capacity and
commitment to reforms. If the project is not implemented, the AP economy will continue to be hampered by
inadequate road infrastructure, and potential improvements in sector efficiency will not be achieved.

9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies
The Bank has accumulated substantial experience in the highway sector in other states of India but not in
Andhra Pradesh. There, the RBD has earned a reputation for reasonably good performance, including via its
implementation of the road and bridge component of the Bank-assisted Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction
Project. The Bank is in a good position to capitalize on this experience with the RBD and to provide a
comprehensive approach to improving the preparation, implementation and maintenance capacity of the State's
road agencies.. Relevant projects include:
Completed First National Highway Project (Ln. 2534-IN)
Andhra Pradesh Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project (Ln. 3260-IN, Cr. 2179-IN)
Ongoing  Second National Highway Project (Ln. 3470-IN, Cr. 2365-IN)
States' Road Project (Ln. 2994-IN, Cr. 1959-IN)
State Roads Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 4114-IN)
ADB First Highway Project and Second Highway Project
Planned   Proposed Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and possible other State Roads Projects (FY 98-2000)
Proposed Third National Highway Project (FY 2000)
Proposed OECF First National Highway Project (may include national highways in AP)
10.... Lessons............ lea......... ed..... and...... re........ ected......... in..... the....... project............ design:.......
After a break in Bank lending in the road sector in India between the late 1960's and the early 1980's, there
have been three Bank road projects at national and state levels. According to the Project Completion Report
(No. 13644, 1994), the First National Highway Project, originally in the amount of US$ 200 million, closed in
December 1994 with only US$ 103 million disbursed. The States' Road Project, which commenced in 1988,
has had one extension of closing date to June 1997. The Second National Highway Project is ongoing since
1993, with substantial implementation delays.
In each case, major constraints on progress in these projects included poor project preparation, weak
implementation plans and capacities, poor inter-agency coordination, poor assimilation of Bank procurement
requirements, poor contract management skills and limited focus on the financial and economic consequences of
poor project implementation. The Andhra Pradesh Irrigation II Project also experienced similar problems
during preparation and implementation. From these experiences, the lessons for future operations in this sector
are:
a) proposed investments must be prepared more comprehensively prior to project appraisal, particularly in
respect of the engineering, social, environmental and institutional aspects;
b) any required strengthening of basic institutional capacities for effective project management,
procurement and contract administration should be fully underway before the major phases of project
implementation;
c) all key pre-implementation and procurement actions for contract initiation on the initial batch of
proposed civil works should be resolved by project effectiveness;



Project Appraisal Document                                                                                        Page 9
Country: India                                                                  Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
d) international 'best practice' engineering services and higher-capacity construction technology ane
practices should be more widely adopted for road works in high-traffic-density corridors;
e) project implementation arrangements must make earlier and explicit provision for institutional
strengthening, particularly in project and contract management; and
f) the public sector roads-financing capac;ty for maintenance and capital works should be substantially
increased to achieve road network asset sustainability.
Overall, action on the substantial needs in India for investment in road infrastructure must be matched with
action on substantive policy-based sector reforms, for any serious prospects of sustainability in those
investments and to establish the necessary wider institutional conditions for effective road infrastructure
provision, financing and maintenance in future.
Preparations for this project have included detailed attention to feasibility, design, procurement planning, and
environmental and resettlement assessments, to ensure readiness for timely implementation. Draft bid
documents and contractor prequalification for the first 30 percent of widening and strengthening works have
been reviewed by the Bank, and are being finalized to incorporate requested changes. Bids for Phase 1 civil
works and supervision consultants will be invited in June, 1997. Social and environmental action plans are
discussed further in sections 17 and 18 respectively.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The initial Strategic Options Study and feasibility studies for the project were undertaken by GOAP using local
consultants at its own expense, with a combined cost in excess of US$ 600,000. GOAP subsequently utilized a
Project Preparation Facility of US$ 2.4 million to finance pre-investment studies and final engineering of the
first-year works package of 41 0 km of roads. This is now almost fully disbursed. Design of the remaining
project roads has commenced under financing from the State Road Infrastructure Development Technical
Assistance Project (Ln. 4114-IN).
GOAP has also embraced a project preparation and implementation framework designed to enhance the state's
absorptive capacity through outsourcing most of the engineering, design and supervision functions of the RBD
for the project, and the implementation of project civil works by contractors of proven international experience.
Finally, the state has completed a "Review of the Institutional Priorities for Management and Financing of AP
Road Transport Infrastructure" which has produced detailed recommendations and action plans for
implementation during the project.

In addition to providing infrastructure financing, the Bank provides experience of similar projects in India and
internationally, and promotes necessary reforms in project implementation and overall management of road
investment and maintenance. The Bank is working with GOAP and the RBD to utilize international expertise
and best practices for road construction, engineering services and sound public sector business management.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file; see Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment 0I Cost-Benefit Analysis
(see Annex 4):                 Widening component       Maintenanc. Component Overall
NPV = US$ 463 million   NPV = US$ 321 million   NPV = US$ 774 million
ERR=27%                  ERR=58%                   ERR=32%
Widening and Strengthening Component: Benefits were determined from savings in road user costs due to
improved pavement condition, reduced traffic congestion, and increased separation of fast and slow moving
traffic, and from savings in future maintenance costs arising from timely rehabilitation. The economic analysis
utilized the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM) model for 28 project road sections selected on the
basis of homogeneous traffic and road condition, and further subdivided by road width. Traffic volumes ranged
from 700 to 3600 vehicles per day, including 65 to 90 percent trucks and buses. The analysis showed Economic
Rates of Return (ERRs) of 18 to 45 percent with an overall rate of return of 27 % and Net Present Value of US$
463 million, assuming a 12 percent discount rate.
Maintenance Component: During project preparation, a core network of 10,000 km of State Highways and
selected heavily-trafficked Major District Roads was identified for priority attention under the maintenance
management component. In order to analyze periodic maintenance requirements, this network was stratified by
functional class, traffic flow and road condition, and indicative treatments were proposed for each case. The
economic analysis then assessed the benefits arising from timely preventative maintenance interventions, taking
account of savings in vehicle operating costs, and in future maintenance and rehabilitation costs of restoring lost
assets when not optimally maintained. An optimum maintenance program was then determined by maximizing
the benefits within the budget constraints. The results for this analysis give an average rate of return of 58 % and
a Net Present Value of US$ 321 million, at a 12 percent discount rate. Additional (but unquantified) benefits of
the maintenance component are expected to arise from overall increases in efficiency of the RBD's spending on
road maintenance due to better priority-setting, works implementation, quality control, and budget
accountability.
Other Components: The benefits of supervision consultancies will be achieved through improved quality and
timely completion of works, and are included in the works evaluations above. Other institutional development
components are necessary to ensure smooth implementation of project works, and sustainable future
maintenance. In addition, institutional strengthening will lead to improved value for money in road spending
and reduced transport costs for road users, through more robust budget planning and prioritization, management
of work processes, and monitoring of outcomes. The overall project Economic Rate of Return is estimated at 32
% and the Net Present Value at US$ 774 million.

14. Financial Assessment
Fiscal impact: The project will generate an overall counterpart fumding requirement for the State of
approximately US$ 130 million over an estimated five year implementation period. Most of the expenditure will
fall during the life of the 9th State Plan (1997-2002) which is currently under preparation. The overall impact of
the project on state finances should be limited since the $27 million annual counterpart funding requirements
represents only about 23 percent of the US$ 120 million the GOAP currently spends on capital and recurrent
works for the whole road sector. The maintenance component has a counterpart funding requirement of
approximately US$ 5 million per annum, which is small relative to the proposed 1997/98 RBD road maintenance
allocation of $108 million. However, the $22 million annual counterpart funding required for widening and



Project Appraisal Document                                                                             Page 11
Country: India                                                          Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
strengthening works is considerably more than the $8 million average plan budget of RBD over the past five
years. Additional GOAP capital budget allocations will therefore be required to cover project needs and any
other capital spending requirements, including the proposed externally aided projects identified in section 6. It
was noted that GOAP has a sound track record of timely provision of counterpart funds for externally aided
projects in the road sector.
The GOAP has for the past several years been running a fairly large fiscal deficit of approximately 3% to 4% of
Gross State Domestic Product, and the fiscal situation of the state has further deteriorated during the last two
years due to prohibition (which has sharply decreased excise revenue) and an increase in the rice price subsidy.
Prohibition has recently been relaxed, and overall state finances are being addressed separately through state
policy reforms and preparation of the Proposed AP Economic Restructuring Project based on the recently
completed Bank report on "Andhra Pradesh: Agenda For Economic Affairs". The project size was determined in
part by the state's fiscal capacity, and the Bank's assessment is that the project is affordable in the context of the
overall state budget.

15. Techncal Assessment
The road widening and strengthening sub-projects do not require complex design or construction methods, but
will introduce substantially higher standards of project design, implementation and quality control. In the past,
quality problems have been encountered in road projects in India with regard to surveys, pavement design,
detailed engineering, contractor capability, workmanship, and strict adherence to technical specifications. A
major emphasis of the project is therefore the introduction of international "best practice" to the Andhra Pradesh
road sector. The quality of engineering preparation has been addressed by appointing an international standard
consulting engineering firm. Bid packages will be sized, and pre-qualification criteria prescribed, so as to be of
interest to well-qualified contractors, and construction supervision will be the responsibility of internationally-
experienced consultants.
Maintenance works presently carried out need improvement to introduce new techniques. The project builds
upon RBD's current practice of progressively contracting out maintenance works to the private sector, and will
introduce rational maintenance planning, strengthened work methods and quality control.
To ensure long-term sustainability of improvements in the technical quality of road works, the institutional
reform agenda includes the introduction of sound business practices including quality management, technical
audits and moder financial and cost accounting systems.
16. Institutional Assessment
The Roads and Buildings Department (RBD) is responsible for the construction and maintenance of National
Highways (on behalf of GOI), State Highways and Major District Roads. The RBD employs approximately
7,500 "regular" staff (including 166 senior officers), and a further 10,000 "work charged" employees. Two thirds
of staff work on roads. Regular staff salaries are paid from the Department's annual approved budget. Work
charged salaries are paid through a lump sum provision and charged directly to the works undertaken. The RBD
has six wings, each headed by a chief engineer or engineer-in-chief reporting to the Principal Secretary. These
are: (a) Buildings; (b) Roads; (c) Administration and Externally-aided projects; (d) Design and planning; (e)
National highways; and (f) Asian Development Bank & Command Area Development Roads (under the Bank-
financed AP Irrigation Projects). Operations are geographically divided into twelve Circles, and further
subdivided into 52 divisions. The six wings report to the Principal Secretary, Transport, Roads and Buildings.

Proposed measures to strengthen the institutional capacity of RBD are discussed in Sections 6 and 7, and
described in more detail in the Project Implementation Plan.
The project does not address the capabilities of other institutions involved in the road sector in AP, which
include:
*    The Department of Transport, responsible for vehicle registration, driver licensing, road safety and
regulation of transport services. The department is headed by a Transport Commissioner, also reporting
to the Principal Secretary, Transport, Roads and Buildings.
*    The Panchayats and Zilla Parishads, responsible for design, construction and maintenance of rural and
village roads respectively, under the direction of the Panchayat Raj Engineering Department.
1. Social Assessment :
Major Social Issues: The project is designed to improve road transport efficiency and road safety on major
portions of the AP road network, with direct benefits for transport operators, service providers and general users
as well as the overall state economy. These will also translate into wider social and environmental benefits over
the life of the project. Project preparations have taken explicit account of possible adverse human and
environmental impacts, with a view to mitigation and/or minimization as far as possible.
Participation and Consultation: Preparation of the project has included consultation with stakeholders at
different levels, particularly with people potentially affected by the project. At the local level, group discussions,
participatory mapping of resources and infrastructure, and other methods have been used. Consultations have
been held with local Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), and it is expected that NGOs will play an
important role in the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (see below). Of particular relevance to
long term institutional sustainability is the plan to link up with existing programs and financial institutions in the
public and private sectors to coordinate the work in a complementary fashion, rather than having the project
attempt to establish new institutional mechanisms for which it would have little capacity or comparative
advantage.
Resettlement: Through comprehensive screening and local consultation, the project preparations have
minimized cases where land acquisition may be required, or where there may be other losses of assets or
resources. Land acquisition is not a major issue in this project, as the works will stay largely within the existing
road right-of-way (ROW). However, where temporary or permanent relocation of people is required, or where
the project is likely to cause other types of losses, appropriate resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) action will
be undertaken as an integral part of project preparation and implementation, in accordance with the Bank's
Operational Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement, and the Government of India's guidelines for
environmental assessment of road projects.
In accordance with terms of reference cleared by the Bank, a detailed assessment has been completed for the first
416 km of project roads. This has been done under the coordination of the PCC, working with a local
organization with previous experience in the application of Bank R&R requirements. This includes a joint
RBD/Department of Revenue verification of the legal boundaries of the ROW, and a census of people and assets
along the road corridor. This acts as a baseline with verified resources (structures, land, etc.), and provides a cut-
off point for eligibility for compensation or other assistance. It includes privately held assets as well as what is
currently occupied by squatters and encroachers within the ROW.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                  Page 13
Country: India                                                   Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
Following this, a more detailed Socio-Economic Baseline Survey has been undertaken for the roads to be
improved during Phase I. Using the same approach, verification and census have been undertaken for an
additional 806 km to be improved under Phases II and III of the project. Finally, an additional stretch of 125 km
is under consideration for inclusion in the project, subject to satisfactory screening and feasibility studies. If it is
decided to include this road, verification and surveys will be undertaken in a similar manner to roads already
included.
The GOAP has developed an R&R policy suited to the circumstances of this project. The major issue of concern
has been the nature of entitlements to be given to squatters and encroachers under the R&R policy. The
Government is concerned about according legitimacy to people illegally occupying public land. Following
consultations, a framework has been developed which complies with Bank and Government of India guidelines,
but which distinguishes between compensation in cases of land acquisition or other losses of private property,
and rehabilitation and assistance given to squatters and certain of the agricultural encroachers. The Bank has
cleared this framework, and a detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared by the Borrower and
agreed with the Bank.
A summary table of families and individuals affected by the project and entitled to assistance under the
resettlement policy is included below:

The Socio-Economic Baseline Survey for the first 416 km of project roads identified 584 project-affected
families (1.4 families per km). Of these, 347 (59%) are encroachers within the ROW; the rest are title holders.
Because of the linear nature of the project and careful design to avoid displacement, only 5 title holders are likely
to lose more than 25% of their land holdings. None of the title holders will have to be relocated, while 187
squatters will lose their residence and be assisted in relocation. The preliminary figures for Phases II and III also
indicate that socio-economic impacts are likely to be modest. No large scale movements of groups of people are
envisaged, and the project will seek to facilitate people's self-relocation by giving adequate resources and
support, rather than developing clustered resettlement sites.
Vulnerable groups: The project action plan gives targeted support and additional assistance to the more
vulnerable groups, in particular those at high risk of losing economic viability. This is in accordance with the
policy framework adopted by GOAP for this project. The data collected contains information about socio-
economic status, as well as being gender disaggregated.
A separate study has been undertaken to assess whether the project will have an impact on indigenous peoples,
which would require an Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan, in accordance with OD 4.20. This study gives
a comprehensive overview of the situation of tribals in Andhra Pradesh, and the existing legislation related to
them. Based on this study, and the baseline data on existing assets and expected impacts of the project, the study
concludes that no tribal communities will be affected, and that a separate Indigenous People's Development Plan
is not required for this project.

The Resettlement Action Plan includes provision for an experienced Resettlement Officer to be appointed to the
Project Implementation Unit, and supported by RBD and district staff for each road contract. The organizational
framework planned is good, with participation by government officials at different levels, participating NGOs,
and representation by project-affected persons. Working with other agencies with more experience in rural
development programs represents a good approach, since RBD does not yet have experience in undertaking
resettlement programs. Plans are underway to appoint coordinators with relevant experience for the project, and
to set up the institutional mechanisms for collaboration. A training program is planned to develop appropriate
skills where required, and implementation support will be provided by experienced NGOs.
Monitoring and supervision: Socio-economic impacts of the project will be monitored during implementation,
based on two kind of indicators. Input/output indicators will be monitored and reported on internally. Impact
indicators will be monitored by an independent agency twice during the project period; as part of a mid-term
evaluation, and as a final evaluation following completion. Regular supervision and follow up by Bank
specialists are planned.

18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category               0 B
A sectoral Environmental Assessment (EA) was initiated as per the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.01 and
was carried out by international consultants. According to the report, since the majority of the work is restricted
to the existing right-of-way, the direct impact of the road will be restricted to the right-of-way and only limited
land acquisition is expected. The improvements in road services will allow development and improved access to
a large part of the state. The project will also reduce road congestion.
The EA also states that the vast majority of project werks will not cause significant environmental degradation.
The road sites are generally highly modified, free of sensitive areas and with relatively clear right-of-way, except
in urban areas. Some trees will be removed but will be compensated by a generous replanting program. The
project will use normal construction controls to limit damage to the environment.
The EA identified two areas on the project roads which have the potential to impact natural habitats. These are:
(a) the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam (NSS) Sanctuary on Guntur to Kurnool Road - a tiger sanctuary; and (b) the
Sri Venkateswara National Park and Sanctuary (SVNPS) bordering the Madanapalle to Renigunta Road - home
to some endangered species. The EA was submitted to the GOI Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF),
and was cleared subject to the exclusion of both roads. The MOEF clearance further proposed an alternative
route to divert traffic away from the NSS Sanctuary. This will be the subject of feasibility study and
environmental resettlement screening, for possible inclusion in the third phase construction program. It was
agreed that an Environmental Management Plan and updated Resettlement Action Plan acceptable to the Bank
will be a condition of invitation of bids for this or any other proposed new road section. It was further agreed
that the loan proceeds will not be used to widen, strengthen, improve or maintain the road section from Guntur to
Thokapalle unless a link acceptable to the Bank, which bypasses the NSS Sanctuary, is proposed.
While only minimal impact on land use is expected, potential environmental impact include: (i) air and noise
pollution during construction and during operation in urban areas; (ii) dust and smoke from material transport,
crushers and asphalt plants during construction; (iii) pollution from spills of oil, fuel, lubricants, etc.; (iv)
encroachrnent of right-of-way by squatters in urban areas; and (v) operation of borrow areas, quarries and
construction camps. The EA recommends a number of measures which have been incorporated in the design,
construction and operation of the project to minimize adverse impacts. In the design phase, for example,

Country: India                                                          Project Title: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
widening of the road will be done on one side where necessary, to minimize disruption and loss of road side
planting.
During the construction phase, key recommendations which will be included in the construction specifications
are: restoration of borrow pits; seeding of embankment slopes and planting of trees; proper siting of camps and
depots recognizing the potential for long-term or other public usage; safe disposal of solid and liquid wastes
from construction camps; prevention of dust, accidents and vehicular damage through safe diversion of
construction traffic; proper selection, maintenance and operation of equipment to ensure compliance with air,
noise and discharge requirements; installation and maintenance of semi-permeable membranes to prevent
sediment transfer and increase in turbidity near waterbodies; etc. Finally the project will be implemented by
contractors working on behalf of RBD and not by RBD directly. As such, the specifications will be strictly
enforced and closely supervised by consultants with local RBD staff.
On the operational front, an institutional goal is to set up an environmental unit in RBD to provide focus for
environmental concerns and training. In the short-term, an environmental specialist will be included in the
proposed PIU to review the project design for environmental adequacy, monitor the environmental aspects of the
project during construction, and assist with other environmental related matters. The EA also recommends
regular budget provision for completing the replanting of the existing right-of-way areas and for replacement tree
planting. Training needs are also identified and these too will be incorporated in the project.
An Environmental Management Plan was prepared by RBD and agreed with the Bank. The Plan includes
measures for mitigating environmental impacts during construction, monitoring, institutional strengthening and
screening of possible future road components, with indicative budgets and target dates.
Overall, the project will have significant positive environment benefits by reducing dust, noise and air pollution,
increasing productivity/supply of services and improving road safety. Indirectly, it will enhance the overall
development of the region. The positive benefit will be enhanced by incorporation of appropriate mitigation
measures and enhancement actions such as tree planting, traffic separation, and improved right-of-way control.
Over the long-term, environmental institutions will be strengthened to provide focus for environmental concerns
in the responsible agency.

20. Sustainabilitv:
Past GOAP allocations for road maintenance have been well below current Indian norms for sustainable
maintenance of existing roads, and could be more efficiently applied. With increasing maintenance allocations
for the road sector over the last two financial years, GOAP maintenance spending could reach 85 percent of
expected norms. It is not yet clear whether RBD will be able to sustain this level in future years, or strengthen
allocation mechanisms to ensure priority for the core road network. The project includes agreements for
minimizing this funding gap and establishment of improved methods for identifying and prioritizing
maintenance needs and managing maintenance spending.
Improved sustainability of road works also requires more effective management of maintenance practices on the
ground, to ensure timely preservation of assets and value-for-money for works undertaken. These are being
addressed through assistance for strengthened maintenance management procedures, which go beyond office
planning tools to address decision-making, quality control and accountability practices.
Sustainability of the institutional impacts of the project will be strengthened by demonstrated success of
improved contracting, consulting and maintenance management procedures and the resettlement and
environmental action plans, and by the involvement of a wide number of RBD staff in project implementation
and training. The advantages of project-related measures such as the Implementation and Tender Committee,
Project Implementation Unit, Pavement Management System and Financial Management System are likely to be
carried through to other GOAP programs beyond the life of the project.
21. Critical Risks:
The main project risks are identified in the fourth column of Annex 1, and include: (a) delay or inaction on
institutional reforms; (b) cost savings not passed on to users; (c) inadequate maintenance; (d) unresolved traffic
delays; (e) delays in procurement and implementation; (f) delays in site readiness and RAP implementation; (g)
counterpart funding; and (h) problems with contractor or consultant performance.
Institutional reforms are at risk of delays or inaction as key officials, priorities and incentives change after the
project has been established. Similarly, there are risks of (i) poorly designed and/or implemented Road Fund
mechanisms, with the further possibility of inaction and/or diversionary efforts on the planned application of
Road Fund resources; and (ii) jeopardy to the agreed revisions to road maintenance policy and programs, where
stakeholder support might wane (or not be fully mobilized by GOAP), or where special interest groups'
pressures could lead to undesirable compromises on the rational determination of spending prioritization. These
risks are being addressed through emphasis on comprehensive consultations on key initiatives such as the Road
Fund and the RBD re-organization, widespread participation by RBD staff in the implementation of institutional
strengthening program, carefully targeted technical assistance, and consultations with the Bank on the
institutional development action program.
Cost savinga arising from improved roads may not be passed on to road users if transport operations are not fully
competitive or constrained by regulations, or if savings are offset by price increases (e.g. for diesel fuel) or
subsidy reductions (e.g. for passenger fares). This risk is not directly addressed, but will be monitored during the
project.
The discussion of risk minimization continues after the following table.

Maintenance of state highways and major district roads has suffered from inadequate funding and weak controls
on priority-setting and works quality. Maintenance funding, planning and management processes will be
addressed under the project, but effective changes in practice could be constrained by entrenched poor practices,
procedures and vested interests.
Traffic delay reductions from the project could be undermined to some extent by inefficient traffic management
or increased roadside development. These will be addressed under the institutional strengthening component of
the project. Higher-than-expected traffic growth could also reduce time savings, but spread the benefits of road
improvements to more end users.

Delays in project implementation have been a common feature of all road sector project in India, due largely to
slow procurement, but lack of timely decisions, and failure to make construction sites available to contractors.
Section 10 summarizes measures taken during project preparation and design to mitigate this problem, including
(i) agreed standard bid documents and procedures; (ii) improved preparation of designs; (iii) advance
procurement actions and an agreed project execution schedule; (iv) supervision by qualified consultants; (v)
establishment of the high-level Implementation and Tender Committee; and (vi) strengthened RBD procedures
for project monitoring.
Site Readiness and Resettlement Action Plan Implementation: While the organizational framework of the RAP
is good, the institutional capacity to undertake the various activities is yet to be established, and the mechanisms
are not yet in place. Because of the importance of systematic and satisfactory land acquisition and resettlement
to the overall progress of the project, developing the organizational capacity to implement the Resettlement
Action Plan is critical. To minimize this risk, mobilization and contractual arrangements of staff and
participating agencies in the RAP will be closely monitored during project supervision. The RAP procedures
specify that completion of resettlement actions will be certified by the Project Director before any road section is
handed over to contractors for civil works. However because works are primarily on existing roads, large
sections are free of resettlement issues and can be handed over at contract commencement.
Counterpart funding inadequacy or delays could arise during the project, leading to a slowdown in disbursements
and project execution.
Contractor or consultant performance problems have also contributed to implementation delays and problems in
India. The project will include workshops and consultation to strengthen working relationships between
contractors, consultants and clients, and training for RBD staff in the role of the employer in contract
management. The introduction of dispute resolution mechanisms is expected to minimize protracted
disagreements.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
During project preparation, three locations were identified where upgrading of existing roads could affect nearby
sensitive environmental areas. The first of these was eliminated early in the assessment process, due to possible
impacts on a national park and tribal communities in the area, and the availability of an alternative route. The
remaining two areas of natural habitat were more extensively assessed, but were subsequently deleted from the
project during review by the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests. These are discussed in Section 18.

24. Q.h=r:
The Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) will maintain an empowered Implementation and Tender
Committee (ITC) to oversee project implementation, consisting of Principal Secretary, Transport, Roads and
Buildings, Principal Secretary, Works and Projects, Secretary, Finance, and Engineer-in-Chief, Roads and
Buildings. The functions of this committee will include (a) approving contracts based on the recommendations
of the PIU, (b) ensuring inter-departmental coordination within GOAP, and (c) facilitating high-level

govermnent decisions when required.
RBD will produce a quarterly report on implementation progress and proposed action plans for the project,
which will be reviewed by the Implementation and Tender Committee and the Bank.
By March 31 each year: GOAP will ensure funding for non-plan maintenance of a core network of
approximately 10,000 km of State Highways and Important Major District Roads (IMDRs) at not less than 80
percent of the needs established by the Pavement Management System for that year. For this purpose, RBD will
establish a separate budget head for non-plan maintenance of IMDRs, as defined in the Project Implementation
Plan, and undertake an annual PMS analysis of optimal maintenance spending requirements on all state roads.
By March 31 each year: GOAP will report on the proportions of the main state road network classified as being
in good, fair and poor condition, on the proposed maintenance spending for the forthcoming year, and on
progress with strengthening of maintenance management.
GOAP will not use the proceeds of the Loan to widen, strengthen, improve or maintain the road section from
Guntur to Thokapalle unless it proposes a road link, satisfactory to the Bank, bypassing the Nagarjuna Sagar-
Srisailam Sanctuary. Further, with respect to the road sections from Guntur to Thokapalle and from Thokapalle
to Nandyal, and any road section not presently selected for the Project, GOAP will submit an Environmental
Management Plan and a Resettlement Action Plan, satisfactory to the Bank, covering the relevant road section
before inviting bids for works on that section.

Detailed Project Description
1. Road Widening and Strengthening - US$ 400.6 million, including contingencies. This includes:
(a) civil works for widening and strengthening of about 1400 km of high-traffic volume State Highways
and Major District Roads ($373.9 million). Works will be implemented in three phases, with the first
400 km to be invited in June, 1997. Each phase will consist of 3-5 civil works packages, generally of
$15-$45 million.
(b) land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, and utility relocation ($1.4 million). This item
including land acquisition and cash compensation where relevant will be financed by GOAP. Other
costs including rehabilitation assistance, training and monitoring will be financed by the Bank under
Components 3(b) and 3(e) below.
(c) consulting services for:
(i) engineering design, production of bid documents, monitoring of implementation ($2 million).
Designs and bid documents for the second and third phase works will be completed in the first year of
the project, while other components of these services will continue into throughout the project. Initial
expenditures of up to $3.7 million for these services will be financed under the State Roads
Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 4114-IN), and are not included here.
(ii) supervision of civil works ($23.3 million). One supervision package will be invited for the first
phase and no more than two for each of the subsequent two construction phases.
2. Road Maintenance - US$ 73.7 million including contingencies. This includes:
(a) a program to reduce the backlog of periodic maintenance works on about 2000 km of state highways
and major district roads ($64.2 million). Selection criteria would take account of road condition and
traffic volume, emphasizing economic returns on investments, and the selection of roads in condition
suitable for preventative maintenance. Works will be executed by contract with design and supervision
provided by the Roads and Buildings Department, supported by advisory consultant services described
below. Measures to strengthen the effectiveness and value-for-money of periodic maintenance will be
progressively introduced in the second and third years of this program.
(b) a program of pilot demonstration projects, to introduce and test alternative approaches and best
practices for routine maintenance by area contract on 900 km of selected roads ($3.3 million). Three
contracts are proposed, each with a three-year duration, with annual reviews of performance criteria and
implementation arrangements.
(c) emergency maintenance of 20 km of national highway 5 affected by recent cyclone damage ($5
million).

Main Assumptions: Details of the economic analysis are described in "Andhra Pradesh State Highway
project - Economic Evaluation", March 1997, a copy of which is on the project file. Key features are:
*  The unit construction costs were based on the Bill of Quantities developed by the consultant
for the first 400 km of roads for which the detailed design was completed. Base costs were
inflated by 19 % to include physical contingencies, supervision costs, and costs of land
acquisition, R&R and utility relocation. The average cost of US$ 260,000 per kilometer
includes substantial widening and shoulder reconstruction. Maintenance costs were based
on the costs developed during the Road Maintenance Study.
  Net Benefits were evaluated using the Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM) model
developed by the World Bank. This calculates the net reduction in total transportation costs
over the life of the project, taking account of savings in road user costs, primarily vehicle
operating costs and time savings, along with changes in construction and maintenance costs.
User cost savings depend mainly on changes in road roughness, traffic congestion and
operating speeds. Time savings typically counted for 39 % of net benefits.
*  Safety impacts are uncertain due to offsetting effects of improved road standards and
expected higher traffic speeds, and were not considered in the analysis due to lack of data on
both accident occurrence and costs. From similar studies in other countries, it is estimated
that their magnitude in economic terms is likely to be modest relative to other user costs.
*  The benefits of widening to two lanes and paving the shoulders were included in the analysis
through speed-flow equations based on lane and shoulder width. Speeds predicted by the
HDM model were consistent with observations of speeds on the roads. The effects of
narrow roads, non-motorized traffic, pedestrians and roadside activities were reflected in a
"friction" factor affecting traffic speed. Alternative road widths were considered in the
analysis, before adopting the final pavement and shoulder widths.
*  The traffic growth rates used for the first 3 years were estimated based on rates of population
growth and per capita income for passenger traffic, and the rates of growth in agriculture,
mining and industrial production for freight traffic projections. These produced initial
growth rates of 6 to 15 percent, while a 5 % traffic growth rate was used for the remaining
17 years of the analysis period.

* The base case without the project assumes that roads are maintained (potholes patched and
reseals every five years) but not improved over the 20 year evaluation period. In the with-
project case, further pavement strengthening is provided through an overlay when roughness
reaches 8.4 International Roughness Index (IRI). This is somewhat later than would be
provided under optimal maintenance strategies, allowing for some remaining inefficiencies
in state maintenance practices.
* Roads are designed on the basis of current levels of truck overloading, recognizing the
substantial lack of success in introducing improved load enforcement or truck fleet
modernization in India.
* For the maintenance component, the HDM model was used with a matrix of 36 "typical
links" having varying traffic volume and road condition, using information on overall
network lengths in each category. Alternative maintenance strategies were considered for
each cell in the matrix, to arrive at an overall priority maintenance program within budget
constraints.
Sensitivity Analysis: (for the widening and strengthening component) The major risk affecting
economic analysis is cost increases due to delays in implementation and site readiness, as discussed in
Section 21. This was reflected by an assumed average one-year delay in opening of all works, with a
commensurate increase in costs and delay in the benefit stream. Sensitivity to changes in future
maintenance practices were relatively small, as they mainly affect user costs in the later years of the
evaluation period. Macroeconomic problems could also lead to reduced traffic growth and
implementation delays. Other risks associated with cost overruns, inadequate maintenance, or low
traffic growth are assessed in terms of possible overall cost increases and benefit reductions in the
following table:

Base Case                   27 %                     463
Opening delayed one year           24 %                     345
Benefits decreased by 20 %          23 %                    319
Benefits decreased by 30 %          21 %                    247
Cost increased by 20%             24 %                    410
Cost increased by 30%             23 %                    385
Benefits down 20% and costs up 20%      20 %                     267
Switching values of critical items: the cost of widening and strengthening works would have to increase
by 179 percent or the benefits to drop by 64 percent before the NPV would fall to zero.
Distribution of benefits: All income groups use state roads, as travelers and as suppliers and consumers of
goods and services. Without the project, high transport costs would continue to affect prices and availability of
services to the community, and would constrain economic development at all levels. With the project, transport
costs will decrease, travel times to main centers will reduce, and services such as electricity, health, education,
and agricultural extension are more likely to become available in rural areas. The trucking industry in Andhra
Pradesh is competitive, and is likely to pass on the benefits of operating cost savings through freight rates and
extended services. Bus services are primarily provided by the state; even if fares are not reduced, the extent and
schedules of bus services are likely to respond to changes in road capacity and quality.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Civil works for widening and strengthening will generally be procured by International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), except for one contract less than $10 million to be procured by
National Competitive Bidding (NCB). The works will be implemented in three phases with
contract packages sized to be of interest to international contractors. Pre-qualification has been
invited for phase I, the first three contract packages ranging from $ 15 to $ 45 million. The
outcome of this PQ may suggest that some changes for the packaging may be required. One
Phase II package with an estimated value of less than $10 million will be procured by NCB. All
civil works will be procured using Bank Standard Bid Documents.
Civil works for maintenance will consist of:
(a) NCB Contracts for periodic maintenance works in packages of $0.5 to $2.5 million, and
one package for emergency maintenance with a value of $5 million, for an aggregate value of
$ 70 million procured by NCB.
(b) Other Pilot demonstration contracts for area routine maintenance with aggregate value of
$ 3.3 m. Pilot works if required up to $0.2 million will be procured on the basis of quotations
obtained from at least three qualified domestic firms.
Equipment and related services for office modernization and road management systems in
conjunction with institutional strengthening will be procured by a combination of NCB and
Local shopping as appropriate on a case by case basis.
Consulting services will be procured according to Bank guidelines and will be provided for:
(i) construction supervision for widening and strengthening works (3-5 packages - one or two
for each phase of 3-5 construction contracts)
(ii) design of remaining works and assistance with project coordination and development of
strengthened project management procedures (1 package)
(iii) assistance with development and implementation of improved maintenance procedures
(1 package)
(iv) technical assistance to reform and strengthen the Roads & Buildings Department (1
package). It is envisaged that twinning proposals will be invited from selected international
highway departments and that evaluation will include visits to each of the responding
institutions.
