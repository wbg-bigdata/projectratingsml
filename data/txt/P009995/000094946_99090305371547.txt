1 BACKGROUND AND WORK PROGRAMME
1.1    Background
The Government of India, with the assistance of the World Bank, has embarked on a major
progranmme to improve the country's transport infrastructure. Under this programme, the
Government of Andhra Pradesh sought loan assistance from the World Bank for improving the
state's roads. In early 1994, the Andhra Pradesh Roads and Buildings Department (APRBD),
on behalf of the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, engaged consultants to undertake a feasibility study
of 3178km of roads to identify a priority 1400km that would be improved' under the Andhra
Pradesh State Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (referred to as the Project). The
feasibility study was completed in 1997, identifying about 1400km of roads for upgrading.
In accordance with the Government of India's requirements (EIA Notification, May 1994), the
Environmental Assessment (entitled Environmental Analysis in the SMEC report) for these
identified road sections was prepared, on behalf of the APRBD, by Snowy Mountain
Engineering Corporation Pvt. Ltd., Australia (SMEC) and Consulting Engineering Service Pvt.
Ltd., India (CES). Both the Environmental Assessment Report and draft of the engineering
feasibility study were submitted in November 1996 to the Ministry of Enviromnent and Forests
(MOEF) to seek environmental clearance. These documents were examined by the Ministry of
Environment and Forest's (MOEF) Expert Committee in December 1996.
In March 1997, the MOEF granted environmental clearance (letter no. J-21012/12/96-IA-IH
dated March 5, 1997 see Annexure I) to the project overall but imposed a set of strict
conditions. Generally, the conditions in the March 1997 letter addressed the entire 1400 kmn of
road under study in the SMEC-CES reports, but focused on the ecological and socio-economic
impacts of the proposed widening of the project roads which pass through protected areas and
reserved forests. One of the key conditions stipulated by the expert committee was to add the
Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli road and drop the Atmakur to Thokapalli section which fronts the
Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve to the north and the Gundla Brahmeswaram (GBM) Sanctuary to
the south. This road was dropped from consideration.
An expert sub-committee constituted by the MOEF visited the project sites flagged in the
MOEF's letter (No. J-21012/12/96-IA-II dated March 5' 1997) from June 10 - 14 1997. Based
on the observations and recommendations made by the sub-committee during the site visit,
additional conditions (Annexure I) were placed on the project (vide MOEF letter no. J-
21012/12/96-AmI) on Sept. 18, 1997. This second set of conditions was much more detailed
and wide-ranging, and included requirements for the completion of a techno-feasibility study
including an environmental analysis of the Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli road section. The
existing mapping showed this road as passing along the southern boundary of the GBM
Sanctuary as well as the Pacherla Reserved Forest to the south. As a result, the sub-committee
reemphasized the analysis of impacts on wildlife. The environmental analysis, as specified by
the sub-committee, was undertaken by Kirloskar Consultants Ltd. and specifically addressed the
Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli road section. This study resulted in the Techno-Economic
Feasibility Report (Kirloskar, 1997), which was submitted by the consultants to the APRBD in
December 1997. The report has been retained by the APRBD for developing the Environmental
Management Plan that is to be submitted to the MOEF in support of the environmental
documentation already on file and as a requirement for project appraisal by the World Bank,
prior to committing loan assistance.
In late March 1998, representatives of The World Bank and Canadian Environmental
Collaborative Ltd. (CEC) asked the Wildlife Institute of India (WIT) to examine the
environmental and wildlife issues related to this project and to assist the APRBD in resolving
the concerns raised by the MOEF (Annexure I). WIT was contracted by CEC Ltd., to lead a joint
'Improved meant widening, strengthening and minor realignments of existing road sections
I



effort to advise and assist the APRBD in addressing the project-wide generic issues and
concerns raised by the MOEF, focussing primarily on the Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli road.
1.2   Work Programme
The work consisted of the planning and execution of the field trip and preparation of the
guideline document for the APRBD, which would help them to fully comply with all
environmental and social requirements of the project. The field trip, undertaken jointly by WII
and CEC, included meetings with the MOEF (Delhi), an intensive site visit, and preparation of
this documentation. A detailed itinerary of the field visit is presented in Annexure II. Following
the field trip, intensive analysis and writing was completed, making certain that all conditions
set by the MOEF had been dealt with and that the APRBD was being provided with a clear
'road map' for implementation of all mitigative measures.
2 NANDYAL-GIDDALUR-THOKAPALLI ROAD PROJECT
The Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli Project Road is 132 Ikn long and runs between State
Highways 53 and 54, linking the towns of Nandyal, Giddalur, Markapur and Thokapalli (Figure
1). A 108km-long section of this road is proposed to be widened from an existing 5m to a 7m
carriageway width, with a further 1.25m soft shoulder on each side. The remaining 24krn
stretch (chainage 151/0 to 175/0), which falls within the reserved forests, will only be
strengthened within the existing 5.5 to 6.5m-wide pavement, for its entire length. The
strengthening of the existing pavement involves the placement of an overlay consisting of 5cm-
thick bituminous macadam and a 4 cm-thick asphaltic concrete. All activities related to the
strengthening of the road section running through the forest lands will remain confined to within
the existing roadway width ranging from 8 to 10m. All preparatory work, such as asphalt
mixing and aggregate extraction, will be done outside the 24km forested section. The NGT
road was built during the British colonial period and has been in use ever since, thus has been a
well established geographic feature of the reserved forest areas for the past half century or
more.
No land would be acquired in the forested section of this road, while in the non-forest section,
2.4ha of additional land, in areas that are currently in agricultural production, will be needed.
As per the details provided by the project authorities, there are 3 major and 16 minor bridges
along the project road, all of which are in good condition. A few minor bridges in the hilly
(Ghat) section are old brick arch bridges and need to be replaced by reinforced concrete slab
bridges. There are 14 cut stone slab culverts, of which a few need to be replaced. One
causeway with reinforced concrete slab needs to be reconstructed as a minor bridge or culvert.

2.1    Environmental Issues Associated with the NGT Road
Road projects have been recognized as major threats to conservation of wildlife habitats and
species. The greatest impacts are loss of habitat and direct physical danger to wildlife, which
are the result of:
* Conversion of wildlife habitat for use in road rights-of-way;
* Fragmentation and degradation of contiguous wildlife habitat;
* Interruption of wildlife movements and migration due to careless RoW placement;
* Collisions with vehicles; and
* Improved access for poachers.
This road project was therefore closely scrutinized by the MOEF for its likely impact on the
natural environment. The MOEF's conditions (see Annexure I) included the exclusion of three
roads from further consideration due to their location in highly sensitive forest areas, and
inclusion of the NGT road as a replacement. Subsequent directives (see Annexure I) required
the completion of a techno-economic feasibility study and environmental analysis of the NGT
road, including a focus on wildlife issues.
2.2    Resettlement Issues Associated with the NGT Road
Because the proposed road improvements along the NGT road involve only minimal changes in
alignment, the need for resettlement of people living along the road has been kept to a
mninimum. It should be noted, however, that the MOEF calls for the completion of a
rehabilitation plan for the people relocated as a result of the project in its letter dated March 5I,
1997 (Annexure 1). Social and resettlement issues arising from this project were not examined
in detail during this study. The resettlement needs of this project are covered in a separate
Resettlement Action Plan.
2.3    The Techno-Economic Feasibility Study
The Techno-Economic Feasibility (TEF) Study, completed by Kirloskar Consultants Ltd.
(1997), was prepared as the key response of the APRBD to the MOEF's conditions. Section 6
of the TEF Report, the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), was examined in terms of how
well it covered the issues raised by the MOEF and the provision of an adequate level of detail
on technical points. This report provides supplementary information on the relative locations of
the project road and sensitive habitats, sources of impacts, and appropriate mitigative measures.
3 FIELD OBSERVATIONS
The following points represent major observations that help in clarifying the issues raised by the
members of the Expert Committee of the MOEF and suggest the necessary steps needed to
satisfy the conditions placed on the Nandyal-Giddalur-Thokapalli section of the project.
3.1    Location of NGT Road in Relation to Reserved Forests and Sanctuaries
The project road meets National Highway 18 at point 192/5192 of the Ongole-Nandyal road
(283/000 of NH 18) at its westerly end near Nandyal, and intersects State Highway 50 at its
easterly terminus at Thokapalli (148/000 of State Highway No. 50). See Figure 1. About 24 km
of the Project road (Iam 151/000 to 175/000) falls in reserved forest areas, of which km 155/000
to 164/200 is in the Ghat section (Plate 2).
For the 24 km that the NGT road passes through the reserved forests, it does not traverse
through any protected area (i.e. national park or sanctuary). The road does not traverse through
192/519 refers to Km 192 of the total distance of 519 kan.

any part of the GBM Sanctuary, although it does skirt its southern boundary for approximately
1.5 km near Compartments no. 532 and 487 of the Chelama Range (see Figure 2). The NGT
road also skirts the boundary of reserved forests just outside the boundary of the GBM
Sanctuary in Compartment no. 681 of Uyyalavada Reserved Forest. The alignment of the NGT
road (Figure 2) does not intersect or pass by any designated wildlife reserves-.
The NGT road corridor outside the 24 km stretch has no significant wildlife habitat. The
unforested sections of the road pass through barren land, agricultural fields and built-up land,
which makes up the predominant land use. The 2.4 ha of land required for new alignments falls
within this unforested area. Major settlements along the project road include the townships of
Giddalur, Pacherla, Gajulapalle, Bestavari Peta and Kambham.

3.2    Environmental Implications of NGT Road Improvements
3.2.1   Conservation values
The dry deciduous mixed forests of Tectona grandis, Pterocarpus marsupium, Terninalia
tomentosa, Albizzia spp., Anogeissus latifolia, Dalbergia sissoo, Boswellia serrata, and
bamboo, which describe most of the reserved forest areas along the NGT road, are home to a
large number of endangered species listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
These include tiger, panther, hyena, jungle cat, sloth bear, mouse deer, pangolin, giant squirrel,
python and marsh crocodile. These forests also support good populations of bonnet macaque,
sambar, chital, nilgai, chowsingha, chinkara, and monitor lizard. Wild dogs are also reported to
occur in these forests. During the field visit to the GBM Sanctuary and the adjacent reserved
forests, the presence of chital, monitor lizard and giant squirrels could be confirmed by direct
sightings. As per the records of the census conducted by the Forest Department, 17 tigers and 7
leopards were reported in the Nandyal Forest Division (which includes the entire study area) in
1997. Indirect evidence of sambar, nilgai and hyena could also be observed during the
reconnaissance survey of the area (Plate 3).
The existing NGT road, established more than 50 years ago, is not a barrier to movement of
animals. The contiguity of the habitat on both sides of the road has been largely maintained, as
is evident from observations and reported movements of animals in the larger conservation area,
which includes the GBM Sanctuary and Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve to the north of the road, as
well as the reserved forests of the Pacherla Beat of the Chelama Range to the south. During the
field visit chital were observed freely crossing the road and evidence of sambar was found on
both sides of the road.         BOX 1. Construction of a New Rail Line within the Sanctuary
3.2.2   Habitat                 The old narrow gauge railway line alignment abutting the southem

The project wl  T   S           line in 1996. This line connects Vijayawada to Guntakal, and the rail

either side of the existing   the existing NGT road in terms of its visible impact upon the conservation

relation to the rail project, the proposed road improvement activities,
should occur so long as road   limited to within the existing RoW, are barely measurable. Fortunately, the
construction is carried out as   relatively minor nature of activities proposed for the NGT road project, in
described in the IEE  and   addition to the fact that it has been subjected to environmental review and
Feasibility Study (Kirloskar  rmitigative measures have been proposed, means that it will not have such

habitat will not be affected.
Since no widening is being proposed in the 24 km section through the forest, no trees will be
cut. Clearing will be restricted to the removal of shrubs etc. from the road edges and the
trimming of branches of trees overhanging the carriageway.
3.2.3 Hydrology
The road improvement activities will not alter the local hydrology and flooding regime, since no
new catchments will be intercepted.
3.2.4 Road-Kills, Obstruction of Movement and Poaching
One of the direct impacts of road improvement is likely to emanate from the increase in traffic
on the NGT road. The traffic projections for the NGT road indicate a substantial increase in the
Passenger Car Units (PCU) from 2065 per day in 1997 to 4884 in 2010, just in the Giddalur-
7



Nandyal section (Kirloskar, 1997). This traffic volume increase is not related to the road
improvement, but rather to the overall growth in vehicle numbers in Andhra Pradesh. Increases
in volume could lead to (I) increased incidences of animals being hit and killed by vehicles; (2)
obstruction in the movement of wild animals; and (3) increased probability of poaching and
illegal exploitation of resources by road users.
1. Road kills
The mortality of animals resulting from animal-vehicle collisions has been well
documented (Bennett, 1990; Adam and Geis, 1983; Robinson, 1976) and has been of
concern to conservation biologists throughout the world. The efforts to collect
information on road kills or poaching incidences on the NGT road met with practically
no success. The only information is the anecdotal recollections of the local people who
estimated the numbers of road kills to be about five per year. These observations are
based on kills of large animals as the smaller mammals, birds and reptiles killed would
have remained unobserved and must have been overlooked in these estimations. None
of these recollections involved tigers. Roads passing through protected areas tend
generally to experience higher incidences of animal mortality, since these areas
naturally have a higher density of animals that frequently use the roads for movement
into adjacent habitats. Roads like the one in question are expected to be sparingly used
by animals, since a) the roadside areas are not part of protected areas3, and b) the
roadside forest tracts are heavily exploited, with human presence evident well over 1
kni from the road edge. Such heavily modified habitat generally does not attract wild
animals, but merely provides a corridor between preferred habitats. Other factors likely
to deter animals from using the road are noise, movements, emissions and flashing
lights.
A somewhat analogous situation can be found along a section of state highway between
Mohund and Dehradun in the State of Uttar Pradesh that separates the Rajaji National
Park from the adjoining patch of forest of the Mohund Block. Animals abound in the
Park. The incidences of road kills on this section are surprisingly low considering the
volume of traffic this road receives (many times greater than along the NGT road). The
low incidence of road kill is likely attributable to the Mohund Block being a heavily
exploited area and thus not attractive as wildlife habitat. The Park provides good habitat
and wildlife remain there. From this comparison, it is possible to infer that wildlife will
likely choose the higher-quality habitat in the interior portions of the reserved forests
along the NGT over the lower-quality habitat along the roadside, and will thus tend to
feed and seek shelter well back from the road4.
2. Obstruchon
The age of the existing road, the minor nature of the proposed improvements (few
changes to vertical alignment), and observations of free movement of animals across
the road suggest that obstruction to movement and restriction of habitat, as a result of
the road improvements, will be negligible. In particular, movements of large predators
such as tigers and leopards, and their prey, will not be restricted.
3. Poaching and illegal resource exploiation
Even though specific poaching data were not available, it is our contention that the
upgrading of the NGT road will not provide a stimulus to increased poaching, since
speed limits will not change and road hazards, which make high-speed getaways very
3Local residents are permitted to harvest bamboo and other forest products from the RFs on both sides of the road,
and their presence was evident everywhere along the road.
4The APRBD needs to weigh carefully the benefits of habitat restoration against the risk of increasing road kill as a
result of attracting wildlife to newly-restored roadside habitat areas.

risky, will remain virtually unchanged. No clearing will take place and access to game
will not change.
4 MITIGATIVE MEASURES
Our analysis of the environmental issues suggests that this road improvement project, confined
as it is to within the existing limits of the RoW, is likely to result in fairly modest impacts.
Nevertheless, the importance of wildlife conservation advocates the need to develop a set of
mitigative actions that will avoid or minimize the likelihood of serious impacts during the
planning, construction and operation of the road. The proposed mitigative measures are
expected to provide adequate protection to the wildlife ecosystem potentially affected by the
road. These measures are described below.
4.1    Traffic
The induced impacts associated with increased traffic on the improved road can be overcome by
a variety of measures, e.g., imposition of tolls to discourage/divert non-essential traffic, and the
imposition of speed limits along the forested section of the road. For reducing the blinding
effect of oncoming vehicles, the luminous intensity of the headlights of vehicles using the road
can be reduced by enforcing the use of hoods on headlights. In India, this reduction in the
intensity of headlights is being achieved by painting the upper halves of the headlight surfaces
black.
4.2    Road Kills
Particular attention must be given to identifying and protecting regular crossing points and
migratory corridors of wildlife, through the use of well-placed signage requiring drivers to use
extra caution. Along the section where the NGT road abuts Compartments no. 532 and 693 of
the Chelamna and Kambham Ranges of the GBM Sanctuary and Compartment no. 681 of
reserved forest outside the GBM, fencing at particularly active crossing sites, as identified by
the Forest Department,. could effectively reduce the possibility of road hit However, due to the
relative lack of confirmed knowledge of the effects of wildlife fencing on wildlife population
dynamics', this mitigative measure should be applied only when absolutely necessary.
4.3   Illegal Exploitation of Resources
Organized vehicle checks at specially-set-up checkpoints at the entry and exit of the forested
section of the NGT road would help to control the illegal exploitation of resources. Contract
clauses and temporary fencing should be helpful in limiting the spread of support facilities into
the forested areas along the road during construction, and would discourage workers from
exploiting the forest resources.
4.4    Animal Migration
The design and location of existing bridges and underpasses in the forest and Ghat (hilly)
section of the NGT has already ensured that animal crossings in the forested area (Plate 5)
remain unhindered. This mitigative action was taken some time ago. In other areas along the
road that are established animal crossing points, fencing during construction will keep large
mammals from direct contact with hazardous substances and also from being on the road during
construction. Subsequently, signage can be put up at these points to indicate animal crossing
points. Speed breakers can also be constructed at suitable locations to further ensure speed
control.
FoT example, in Banff National Park, Canada, it was found that roadside fencing erected to reduce road kills,
especially of elk, actually introduced changes to predator-prey relationships when coyotes discovered that the fences
could be used to corner elk and make capture easier.

4.5    Construction Activities
Timing of road operations outside the monsoon season will prevent the impacts of soil erosion
and water pollution.
It would be useful if the APRBD were to instruct their consultant to incorporate this list of
mitigative measures into the revised IEE. The successful implementation of the proposed
mitigative measures will greatly depend on close coordination between the APRBD and the
Nandyal and Giddalur Forest Divisions of the APFD, as well as the district administration. To
that end we propose that the APRBD's environmental officer organize a meeting with the
Nandyal and Giddalur Forest Divisions of the APFD every two months, to brief them on events
and to seek assistance with all aspects of road planning and design that may impinge on wildlife
management. These meetings should be recorded and kept on file by the APRBD.
5   ACTIONS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
RAISED BY THE MOEF ON THE ANDHRA PRADESH STATE
HIGHWAY PROJECT
All the conditions stipulated by the MOEF have been carefully examined by WII-CEC. The list
of the MOEF's conditions was transferred into a matrix table, with each condition in a separate
row (Table 1). For each condition an analysis and a set of actions were described such that the
APRBD could, at a glance, see the actions being proposed by WII-CEC (or those actions
already completed) to meet the conditions stipulated by the MOEF (see Annexure I).
We recommend that the APRBD undertake these actions according to a schedule set up by its
enviromnental officer. The schedule should be based on the column entitled "Time Frame" in
Table 1 and would most effectively be presented as a bar chart with time along the horizontal
axis and the conditions and stipulations as defined in Table I-colurn 1 on the vertical axis.

6   CONSULTATION AND CONCLUSIONS
6.1    Wrap-up Meeting Summary
A wrap-up meeting for the field visit was held on April 27' 1998 to discuss the various
findings of the WII-CEC team and to agree on a course of action for the APRBD. The meeting was
held in the office of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Andhra Pradesh Forest
Department (APFD).
The following were present:
Mr. S.D. Mukherjee, IFS Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, APFD
Mr. Murahari Reddy, Engineer-in-Chief, APRBD
Mr. T. Ramakrishna, IFS, Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), APFD
Md. Sultan Moiuddin, IFS, Chief Conservator of Forests (Administration) AP
Mr. Sunil Kumar, IFS, Conservator of Forests, Telegu Ganga Project, APFD
Mr. S.K. Mukherjee, WII Consultant
Dr. V.B. Mathur, WII Consultant
Dr. Asha Rajvanshi, WII Consultant
Mr. Mahendra Reddy, Environmental Officer, APRBD
Mr. Vara Prasad, ACF, APFD
The following are the key conclusions reached:
Mr. Murahari Reddy explained that the Ministry of Environment of Forests (MOEF), Govt.
of India, New Delhi had already accorded environmental clearance to the APRBD road
project proposals, subject to certain environmental conditions to be followed by the project
authorities. He endorsed that the APRBD was committed to adopt appropriate
environmental safeguards. The same would be incorporated in the APRBD contract
documents and would be implemented during the construction and maintenance phases of
the Project. He affirmed that in response to the MOEF's observations, the APRBD had
already excluded the following sections from its consideration (i) Kumoor-Atmakur-Guntur
road, (ii) Atmakur-Nandyal road, (iii) Madanapally-Chandragiri and (iv) Lakshettipet-
Gudihatnur road. He also indicated that no report or communication was needed with the
MOEF at this time, since this was not specified in their letters of March and September
1997 but the APRBD, through their enviromnental officer Mr. Mahendra Reddy, would
keep on file all documentation related to the actions taken to address the conditions.
WMr. S.K. Mukherjee briefed the meeting about the salient findings and actions of the WII-
CEC team during the April 24-26, 1998 site visit.
(i)  a map (1:50,000 scale) showing the location of the NGT road vis-a-vis the boundaries
of reserved forests and GBM Sanctuary was prepared. It is evident from this map that
a distance of at least 50 kmn separates the aligmnent of the NGT road from the nearest
boundary of the Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (RGTR). The alignment also does not skirt
the GBM Sanctuary boundary, except in forest compartments 532, 487 and 693.
(ii)  It was observed during the field visit that between the NGT road section passing
through the Chelama Forest Range of the Nandyal Forest Division and the old railway
meter-gauge track adjoining the boundary of the GBM Sanctuary, a new linear
development in the form of a broad gauge track along with a railway station (New
Chelama) was established in the reserved forests in 1996.
(iii) From the reconnaissance of the NGT Project area, it could be established that the
conservation values of the forest areas falling within the Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve,
GBM Sanctuary, and Nandyal and Giddalur Forest Divisions are comparable, although
no detailed floral-faunal surveys have been conducted by the Forest Department or
scientific organizations.
19



The WII-CEC team summarized its observations and comments (Table 1) on the conditions
stipulated by the MOEF for improved environmental management planning of the APRBD
State Highway Project sites. Discussions took place on the various environmental
conditions stipulated by the MOEF and the actions proposed to be undertaken by the
APRBD & APFD to fulfill the requirements of the MOEF were agreed to and recorded.
(i)   It was affirmed in the meeting that since no forest land was being acquired by
the APRBD for widening of the existing NGT road, clearance under the
Forest Conservation Act, 1980 is not warranted.
(ii)   The PCCF informed that the District Forest Committees would look after all
matters connected with the felling of trees falling within the existing Right of
Way (RoW), wherever necessary.
(iii)   The WIU consultants stressed the need to review the choice of species for
avenue planting which was appended in the project documents, and it was
agreed that this list would be reviewed in consultation with the PCCF, AP
Forest Dept.
(iv)   On the MOEF's condition No. 6.0 (Table 1), pertaining to the transfer of the
Atmakur-Kumool road from the APRBD to the APFD it was pointed out by
the PCCF that such a transfer was not warranted as the necessary expertise to
maintain and repair this road section, involving a Ghat section, was
adequately available with the APRBD. The authorities of the Rajiv Gandhi
Tiger Project would continue to provide the necessary coordination for the
regulation of traffic on this road segment.
(v)    On the MOEF's condition No. 7.0 (Table 1), regarding provisions for
vehicles, communication and weapons to the anti-poaching squad of the
APFD it was stated by the PCCF & CCF (WL) that since the NGT road
project does not include any part of the RGTR area and only marginally
skirts the GBM Sanctuary area, no action was required to be taken up on this
condition.
(vi)   Engineer-in-Chief, APRBD  informed  that a monitoring  committee,
independent of the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) has been
constituted. Mr. Sunil Kumar, CF(TGP) as the representative of the APFD
and the Environmental Officer, APRBD is designated the convener of this
committee.
(i)   It was agreed that the APRBD & APFD would provide the WII-CEC
consultants the necessary documentation and cross references relating to the
compliance of enviromnental conditions stipulated by the MOEF.
6.2    Conclusions
This report is an outcome of the efforts to analyze environmental issues in general, and wildlife issues
in particular, associated with the NGT road. The report also addresses the generic and specific
concerns of the MOEF related to the Andhra Pradesh road project, validates earlier findings of initial
environmental analysis conducted by Kirloskar Consultants, and recommends environmental
safeguards specific to the NGT road.
In general, the WII-CEC team found that the NGT road upgrade as proposed by the APRBD, when
coupled with the mitigative measures proposed in Section 4 and Table I of this report, would result in
essentially no negative effects. None of the road improvement activities proposed for the NGT road's
20



forested (sensitive) section, nor the road's operation, suggest that there will be any significant impact
on tigers, leopards or their prey. The aligmnent, width, and appearance of the road section through
the forested section will not change, thus there will not be a change (from existing conditions) in the
interaction of the road with the wildlife as a result of the upgrade6. If implemented, the mitigative
actions proposed would greatly reduce the net environmental losses over the existing situation, and in
effect improve the ability of the Park staff to control illegal activities and to manage local natural
resources.
The following are the salient findings of the reconnaissance survey:
(i)   The NGT road does not traverse through any national park or sanctuary. The nearest
boundary of the GBM Sanctuary is 2 km from the NGT road, except near Compartments
no. 532 and 693 of Chelama and Kambham Ranges of the above Sanctuary and
Compartment no. 681 of the Uyyalavada Reserved Forest outside the GBM Sanctuary.
(ii)   The alignment of the NGT road does not overlap with the boundaries of the Rajiv Gandhi
Tiger Reserve or any other reserve in Andhra Pradesh.
(iii)  The proposed road surface improvement activities along the NGT road will be confined
to within the spatial limits of the existing right-of-way of the road. Therefore these
activities can only have modest impacts, for which appropriate mitigative measures have
been suggested (see Section 4).
(iv)  Anecdotal statistics on large animal road kills along the NGT road, collected from local
residents, suggested low numbers (4-5/year). Such numbers suggest that this issue is a
minor concern. Although well substantiated data on incidences of road kills and poaching
in this road section are lacking, suitable measures have been proposed in Section 4 to
mitigate these impacts effectively.
(v)   Although the impacts of earth work, water impoundment and clearing of vegetation
associated with this road project are not likely to assume greater significance than those
of the broad gauge railway line project (which has recently been completed), necessary
measures to mitigate the construction phase impacts have been suggested in Table 1.
These impacts, particularly in the 24-km long forest and Ghat section will be negligible.
The conditions imposed by the MOEF for environmental clearance of the project have been
extensively dealt with through a consultative process involving all agencies responsible for the
implementation, management and monitoring of the project and the site environment (See Annexure
Im). The consultative process has been useful in resolving the following key issues linked to the
conditions specified by the MOEF vide their letters (Annexure I).
(a)   Clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 is not warranted since no forest land
is to be acquired.
(b)   Transfer of the Atnakur-Kurnool road from  the APRBD to the APFD is also not
warranted considering that better expertise for handling road repair and maintenance
work is available within the APRBD.
(c)   It is not obligatory on the part of project authorities (APRBD) to strengthen the anti-
poaching squad of the APFD since the project does not include any part of the Rajiv
6 Growth in traffic volume on the road is expected to arise from factors such as general population growth, as opposed to the
road upgrade itself. See Section 4.4 of the Kirloskar Techno-economic Feasibility Report for traffic projections and further
discussion.
21



Gandhi Tiger Reserve or the GBM Sanctuary, nor has the APFD sought any assistance
from the APRBD on this matter.
(d)   The APFD will assist the APRBD in the implementation of safeguards outlined in Section
4 and Table 1 to mitigate impacts on wildlife values and promote wildlife conservation.
The step-by-step actions have been outlined in Table 1. These actions address the issues and
concems expressed by the MOEF and are comprehensive enough to be a useful tool in the
development of the Environmental Action Plan by the APRBD. The END is a prerequisite to World
Bank loan approval.
The success of the mitigative measures hinges on the establishment of a good communication link
between the APRBD and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Andhra Pradesh Department of
Forestry. To that end, the APRBD's environmental officer should be supported by the APRBD in
carrying out all actions related to monitoring and consultation with any agencies. He should also be
given responsibility to alert and train the contractor in the implementation of measures presented here
in this document as well as in the EMP contained in the revised Techno-Economic Feasibility Report
to be prepared by Kirloskar Consultants.
