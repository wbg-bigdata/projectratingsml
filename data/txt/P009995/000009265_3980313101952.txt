Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project                                  Executive Summary
Executive Summary
An environmental review of the roads to be constructed under the Andhra Pradesh State
Highways Project (APSHP) has been carried out by the Snowy Mountains Engineering
Corporation (SMEC) as part of the services it has provided as the Project Coordinating
Consultant (PCC).
V           The APSHP provides an opportunity for the establishment of environmentally sound road
construction practices in Andhra Pradesh, at a time when expenditure on road infrastructure is
expected to increase rapidly. The project is a rural roads project and will involve a new generation
of highway construction technology and contracting procedures for Andhra Pradesh. It is-
important, therefore, that adequate attention and resources are given to environmental concerns
throughout the project cycle.
i          This report contains the findings of the environmental review together with recommendations for
measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of the project and to enhance the positive impacts. The
r           report also makes recommendations that will allow the Roads and Buildings Departnent (R&B)
to continue ecologically sound road improvements in the longer term.
The roads assessed in this report are listed in Tablel.

Andhlra Pradesh State Higlhways Project                            Executive Summary
'l l       The proposed work under the project will involve repair of damaged pavements, strengthening,
widening, drainage structures and furnishings, with a limited number of bypasses and minor
realignments.
Since the majority of the work is restricted to the existing Right-of-Way (ROW) the direct impact
will be spatially restricted and limited land acquisition is expected. The improvements in road
services will have, however, widespread impact in allowing development and improved access
to a large part of the state. Positive benefits from reduced congestion will occur.
A summary of anticipated levels of the impact of APSHP is given in Table 2.

Based on the inspections undertaken and analysis of information available, the vast majority of
the APSHP will not cause significant environmental degradation. The sites are generally highly
modified, free of sensitive areas and with relatively clear Rights-of-Way, except in urban areas.
3 |         Some trees will need to be removed but will be compensated for by a generous replanting
programme. Normal construction controls will be used to limit any environmental damage to
water, air or terrestrial ecosystems.

Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project                           Executive Summary
There are however, two areas on the project roads that have the potential for significant
conversion or degradation of critical, or other, natural habitats. The sensitive areas are:
r  .  Kawal Sanctuary on Road 2(a) from Lakshettipet to Gudihatnoor. This is a tiger
sanctuary.
*     Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuary on Road 2(b) from Guntur to Kurnool. This is a
tiger sanctuary.
Tigers are listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species and as such their survival is of
national and international importance. Each of the two sites may house other endangered
species.
In terms of World Bank classification, under Operational Directive 4.01, the project would
therefore fall within Category A, and the two sensitive sites will require a full environmental
impact assessment (EIA). Draft terms of reference for this EIA are included in the report.
ii         Other key outcomes of the environmental review are:
Environmental input should continue throughout the project and be available for all future
projects. This can best be done by establishment of an environment unit within R&B with
specific assistance to that unit provided by domestic and international advisers. Road
planning and design needs to ultimately integrate environmental factors as part of the
normal planning and management process. The development of a full environmental unit
will not occur immediately and will be a lonaterm objective An environmental officer
should, howeverq be included in the proposed APSHP cell immediately.
|   *  Enhancement of the environment through roadside planting is a potentially valuable
I                outcome of the APSHP. Details of roadside planting and landscaping will be included in
the Contract Specifications.
*     Awareness of environmental issues in the road construction industry in AP is at a very
early stage. Environrmental training is therefore recommended for a variety of personell
involved in the construction of the project.
;   *  The 1995 IRC Road and Bridge Works specification provides a number of clauses which
3 |              address protection of the environment concerns. A series of additional clauses are
recommended to be included in the contract documentation for the project to ensure that
adequate construction controls are available. These stress the erteIirements

Andhlra Pradesh State Highways Project                        Executive Summary
|l   *  The project will have a significant long tern impact on road safety, particularly with
repect to non motorised transport (NMT). A pilot safety study to enhance the safety of
fl               NMT is recommended for inclusion in the project.
The APSHP is a rural roads project and is not intended to deal with urban conditions.
Bypasses of major urban areas require detailed study to determine the impacts on the
environment, affected people, traffic, economics and the community as a whole. These
studies are considered to be outside the PCC's scope of work. Subsequently, it is
recommended that where urban areas are large, no work will occur inside towns. In
smaller towns, where practical, the road will be strengthened to a width which minimises
or preferably avoids the need for relocation of project affected people.
*     Local administrations and other service providers such as electricity and telephone
authorities should be consulted as a matter of routine proceedure during the design of
R&B projects.
Summary of Initial Action Recommended
In order to ensure that Government of India policies are addressed and environmental concerns
are fully taken into account in the APSHP, the following recommendations are made for
immediate action:
I          *     Complete EIA on critical natural habitats and implement recommendations made in the
EIA. The EIA has to be completed before project appraisal by the World Bank currently
progranmmed for September 1996. It is recommended that a consultant is appointed to
i                carry out the work immediately. It is estimated that the EIA will take approximately 6
weeks to complete.
I          *     Implement institutional reform recommendations within R&B. A programme for the
implementation is included in the PCC's Draft Institutional Review Report.
|          *     Include recommendations for enhancement and protection of the environment in the
contract documents. This work should be carried out as part of the project documentation
and should be completed by project appraisal.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                             1. Introduction
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Project Background
In early 1994 the Roads and Buildings Department (R & B), on behalf of the Government of
rl         Andhra Pradesh (GoAP), commissioned 6 local consultants to identify sections of State Highways
and Major District Roads, and to report where reduced carriageway width and/or pavement
deterioration constrained traffic capacity. The consultants reports were combined into a Strategic
rl         Options Study in April 1994 in which some 3000 km of roads were identified as high priority.
Following a World Bank (WB) agreement, four local consultants were commissioned in May
1995 to prepare detailed road inventories and feasibility studies for these priority roads. The
IU        study included the collection of environmental information necessary for an assessment of the
environmental impact of the APSHP in accordance with Ministry of Environment (India)
Guidelines, as well as land acquisition and resettlement plans.
In June 1995 the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) signed a contract with the
R & B on behalf of the GoAP to act as the Project Co-ordinating Consultant (PCC) to carry out
an economic evaluation of the 3000 km of roads. From the economic evaluation 1400 km of road
was identified for upgrade funded through a WB loan. SMEC is currently carrying out the survey
3          and detailed design of an initial 400 km of high priority road. Included in this consultancy is an
environmental impact assessment which is contained in this report. In July 1995 the PCC issued
a guideline document to the local consultants to supplement the Terms of Reference, outlining
3          the type of environmental information required (see Annexure 1). This was to complement
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) Guidelines and to ensure that environmental
factors were considered in the recommendations for road improvement work and conceptual
I          designs. Subsequently, the World Bank sought a more substantial social assessment, in order to
proceed to a Resettlement Action Plan.
I          The local consultant's Feasibility Study reports varied markedly, regarding the attention given
to the specific environmental impacts of proposals and the extent of relevant baseline information.
*          The PCC's First Interim Report submitted in December 1995 identified which roads should be
included in the 1400 km of project roads and included a draft Environmental Assessment of the
|          recommended roads.
The Environmental Assessment second draft of the recommended 1400 km of road was submitted
3          to R&B in March 1995. Comments made on that draft have been addressed in this revision of
the report.
3          In April 1996, R&B requested that three additional sections of road, not considered in the
Feasibility Study reports undertaken by the local consultants in 1995, be included in the roads
3 |        to be considered for construction as part of the project. The additional roads to be included are:

*~  Madanapalli-Chandragiri-Renigunta (128 km)
Renigunta-Nayadupeta (56 km)
Puttur-State Border (22.5 km)
At the time of writing, the economic and technical feasibility studies of the additional three roads,
being undertaken by local consultants, had not been completed. The choice of the final 1400 km
of road to be included in the project has therefore not been finalised. To allow early submission
of this Environmental Analysis, all of the roads that will be considered for inclusion in the project
(the originally recommended 1400 km plus the additional three roads) have been analysed for
environmental impacts. This report presents an environmental impact assessment for each of
these roads, based on the inventory material collected, inspection and supplementary analysis.
A degree of emphasis is given to the 400 km being proposed under Phase I. The general purpose
of the environmental assessment is to improve the decision making in the selection of priority
roads, by including a valuation for mitigation measures, and to ensure that the environmental
consequences are taken into account throughout the project cycle, and any adverse impacts are
either minimised or eliminated. All the roads covered in this report were inspected with similar
concerns and conditions applying to each section.
Locations of the roads evaluated in this report are given in Figure 1.1. Clearly the coastal routes
are currently the most accessible and the project roads are designed to complement the coastal
road system by linking it with areas to the north and west.

Andlhra Pradesh State Highway Project                            1. Introduction
The State roads in Andhra Pradesh which have limited carriageway width and maintenance, will
continue to deteriorate as traffic volumes and loads increase. Design speeds can rarely be
maintained due to surface condition, congestion and encroachments. Vegetation growth on
shoulders and the erosion of verges has reduced road serviceability, and contributes to a relatively
high accident rate.
The stated objective for the APSHP project is;
To reduce the total cost of road transport in Andhra Pradesh by improving road
conditions and capacity, along with R&Bs in-house capabilities to design, manage and
operate the road network.
Costs of vehicle damage, additional fuel usage and delays as a result of road condition and
pt        congestion are evaluated in the economic assessment for the project.
1.2 Institutional, Legal and Policy context
11        The Roads and Buildings Department (R&B), of the Andhra Pradesh Public Works Department,
has responsibility for the construction and maintenance of 45,452 km of the state road network.
The Engineer-in-Chief (A & E) currently has responsibilities for both National Highways (on
behalf of the National Highways Authority), State and District roads, and has a headquarters in
Hyderabad with a decentralised implementation structure based on District Circles.
The APSHP focuses on State Highways and Major District Roads. At the present time, no
planning win1g or specific environment unit exists within either R&B, nor the Ministry of Surface
I         Transport (MOST) which has national coordination functions. The Transport Department has
licensing, vehicle registration and control functions. The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport
Corporation (APSRTC) is the main public road transport operator in the state. The Police
I         Department has legal powers in relation to operations and activity on the road Right-of-Way
(ROW). Local government, municipal and town development authorities may control road
sections within built-up areas, and District Commissioners have overall administrative
coordination and land control functions at the district level.
In June 1994 the R&B Department had approximately 17,700 employees. Road construction and
maintenance is managed through 12 Circles in the Roads Wing, each headed by a Superintending
Engineer with up to 6 Executing Engineers controlling District operations. Separate Circles exist
3 |       for ADB construction work and Cyclone Rehabilitation work. This APSHP project spans 13 of
21 Districts in Andhra Pradesh. Separate District administrations which are involved for each
Circle, will be important to the APSHP project in terms of their coordination, land registration
and general administrative control duties. A Chief Engineer (Design and Planning) position exists
but advice was that this is primarily involved in national highways and building work. No policy
statements nor corporate plans are known to exist.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                              1. Introduction
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) has overall responsibility for administration
and implementation of government policy in respect to conservation, ecologically sustainable
development and pollution control. The government concern for the environment has been
promulgated through the National Conservation Strategy, National Forest Policy and the Policy
for Abatement of Pollution (1992). MOEF which is responsible for various action plans and
5          programs, research, funding and guidelines has representation in Andhra Pradesh. India is a
signatory to all the major international Conventions and Protocols with respect to the
environment, and was a major participant at UNCED 92.
Key domestic legislation includes;
*        . *      The Environmental Protection Act, 1986
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
1           *     The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
_  .  The Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991
"   *  The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
A key document under the Environmental (Protection) Act (No.29 of 1986) is the Handbook of
Environmental Procedures and Guidelines (1994) which outlines the requirements for
environmental clearance of new development proposals, as part of the New Industrial Policy.
This states that, under Schedule I, "Highway" development projects require environmental
clearance from  the Central Government. A  specific Environmental Guidelines for
Rail/Road/Highway Projects was promulgated by MOEF in 1989, in conjunction with MOST,
and includes a summary questionnaire for submission purposes. This earlier guide document is
3         generally used as the basis of EIA for domestic road project clearance purposes. It provides some
absolute standards but is primarily a checklist and is limited in the depth and detail of
information. Under the TOR for the domestic consultant Techno-Economic Feasibility Studies,
I         these guidelines were to be used for EIA purposes. The Indian Roads Congress has also issued
a guideline document for EIA (1988) and this provides general issue and impact guidance.
X |       In practice, the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB) have been established for implementation
of the rules and procedures. In Andhra Pradesh the SPCB will act as the initial contact point for
environmental clearance purposes. The project may, however, need to be environmentally cleared
at both state and federal level, and will be submitted to both concurrently by R&B. Draft
summary documents for each of the proposed road sections are given at Annex 5 for submission
3 |       purposes.
Standards for the discharge of environmental pollutants have been notified under the
I         Environmental Protection Act for various classes of recipient waters and noise standards for
vehicles also exist (see Annex 3). Whilst the primary intention of standards, to date, has been for
the control of industrial sourced pollution, the same rules apply to road construction activity.
I J       Legal action has been taken on environmental damage in India and sufficient legal precedence
exists to expect that domestic legislation is adequately effective. Many of the SPCBs are being
strengthened through donor assistance with AusAID commencing such a project in Andhra

Pradesh. This complements earlier Swiss support of the Environment Protection Training and
Research Institute (EPTRI).
An important associated consideration in relation to the APSHP is that of forest protection and
arboriculture. Any arboriculture activities in relation to roads have generally been undertaken by
the AP Forest department on behalf of R&B and it has supplied seedlings for roadside planting,
but no regular links nor roadside planting programmes exist. Little attention has been given to the
development of road reserves as biodiversity stores and only limited arboriculture work occurs
on construction work, with no policy on species selection.
The Chief Conservator of Forests has control powers in relation to the removal of trees or tree
products in any Forest Reserve areas, but these powers under the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act
(1967), for road reserve areas at least, were delegated to the R&B Engineers by Gazettal (Issue
20, 19 December 1991). This allows the Chief Engineer to exercise Chief Conservator powers
in relation to protection of trees in the ROW, and grants Superintending and Assistant Executive
Engineers the ability to exercise Conservator and Divisional forest Officer functions respectively.
This means that R&B owns trees on the ROW and has the legal right to approve the removal and
disposal of trees in the ROW, although the District Collector, and the District Committee, would
generally exercise some veto power.
Increasing forest resources in AP appears to have been a priority with massive reforestation
programmes implemented under the Forest Department, using World Bank support, and any
resumption of Forest Reserves now requires central government clearance under the Forest
Conservation Act. Such a process is expected to be lengthy and a compensation policy, of four
trees to one, exists. The value of reserves for wildlife conservation has also been recognised as
important with the Wildlife Act 1972. A series of 75 National Parks and 421 Sanctuary areas have
been declared in India to protect species threatened with extinction and a number of these are to
be found in AP (see Annex 3).
Parallel to GOI requirements, for World Bank funding, are those under Operational Directive
OD4.01 Annex A (October 1989) on Environmental Assessment. These require that
environmental issues are fully considered throughout the project cycle and due provision given
to mitigation and monitoring. This report is structured in accordance with these latter guidelines.
It is the borrower's responsibility to prepare TORs for the EA or other analysis, and to obtain
necessary expertise.
1.3 Study Area
The State of Andhra Pradesh lies between 13 and 20 degrees North latitude and longitude 77 and
84 degrees. It covers an area of 275,070 sq.km (8.4% of India) and the 1991 Census recorded a
population of 66.5 million people (7.9% of India). Of these the female/male ratio was 972/1000,
and the urban population was 26.9%. The Scheduled Tribal population was 6.31%, and the
overall literacy rate was 44.09%.

As the fifth largest area state in India it is a complex and diverse study area. With an average
population density of 242 per square kilometre (1991 Census) it is a highly productive state. It
is a major producer of rice, groundnut, cotton and tobacco, and has developed a large ferro-alloy,
cement, cigarette and mineral production base. In 1990 it had the largest number of registered
factories (16,007) of any state and per capita electricity consumption was 312 kWh (7th rank) in
1992-93. All the rural population is covered by electricity supply.

into 112 Municipalities and 19,497 Gram-Panchayats. In 1992-93 there were 353 separate
property registration offices.
Table 1.1 gives an outline of the Districts affected by the road proposals. Some difficulty was
experienced by the local consultants in defining the exact influence and catchment areas of the
3            road proposals. This depends on the feeder network, alternative routes and the approach of the
local consultants varied from assuming the whole District crossed to a 40 km band, with one also
including the influences of adjacent states. This dilemma is appreciated, particularly where
J            selected state roads are considered in isolation of the national and local road systems. Without
more detailed mapping or aerial photographs being available it is difficult to predict expected
catchments, and only District level data is readily available (although village level data exists
under national census collations).

Anidlira Pradesh State Higlhway Project                          1. In2troduction
The AP road system comprises 2,587 km of national highways, 8,651 km of State Highways,
25,463 km of major district roads, 46,713 km of Zilla-Praja-Parishad Roads, 42,509 km of
Panchayat roads, 5,407 km of urban roads and 7,581 of Project roads (1993 Census). In terms of
road length per unit area it ranked number 12 among Indian states. In 1991 Andhra Pradesh was
ranked 14th in terms of vehicle ownership with 1.46 million vehicles registered for use, including
r         79,600 cars, 34,180 Jeeps, 20,889 buses (15,000 are APSRTC) and 92,900 Trucks, but 5th in
terms of total petroleum product consumption.
Annual funding for PWD roads in recent years has been primarily utilised for the externally aided
Rajiv Rahandari road between Hyderabad and Ramagundam, and the Kakinada-Rajanagaram
road, as well as for cyclone restoration along the coast. The State Government has stated that it
aims to increase road funding in the future.
Motor vehicle accidents have been increasing rapidly with 16,941 recorded by the Police in 1992,
many involving goods vehicles and buses, but much greater numbers are expected to have
occurred and not recorded. Few details of accidents are available but the cost in life, delay and
fl        damage is likely to be high.
The rail system is extensive with 5,086km of railway lines, of four gauges, under four systems
fi        and AP state ranks 11th in terms of distance per unit area. All major centres are served by regular
train connections with 650 stations in Andhra Pradesh.
The port system is based on 1O seaports with major ports at Vishakhapatnam and at Kakinda
(handling 1.56 million tonnes in 1992-93) and Machilipatnam with 7 mini-ports, including
Krishnapatnam. Principal exports are iron ore and iron/steel, with imports of cooking coal and
II        oil predominating. Kakinda is receiving ADB support. Around 2,747km of inland waterway is
suitable for transport, with coal the major commodity moved.
|         Airports with Regular Passenger Transport (RPT) services are limited, with only Hyderabad
having daily jet services, although 8 civil aerodromes and other military bases do exist throughout
the state. Indian Airlines and VIF currently operate 'skeleton' intra-state services to Rajahmundry,
Tirupati and Vishakapatnam.
In 1992 approximately 25 million domestic and 37,000 foreign tourists arrived in Andhra
Pradesh.
3         Forest cover in Andhra Pradesh is above the Indian average with a cover of 22.8 percent, or some
62.7 lakh hectares. This is organised under 10 Circles with Reserved Forests, Protected Land and
unclassified areas, producing teak, eucalyptus, casuarina, cashew, Red Sanders, Sandalwood,
5         Bamboo and other species. The Adilabad, Warangal, Khamman and Rajahmundry Circles are
major timber producing areas.

Andhira Pradesh State Highway Project                                        1. Introduction
II          1.4 Project proposals
The Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project is a rehabilitation and maintenance project, based on
existing road alignments with relatively minor realignment and bypass provision expected. As
such the risk of significant environmental damage is low, but this depends on the sensitivity of
3           the areas traversed, and the imposition of appropriate mitigation and control measures. Under
World Bank categorisation, it would normally be classified as Category B, requiring more limited
environmental analysis, and for which appropriate environrmental management might be readily
5           specified. However three roads proposed in Phase II of the project may cause significant
environmental degradation and subsequently the project will be classified as Category A. It is
recommended that a full EIA be carried out on the sensitive sections of these three roads which
3           will eventually be added as an addendum to this document. The terms of reference for the EIA
are presented in Annex 7.
I           Table 1.2 presents the construction work that would be undertaken for the roads assessed in this
report.

Total length: 200.0km - plus bypasses of Nalgonda and Mirialguda and possibly
1                Piduguralla
Nalgonda/Guntur/Prakasam Districts
s   *  MDRl: Tadipatri (kml04)- Cuddapah (km 00)
m               Total length: 104km
Anantpur/Cuddapah Districts
Designs for Phase I will not be finalised until July/August 1996 so exact details of the work for
each road will not be available until that time. To date, however, a standard 7 m wide pavement
and 2.5m wide shoulders (1.5 m sealed) has been adopted with a design speed of 80 to 100kmlhr
(refer Annex 9). Modified IRC Geometric design standards are to be used. Phase II work is to
be progressivelv designed and implemented over a five year project period following project loan
3         approvals.
Three bypasses on roads being designed in Phase I were recommended by the domestic
*         consultants in the Feasibility Study reports. All three of the bypasses are on the Narketpalli-
Addanki road around the towns of Nalgonda, Mirialguda and Piduguralla.
5         To determine the feasibility, location and impacts of each bypass, a full social, economic and
environmental investigation of each bypass site should be carried out to ensure that the bypasses
are integrated into the urban road system of each town to minimise adverse affects and to
determine the extent of benefits. The studies to determine the requirement for and the design of
bypasses is considered to be outside the PCC's scope of work.
However, preliminary investigations for each of the three bypasses to identify possible alignments
have been carried out by the PCC's design team using engineering (constructability) criteria and
with the added aim of minimising the number of structures and agricultural land affected by the
road. Environmental assessments of the preliminary alignments resulting from the bypass
investigations have been undertaken.
Delays to the project may occur because of land acquisition requirements on bypasses. It is
therefore recommended that the studies of the bypasses on the roads being designed in Phase I
U         are carried out early in Phase II of the project.
Through larger towns the road surface will be smoothed and strengthened in such a manner to
I         avoid impacts on structures.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                               1. Introduction
Some realignment of low radius curves will also be undertaken, mostly within the ROW but some
will require land acquisition.
r1~        It is important to stress that road improvements, once identified and agreed, will be implemented
by Contractors working on behalf of R&B, and not by R&B directly. As such, the specification
of the work can be strictly enforced and will be closely supervised by consultants in conjunction
with local R&B staff. For the majority of the road sections, the work will be confined to the
existing Right-of-Ways (ROW) and on existing horizontal alignments. It will primarily consist
of;
*     Rehabilitation activities - where distressed pavement areas will be identified and replaced,
or strengthened by a new pavement structure the design of which is based on forecast
traffic needs.
*     Widening of Pavements and shoulders - where the pavement width is below 7 metres and
shoulders are less than 2.5 metre, widening will occur to provide a safe and consistent
width, provided feasible. This will be done on one side where necessary, to minimise
disruption and loss of roadside planting.
*     Widening, or replacement if necessary, of drainage structures to ensure clearances and
traffic safety, and
fl  *  Asphaltic concrete surfacing of all pavement areas to provide a smooth wearing course,
with regular crossfall and lateral drainage.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS ALONG PROJECT ROADS
2.1 Bio-Physical Characteristics
Andhra Pradesh is a large state with a variety of physical and ecological characteristics. It is a
highly modified environment, affected by centuries of habitation and use, but a number of areas
have been set aside for conservation purposes, ranging from 3568 sq.km sections down to 1.4
sq.km. The Forest and sanctuary areas are an important asset that are understandably guarded and
I!        a number of reforestation projects are proceeding. There are 20 Sanctuaries in the State with the
Sri Venkateswara Sanctuary recently reclassified as a National Park. Andhra Pradesh has a
number of tiger sanctuaries that have been set up as part of Project Tiger. The Indravati and
Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuaries, of 2048 and 3000 sq.km respectively, are the more
important conservation areas in Andhra Pradesh. The location and relative size of each
conservation area in Andhra Pradesh are shown in Figure 2.1.1.
Over 2,500 plant species have been identified in forest areas but the emphasis for forest
fl         management is on exploiting about 12 commercial species in plantations. The forest areas are
shown in Figure 2.1.2. Since a number of the project roads cross forest reserve areas it will be
important to advise the Chief Conservator of Forests of the road proposals. Under the Forest
rl         Conservation Act 1980, Reserve Forest land cannot be diverted to other use, including roads,
without Gol approval.
fl        Physically the state is dominated by three major rivers - the Godavari, Krishna and Pennar.The
basins of these three rivers cover 73% of the state. These rivers, and their tributaries, drain the
state to the Bay of Bengal, along with a number of shorter rivers such as the Nagavali,
N!l        Vamsadhara, Gundlakamma and Swarnamukhi (Figure 2.1.3). The coastline is long, at around
900km, and the adjacent sea is relatively shallow.
l         Physiologically AP can be classified into three regions;
||   *  The Coastal Plains, between 0 and 150 m above sea level and around 3.7km wide in the
north to 72km wide in the delta areas to 22km in the south, with a clear escarpment of up
to 600 m. It is dotted with lakes such as the Koleru and Pulical. It covers nine districts.
|   *  Eastern Ghats, a chain of broken hills some 610 to 1200 m above MSL, stretching from
Srikakulam district in the north east to the Cuddapah range in the south-west, and
*     Western Peneplains, or Deccan Plateau, a savannah area with scattered hillocks and open
shrubland, covering Kurnool, Anantapur and the greater Telanga region (some ten
I                districts). This is an old plain, made up of deeply dissected plateau of Archaen gneisses
and granites with hills of small relief. Tor and boulder forms are conmnon.
These regions are illustrated in Figure 2.1.4.

l
Andhira Pradesh State Highway Project                        2. Existing Conditions
- |       Numerous tanks and lakes cover the state, having irrigation and conservation value. Project roads
either cross or are adjacent to a number of water reservoirs and particular care will be taken in
maintaining water quality. Since the project roads follow existing alignments, few new bridges
will be required but widening of existing crossings and provision of additional cross drainage for
low sections will be involved.
The climate is generally tropical, with temperatures between the mid 40s and around 1 6C, with
both the south-west (June to September) and the north-east (October to December) monsoon
I |       affecting the state. Rainfall varies from 140 cm annually in the far north to less than 60 cm in the
south west. The south-western and central areas, where hot steppe conditions occur, are water
deficient and drought prone. Cyclones from the Bay of Bengal may cross the coast in October to
December but these rapidly lose intensity.
if        Geologically Andhra Pradesh contains a wide variety of formations, from the oldest Dharwar
(Lower Pre Cambian) Schists to recent alluvium. Remnant volcanic formations are common and
rock types are reflected in relief character. Soil types present make AP naturally fertile so that
regeneration capacity is high. The general soil classification applied is shown in Figure 2.1.5 and
consists of;
; |   *  Zonal Soils - red sandy, loamy and lateritic soils
l i          *      Intra-Zonal Soils - including deep black soils and mixed soils, following the main rivers,
and
|   *  Azonal Soils - including deltaic and coastal alluvial, sandy and skeletal soils.
Erosion is not a major issue but sediment loadings of streams can be high. Wasteland
l  l |    development has, however, received attention and maximum use of land resources is pursued.
High fluoride levels are a common water problem in AP as a result of rock composition.
ii        Each of the proposed roads has been inspected and specific problems or issues are identified
under section 2.3. As a result of centuries of dense habitation and development the landscape
retains little of what might be called the original environment, and population densities continue
to place major demands on the natural ecosystems. Aerial photographs or recent topographic
maps were not available but 1:250,000 land use maps produced by the National Remote Sensing
Agency were used to confirm general development patterns.
The major environmental problems facing AP are those related to air and water pollution,
3          primarily industry sourced, and urban deterioration under the pressure of urban drift and
overpopulation.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                        2. Existing Conditions
2.2 Socio-Economic Characteristics
The urban population in AP is unevenly distributed with the Hyderabad agglomeration
accounting for one quarter of the urban total and Rangarredi the other highly urbanised district.
The Rajahmundry - Vijaywada - Guntur coastal strip is another major concentration, as is
Fi        Vishakhapatnam. In 1993 there were some 264 towns and cities, and over 26,613 villages
recorded. Agriculture remains the lifeline of the State's economy but, despite massive public
investment, production has been stagnating. Irrigation schemes have been massively expanded
with groundwater utilisation increasing, along with salinity and waterlogging.
The village population is organised under the Panchayat Raj system, a three tier administrative
l l       structure, comprising:
*     Gram Panchayat, the grass roots level that has existed for 50 years;
r     Mandal Praja Parishad, or middle tier constituted for 30-45,000 people (1,092 in State);
and
*     fZilla Praja Parishads, or District Boards.
Government works are generally implemented by Departments through District heads but District
Rural Development Agencies (DRDA) exist in 22 Districts and are responsible for planning and
execution of rural development activity.
Urban settlements (over 5000 population) are classed according to size (Class I to 6) and are
either administered by a Municipal Corporation (Class 6), a Municipality, notified area committee
or development centre. Master Plans exist for 85 urban centres.
Industrialisation has been encouraged as an employment generator and AP is among the top six
industrialised states. Incentives were introduced in 1989 with an investment subsidy, deferment
of sales tax and interest free sales tax loans offered. Growth in small scale industries has been
significant and incentives are available for non-resident Indians to invest in selected areas.
The Eighth Five Year plan (1992-97) provides the overall Government policy with Annual Plans
establishing financial outlays. In recent years the irrigation and power sectors have been given
priority, but with an increasing emphasis on the social services.
Archaeology and endowment preservation are particular issues that deserve attention. Numerous
historical sites exist throughout AP with civilisation remains dating back to 200BC. The Andhra
Desa was a centre for Buddhist art and culture. The Krishna and Godavari valleys were
particularly fertile areas and development flourished between 225BC and 225AD, with cave
sculptures, stupas and temples to be found. It continued until around 400AD. The evolution of
the Hindu religion and its associated sculpture has provided archaeological richness, and with
Moghul influences, forts and temples, there has been a concentration of remains.
The AP Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960 and
promulgated Rules, have been established to provide for the protection and conservation of

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                       2. Existing Conditions
remains. Excavations are strictly controlled and areas can be designated as Protected Areas, with
clearance by an Archaeological Officer needed. No protected areas are known to exist on the
project roads but should remains be exposed then these would need to be notified.
Numerous, more modern, temples and grave sites are known to be in the ROW and these were
noted during inspections. Sensitive treatment will be needed in such cases and they will generally
be avoided.
2.3 Sensitive areas and priority issues
Environmental concerns in AP are becoming more public. Whilst industrial pollution and urban
deterioration are receiving institutional and local attention, there is an evolving concern with the
broader issues of resource protection and the quality of life.
There is an active environmental NGO presence in Andhra Pradesh with affiliations to WWF and
IUCN. Some 168 organisations in Andhra Pradesh have registered with WWF as Environmental
NGOs, although many of these have marginal environmental interests. Many also represent
specific areal interests and have limited resources. Contact was made with the SPEQL group
which, whilst primarily Hyderabad based, has particular interests in biodiversity and urban
|          planning. The issue of roadside vegetation was one that raised particular concerns, as was
apparent with the East Coast Road proposals. A list of NGOs is given at Annex 3.
l |        There is a strong faith in India in the sanctity of life and the divinity of trees and plants. The
traditional interest in the medicinal value of plants and the place of the Banyan tree in cultural
*          perceptions are possible indicators of a strong concern for maintaining this flora.
There are no significant forest, sanctuary or park areas to be resumed by the project but a number
of sensitive habitats may be affected as they are crossed by project roads.
There are no Biosphere Reserves in AP under the MAB programme in India and the only wetland
in AP that has been identified as a priority area by the National Wetland Management Committee
is Kolleru Lake, in West Godavari and Krishna Districts. It is well away from any proposed road
works. The important mangrove areas of Coringa, Godavari Delta and Krishna Estuary will also
|          not be directly affected in any way.
Concerns will exist, however, for even limited tree loss and it is imperative that a good
3          arboriculture program be established as clear and effective compensation. The limited
effectiveness of some road replanting schemes, as shown in Figure 2.3.1 for the ADB Hyderabad
Ramagundam Road, should not be repeated. Batter erosion problems on other road work will
3 |        also be specifically addressed (Figure 2.3.2). Revegetation related specifications for inclusion in
the roadworks contracts are presented in Annex 8. Other more general environmental
- |        considerations to be included in the Contract Specifications, such as soil erosion, already exist
in the IRC Specifications.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                        2. Existing Conditions
The only other major issue that has arisen is the resumption of, or interference to, Tribal Areas.
Scheduled Tribal Areas extend over 31,485 sq.km or 11% of the state with 5936 villages ir
|         Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakapatnam, East Godavari, Khamman, Warangal, Adilabad and
Mahbubnagar districts. There are two particular tribal areas that may be affected by the proposed
roads. The Gond Tribe lives in Kawal Sanctuary and the Chenchu tribe are found in Nagajn-ma
| S       Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuary. The effects of the road upgrade on these people will be assessed as
part of the Social Impact Report. An assessment of the effects the tribal people have on their
environment and the wildlife nearby will be part of the full EIA that is recommended for the six
environmentally sensitive areas traversed by the road..

This section crosses the inland plains area and,slowly rises in altitude in moving westward to a
hilly, granite outcrop area. The overall road route will provide an important connection between
III       traffic coming from Delhi and the coastal ports of Andhra Pradesh, bypassing the urban
conglomeration around Hyderabad (see Fig. 2.3).
It is a highly developed area with rice based agriculture predominating and isolated
towns/villages along the road alignment. The road itself is primarily on low embankments with
widening to 7 m previously attempted, but now failing, but sections down to 3.6 m width occur
after km 38. The right of way appears relatively free of encroachment except in villages, where
shelters and poor drainage are found. The horizontal alignment is relatively good, but some
raising of formation is needed where the road follows natural surface levels.
Roadside vegetation consists of mainly of thorny shrubs, while wild mint was in profusion at the
time of the first inspection in October 1995, creating heavily overgrown shoulders and restricted
visibility. The mint had died by the end of summer and it caused no visibility problems. Roadside
planting of Neem, Pippal and Gudga exist but primarily as irregular remnants rather than as
*         continuous avenue planting (see inset to Figure 2.4.1). In some cases, trees were within 1 m of
the pavement edge (some over 1m in diameter) but are generally well off the pavement and
I |       limited numbers will be directly affected. Sections of palms exist around km 50.
1 10 graves and five temples are found nearby to the road. None of these will be affected by the
3         proposed road upgrade.
A number of lateral drainage structures exist, with general flow from west to east, but these suffer
from lack of maintenance. Longitudinal drainage and crossfall was generally poor with ponding
on the road, and subsequent pavement failure, common. A number of irrigation channels are
crossed and wet rice production is common and particularly intensive around km 51 to km 54.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                       2. Existing Conditions
At km 39.8 there is a tank through which the road embankment crosses, where fish and heron
were observed, but it is relatively minor site and any widening of the embankment needed will
be controlled.
The city of Warangal had a population of 460,000 in 1991 and is a District Centre with rapid
urbanisation and expansion. The proposed road works commence at 6km from the centre and
outside the built-up area. The Municipality of Karimnagar has more recently become a District
centre and in 1991 had a population of 148,000 but was increasing even more rapidly at over 7%
annually. ADB funded road w~ork being done on the Hyderabad - Karimnagar link should further
encourage development of this mineral rich area. Road work proposed under this project ceases
I I        at km 67 near the connection of the Hyderabad road (near a large tank on the left and a relatively
new bridge crossing of the Maher River, a tributary of the Godavari) before recommencing on
the outskirts of the urban area at km 164. It then proceeds north through increasingly hilly areas
until it meets SH#16 and crosses the Godavari River. Traffic delays in Karimnagar could become
a concern and, although a bypass was not proposed by the domestic consultant, should be
considered a longer term option. This is outside the scope of this project.
The town of Huzurabad at km 28-31 has highly congested sections but adequate ROW appears
available. Other than minor villages adjacent to the ROW this is the only major settlement area
on the project road and very little industrial development occurs. It is primarily a rural setting
*          based on wet rice and dry season crops.
A range of remnant avenue planting exist along the road, primarily of Nimli, Neem and Pipal, and
at various distances off existing pavement but are irregular in length, spacing and size. Distinct
1X         avenues do exist in some locations but the pattern is not well established, although the often large
trees would provide welcome shade in summer. In many cases trees could be retained on both
sides of the road, however, there are cases where trees are close to the road on both sides and it
will not be possible to construct the new road between them because of inadequate width. In these
situations the new road will be constructed offset from the existing road and removal of the trees
on one side of the road will be necessary. The local consultant offered no estimate of numbers
to be removed, but it is expected to be in the order of 100-200. A revegetation component will
be included in the project contract (see Annex 8).
Regular cross drainage structures exist on this section, with 25 bridges and 4 causeways, but no
major changes in waterway provision are expected. Artificial and natural ponds, for water or
aquaculture, exist adjacent to the road in a number of locations and care will be needed to prevent
siltation and turbidity.
The work proposed by the domestic consultants on this section consists of strengthening and
widening, with reconstruction of pavement sections and intersection improvements as well as
signage. No bypasses were proposed, nor significant realignment, but it was estimated that 16.2
ha of acquisition was needed between Karimnagar and Luxipetta for minor realignment. The
ROW is restricted, and often well below the 30-50 m recommended, but no long-tern acquisition
program was proposed. Compared to other areas, encroachment is not a major issue on this
section and it is a highly modified area where agriculture has already caused alteration. No other
environmental problems are expected.

3          This section of road connects NH#5 at Medarmetia (stopping 10km away at Addanki) and NH#9
at Narkatpalli, and will be a major bypass of Guntur on the Hyderabad - Madras route. It is a
connection of a number of different State Highways and Major District Roads (see Fig.2.4.7).
I          It passes through a number of major towns and crosses the Krishna River (bridge opened in
1992).
|          The road falls from around 300m at NH#9 to the coastal plain. It passes a range of landuse and
soil types, from zonal to intra-zonal to azonal profiles. A number of major cement factories are
3          located between Mirialguda and Dachepalle.

Numerous other smaller villages exist and, combined with the poor condition of the road and their
g large amounts of NMT, capacity is limited. As a result of traffic, poor drainage and lack of
maintenance, road pavements within the town areas are frequently very poor. Despite this, the
o      ~~road is already used as a bypass at least until Piduguralla when traffic deviates to Naraosopet.
The road is primarily on low embankments but sections at grade do exist.
l .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~........
U      ~~The landscape is dominated by adjacent agriculture activity with limited avenue planting.
Isolated Banyan trees provide welcome shade. There are no forest or reserve areas traversed. Wet
|      ~~rice is common but responds to local conditions and long sections of scrub and wasteland exist
where water is not readily available. Rock outcrops are frequent. Isolated industrial activity exists
with up to 400 rice mills, marble cutting factories and, at two locations, the road is crossed by
|      ~~major railway lines (the crossing between Rompicherla and the SH150 providing a bad approach
alignment and only 5.5 m clearance). At least 4 cement factories are located along the road,
s      ~~concentrated around the Krishna River, and these generate traffic as well as air and dust pollution.
Two temples are found alongside the ROW, one at 5km north of the Krishna River and the other
14km south of Nalgonda. Neither are close enough to the ROW to be affected by the road
I         widening. A multitude of graves are situated alongside the ROW, particularly around 10 to 25km

I      ~~38 bridges and 16 causeways exist on the section, particularly on the coastal plain area where
braided streams are common, and will require significant structures. Two major tanks exist

occupies an area of some 20 ha. The grove itself is well away from the road so it will not be
affected by the road upgrade. Singaraya Konda is in association with a 200m causeway
immediately downstream of the spillway and the road follows the base of the dam for nearly lkm
kl        (see Figure 2.4.2). The dam wall will not be touched as part of the road improvement. Other tanks
occur and the canal system from Nagarjuna Sagar irrigates the road corridor area, with canal
crossings at km 55 (Machavaram), km 74 (Guntur branch), km85 (Piduguralla Minor) and km
150 (Vemula Palli). None of these will be affected by works associated with this project.
r          OOnly the Krishna River is perennial and most other drainage channels are seasonal, but flooding
does occur at a number of these. Irrigation and canals are common in the area with a new canal
crossing (and presumably road bridge) being constructed at 13km south of Piduguralla.
The local consultants estimated that some 1800 trees would need to be felled for this section and
proposed a replacement/compensation planting of at least 7200 roadside trees. An additional 40
ha (4000 trees) were suggested as a social forestry/afforestation measure.
The work proposed involves widening (from mainly 3.6 m. to 7 m.) and strengthening of the
lll        pavement, which will involve formation widening, throughout the length. Three bypasses, at
Nalgonda, Mirialguda and Piduguralla were recommended in the Feasibility Studies by the local
consultants.. ROW available is limited, particularly in the villages and towns, but acquisition will
primarily be associated with the bypasses.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                        2. Existing Conditions
Studies have been investigated and possible alignments identified. A preliminary environmental
assessment has been conducted on two of these, Nalgonda and Mirialguda.
111'      1. Nalgonda bypass
Without aerial photographs it was extremely difficult to review options for bypasses. Site
inspection did reveal, however, that options are limited and have been based on restricting the
bypass to agricultural and fallow land only. The domestic consultants have estimated that 40 ha
r         of agricultural land and 12 ha of fallow land will be required. Three options for the bypass of
Nalgonda were investigated, two to the east of the town beside the railway line and one to the
west (Figure 2.4.4).
The western route leaves the existing road at the railway overpass at km 14 north of Nalgonda
and rejoins the existing road at km 3.0. This route passes to the west of the twin hills. The two
eastern bypass options both utilise the cleared land beside the railway line. The major problem
with this route was its 13km. length.
The bypass to the west of the railway line (Eastern Option 1) is the most desireable of the three
alignments investigated from an engineering point of view, but it would require acquisition of
some land belonging to Indian Railways which has a history of refusing such acquisition. This
option was therefore discarded.
The recommended bypass route (Eastern Option 2) runs along the eastern side of the railway line.
This route leaves the existing road immeadiately to the north of the railway overpass at km 14
north of Nalgonda. The route will pass to the northern side of a cemetry nestled at the junction
of the road and the railway easement. No graves will be disturbed.
For its first 3km the road runs beside the railway line and traverses an area of undeveloped
I         residential plots. A grove of palms situated alongside these residential plots will not be affected.
The route crosses the Pangal road and then will probably pass along an existing road and continue
in a straight line as the railway line bends to the south. Nearby the existing road is another
*         cemetry which also will not be disturbed (see Figure 2.4.3). The route then travels through a
wasteland of small scrub before entering an area of fallow rice paddies 1km from where it rejoins
the existing road. The owners of this cropland will be compensated for any loss of land.
The route will probably pass to the south of existing the Food Corporation of India factory and
Indian Railways storehouses which will not be affected. The exact route and the number of
-         residences that will be affected has yet to be determined, however they are not expected to be
high. Recent aerial photographs are required to determine the precise route and it has not yet been
possible to obtain them.
The preferred option (Eastern Option 2) traverses approximately 25-35ha of mostly fallow land.
It is understood that a significant proportion of this land already belongs to the State Government.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                          2. Existing Conditions
The route will cross the railway line via an overbridge and rejoin the existing road at km 2.4. The
total length is around 7km. Because of its proximity to the railway line, the use of an existing
road for part of its length, and the use of agricultural land and unused residential plots, the route
does not have any significant environmental problems. Three large culverts will be required to
match those of the railway but apart from these there are no expected alterations to the regions
current hydrology. The route has already been extensively cleared of vegetation so no significant
species or habitats are found nearby.

2. Mirialguda bypass
Three options were also considered for the bypass of Mirialguda township, two to the east and
one to the west. The eastem routes were much shorter yet passed close by a tank serving the
| ~~township and traversed rich agricultural land. The western route although being longer than the
* ~~eastern options has the advantage of allowing traffic approaching Mirialguda from the southwest
(Peddevur) to also bypass the town to the north or south (Fgure 2.4.6). The eastern route was
|       ~~adopted as the preferred route.
The western route starts at km 38.4 and travels in a south-westerly direction through very gently
0 | ~~undulating land, cultivated with rice. Near the routes crossing of the Nandipahad road there is a
small watercourse to be crossed which will require a culvert. A grove of trees is situated here as
0       ~~well and will not be affected. The road bends around the township to the south-east as it crosses
X | ~~the Venkeatadripalem Road. A small temple is located near the bend and this will not be disturbed.
-        ~~~The road continues through cultivated land until it nears Peddevur Road, where it traverses a
- | ~~small subdivision on the northern side. There are currently very few buildings either completed
,- | ~or under construction on the subdivision and the bypass could be constructed through the
g        ~~~subdivision without affecting these structures.
- * ~~To the southern side of Peddevur Road the route passes through the drying area of the Bhagya
Lakshmi Rice Factory. Purchase of a replacement area will be necessary and lanid is available

behind the factory. Approximately seven temporary houses (mud) will require demolition on the
south side of the road. A road easement exists on the north side of the road although
approximately four temporary huts (thatched) will have to be removed from the easement (see
Figure 2.4.5). The route rejoins the existing road at km 43.4 and passes to the left hand side of
a large hut. The approximate length of the bypass is 7.7km.

3. Piduguralla bypass
A bypass was recommended by the domestic consultants for Piduguralla. Two different routes
were considered one to the north and one to the south of the town. The southern option is
I         unfavourable due to the southerly direction of urbanisation within the town meaning that the
bypass will eventually be engulfed by the town. The northern route is 500 m. longer than the
southern route at 6.2km., however, it is advantageous in that it follows high ground near the
I         Piduguralla tank, land is cheap due to the proximity of lime kilns and less earthworks are required
for improving horizontal geometry, constructing a road overbridge and for a bridge crossing of
3         the Bugga Vagu (as it is already present).
The option of not constructing a bypass was also considered because of the apparent adequacy
of the width of the road and footpath construction between the permanent building in town. It is
possible to construct two 3.5 metre wide lanes in each direction with a one metre median strip at
the narrowest point while leaving a 2 m. wide footpath on either side. This could be done without
3         disturbing the existing permanent buildings. However, a large number of temporary structures
in the town centre would be affected. Parking bays could be added in wider sections. A minor
d         realignment to the south would allow space for a rail overbridge. This option has been adopted
z=i ||as the preferred option.
-1.       Because the preferred option for Piduguralla is not to construct a bypass, no environmental
g-J *     assessment of this option has been carried out.

4. Further Investigations
Encroachments exist in almost all the towns along this road. Further attention to bypasses may
F-         be warranted for Dachepalle (where a culvert is frequently overtopped) and Brananapalli (where
the ROW is particularly constrained). It is recommended that further studies as discussed in
Section 1.4 are carried out for each of the major urban areas to determine the requirement for
-     ~bypasses.

This section forms less than half the section considered by the local consultant study and provides
a link between the major municipal centre of Tadipatri (1991 population 71,000) in the Anantpur
District to Cuddapah City (1991 area population 215,000 and District centre). The road (MDR
I4        #1 and SH#3 1) crosses the Chitrava and Papagni Rivers, and parallels the Madras - Bombay Rail
cornidor. The road follows a broad valley surrounding the Pennar River and crosses a relatively
sparse and barren landscape, with rainfall between 60-80 cm per year and temperatures between
I         the mid 20s and 40s (degrees C). Wet rice is produced in some irrigated areas but it is a
comparatively open, barren area with dryland agriculture and little in the way of roadside
planting. The land is relatively stable, consisting of red soils, gravel or moorum. Short, intense
*         rainfall tends to occur causing drainage problems, whilst dust and wind erosion are summer
features. There are no forest reserves or sanctuaries on this section of the road. Roadside
3         vegetation consists of scrub, with few trees and no true avenue planting. No heritage sites are
known to exist.
3 |       At the present time this section is primarily of 3.6m pavement with some widening to 5.5m (that
is generally failing) and with particularly bad shoulders. It closely follows the rail line and there
are 3 level crossings (some with bad approaches and differences in level), including at
Sl        Mangapatnam and immediately north of Cuddapah. Rail traffic is insufficient to warrant grade
separation in accordance with IRC guidelines.
A small industrial area and power station exists around 10km north of Yerraguntla, which is itself
a major industrial area with cement plants and quarries.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                       2. Existing Conditions
A significant number of smaller villages exist along the alignment (Chevatipdi, Settamapalli,
Kammopalli, Chilamakur, Kondapuram, Sugummchipalli, Mangaputnam, Thalla Proddattur etc)
with larger towns at Yerraguntla and Muddanuru. Congestion and encroachment at the former
town is fairly significant whilst the latter is at the junction with another State Highway (Figure
2.4.8). No bypasses are being considered.
20 bridges and 9 causeways are provided on the length, some for relatively large drainage
channels, and around 180 other culverts were recorded. In many instances widening of culverts
and bridges to 7 m clearance has already occurred. A major bridge crossing of the Papagni River
occurs immediately before entering the outskirts of Cuddapah and the rail crossing (km 24),
before a tight S-bend and an arch bridge over the main canal (km 5). NH 18 to Chittoor provides
a partial bypass to Cuddapah, in which congestion and encroachment are severe. The parallel
railway embankment may have altered drainage patterns, with the road rarely having the
equivalent bridging structure, resulting is wet season overtopping. Irrigation flooding of road
areas was also noticed and rarely is lateral drainage of pavement adequate.
The proposed work involves widening and strengthening pavement, with associated shoulder and
drainage work. The domestic consultant estimated that 5.1 ha of land acquisition was needed.
It was also estimated that some 204 trees needed to be felled on this section. Realignment at
|         some of the railway crossings may also be necessary, although this has yet to be designed. ROW
details were not completely available, but field observations suggest that this may be limited in
many locations. Existing stone quarries are at Tadipatri and near Cuddapah, with numerous gravel
I         and sand deposits in the many nullahs. The domestic consultant also noted 6 accident zones for
this particular road section (see Figure 2.4.9).
|         There are 5,588 trees located within 5 m. of the edge of the bitumen on this road between
Tadpatri and the State Border via Renigunta, 3,317 on the left-hand side and 2,271 on the right-
hand side. A large scale revegetation scheme will be conducted over the 377.6km. section of road.
This specifics of this revegetation scheme are included in Annex 8.

This is an extension of the Warangal - Raiputnam section under Phase I and completes the
connection to NH#7. Starting from NH#16 around 3km west of Lakshettipet, and north of the
Godavari River crossing, the road rises from the river valley into the Satmala Hills. In moving
north-west average annual rainfall increases from 100 to 120 cm. Deep black soils give way to
effusive deposits of the Deccan Trap (see Figure 2.1.5).
Initial sections of the road are low lying, easily flooded and traverse small streams feeding back
into the Godavari. Agriculture predominates the landuse and few roadside trees exist, although
v          remnants of avenue planting, up to 300 mm. diameter, are to be found. A number of small
villages are found in the first 20km, with some minor encroachment by residential shelters.
Approximately 22km. before the road passes into the Adilabad District it enters the Kawal Forest
and Sanctuary area. This is an important wildlife protection area as it is a Tiger Sanctuary. It is
estimated that there are 12 tigers within the 893 sq.km sanctuary which is split in two by the
existing road. Core tiger areas are located on either side of the road which may act as a barrier to

wildlife movements. A full EIA should be conducted on this site to determine the impacts of the
upgraded road on all the wildlife in the sanctuary. The terms of reference for the study presented
in Annex 7.
Kawal Sanctuary is protected by a checkpoint at km 145. The forest area is more undulating and
small cuttfill patterns emerge, with rock outcrops. Trees are up to 600mm diameter and frequently
within 2m of the existing 3.6m pavement, but the land opens up to sections of farming by the
Gond tribe as the road weaves through the forest boundary. Villages are to be found in these
clearings. The impact of the tribal people on the environment they live in will also be assessed
in the EIA. At kmnl36 the road crosses a flooded area where wet rice has been introduced. In a
number of areas space for widening, on one side, is available due to power line clearing.
At 44km from NH#16 the project road turns right to Utnoor (60km), near the Karimnagar/
Adilabad boundary, whilst most traffic continues on to Nirmal. The 3.6m road continues through
n,1l      the Kawal Forest area for another 25km, on embankments and cuts up to 1-2m high with minimal
ROW to trees of 200-300mm diameter. This is a dry deciduous, broadleaf forest with teak and
bamboo. A number of clearings occur, where farming and villages exist. At 20km inside Adilabad
the road crosses a small wetland area where culverts are permanently submerged following the
rainy season, and snakes are common. Cross drainage structures in Kawal Forest are generally
large and are often bridges (Figure 2.4.11). It is unknown whether or not these were designed as
wildlife underpasses, but enlarging these during the road upgrade is a potential mitigation
method. Kawal Sanctuary ends at a bridge at km 40 and the forest checkpoint is situated about
3          2km further on.

Pericherala is located some lOkm from Guntur and is the start of an east-west crossing of the
lower half of Andhra Pradesh between NH# 5 and 7. The road commences on the coastal plain
and then rises over the Nallamala Hills before falling again into the Kunderu valley to follow the
Krishna - Tungabhadra rivers to Kumool. From coastal catchrnent areas it moves into the Krishna
River upper catchment.
3          In moving across the state it passes over a range of geological deposits with mixed red and black
soils. Rainfall decreases in moving west from around 100 to 60 cm annually. Vegetation and
1          landuse change with ecological conditions.
Environrnentally important is the presence of major Forest Reserve areas between Domala and
Atmakur. as the road rises over the hills. 40km east of Atmakur, conditions are mountainous with
60-70 degree slopes and major cuts. It is a dry deciduous forest area with bamboo, part of the
major Nagarajuna Sagar-Srisailam and Gunda Brahmeswaram Sanctuary network. Nagarjuna
1          Sagar-Srisailam is a tiger sanctuary set up as part of the Project Tiger scheme. It has an estimated
80 tigers within its 3568 sq.km. Its area surrounds the Nagarjuna Sagar. The project road runs
along the edge of the sanctua                6km of the core tiger habitat. The Gundla
3 |        Brahmeswaram Sanctuary is situated on the southern side of the road between Atmakur and
Dornala. This is not listed as a tiger sanctuary however its proximity to the Nagarjuna Sagar-
-          Srisailam Sanctuary and he thick forest beside the road suggest that suitable tiger habitat may
exist within this sanctuary The affect of the upgraded road on these two areas should be assessed
in a full EIA along with any mitigation measures.1

Andhra Pradesh State High way Project                      2. Existing Conditions
5I lIn the early stages the road crosses a dense mixed farming area with a number of rail crossings
and some industrial development. Roadside tree planting, particularly Banyan, are common, as
are irrigation canals. The landscape is relatively flat with rock hill outcrops. A 7m pavement is
reduced to 5.5m and causeways are frequent.
At some 50km from Guntur the road passes through Narasaropet, a large Municipality with some
90,000 people. Encroachment is extremely bad and the route torturous for 3km as it winds
through the urban area. The local consultant did not reconmmend a bypass but it may be essential.
West of Narasaraopet settlement becomes more scattered, with wet rice and isolated planting of
Imli more obvious. Causeways remain common and temporary encroachment at the villages
I         noticeable. This continues for 40km until Vinukonda. Vinukonda is a Panchayat centre of over
35,000 people and represents a problem for through traffic. Pavement in the centre of the town
is badly damaged and, whilst the ROW is available, congestion is severe and a bypass might be
considered.
West of Vinukonda the road reduces to 3.6m although widening had, and was, occurring. Land
becomes more undulating and agriculture more mixed with scattered roadside planting. Cotton
begins to be grown. Villages tend to occur at intersections with side roads and the countryside
more open. Temporary encroachments at villages occur but fewtrees are to be affected. At 21km
east of Domala the road rises over a low saddle of around 1 00m. Occasional tanks and irrigation
support wet rice. Dornala is in Kumool District and stretches over 1.5km with a limited ROW for
i         300m due to stall encroachment.
West of Domala the road runs alongside 300m hills and at 10km out starts to rise. The land gives
|         way to forest and at 20km out it is in a narrow valley with bamboo forest as it rises quickly
(Figure 2.4.14). For the next 22km it passes through steep country and Forest Reserve until
coming out onto the valley floor the other side of the hill range. A limited number of scattered
I         villages occur but it is a relatively dense forest area with side cuttings and some tight alignment.
Trees are within 1-2m of a 3.6m to 5.5m pavement. Atmakur is entered 12km later. The road
through Atmakur has some encroachment and a bypass in the longer term may need to be
considered.

A good section of avenue planting occurs to the west of Atmakur for one km. From here the road
runs along the Nandyal Valley, which consists of very flat and dry land. A forest reserve is
located to the north of the road just outside the village of Karnbalapalle. Initially the main form
of landuse is cotton farming, however, this gives way to irrigated rice farming just outside the
village of Nandikotkur. A number of large bridges are found here to cross the dried up
Nandikotkur Tank. Care will need to be taken in upgrading these bridges.
The township of Nandikotkur does not require a bypass as it has very little encroachment and has
sufficient ROW. For the next 30km the road passes through cultivated land interspersed with
minor villages. The area is largely treeless and no significant avenue planting exists. 11 km from
Kumool is the village of Gademadugu which has a minor level of residential encroachment and
non-motorised transport. The road continues for 9km until Kumool is reached.
Two sacred groves are found nearby the ROW in this section, one about 7km east of Kurnool and
the other near a small village 1 Okm to the west of Nandikotkur. Neither sacred grove will be
affected by the proposed road widening. Numerous graves, both Hindu and Moslem, are also
located alongside the road. Those few that occur within the ROW will not be affected by the road
widening as the road will be realigned.

This is the southern extension of the section proposed under Phase I to connect to Madras, and
consists of SH3 1 running between the Velikonda and Palkonda Ranges. It crosses from the
Penner River catchment over to the coastal plain where it drains towards the Palicat Lake area.
There are 11 causeways and nine rail crossing on the section.
The road follows Upper Pre-Cambrian deposits and red sandy loam sediments. The section is
environmentally significant in that it passes close to three critical natural habitats. The most
significant of these is the Sri Venkateshwara Sanctuary and National Park, to the west of the
I          existing road. This conservation site has an area of 506 sq.km and is home to endangered species
such as the Golden Gecko. This area is also significant in that the Red Sanders (Pterocarpus
santalinus) is endemic and is found in low numbers throughout most of the region. Two other
I         habitats are found along this road, the Nandular Tank and the Vontimitta Tank, whose bird
habitats are included as part of the Sri Lankasmalla National Park.
I |        The road continues to follow the Bombay to Madras rail line and crosses the Cheyyuru River.
Bypasses have been proposed for Cuddapah, Rajampet and Kodur. Additional analysis is
*          recommended for these bypasses and this is considered outside the scope of this project.
Commencing at Cuddapah the road enters a narrowing valley where reafforestation is occurring
over nearly 1 Okm. This changes to mixed farming and villages before running along the bund for
the Vontimitta Tank at km 25. Reafforestation work then continues until two bad rail crossings

at km 35 and km 40. The area between is a mixture of forest and villages with encroachment.
The Nandular Tank and Bird Sanctuary is located on the right before entering Nandular Village
and a 500 m. long causeway crossing of the Chetteru River (see Figure 2.4.16). It is a scrubby
area with few roadside trees, rocky outcrops and a number of villages. 9km further on is
Rajampet in Nellore District. This is heavily congested with a concrete road and a ROW down
to 8m width.
Figure 2.4.16 Nandular Tank with the road running along the dam wall
South of Rajampet are the villages of Pullampet, Reddipalle, Gallapalle, Koduru, Settigunta and
Momanduru. It is a mixture of open scrub land, industrial development (km80), coal mines and
mixed farming. Encroachment and unauthorised use of the ROW are common, particularly in the
villages. At Baleppalle, at kmr105, the Settigunta Reserve and Bamboo forest commences. This
5         is a forestry plantation area and continues for nearly 20km until the Karakarambapi Forest check-
point on the southernrside.
|         Around 6.5km further on is Renigunta, off to the right. Before meeting with SH32 and 61 at a
rather complex rail/road interface, the road passes through an area of rock cutting and marshy
land, below the rail embankment. Shoulders are overgrown but few roadside trees exist.
The road continues through Renigunta and on to Puttur, 24km away. Three large bridges occur
along this stretch of the road as the topography rises and falls with the Nagari Hills.
Encroachment occurs in Puttur and Renigunta and a bypass may be considered in the future, but
is outside the scope of this project. The road crosses the Surarmutha River via a causeway at km
63 just outside of Renigunta and the nearby area is irrigated rice paddies. Between km 62 and km
59 there are two villages with ROW restricted by encroachment. The road crosses over the rail
line at five narrow at grade crossings and two underpasses. Most of these will require widening.
= |     ~~A number of minor tanks occur close to the road but will not be affected by the roadworks. Social
forestry occurs at kms 28, 48 and 52, with the plantation at km 48 being of Mango. The road
continues on to the state border through more cultivated land via the village of Nagari which is

already bypassed. The proposed project road ends at a rail crossing 9.5km from Tirutani.
An estimated 6089 trees occur within 5 metres of the centre line of the existing road. Where
possible only those trees on one side of the road will be removed. The area will be fully
revegetated following the upgrade (see Annex 8 for the revegetation related contract
recommendations).

j        A connection from Nalajerla to Pollacolu had also been proposed but has been reduced to a link
from NH#5 to Pollacolu. This latter section runs through the heavily congested Tadepallegudem
urban area and along back-roads on irrigation canal banks, to connect to Maruteru, a sensitive wet
rice area with major encroachment and land acquisition problems.
The road proposed drops from around 280m at Warangal to 150m at Khamman and then
I         continues across the coastal plain, to connect with the Eluru - Rajahmundry road (MDRl 801) at
Deepavalli (or Devarapally, west of Nalajerla), which makes use of the relatively new bridge
crossing of the Godavari at Kovvur. It is dry area with 60-80 cm annually. The road proposed is
a slight variation from that considered by the local consultants, who looked at a connection right
through to Palakollu and Narasapur, via Potavaram, Tirumala and Tadepallegudem.
Warangal is a large sized city with a half million people (1991 data) and the connection through
the urban area will pose problems. Built-up conditions continue for nearly 9km from the town
centre and encroachment is severe, with an extremely variable ROW. No bypass was proposed
by the domestic consultant, with the project designed to start at km 2 from the centre, but this
may need to be considered in the future in another more urban orientated project.
South of Warangal agriculture predominates with wet rice, orchards and mixed crops. The
pavement of SH#8 has been widened to 7 m for over 70km and, whilst some realignment of

fl       sharp curves may be needed, the alignment is generally good and condition reasonable. The
domestic consultant estimated that 43.3ha of acquisition was needed between Warangal and
Khamman, some 126km apart, with 15 families affected. Roadside planting on this section is
extremely variable. A number of avenue plantings exist, including Banyan, some of which will
need to be removed. More recent planting was observed mostly clear of any proposed work.
Eucalyptus are being used for farm trees in the area. Villages occur regularly, some with minor
encroachment, with the main ones being Sangam, Vardannapet, Dantanpally, Yellampet, Mated,
Maripeda, Pedda Nagaram and Pindipole. Widening is being continued at around 40km north of
Khamman. Some temples do exist in the ROW, but these will be avoided. At 4.6km north of
Khamman the project road turns left (right being to Suriapet). Urban development begins
immediately after, until the 14 span masonry Munar Bridge crosses the Maneru River (Krishna
catchment), 3km north. Khamman is congested with 2 rail overpasses.
Between Khamman and Ashweraopet (115.5km) the coastal plain landscape becomes flatter, with
fewer villages and more irrigated areas. Tallada is the first major town on SH#42, 3 1km out, in
which pavement condition is poor, and the road turns right. The road crosses the Wira River 7km
north of Tallada and the area largely of wet rice with scattered villages. Kallur is 14km further
on and it has some stall encroachment and road condition there is deteriorating. Limited trees
occur in the ROW. Irrigation channel crossings increase with wet rice the main landuse, with the
road passing through Vayumbunga, Sathupally and a number of smaller villages, with some
encroachment. The Mondaken Forest Nursery (WB funded) is located 6km south, of
Vayumbunga but will not be affected by this project. Mixed farming begins short of Ashweraopet
with Oil Palm plantations and industry. Few roadside trees exist.
At Ashweraopet the 5.5m road veers right and continues east to pass through the villages of
I         Darbhaguden, Taduvaie, Vegavaram and Jangareddi Gudem. The latter having very bad
encroachment and may need to be by-passed. The area is of open mixed farms with the Central
Tobacco Research Institute 4km south. Road condition continues to deteriorate and travel times
are slow. Drainage damage to the road embankment was observed 16km south but Banyan tree
numbers increase, with some distinctive avenues. The proposed project road ends at Deepavalli,
east of Nalajerla and approximately 22km west of Kovvur.
The connection from NH5 to Palakollu passes through the main street of Tadepallegudem in
which congestion is severe. Encroachment problems occur at a large number of villages and the
road is frequently located on the banks of irrigation canals. Minimal ROW is available and the
area has continuous wet rice production with a tropical climate. Any road construction will cause
U         major disturbance with the risk of siltation and disruption of water flow. The design of this
connection will need to be particularly sensitive in order to minimise problems.

This area has less than 60 cm rainfall annually and part of the upper Penner River catchment.
Soils are mixed red and black, and deposits Archaean. The topography of the area is flat, boulder
terrain, with sparse arid zone vegetation interspersed with fallow land and occasional irrigation
I         areas. The road is located above 300m in the Erramala Hills.
No major forest reserves nor sanctuaries are to be found in the area. Two minor sacred groves are
I         located near to Gooty and Guntakal, however these are nowhere near the road reserve. The 38
grave sites are also outside the ROW and will not be disturbed.
This road section links Karnataka State with NH7 and Madras via the other roads being proposed
for upgrade. The road begins two km inside the state border and is in very poor condition. The
road runs into the village of Gadekallu, nestled amidst three granite outcrops. Gadekallu is a small
village with a tank well to the right of the ROW. This 13km stretch of road until Guntakal appears
to be subject to innundation during the monsoon. The road is generally at grade and runs between
the numerous granite hills that are scattered across the Rayalasima Plateau.
Guntakal is a large town with some residential encroachment and minor amounts of non-
I         motorised transport. Avenue planting has occurred along the road through the town. An at grade
rail crossing occurs at km 326 near Guntakal. A number of small villages are passed on the 30km
stretch to Gooty, but none are large enough to impede through traffic. The road entering Gooty
I         runs alongside the base of the Gooty Water Tank wall to the north, which separates the higher
ground from that to the south and retains monsoonal rainfall. This tank was built by King
Ramadevaraya in 1619 AD. It runs beside the road for 4.1km and irrigates 450 ha. The dam wall

Gooty is located at the intersection with NH#7. Some encroachment and a great deal of non-
motorised transport are found here. Nonetheless no bypasses of Gooty or Guntakal were
recommended by the sub-consultant.

This road (MDR1 801) connection (48.5km) provides an alternate route to NH#5 between Eluru
and Rajamundry in West Godavari, using a relatively recent bridge crossing of the Godavari
River between Kovuur and Rajamundry, resulting in a saving of almost half the Eluru -
3         Rajamundry distance. For most of the road the pavement has already been widened to 7m but
edge failures and shoulder damage, as well as surface deterioration, lessen its capacity. Traffic
from the north-west use the link as a more direct connection to the Kakinda area.
It is located on the coastal plain and the area feeds into the Kolleru Lake catchment. It is a
*- |      cyclone prone area and annual rainfall is over 100cm. It is a densely settled area in which
*         agricultural development is giving way to industrial development, particularly at the Kovuur end,
where quarry development is also found. Numerous tanks are nearby the road and irrigated rice
predominates. Oil Palm and sugar cane cultivation is expanding. Roadside planting are common
I         with Banyan avenues around villages frequent. Encroachment occurs and the alignment needs
-l r      improvement in places.
From the Kovuur end the road follows the Godavari River through an industrial area until
| u       reaching the rural area about 10km out. It then enters a hilly area where a number of rock quarries
and crushers have been established at 10-12km north of Deepavalli. Numerous huts are to be
found in the ROW but these are clear of expected works. Deepavalli is a major truck stop at the
end of the Khamman - Ashaeropet connection and minor congestion exists. Further south, the
area becomes more coastal and rural with wet rice common. Road condition deteriorates and
tanks become more frequent. Villages include Marapali, Achannapalem, Nallajerla, Bhamdolu,
1 l l |      Dhubacharla and Bhimadals, all of which have temporary encroachments.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                         2. Existing Conditions
At the connection with NH#5, on the south-west end, the road enters as a T-junction after passing
over a railway line and a number of ceramic factories, with huts lining the intersection.
No major difficulties are expected on this road but the extensive irrigation system and the higher
rainfall of the area, and cyclone risk, will require particular attention to sediment control during
the design phase and the contract preparations. Minor realignment of some curves may also be
desired and limited tree removal could be required.

This road connects Bangalore to places of tourism and religious importance such as Tirupathi and
Renigunta and joins with Road 2(h) from Renigunta to Nayudupeta to link with NH5 on the
coast. The road extends across the Chittoor district and reaches an height of 950 metres at
Madanapalle. The overall road condition is relatively good with double lane width between
Madanapalle and Pileru.
The road begins at Madanapalle and travels north-east for 12km before turning to the east. There
is a level crossing 13 km from Madanapalle from where the road runs to the north of the rail line
for a further 45km until it reaches the town of Pileru. The area becomes less arid as the road
travels towards the coast. Just outside of Pileru is a narrow rail underpass 3.5 metres wide. The
road passes through several villages, including Vayalpad and Kalikiri. No major encroachment
and non-motorised transport are found here. Two relatively major waterways are between
Madanapalli and Pileru, a tributary of the Bahuda River and the Punchu River.
The road continues through Pileru, where congestion and encroachment are substantial, to the east
for a further 5 1km until it reaches Chandrigiri. Agricultural factories occur on the outskirts of
Pileru and nearby the road passes along the wall of a tank and past a cemetery at km 5 before
entering arid, undulating land. Neither the tank nor the cemetery should be affected by the
proposed road upgrade. Near the village of Thrippanandandipalli at km 15 the road passes along
a large built-up section across low lying land that appears to be susceptible to flooding.
The land changes from predominately agricultural land to Reserved Forest at km 26 as the
topography becomes more mountainous. The road enters the Sri Venkateswara Sanctuary and

National Park at km 26 and leaves it at km 37. The Sri Venkateswara National Park is reported
to house some rare and endangered plant species like Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus),
Shorea talura, Shorea thumbuggia, Terminaliapallida, Cycas beddomei, Syzygium alternifolium
and Psilotum nudam. Animals found in the park include Leopard, Sloth Bear, Sambar, Chital,
Mouse Deer, Barking Deer, Chowsingha, Wild Boar, Wild Dog, Hyena, Jackal, Fox, Civet Catf,
Jungle Cate, Golden Gecko, Slender Loris, Indian Giant Squirrel and Flying Lizard. The area is
vegetated with thick forest on undulating hills that are interspersed with granite outcrops. This
is an area of critical natural habitat and it is recommended that the impacts of the road upgrade
on the area are assessed in a full EIA.
From km 59 three more Forest Reserves are located on the northern side of the road. The Forest
I:l         Reserves extend for approximately 3 km along the road. These forests consists of eucalyptus and
Red Sanders. The fences for the Forest Reserves are approximately 8 metres off the edge of the
road and the vegetation begins some 10 to 15 metres further inside. There is approximately 20
11         metres of available ROW, so the Forest Reserves will not be affected by the road works. On
either side of the Forest Reserves are areas of dry land farmning.
The Forest Reserves may act as a buffer zone for wildlife inhabiting the Sri Venkateswara
National Park and as such wildlife may enter the reserves. The noise and activity of the road
would act to keep wildlife away from the road side edge of the Forest Reserves. Nonetheless,
several species of animals may be expected to inhabit the Forest Reserves including smaller
mammals such as the Wild Boar and Jackal amongst others.
At km 43, an archway spans the road (see Figure 2.4.20). The archway allows only one lane of
traffic to pass through it at a time and causes significant delays. It is associated with the Sri
Venkateswara Swami Temple nearby. The archway should not be affected by the upgrade. One
possible way of avoiding disturbance to the structure is to allow one lane of traffic to continue
to pass beneath the arch and construct a single lane around the structure to carry vehicles
travelling in the other direction.

About 3km outside Chandrigiri there is a level crossing and one km further there is a single lane
bridge, both of which cause traffic delays. Bhakarapeta and Narasingapuram are the two major
villages on this section of the route but neither provide any significant impediment to traffic.
The road confinuous 4kmn fuirther on to a small village where a large Banyan tree is situated in the
centre of the T-intersection. This tree will not be affected by any roadworks proposed in this
project.
The vegetation is generally dry, arid zone vegetation. There are no sacred groves in the nearby
area. It will be possible to construct the project without affecting any graves or temples on this
section of road.
From Chandrigiri the road leads north-east towards the major tourist destination of Tirupathi.
Tirupathi is the service town at the base of the 800 metre high hill, upon which is situated the
holy site of Tinumala. Tirumala is one of the most important pilgrim centres in all India, because
of ancient Vaishnavaite temple of Lord Venkateswara. An average of 30,000 people per day
come to Tirumala to worship, and this total is often as high as I100,000. With such a high tourist
centre comes a large amount of urbanisation and the roads leading through the town are generally
7 metres wide and have good quality surfaces.
The road passes alongside the Sri Venkateswara National Park and the Sri Venkateswara
Zoological Park. The Zoological Park is located approximately 3 km from Tirumala,

immediately adjacent to the road and is fully fenced. Road works will not affect the park. While
the actual boundary of the National Park is poorly defined on maps, it is assumed that the road
forms the park boundary in this area. The road runs alongside the base of the holy hill of
Tirumala turning right at a round about and crossing a large bridge. The road here is very good,
with lane separation.
The vegetation east of Chandrigiri consists of dry deciduous, mixed forest with patches of moist
deciduous forest in some valleys. Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus) is endemic to this
region and grows throughout areas of remnant native vegetation devoid of human intervention.
There are no areas of significant avenue planting along this section of road. This section of road
was not studied by the sub-consultants so there are no estimates of the number of trees to be
removed. The coastal plain to the east of Tirupathi is characterised by irrigation and heavy
cultivation.
rl         On the eastern side of the bridge is a turn off to the Tirupathi town centre and the route continues
to the north-east to Renigunta, about 8 km away. This road has two lanes and has suffered from
ribbon development for much of its length. The road surface is poor at the Renigunta junction,
beneath the rail overpass, and work is currently being done on improving the surface here.

3j        This route links the important tourist sites surrounding Tirupathi and the Bangalore road to the
NH5 running along the coast. The road drops gently as it traverses flat plains. The area is
relatively well watered and supports many forms of agriculture, particularly rice.
The road travels alongside the railway line through cultivated fields for 27km and through the
village of Erpedu. Erpedu has very little encroachment or congestion. The rail line bends to the
I         north about 4km from Sri Kalahasti and a bridge over a perennial waterway is found on the
outskirts of town. Encroachment here is significant and a bypass may be considered, although it
would be outside the scope of this project.
A number of sacred groves are listed as occurring near Sri Kalahasti. These are Kannappa Konda,
Sugha  Theertham,  Neelaknateswara  Swamy  Tempie,  Ayyappe  Swamy  Konda,
Markanayatheertham and Indratheertham. None of these sites are within sight of the ROW and
so they will not be affected.
The road continues and 5km from Sri Kalahasti it leaves the Chittoor district and enters the
Nellore district. The road crosses the district boundary twice more before reaching Nayudupeta
|         29km later. This area is well watered and lies on the coastal lowlands. Cross drainage structures
were not counted for this section of road.
3         No Forest Reserves or critical natural habitats are affected by this road proposal. Figure 2.4.21
illustrates this road also, and its important features.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project         3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
3. ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
3.1 Major Issues
Environmental impacts can be classified in many ways. A useful way is by impact cause and this
generally includes;
*     Direct Impacts - those impacts caused as a direct result of proect activity (such as the
removal of trees, disturbance of borrow areas, sh-iing of houses, siltation etc)
*     Indirect Impacts - those. impacts resulting from aivitdes prom.oted .by the project but
not directly attributable to it (such as future traffic pollution, industrial/economic
growth, effects of material supply :etc) .
*      -Cumulative Impacts:- where relatively mior ipa, in assoiation with the impacts
of other activity (now or later), conibute to significant changes.
Another classification is on temporal pattern, that is either short term or long term. For
infrastructure development this is frequently considered as either construction related impacts
(temporary) or permanent impacts. Many impacts are short lived and without any long lasting
effect. Other impacts will not become apparent for significant periods of time after the activity
is completed. Impacts will also vary with spatial distribution, such as noise. In such cases the
impact varies with the distance from the activity and the "significance" of any impact depends
on where it is assessed.
Environmental impacts can also be positive or negative, reversible or irreversible. Many EAs
focus on the negative aspects, such as loss of amenity, but projects like the AP State Highway
Project can have significant positive benefits by reducing dust, noise and air pollution, increasing
productivity/supply of services and improving safety. Indirectly roads can be major catalyst in
the overall development of regions. The positive benefits can also be enhanced by appropriate
mitigation and enhancement actions, such as increased tree planting, traffic separation and
improved right-of-way control. Impacts cannot always be predicted, and random patterns (such
as unseasonal storms or a drought at a critical time) can dramatically change the severity of
expected impacts.
Many documents and guidelines are available listing the potential impacts of road projects, but
the severity and significance of these depends on specific features of the project, site, scale and
construction methods, as well as variables such as weather and supervision. Each situation is
unique and requires specific attention to the work being proposed.
Despite the large geographic spread of the 3000km of road being reviewed under this study all
roads were travelled to prepare a detailed environmental analysis. Those sections being proposed
for design were, however, inspected for site specific concerns and a significant proportion of the
remaining 1 000km being proposed were also visited. Based on preliminary scoping of the areas,
and the work being proposed, the following key issues were seen as most important to this
project;
protection of Reserve and sanctuary areas
effective restoration of borrow areas and quarries

Andlhra Pradesh State Highway Project        3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
*     tree removal and replacement tree planting
*     maintaining waterway areas and preventing siltation
*     protection of sacred groves, grave sites and temples
*     waste management, particularly from construction camps
*     acquisition of land, displacement of permanent landholders and squatters
*     encroachment and compatibility with local government development, and
*     environmental awareness of staff and explicit responsibility for mitigation.
These are dealt with more fully under elements of the natural and human environment. In most
cases there will be differences in construction related and permanent impacts.
3.2 Physical and Natural Environment
3.2.1 Topograplhy/Soil and landform
The key changes to landform resulting from the project will be;
(Changes in road embankments. Whilst the project is largely confined to existing
alignments, and within existing right-of-ways, the rehabilitation and widening activity
will raise, extend and enlarge existing road embankments, or new embankments will be
placed. As freshly consolidated sediments these are prone to erosion, and will cause some
visual and physical obstruction. In most cases the scale will be marginal, with little
change evident. Attention to batter stabilisation, selection of less erodable material and
compaction will be needed. Particular batter protection around culverts may be needed
and batter drains will be installed on high fills. In all instances, final forming and
revegetation will be completed as soon as possible after fill placement to allow natural
regeneration. This is generally a short term impact only.
* Borrow Pit excavations. Roads in India are bordered by a series of often discontinuous
and regularly shaped (easier for measurement) excavations, both within and outside the
ROW. These can cause drainage and visual problems, with the potential for increased
disease vector activity. Under the new IRC specification borrow areas are to be located
outside the ROW with restoration expected. These are frequently subject to negotiation
between the Contractor and adjacent landowner. A more positive approach might be
taken, with the creation of additional tanks or improvements to local drainage patterns but,
at the least, site supervisors will be instructed to ensure that restoration is completed
before final acceptance of the contract.
Quarry operations. Substantial quantities of crushed rock and sand will be required for
the macadam based pavements normally constructed in India, and for concrete. A
network of commercial quarries have been established in AP based on the igneous and
metamorphic rock outcrops, which occur over the state, and alluvial deposits. A separate
study on material sourcing and quarries is being prepared and this should be referred to
for more specific detail. Whilst operation of quarries are an independently regulated
activity, the project will increase the rate of utilisation and resource depletion. With an
indirect effect, it is appropriate that some consideration be given to the environmental
implications in selection of quarry sources and that appropriate site restoration plans exist.

Andhra Pradesh State Highlway Project       3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
The project will contribute to the long term depletion of such resources but the issue of
restoration remains more important.
Construction Camp sites. The construction work will be contracted in a number of
packages and under normal contracting procedures it is expected that each Contractor will
establish a base site adjacent to the work site which provides office and residential
facilities. These are frequently only temporary sites that are leased from adjacent
landowners and become disorganised sites of disused equipment, containers and
materials. Considering the problems with rehabilitation of these sites and the lack of
arable land in many parts of the state it may be appropriate for alternative arrangements
to be considered. This may involve development of the many R&B office and guest
house facilities, or those of other local authorities, for later handover or conversion. This
can avoid costs of demolition and could provide additional community based facilities.
All sites need to be appropriately rehabilitated on completion.
Resumption of land is involved (see 3.3.2) and will result in some minor landuse change. In most
cases land impacts are relatively short term, but this necessitates attention to restoration and
rehabilitation, often outside the direct contractual responsibilities or BoQ items. The tropical
climate and soil conditions of Andhra Pradesh provide good regeneration capacity and no
unmanageable issues are envisaged.
3.2.2 Water
Road projects can create both favourable and unfavourable impacts on the hydrologic cycle,
affecting both surface and groundwater patterns, through volume, flow and quality changes.
Under the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules, 1993 water quality discharge
standards have been established for inland surface waters, sewers, land for irrigation and marine
coastal areas. It will be a legal obligation on the Contractor that any discharge from the work site
meets these standards. These include up to 46 physical and chemical parameters. Some
monitoring mechanism in the contract supervision is desirable and testing equipment needs to be
available.
The surface drainage system in AP follows a dendritic pattern based on the major river
catchments leading to the Bay of Bengal, but interrupted by a well utilised system of tanks and
reservoirs. The project roads cross these drainage lines at various levels and locations. Irrigation
is widely applied, with 500,000 ha irrigated in 1980, and substantial investment (65% of
development outlay in 5th Plan) has been made in its expansion. This has frequently had impact
on the roads, often contributing to their damage, through seepage and construction.
Since the ioads are existing then provision has been made, in most cases, for cross drainage
structures of sufficient discharge capacity, with undue ponding or retention of water previously
avoided. A number of causeways will need to be replaced with structures and attention will be
needed to design for appropriate return interval rainfall. Flooding is known to occur at a number
of road locations and some limited flood hazard mapping has been done by APRSAC. Whilst it
might be expected that the project roads will be occasionally blocked, the frequency and duration
of closure will be limited, commensurate with the economic importance of the link. Sizing of

Andlhra Pradesh State Higliway Project       3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
drainage structures will allow for a discharge event with a return period of approximately 20
years. They will not cause any reduction or inhibition of the waterway compared to adjacent
structures, such as on rail lines. Suitable protection will be provided around drainage structures
to prevent scour for expected flow velocities.
In a number of situations the project roads are either along the containing embankment of
reservoirs, adjacent to them, or have themselves created mini-reservoirs (tanks account for 26%
of irrigation). This containment of water has frequently led to the creation of wetland and bird
breeding/nesting areas as at Nadular and Votimitta. In such cases, widening will need to be
strictly controlled to avoid pollution, turbidity or siltation. In many cases any widening can be
undertaken on the side away from the reservoir, but where this is not possible then silt retaining
membranes will be installed until embankments are stabilised. Care will also be taken in ensuring
that road drainage provisions, or new embankments, do not alter current wetland status.
Relatively shallow groundwater wells are utilised for 20% of irrigation in AP, particularly away
from the coastal belt and in the south west, but the catchment area is large and the project is not
expected to have any significant impact on aquifer depletion or recharge.
In the longer term vehicle pollutants (dust, lead, zinc. hydrocarbons) are deposited on the road
surface and can ultimately find their way into the water system, but should be no more than
would now occur. With improved vehicle performance on a new road these may actually be
reduced.
3.2.3 Air Quality
Dust, noise and vehicle emissions are all associated with roads in India. The surface deterioration
of the existing project roads gives rise to major dust problems, particularly in the dry season, and
the constant hooting of horns contributes to a relatively high, albeit diurnal cycle, noise level.
This is pronounced in towns where congestion, pavement damage and the level of traffic is
greater. Under the Air Act, 1981 noise standards have been set for motor vehicles (80-91 dBA),
and vehicle emission standards do exist, but are high and rarely achieved.
Ambient noise levels in rural areas can be low but in urban and industrial areas, road traffic is but
one of many audible disturbances.
Some temporary increase in dust and noise might be expected from construction traffic, and some
shift in impact locality will occur with any bypass. The degree of impact from these activities can,
however, be mitigated by modern engineering practice and equipment. This is discussed in the
mitigation section.
With growth in traffic using the roads in the longer term, noise and air pollution will increase.
This will tend to increase regardless of the improvements and, with a better driving surface, the
project will contribute to some reduction in noise. Expected improvements from control of motor
vehicle emissions, and unleaded fuel, will also contribute to a general reduction in air pollution
over the longer term.

-A n-hra Pradeshi Siae  HigAhway Project    3. Assessmenit of Environmental Impacts
The project is not expected to have any particular impact on vehicle ownership numbers nor
usage patterns, and should not affect global climate related concerns. Use of unleaded petrol and
catalytic converters, and improved driving behaviour, can have more significant effects.
3.2.4 Flora anid Fauna
The presence of reserve areas have been noted in the project road profiles and details of
threatened or endangered species in India are given at Annex 3. Two roads in particular have the
potential to significantly affect areas of critical natural habitat which house important flora and
fauna species. These have already been mentioned and a full EIA is recommended for these
areas. The two critical habitats are:
*     the Kawal sanctuary on road 2(a) from Lakshettipet to Gudihatnoor
*     Nagarjuna Sagar - Srisailam sanctuary on road 2(b) from Guntur to Kumool
The proposed terms of reference for the EIA are presented in Annex 7.
In addition to the above areas, two roads pass along the boundaries of critical areas.
Road 2(c) passes along the eastern boundary of the Sri Venkateswara National Park. However,
the existing railway line between the road and the park will tend to mitigate any impacts caused
by upgrading the road. The most important impact would be the inhibition of movement for
various migratory animals. The rail line is generally on a relatively high embankment with long,
high bridges across water courses allowing wild life to pass beneath the line. If the road was to
be upgraded in a manner that maintains the movement corrodors accorded by the railway line,
the environmiental impact of the road upgrading would be minimal. Bridges on the road upgrade
should therefore be built to correspond in location and size to those of the railway line. Enough
room should be available to leave some dry land under the bridge during heavy rainfall to allow
animals to pass during these times.
Road 2(c) also passes beside two tanks that are included as part of the Sri Lankesmalla National
Park. The road runs beside the Vontimitta Tank and along the bund of the Nadular Tank. Both
areas are significant bird habitats as well as supplying water to their respective villages. Strict
sediment and erosion control measures need to be undertaken during the construction phase to
ensure that the road upgrade does not cause impacts on the water quality of these two tanks,
thereby affecting the bird and aquatic life that inhabit them and the villagers that use them. Other
effects of the road upgrade on the bird life in these areas will be minor.
Road 2(g) between Madanapalle-Renigunta forms the boundary between the Sri Venkateswara
Sanctuary to the north and a Reserve Forest to the south. Because of the sensitivity of the habitat
in this area the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was requested to carry out a preliminary
investigation on impact and possible mitigation measures on this road. A copy of their report is
included itn Annexure 12. Widening of the road will involve the removal of some wildlife habitat
in both the sanctuary (3km) and the forest reserve (3km). However the forest affected is not
prime wildlife habitat and the widening will have minimal affect on the sanctuary. The most
significant impacts to the sanctuary are likely to occur during construction. It is recommended
that quarrying of stone, construction of labour camps and collection of fuel are prohibited in
sanctuary and forest areas to minimise the adverse impact on the sanctuary during construction.

Andlhra Pradesh State Higqhway Project       3. AssessmentofEnviroiintentalIImpacts
Specific mitigation measures for the above mentioned roads are included in Section 5.3.6.
Forest Reserves are located throughout Andhra Pradesh adjacent to the road reserve. The
Forestry Department runs these plantations and stocks species such as Eucalyptus and Red
Sanders. These plantations are not generally stores of biological diversity, stocked with a wide
variety of species, but are simply stocks of individual species that have economic value. Red
Sanders is a species listed as endemic to the southern region of Andhra Pradesh and its rarity is
due to its wide and diverse uses. Utilisation of species within the Forestry Reserves is still
allowed.
As well as normally having a low species diversity, the Forest Reserve plantations are well off
the road (beginning a further 15 metres inside the Reserve boundary fence). This means that
despite widening the road, there will be no loss of trees. Forestry Reserves will not be
significantly impacted by the Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project.
Sacred groves are defined as wild areas containing substantial biological diversity that are held
in great esteem or awe by local people. Today, in the vastly altered landscape of Andhra Pradesh,
they are the only remnants of tree vegetation in many parts of the state. As well as maintaining
biodiversity, they serve other critical functions such as the sources of leaf litter or in the
protection of water sources.
There are no sacred groves currently known to be situated within the ROW for the APSHP. Only
the Singaraya Konda is within sight of the road. This sacred grove covers 20 ha of land
associated with a temple. The grove is well protected and well away from the road. All other
sacred groves mentioned in the WWF publication, "Sacred and Protected Groves of Andhra
Pradesh" are well clear of the ROW.
Sacred groves listed in the WWF publication are generally large areas, however, small groups
of trees associated with small temples or graves are seen throughout the countryside. These have
little significance for maintaining biodiversity due to their size, however, they do have religious
significance. Because of their proximity to grave sites they will not be affected by the proposed
road upgrade.
A number of roadside trees will require removal and an estimate of numbers has been given for
certain sections by the domestic consultants. This issue of tree removal is one of particular
relevance to any road project in India, as was demonstrated with the reaction to the East Coast
Road in Tamil Nadu.
Whilst the issue of biological preservation or greenhouse gas emissions may not be the
underlying concerns, with issues of shade for travellers in an otherwise hot and dusty country and
the "aesthetics" of avenue planting more relevant, roadside trees have developed some very vocal
lobbyists. In most cases historical roadside planting (Banyan, Pipal, Neem, Imli etc) are neither
rare nor particularly valuable timber species. Many (such as Neem) have some medicinal and
supplementary fuel or use values, particularly in fodder short times, and are 'part of the
landscape'. This non-timber use is frequently demonstrated by many of the trees being heavily
coppiced, making them less than magnificent specimens. Many of these trees are of a large
diameter and, located on the edge of a pavement with fast traffic, can be a safety hazard to traffic
as well as cause damage to pavements (Figure 3.2.1).

3.3 Human and Social Environment
3.3.1 Communit life and economic activity
There is no clear, nor well developed, hierarchy of roads in Andhra Pradesh. A limited number
of National Highways cross the state and connect the major urban centres. State Highways
connect District Centres but the local collector road systems are relatively poorly developed.
Ribbon development is common and even highways are used as routes for the local movement
of stock and pedestrians, as well as grain/brush drying or storage (see Figures 3.3.1 and 3.3.2).

|         Many of the project roads have not seen major traffic growth as a result of their poor condition,
rather than any lack of demand or potential network benefit. Improvements under the project will
see speeds and volumes increase. This is indeed the objective of the project. Whilst such an
3 |       outcome is in the interests of regional economic development and transit users, it will have
implications for local residents along the routes in terms of opportunities, outside influences,
disruption and safety. A pilot safety pragram is recommended for non-motorised transport and
this is discussed in section 3.3.9.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project       3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
[1        Many of the areas have been relatively isolated, despite mass media and education, and the
appreciation of motor vehicle behaviour, and accepted road rules, or risks is limited.
There will be temporary effects during construction, primarily by offering employment options
and added commercial demands, but in the longer term there will be more significant changes as
a result of road improvements. In most cases people see these changes as positive, after having
suffered the delays, costs and nuisance of poor roads, but there are some whose traditional
patterns of living will be disrupted.
Temporary disruption of the road access will occur during the construction period but contract
provisions for detours and maintaining a trafficable surface will minimise these. Access and
Niu       egress to markets and shops in villages will be a particular issue and all work will be coordinated
with the local authorities. The opportunity exists for more planned development and control of
ribbon encroachment by coordination of town planning activities and recommendations in this
regard are made later.
3.3.2 LandAcquisition and Resettlement
Land records are not readily accessible and are maintained by a number of different District
Administrations. Based on the physical recording of remaining boundary markers in the field by
the domestic consultants the existing right-of-way varies from anywhere between 8m to 30 m.
The minimum adopted standard for a state highway is some 30 m under IRC guidelines. This
provides reasonable protection of the thoroughfare and allows future widening without disruption.
In the absence of a full ROW, displacement of people will occur under the project. The number
will depend on those using the existing ROW, and where realignment or a bypass is required.
A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and a Social Report are being produced separately. As part
of the RAP a full list of encroachments on the project roads is currently being undertaken.
Encroachment and the use of an apparently "unused" road reserve is a reality in India. Landless
squatters and adjacent farmers alike see value in using the apparently vacant land. This can be a
productive use of otherwise idle land, but can frequently cause damage to the road, either
3         physically by excavation or irrigation, or in performance through added congestion. Historically
the responsibility for control of encroachment has been unclear with police, R&B and local
administrations having failed to exercise their legal powers. Whilst legally the encroachers have
fi        no right to occupation nor compensation, there is an ethical and moral obligation that their
position be considered, based on long-term 'user-rights'. World Bank policy (OD4.30) also
requires that all project affected persons (PAP) be considered and through the Social Report they
will be.
There are three possible bypasses proposed in Phase I at Nalgonda, Mirialguda and Piduguralla
on Road l(b). If these are constructed significant land acquistion will be required. Minor amounts

of land aquistion will also be required at various locations on the Phase I roads to allow for
geometric improvements in the road alignment.
Some further widening of the ROW will certainly be required under Phase II and will involve
acquisition of a new ROW at the following locations;
Cuddapah (5.1ha required)
Rajampet (5.3ha required)
Renigunta (7.8ha required)
others to be specified
ri        Estimates for land needed and people affected are noted based on the data provided by the
domestic consultants but more detailed design is required before final estimates can be given.
rl        In view of the significance of resettlement and rehabilitation readers are referred to the separate
social assessment and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
3.3.3 Indigenous and Traditionalpopulations
ni        Special attention is given in India to minority groups under the Scheduled Castes and Tribal
Population policies. Specific lands are allocated and government funding available. These are
rigidly enforced. The Scheduled Castes account for 15.9% and Scheduled Tribes 6.3% of the total
AP population (1991 data). Scheduled tribes are more pronounced in the in the far north of the
state whilst Scheduled Castes are concentrated in the north-west, and south-east.
I         No specific issues in relation to minority groups is expected with the project, but it will be a
concern when considering land resumption. Subsequently the impact of the road upgrade on these
people is considered in the Social Report and the impact these people have on their environment
will be assessed in the full EIA that has been recommended.
1         3.3.4 Cultural Heritage
India is a land of historical monuments and Andhra Pradesh is no exception. Andhra Pradesh was
created by the combination of the old princely state of Hyderabad and the Telugu-speaking
portions of the old Madras state. It has a long history of settlement stretching back to Buddhist
times when it was part of Ashoka's large empire, and traces still remain. In the 7th century the
Chalukyas held power until they fell to the Chola kingdom in the 10th century. The Kakatiyas
rose in the 13th century and were based at Warangal but this gave way to Muslim power in 1323.
The Hindu Vijaynagar empire soon challenged Muslim power and in 1543 the Qutab Shahi
I         dynasty was established at Hyderabad. In 1687 the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb took over the
kingdom and established the nizams of Hyderabad, who ruled through to independence.
Whilst predominantly a Hindu population (89%) it has a large Muslim component (8%)
concentrated on Hyderabad with Christians (3%), Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists also present.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project       3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
Temples, graves and sacred sites abound, along with archaeological remains. Important sites may
frequently be a minor structure under a Banyan tree at the side of the road, and its significance
may lay in local knowledge alone. The impressive Kakatiya ruins at Warangal, the Buddhist sites
at Nagarjuna Sagar and Amaravathi and the Kanakadrga temple at Vijayawada, as well as the
temple complex at Tirumala in the south-east are particular, more visible, sites of importance and
none of these will be directly affected. The Gooty Water Tank is the most important heritage site
found along the project roads and it was built in 1619 AD. It will not be disturbed by the road
fl        works.
It was not possible to do a full archaeological survey of the ROW but the major sites are located
off the project roads and the visual inspection was used to pick up the more obvious concerns
of temples and graves. There are a multitude of graves and temples nearby the roads however
these will be designed around where necessary and none will be shifted.
The approach to be taken is to avoid any historical or religious sites during the design and
construction phases. Should sites become exposed during construction then appropriate
archaeological agencies will be consulted.
3.3.5 Aesthetics and Landscape
The project involves an existing road and no substantial landscape change is expected. Increases
in embanknent width and height will in places make it more visually obvious and the severance
effect will be increased, both by size and traffic patterns. Options for changes in alignment to
improve aesthetics have only been considered only where they would not increase acquisition
needs and enviromnental problems.
Much can, nevertheless, be done to enhance the visual impact of the roads and a specific
I         treeplanting/landscaping component under each contract will occur and specifications relating
to the contract of Phase I are included in Annex 8. It has already been noted that avenue shade
trees are well accepted as a social good in India. Some sub-continent countries have even
1         established policies that set aside a percentage of road construction costs for tree planting. Tree
planting and vegetation can enhance the delineation of road alignment, offer a buffer (primarily
visual but potentially with some noise and pollution attenuation effect) but this needs to be based
on ecologically appropriate planting and concerns for safety. Much of the cost of the revegetaion
schemes can be derived from selling the timber cut down during the road widening process.
3.3.6 Road safety
3         Road accident statistics were sought as part of the domestic consultant studies from records kept
with local police. These are far from accurate nor comprehensive, and the data available is very
limited. It is apparent, however, that road accidents in AP are a matter for concern. Some local
a          consultants were able to identify "black" spots and particular design attention is needed at these
locations.

There can be little doubt that improving the surface of the road and its alignment will encourage
increased speeds and with that the risk of even more serious accidents. Pedestrians, not used to
fast traffic, will also be exposed and their behaviour, as well as that of the drivers, needs to be
considered. Improvements in alignment and better traffic separation, as well as increased roadway
width based on modem standards will help alleviate current dangers but it remains important that
|l         due attention be given to safety, as a part of any road improvement.
Safety audits can provide a useful tool for analysis and consideration will be given to pre and post
|          construction auditing as part of the overall project monitoring.

1          3.3.7 Urban Centres and Built-Up Areas
A significant proportion of traffic entering urban centres is not 'through' traffic. Almost all buses
and many trucks stop within these settlements to deliver and collect passengers and goods en
route to other destinations. Any bypass of urban areas must also provide for access to the
3           commercial centres of the urban areas. However, once in the urban area it is doubtful whether the
vehicles would return to access the bypass prefering instead to continue on through the town, and
congestion would remain. Congestion problems still remain in many towns which have bypasses
such as Nagari on the Cuddapah to the State Border via Renigunta Road (2(c)).

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project        3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
fl        Over time, and as induced through traffic increases, the proposed bypasses will become corridors
of commercial activity, generated through passing trade. Service roads to reduce this
r          encroachment would greatly add to the cost and the duration of the project.
Providing improvements on alignments through towns will require custom made solutions which
rl         will need to take into account encroachment, R&R issues, environmental issues, economic issues,
constructibility and the urban networking effect.
rl         As the project is a rural road project, the detailed studies required for bypasses and improvements
through the larger towns is considered to be outside the PCC's scope of work. The additional
studies required could be carried out in Phase II.
The following approach has been taken in the design of the Phase I works:
n          .l     Where a town is relatively small (generally population less than 20,000) and the project
road is the only major road passing through it, the road will be strengthened in the urban
area to a width which does not affect encroachers and therefore will not result in R&R
issues.
51   *  In larger towns which may be serviced by a number of major roads it is not logical to
cnstruct the project road through the urban centre because of the relatively high cost of
urban construction (underground drainage, intersections etc) which would significantly
3               reduce the length of road constructed under the project and the need take into account
other factors such as R&R, economic factors and the urban traffic network. The project
roads therefore commence and terminate at the outskirts of the larger towns. In a number
I                of cases, the roads analysed in the Feasibility Studies terminated at the edges of the larger
towns in any case.
A summary of the approach taken to the design at major centres is given in Table 3.3.7.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project       3. Assessment of Environmental Impacts
A line diagramme of the project roads and the major towns is included in Annex 10.
3.3.8 Occupational Health and Safety
Il        Worker safety regulations do exist in India and it is an active participant in ILO activities. Whilst
the focus is on conditions and industrial type industry, there is relevance to the road construction
industry. The observations of limited provision for traffic, safety equipment and practices (such
as boiling bitumen drums on roadsides) are not considered particularly good for worker health.
Due attention to enforcing appropriate OH&S practices is needed.
3.3.9 Non-Motorised Transport
fll       Non-motorised transport (NMT) makes up a large proportion of road users in Andhra Pradesh.
Sections of all project roads are currently used by non-motorised transport, especially at
approaches to towns and villages, and this will continue after completion of the new construction.
Non-motorised forms of transport are particularly environmentally friendly and are used by the
poor.
Inter-urban non-motorised transport does not cause significant congestion problems due to the
small number of vehicles involved. However, a major safety issue exists because of the high
difference in speeds between NMT and motorised vehicles using the road. Inter-urban NMT is
catered for in the road design by the inclusion of a 1.5 m paved shoulder and a 1 m gravelled
verge adjacent to the carriageway. This total of 2.5 m will allow NMT to stay off the main
carriageway and away from faster moving traffic.
In urban areas and the approach to urban areas, safety of NMT is also a problem, despite slower
motorised vehicle speeds, because of the much greater volume of NMT. In addition, non-
motorised transport adds significantly to traffic congestion in these areas.
It is recommended that a pilot study is included in the project to address the safety and
congestions problems of NMT in urban areas. This pilot study would involve construction of a
number of different systems to separate NMT from through traffic and would include a
monitoring programme to allow an assessment to be made of the performance of each of the
trialed systems.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                              4. Alternatives
Id          4. ALTERNATIVES
|           4.1 Do-nothing
Road travel times in Andhra Pradesh are unduly long and average speeds down to 30km/hr are
3           now common on roads designed for 80-1OOkm per hour. On some sections of the project roads
speeds of less than 5km/hr only are possible. The surface condition, width and congestion are
the key factors resulting in this productivity loss. These serviceability problems are being
U           exacerbated by the lack of maintenance and road user behaviour. Rail and other transport modes
do not offer a viable substitute network so that vehicle ownership and use of road freight transport
has been increasing rapidly with India's development.
Without restoration of the existing state road network the road transport system will collapse and
3           services to remote areas will become unduly expensive, affecting exports and imports.
Expenditure on National Highways and feeder roads will also be made less effective. Under these
circumstances any "do-nothing" scenario is viewed as unacceptable. In most cases the work being
=j          proposed will be confined to the existing right-of-way, with investment and impact above a
minimal "fix" being marginal.
I           Improvements to existing roads within the current ROW are generally the more economical, and
the most environmentally sound, approach to road improvement. Despite severe problems in
operations, maintenance and with narrow pavements, the project roads provide a generally good
E           network for the provision of goods and services within the state and no new roads are being
proposed. Improvements in the national highway system are already taking place and the state
highway system needs to be able to effectively complement that system. Without improvements
I           to the state highway system the national highway investment would be jeopardised as more
regional traffic is forced to use the national road system. Similarly, investment will be needed on
the local road system to achieve maximum benefits
4.2 Options considered
*           4.2.1 Geometric
3           Since the work is largely restricted to the existing horizontal alignment there were few locational
alternatives available. Options proposed by the domestic consultants included isolated
straigthening of sections and bypasses. Various options will, however, need to be considered in
J           the detailed design including the form of pavement construction, width, structure widening and
final bypass locations adopted.
The overall geometric standard of the existing road alignment is generally good, with long
straight sections and gentle grades, resulting from the relatively gentle relief. A design speed of
*           80 to 100km/hr has been adopted for detailed design based on modified IRC Standards. Speeds
*           of this magnitude would not normally be expected due to congestion levels. A design speed of
less than 100km/hr might be considered but is not expected to make any real differences to direct

environmental implications.
Within the IRC Standards, options for reduced pavement width might be considered, where less
disruption or tree felling is likely to occur, but needs to be considered in relation to effects on
safety and the significance of resulting benefits. Widening on one side only can also be
considered for specific sections. Two standardised cross-sections have been adopted (see Figure
1.4).
4.2.2 Design and Construction methods
A stated objective of the project is to improve the capacity of R&B to provide for operation and
management of the road system. This will generally entail the introduction of modem design and
construction methods, with strict emission standards and minimal wastage. CADD is being
utilised in the survey and design for the project and staff are being trained in using the equipment
n         introduced. Pavement investigation and testing is also extending the use of analytical techniques,
as will mechanistic design methods. These will not have direct environmental benefits but will
allow options in pavement structure and construction methods to be considered. Lessening
pavement depth required, using alternative materials and greater productivity of modem
equipment can have major indirect environmental benefits. Strict construction control can also
|         contribute to a decrease in any adverse environmental impact. Specifications with strong
environmental clauses, environmental monitoring and a higher level of environmental awareness
will contribute to a more ecologically sound project.
The use of modern construction equipment, with effective maintenance, will result in less
pollution and will be encouraged. Pollution abatement techniques, such as mulching, bitumen
emulsion, revegetation and silt traps, will also decrease impact and will be encouraged.
Opportunities for local involvement and work creation might be considered further.
11        4.2.3 Bypasses
This project is a rural roads project and is not intended to focus on the problems of congestion
I         and encroachment in urban areas. A detailed study recommended for each locationwhere a bypass
is being considered.
Alternative alignments for bypasses have generally been evaluated on the basis of land
acquisition necessary and the extent of productive land being alienated, within the constraints of
3         existing development and natural features. No major concerns exist with the approach taken but
more detailed studies are needed before all options could be fully considered.
3         Attention will be given to defining landuse on the new alignments, ensuring disruption to
watercourses and social activity is avoided, and minimising the use of productive land. This can
generally be equated to minirnising the length of bypass, and its cost. An important concern for
any new bypasses is to avoid future encroachment and control access.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                         5. Recommendations
l 1       5. MITIGATION AND ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 General
Like virtually any large construction project the APSHP will have impacts on the environment.
nl         The analysis undertaken has indicated that the project, in general, does have a number of
potentially adverse environmental impacts. These should be assessed through a full EIA, to
enable the environmental impacts, and methods to mitigate those impacts, to be known by the
completion of that report and therefore be carried into the road design. Nonetheless the project
will have a number of other direct and indirect environmental risks not associated with the critical
natural habitats and it is appropriate that adequate safeguards be built into the project. Similarly,
where impacts might be positive, opportunities for enhancement will be taken.
Responsibility for environmental protection rests with all parties in the project. A number of
legal obligations exist, but it is imperative that, for ecologically sustainable development to occur,
all individuals recognise their own role and opportunity. Each and every person can contribute.
R&B has overall obligations to meet GOI policy. The Contractors will have legal requirements.
MOEF and PCB staff will have obligations under their enabling legislation. R&B and consultant
staff will also have opportunities and obligations.
A mitigation plan will define feasible and cost effective measures in which potentially significant
adverse environmental impacts (if any) can be reduced. It will ensure, as far as feasible, that
I         environmental concerns are in phase with engineering activity. Whilst the scale or complexity
of the project sections not recommended for inclusion in the full EIA do not require a specific
a         Environmental Management Plan, some basic procedures and safeguards are warranted.
The key method for achieving effective mitigation is through awareness and appropriate contract
provisions, but this can be supplemented by general project policy and activity.
5.2 Construction Contract Provisions
The most convenient and cost effective way to ensure that works are environmentally sound is
to include these requirements in the construction contract provisions. The contract provisions
3          establish the scope of and conditions under which work is to proceed.
It is expected that the IRC Specification for Road and Bridge Works (1995) and FIDIC General
|          Conditions of Contract will be used for construction contract purposes. Some provisions for the
protection of the environment are included in these documents but additional clauses are
proposed, particularly in provision of specific mitigation and enhancement works.
The IRC Specification has a number of clauses relevant to environmental concerns. Clause Ill
(Precautions for Safeguarding the Environment) has general requirements for borrow-pit location,
I          quarry operations, control of erosion and pollution, as well as hazardous substances. The Scope
of Works (Clause 105) includes attention to first-aid, adequate sanitary arrangements, regular
zSI             I

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                            5. Recommendations
clearance of rubbish and clearing-up of the site. Clause 201 on Site Clearance has a requirement
to preserve roadside trees, monumrents not to be disturbed and for control of erosion and water
pollution. It also provides for removal of roots, overhanging trees and waste. Clause 306 (Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control) provides for provision of berms, sediment basins, fibre mats,
mulches, grasses, slope drains and other devices to be specified, or directed. It also provides for
rl         minimisation of areas opened and corrective action at Contractor's expense. Clause 307 provides
for Turfing with Sods and clause 308 for Seeding and Mulching. Additional clauses on specific
matters are needed.
The FIDIC General Conditions have only a general environmental clause and allow for the
inclusion of Special Conditions. Numerous specifications relating to revegetation in particular
au         that will be included in the contract document are presented in Annex 8. Contract provisions for
the critical natural habitats will not be available until after the full EIA has been completed.
The following specific additions are recommended, with draft clauses noted;

3         To ensure that site supervision is able to measure and quantify major pollutants the project
will provide for the testing of key pollution parameters, such as suspended solids, pH1 and
s      ~~chemicals.
f5.3 Supplementary Mitigation
1      ~~5.3.1 Institutional
The lack of an institutional focus for environment issues in R&B is a matter of concern.
The key element to an effective management plan is the explicit allocation of responsibility and
the provision of resources. While all staff have some responsibility to meet GOI environment
policy, without a focus for environmental concerns in R&B it is unlikely that adequate attention
will be given to ecological concerns. It is widely accepted in road departments elsewhere that it
3     - ~is advisable to have some form of environmental unit - particularly as a single contact for
Environment Deparments. With the development of a parallel component for institutional
development of R&D it is appropriate that some linkage and recomnmendations in this regard be
I  made as part of this study.
Explicit responsibility for prevention of encroachment will also be allocated and the legal basis
I    ~    ~clarified. Whilst the records provided by R&D indicate that some monitoring has occurred it is
apparent that control has not always been effective. The interaction of Police, R&D and District
admninistrations in this regard will be actively pursued. This would be a useful function that could
be asociated with an Environment Unit as part of a more general property function. Long term
acquisition of a full ROW on the priority road system will be pursued as a longer term goal.
I  Also linked is the arboriculture and landscaping functions associated with roads. Some road
authorities promote an active arboriculture program and these are effectively associated with the
3      ~~environment functions. Recommendations for an Environment Unit are given as Annex 4 and
these are being considered in the institutional development work currently being undertaken. The
recommendations for setting up an Environmental Unit is a long-term objective. In the short term
I      ~~however, an officer from the Forest Department should immediately be seconded and added to
the cell being set up for the APSHP.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project                         5. Recommendations
5.3.2 Increased roadside tree planting
FJ i       There is no specific arboriculture policy with regard to road construction in Andhra Pradesh,
other than the general compliance with Gol policy for replacement of Forest Reserve removals.
It is clear, however, that greater attention is needed in order to improve present practices and to
promote R&B as a more environmentally sensitive agency. More diverse and dense planting to
protect the ROW is warranted for control of encroachment. Plantings also provide noise, dust and
visual barriers. This will include planting from the toe of embankment to the edge of the ROW,
- staggered and varied - to provide for traffic safety. Guidelines on suitable species and species
selection procedures are presented in Annex 8.
Use of local nurseries (Forest Department or Social Forestry) as a seedling source, and local
01;       people for maintenance (on a part share harvest basis), is considered as a way of improving
survival rates and improving biodiversity. The ROW represents a large productive area potential,
trees can have benefits in reducing sub-grade water levels and can be a useful revenue source to
the road operation. Maximum use of the area will be made.
fl        Regular budget provision for completing the replanting of existing ROW  areas and for
replacement treeplanting, should be made available as a regular R&B annual budget item.
Distinct budget provisions should be identified under each contract in order to complete ROW
jqj       planting along the full length of the road being constructed or reconstructed, as a valid and
necessary road construction cost. Funds generated from harvesting trees in the ROW will be
strictly controlled and used to offset any treeplanting costs.
5.3.3 Integration of road improvements within urban settlements
Roads are frequently planned in isolation of land use planning and conflicts can arise. This can
cause problems in operation as well as direct damage. The location of power poles, water mains,
commercial areas and access roads can all have major impacts on road performance. Examples
of situations where recent road surfacing is disturbed by other service providers are common.
Further attention is needed to integrate local government, other service providers and R&B work.
5         This will primarily involve consultation but can also include additional road provisions to cater
for other ROW users. Consideration in the project will specifically be given to:
|   *  Providing lateral Service Ducts in urban areas to take power, telephone, irrigation and
other connections in order to prevent unauthorised road openings and damage;
t   *  Provision of Parking areas - (where ROW exists) particularly for bus and truck traffic
I                which currently stop on the through lanes. Locations and areas need to respond to user
behaviour, provide all weather surfaces and their use encouraged by Police direction or
punitive measures; and
*     Long term shifts in commercial activity centres away from the state highways.

Andlira Pradeslh State Higlhway Project                       5. Recommeltdations
All such considerations will focus on integration in a cost effective, socially and environmentally
friendly manner which does not require resettlement or relocation. Urban areas are generally
excluded from the scope of works of this project as it is a rural roads project. Nonetheless the
primacy of the ROW being for through road traffic is a value that needs to be recognised and
communicated. This can be furthered by requiring consultation and submission of road plans to
local administrations as a matter of routine procedure. Separation of traffic and prevention of
encroachment must be themes pursued in design and future road management.
Effective road provision and the prevention of environmental damage is provided by orderly and
considered forward planning action. Divisions should be actively involved in setting priorities,
and implementing design and construction work under delegated powers.
5.3.4 Resunmptionz anid resettlenment
Effects of resumption on landowners and displacement of squatters from the road reserve as
construction proceeds are a real concern and appropriate mitigation and compensation is required.
This is addressed in the Social Impact report and RAP.
5.3.5 Noni-inotorised tranisport
A pilot study is recommended in order to determine the best way of separating, fast moving,
motorised through traffic from the slower, non-motorised forms of local transport in urban areas.
Schemes proven successful in the pilot study can then be applied more widely.
5.3.6 Specific Mitigation Measures
In addition to the general mitigation measures outlined in this section specific mitigation
measures are proposed on two roads.
On road 2(c) bridges are to be constructed to correspond in location and size to bridges on the
adjacent railway line as stated in section 3.2.4, so as not to impede animal movement corridors.
On road 2(g) to minimise the adverse affect of construction on the Sri Venkateshwara Sanctuary
and the adjacent Reserved Forest, construction of labour camps quarrying of stone and collection
of fuel in reserve and sanctuary are to be specifically prohibited in the contract documents.
In addition, the following measures are recommended to mitigate impacts on wildlife on road
2(g):
*     The speed limit through the area is to be 60km/hr. Speed breakers to be specified in the
construction documents to ensure that the speed limit is enforced.
The size of some of the existing culverts is to be increased to allow the passage of
animals. There are approximately 15 culverts across the road at present, most of which
are too small in cross section for use by animals. In consultation with the Wildlife Wing,
strategically placed culverts should be identified and new culverts designed with an
increased cross section to facilitate the passage of animals across the road.

Andlhra Pradeslh State High way Project                       5. Recommendations
r          .     Develop compensatory habitat. The widening of the road and the resulting increase in
traffic speed and noise will reduce the quality of habitat along the road and increase the
vulnerability of wildlife to road accidents. A method to mitigate such impacts would be
F                to compensate for the loss by improving habitat in adjoining areas to wean wildlife away
from the road. Areas suitable for improvement occur in the contiguous valleys such as
the Chamala valley.
With the improvement of water holes, fire protection, soil and water conservation
measures, removal of weeds such as lantana and development of meadows and edges, it
would be possible to improve the existing habitat and its carrying capacity in the Chamnala
valley or in some similar location. It is recommended that R&B allocate some funds,
rl               perhaps 1-2% of the cost of the road, for such habitat improvement measures.
It is suggested that R&B liaise with the Wildlife Wing to agree a compensatory habitat
r                development plan and the required funding. Funds could be placed at the disposal of the
Wildlife Wing for implementation of the plan.
rll       It is recommended that the specific mitigation measures outlined are made a mandatory
requirement for upgrading of the affected roads.
Iii        5.4 Costs of mitigation
In general, mitigation recommendations should not substantially increase the cost of the work.
Institutionally some changes in staffing will allow for the creation of the Environment Unit.
Changes in Contract Conditions will not, in themselves, add significant costs. Costs of
restoration, erosion control and other work related activities are marginal to BOQ unit rates and
no major additional costs are expected to apply. Costs for items such as service roads, parking
and ducts will, however, depend on the extent of additional provisions adopted in the detailed
design, primarily as enhancements. Typical unit costs are given below.
Service Roads allow      Rs 140/sq.m
Concrete kerbs           Rs 370/rn
Village stone drains     Rs 970/m
Land acquisition        2 lakhlha -   uncultivated
l                                    4 lakh/ha    - cultivated
Tree Cutting             Rs 1500 (300-600mm)
Rs 2500 (>600mm)
Unit cost of tree placed  Rs 20   (im seedling + some transport)
3                           :        Rs 200 ea (1 year maintenance)

A ndlira Pradlesh State Higlhway Project                      5. Recommendations
The key additional cost will be for enhanced treeplanting, if this is adopted to the extent
recommended. Based on an assumed, regular pattern of planting and maintenance for the
complete length of works this can be costed on a per unit road length basis, with a rate of
Rs.70,000/km being adopted. In comparison to road costs this represents approximately 1%.
Costs of land acquistion were generally included in the domestic consultant reports as well as
costs of tree removal, with some limited replanting and turfing. Generally no provision was made
for compensation nor enhancement work, with the domestic consultant reports not being
consistent. Revised cost estimates are being prepared as part of the design work.
Some additional costs for training and monitoring are expected for the project overall and these
are addressed in the following sections.

rj         6.1 Institutional recommendations
An Institutional Review team is currently assessing the R&B Department and a report is due from
them by mid-June 1996. They have split the phasing of the recommendations into four phases:
(1) Immediate Term (0-1 years);
(2) Short Term (0-5 years);
V g              (3) Medium Term (5-1 0 years); and
(4) Long Term (>10 years).
fl        An APSHP cell is recommended to be established immediately, under the direction of the
Director of the APSHP, for the management of the project. One responsibility of this cell will be
envirorrnental management. This can be achieved be having officers from the Forestry
Department, seconded to the cell.
I11J      The environmental section of the project cell will:
liaise with relevent NGO's Government Departmnents and other interested parties on
|                environmental and social issues raised by the project.
*     review the project designs to ensure their adequacy and suitability with respect to
environmental matters.
@   *  monitor the environmental aspects of the project, during the construction to ensure that
U                environmental requirements of the contract are satisfied, in particular tree removal and

*     assist in and monitor the additional studies to determine the need for bypasses and
|                construction to be undertaken in urban centres.
During the short tenn, the cell will be reassessed and major institutional strengthening initiatives
|         relating to improved management of the organisation will occur. This will be frrther reassessed
in the medium term.
In the long term it is recommended that an environmental unit be established in the proposed
Planning and Design Wing of R&B. In addition to those activities listed above, which would be
carried out on each project undertaken by R&B, the environment unit would:
*     conduct environmental and social impact analysis;

*     development government policy initiatives.
99         A draft structure and duty statements for the long term have been included at Annex 4. This unit
will act as the key referral and contact point for R&B on environment matters. It will provide the
interface between MOEF/SPCB and the department for compliance under legislation, it will need
rl        to translate and communicate government policy for R&B, and it will provide a point for
monitoring the environmental effects of R&B activities. It should develop the capacity to provide
good planning advice and be proactive in defending the department against criticism as
n 11       environmental issues evolve. It will need to establish good relations with a range of specialists
and the NGO conmmunity, and to establish procedures and recommendations for handling and
managing environmental issues.
To be effective this unit will require some training but in general it is administrative work and
n1~       functioning within the unit will develop skills needed.
6.2 Recommended Training and monitoring activity
Awareness of environmental issues in the road construction industry in AP is at a very early
stage. Whilst consciousness is increasing, there is limited appreciation of how issues might be
Ij;        handled and some training is warranted under the project. Training of staff will be needed at a
number of levels;
3          a. Environment unit. Specialised EIA and general issue training will be needed as the unit is
created. Academic institutions in India and EPTRI or the SPCB can provide opportunities and
contact in this regard needs to be developed. An expatriate adviser in the unit for 6-12 months
after it is fully staffed would provide a useful impetus for mobilising activity.
b. Construction supervisors.  A number of R&B and PCC staff will be involved in site
supervision and some awareness level training, undertaken by the PCC and environment unit staff
is warranted.

Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project            7. Environmental Monitoring Plan
F0         7. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
7.1 Baseline studies and key parameters
Road rehabilitation work is generally too geographically spread and too diffuse in impact to
nF!        warrant a strict, independent or systematic environmental management plan. Some oversight and
capacity to review impact is needed, however, in meeting legal responsibilities.
Responsibility for oversight can best be assigned to the construction supervisor, but supplemented
by some specialist consultant input, as required, and reported to the R&B Environment Unit.
Capacity to quantitatively monitor water sediment loads (by suitable portable test equipment) and
n ll       noise might be advantageous, but monitoring will primarily involve ensuring that actions taken
. are in accordance with contract and specification clauses, and planned mitigation. Some
awareness level training is generally needed to ensure this occurs effectively. Project
N11        management needs to be able to check Contractor practices in a visual assessment manner at a
minimum, and if pollutant levels are suspect and need to be measured then SPCB, or private
sector laboratories, could be asked to sample and measure.
In the case of those areas of the AP State Highway Project that are not included in the full EIA
jj       that has been recommended, it is not expected that major baseline surveys are required for
monitoring, other than for identification and quantification of trees to be removed. In this specific
case it may also be better if policy conditions for removal were agreed rather than absolute
quantification. This might involve agreement to remove all trees within 2.5m of planned
pavement edge; to remove those within 2.5-4 m if they are likely to be damaged (keeping larger
*          diameter); and beyond 4m to leave all trees intact.
Photographic records provide a useful environmental monitoring tool and will be kept as part of
normal contract monitoring.
The RAP provides the primary social impact monitoring tool but a road safety audit would also
be recommended in the case of road upgrading envisaged. It should be possible to arrange this
through discussions with and requests to local police stations, rather than as a separate activity.
3          The pilot safety study recommended will require monitoring to determine its effectiveness. Local
R&B workers and the environment unit should be in charge of regular monitoring, while the PCC
should monitor the pilot studies on a less frequent basis. Accident data from police records should
|          also be checked to determnine the success of the program.
|          7.2 Audit and Mitigation plans
A simple monitoring method is needed that focuses attention on environmental issues and
U          provides some feedback, and a draft Contract Review proforma is provided at Annex 6.
Mitigation and enhancement measures adopted in final design will be explicitly identified under

Dl         The detail of project specific EAs should be commensurate with the expected impact and would
normally cover;
i        (a) existing environmental "baseline" conditions
(b) potential environmental impacts, direct and indirect, including enhancement opportunities
(c) systematic comparison of alternatives
(d)   preventative, mitigative and compensatory measures, generally in the form of an action
plan
(e)   environmental management and training, and
(f)    monitoring
World Bank guidelines would norrnally place road rehabilitation in Cagtegory B, which may have
specific environmental inpacts and require more limited environmental analysis. New rural roads
normally require a full EA.
The Indian Roads Congress has also published Guidelines for EIA of Highway Projects in 1989,
fl        recommended only for major me highways, but this provides a usefult format and checklist.
3.    Application to Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
Until the priority locations are chosen and improvement details are considered the "significance"
of environmental impact cannot be absolutely known. It might generaly be presumed, however,
that rehabilitation and limited new work would not require a full EIA and environmental inpacts
might be resonably managed. This in no way negates requirements for consultation with affected
pupulations nor attention to sensitive or protected areas, such as in the Eastern Ghats.
A limited from of EA would thus seem appropriate, but one which allows the identification of
likely environmental impact of detailed options considered. This would particularly apply to
resumption and resettlement. new alignments, drainage provisions, borrow areas, resource use
and construction disturbance, and safety. An Environemtnal Management Plan which minimises
or negates adverse impact, and increase coordination, is needed.
Opportunities for environmental enhancement and institutional strengthening might be particular
issues to incoroporate and some form of environmental monitoring is desirable.
For the purpose of providied the Project Coordinating Consultants with adequate background
material to rview the environmental significance of recommendations made, and collate an EA
for World Bank clearance, the following type of information would be the minimum needed for
sections identified:
Demographic details of adjacent and affected popultaitons
Landuse, Vegetation and natural fauna detials along the alingment, including agricultural and
urban/residential pattersonl areas to be resumed; tree types, sizes and numbers
Accident statistics
Proposed borrow areas and vlumes to be extracted

ANNEX 4. R& B ENVIRONMENT UNIT
Proposal for Establishment of an Environment Unit
in Roads and Buildings Department, Public Works Department, Andra Pradesh
DISCUSSION PAPER
Background:
r         At the present time there is no focus for environmental issues in the departnent. In order to
meet donor and domestic policy/legislation R&B will be obliged to give gretaer attention to
how environmental concerns can be addressed. An Institutional review is currently being
nl        conducted on R&B and it is recornmending the inclusion of an environmental officer in a unit
focussing on the APSHP. This discussion paper describes the formation and structure of a full
environmental unit that should be aimed for in the longer turn.
The Environment Protection Act 1986 and Rules promulgated requires clearance of projects
with the Environment Department and places the onus on departmnents to ensure appropriate
N00       environmental protection and mitigation. This parallels the concerns of donors which have
insisted on effective integration of environmental considerations into planning and
construction. Road authorities throughout the world have seen it as valuable to establish
0ll       environmental units to coordinate activities and to give a focus to enviromnental concerns.
The proposed unit should report directly to the Principal Secretary of the R&B Department for
matters concerning environmental assessment and monitoring and to the Chief Engineer
(Planning) for design related matters. In addition the unit should liaise with the NGO
community concerned with the environment. Public relations capability should also be
3         pursued to highlight the work done by the unit.
Objective: To ensure that a concern for the environmental impact of RBD activities is
3         effectively integrated into departmental operations and R&B complies with all legal and
policy obligations related to environment protection and resource conservation. This
objective will be satisfied in the imnmediate term by the inclusion of an environmental officer
I         in the project cell, however the unit discussed here should be the aim for a more long term
solution.
|         Justification: The Environment Protection 4ct (1986) and Guidelines of 1989 requires all
new projects to be cleared with the Environment Department. The Planning Proposal system
requires consideration of the environment before funding approval is given.
R&B has no specific environment assessment capability and no focal point of responsibility
and coordination on environmental matters. Limited action is being taken on environment
matters. An Environment Unit as part of a Transport Planning Wing should be established
and developed as recommended in the strengthening strategy.
I         The Unit should report directly to the Chief Engineer (Transport Planning Wing), as with
most international road authorities who have responded to government and public concerns

n'         with the environment impact of road construction. These Units generally involve a small
coordinating organisation rather than attempting to maintain all needed technical skills in-
house. They work closely with the planning activities and can most effectively integrate into
decisions at this stage but also relate to all other activity..

SUMMARY QUESTIONNAIRE FOR
MOEF ENVIRONMENTAL APPRAISAL
T         Road Section: WARANGAL - KARIMNAGAR - RAIPUTNAM (110.8KM)
r          1. GENERAL
1.1 Name of Project: Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project
a) Objectives: To improve the capacity, life and performance and the state road system in
Andhra Pradesh.
b) Brief Description ofproposal
Pavement strengthening, repair and widening on existing road alignments, with isolated
realignment and bypasses where necessary. Design standard to be in accordance with Indian
Roads Congress recommendations for 1 OOkm/hr design speed: with 7m wide sealed pavement
and 2.5 m width shoulders (1.5m sealed).
c) Project Justification/IVeed
The existing system of state highways and major district roads has become badly deteriorated
resulting in delays and vehicle damage. Economic analysis has shown that user benefits
warrant construction as soon as possible. Existing roads are narrow, of poor surface and
shoulders are rarely capable of supporting traffic. The road will provide a link between
311        National Highway 7 in the north of the state and the eastern ports.
d) Present Status of the Project
The project is currently being submitted for Government of Andhra Pradesh and World Bank
funding. Detailed design work has commenced on priority sections (Stage I) and should be
completed by April 1996. Following donor approval it is expected that the construction work
will be tendered for a start in late 1996.
e) Operational Plan (time schedule)
Construction is expected to start in late 1996 with completion over a three to four year period.
1.2   Location of the Project:
a) Place: State Highways 1 and 7 between Aarangal and Lakshettipet. Generally between
3          latitude 78-37-30 and 81-42-57 degrees north, and longitude 19-21-18 and 16-30-05 degrees
West. Excludes section through Karimnagar.
b) District: Karimnagar, Warangal
c) State: Andhra Pradesh
3          1.3 Approximate area/population to be served
The combined district population is nearly 6 million but the road will service other districts
I |        and states.
1.4 Overall project cost
Estimated cost is of the order of Rs.13,44 lac in 1995 values.

1.5 Carriageway details: 7 m pavement with 2.5m shoulders
1.6 Traffic Details: AADT, mix
1.7 size and magnitude
a) Length: 110.8 km
b) Width of formation: 1 3mplus berms.
c) Total land required: Preliminary estimates suggest 16 ha acquisition is required for
realignment of sections between Karirnagar and Raiputnam. This will be of agricultural land
immediately adjacent to the existing road reserve.
1.8 Alternative alignments examined
The overall road alignment follows that existing and is largely within the current Right-of-
Way vested in the Roads and Buildings Department.
2. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING/PROJECT LOCATION
2.1 Environmental characteristics for 10km both side (1:50,000 base map)
NR         Adjacent landuse is primarily agricultural (irrigated rice and dryland) with isolated village
settlements. Topography is largely gentle plain, rising slowly to the west and follows the
Godavari river system, crossing a number of tributaries. The road follows red sandy soils and
erosion is not prominant.
2.2 Details of forest Land
No Forest Reserves exist along the road section and roadside plantings are irregular, primarily
of Neem, Pipal and Nimli.
2.3 Displacement, material sourcing, rehabilitation plans
No displacement is expected on the project section. Earthworks will be sourced from borrow
pits outside the Right-of-Way and full restoration required under the Contract Specification.
Rock will be sourced from existing quarries along the alignment and no new areas should
need to be developed.
2.4 Proposed compensation for forest land
No Forest Reserve will be required and no compensation is needed, but an expanded
U          treeplanting program along the full Right-of-Way is being proposed in order to provide a
buffer and biodiversity store. Species selected and placement will be consideration of local
3          ecology and traffic safety.
2.5 Stripping & site clearing (size, location, soil type, volumes, dump sites etc)
3          The project will primarily involve widening of existing road formations and excavation of
1 3        shoulders and pavement will be the only direct clearance required. It is expected that spoil
will be disposed of within the ROW and use to flatten embankment batters. Some trees will
need to be removed in order to construct pavement and prevent damage but will be replaced
by new seedlings.

Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project                                   Annexure - 5
2.6 Details of bridges/cuttings etc (size, location, soil type, volume etc)
Existing drainage structures will be widened and poor structures replaced but no new cross
r          drainage structures should be needed.
2.7 Details of embankments (size, location, soil type, volumes etc)
The road section is primarily on low embankment up to Im and this will be maintained with
[        some improvement to vertical alignment to meet a 1 00km design standard. Pavement
drainage will be imnproved by adopting constant shoulder crossfalls and betters will be turfed
or drains installed to prevent batter erosion.
2.8 Data on history of land stability, floods etc
Limited records are available but flooding of this section is relatively infrequent. At locations
immediately south of Karimnagar the road levels is such that irrigation water causes
immersion but this will be overcome by a general raising of the formation.
2.9 Measures to prevent risks
Construction sequencing and provision for traffic will be used to limit disruption and safety
risks. Silt traps and semi-permeable membranes will be specified in order to control siltation
and turbidity of watercourses. Occupational health and safety regulations will be enforced and
emission standards monitored to ensure these are within MOEF standards. Hours of work
n          will be limited in residential areas and noise and dust levels controlled. Waste disposal
methods will ensure that pollution does not occur and recycling will be encouraged.
3          2.10 Likely modifications to hydrology
No significant changes in hydrology are expected. Water will be required for compaction of
pavements and the construction labour force and will be sourced locally. Volumes needs are
I         not expected to affect water balances but some shortages could arise during the dry season. At
these times sourcing will take into account local agricultural needs and discussions will be
held with local farmers.
2.11 Hazards to workers and residents
Attention to provision for traffic and best practice will minimise risks to workers, users and
resident alike. Site safety will be given a high profile and the Contractor obliged to meet
relevant regulations and to provide needed safety equipment. Longer term safety risks arising
|          from increased traffic speeds will need to be addressed in providing for traffic separation and
road education. Local authorities will be asked to consider changes in planning practice to
prevent encroachemtn and protect the through traffic role of the state highway system.
2.12 Air quality impact/Noise impact
- s        Some temporary increase in dust and noise must be expected during the construction period
z         but disturbance from traffic will decrease in the longer term as surface standards are
improved. Construction impact will be limited by watering and limitation of operations to
within favourable periods. Vibration generated by construction traffic could cause some
I |       disturbance but should not result in structural damage of the generally light structures in close
proximity to the pavement. Plant and equipment used will be required to meet, and

maintained to conform with, Government of India emission standards.
2.13 Hazards to aquatic ecology
No major pollution sources are involved and siltation or turbidity arising from earthworks will
be controlled by silt traps and membrane retainers. No major sanctuary is found on the project
road.
2.14 Likely health hazards
Construction camps will be provided with necessary hygiene and waste disposal to avoid
health probelms. The Contractor will be asked to provide necessary health services, where
these are not locally available, and emergency first-aid. Encouragement will be given to
employment of local people to avoid any major influx of foreign workers and appropriate
recreation facilities. Worker education on health risks will be arranged.
2.15 Groundwater pollution risk
Limited excavation is involved so risks to groundwater supplies are minor. Attention will be
given to the disposal of excess oil and bitumen to avoid any possibility of contamination.
l g        Other materials used are relatively inert and landfill areas will be sited to lessen leaching and
pollution risks.
[II        2.16 Fuel supply arrangements
It is expected that commercial fuel supplies will be available and minimal site stirage will be
involved. Mobile tankers will be used for distribution of fuel and use of drums minimised to
lessen disposal, contamination and discharge problems.

ENVIRONMENT MONITORING CHECKLIST
COMMENTARY ON FIELD QUESTIONNAIRE
Environment monitoring forms part of the continuing environment assessment of projects. It
should normally flow from the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) done as part of the project
preparation and be based on the key or critical issues identified (scoping) and in comparison to
baseline data within the area of impact (bounding). It can be part of the actual construction phase
or be done post construction. There can be significant differences in short, medium or long term
impact.
fl          In most cases a monitoring program consists of the identification and selection of key
environmental indicators or parameters which may be quantitatively measured and compared over
time. These can be physical, chemical or social indicators.
In many cases, however, insufficient or too general an assesment is done to provide a specific plan,
or it may not, indeed, be warranted considering the general nature and relative insignificance of
the impact. For these cases a more general monitoring tool is useful and there is advantage in
adopting a uniform monitoring proforma. It is frequently based on recording project details
combined with recording of expected project actions or outcomes.
For these reasons the following Checklist/Questionnaire has been developed. It is purposely kept
fl          simple and generalised, so it can be used for a number of projects. It should, however, be
reviewed and improved in the light of experience.
n           Objectives of Monitoring and Evaluation
1. To demonstrate that negative effects have been addressed and adverse consequences minimized
2. To monitor and promote any positive impacts so as to enhance environmental quality
3. To provide a record of conditions, actions and project impact, with a view towards adoption
of better mitigation methods and defence against any legal or community obligations, and
4. To investigate the adequacy of any Initial Environmental Examination or Environment Impact
Assessment, and to suggest improvements.
Monitoring Methodology
The technique is principally one of subjective rapid appraisal based on visual observation with
quantification of some key parameters. This requires some understanding of environmental
impact, at least to an awareness level, but also contributes to the development of understanding.
A limited number of key impact areas have been adopted with a conscious attempt to limit the size
of the questionnaire and encourage its completion by site supervisors. Sources of information are

r          largely visual observation or basic project details and it allows the collection of baseline data. The
collation of this information, and its recording, fed into an Environment Unit provides the basic
data on which further selective analysis and investigation might be undertaken. Strict specification
of sampling numbers and numerous tests should be avoided. Further tests can be arranged by the
Environment Unit should concerns be raised by general monitoring reports. This avoids the cost
of unnecessary tests, the results of which are often seen as an end in themselves, and simplifies the
process. This approach of selective investigation and questioning should provide a practical and
achievable development of environmental awareness. There are already numerous returns and
reports required from construction activity and protection of the environment should not be seen
as an unnecessary additional burden on limited time resources. It should, however, become a
regular procedure and part of routine contract management.

Iif   INTRODUCTION
This terms of reference (TOR) document is for a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) on
two areas of critical natural habitat that may be affected by roads being proposed for upgrading
as part of the Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project. The EIA is required to ensure that the
development options currently being considered as part of Phase II of the APSHP are
environmentally sound and sustainable. The EIA will ensure that any envirornental
consequences of the project are taken into account in the design stage and appropriate mitigation
l l       measures are used. The critical areas that the roads pass through are Nagarjuna Sagar - Srisailam
Sanctuary and Kawal Sanctuary. The locations of the roads and the critical natural habitats are
presented in Figure 1.1.
The completion of the EIA will involve extensive consultation with the local community and
relevant Government and non-government organisations.
The ETA will be prepared following World Bank guidelines. The report will be finalised by July
5, 1996. The final report will be submitted, by the Chief Engineer of the Roads and Buildings
section of the Andhra Pradesh State Government, to the World Bank at least six weeks prior to
the appraisal of the project. A draft of the EIA will be submitted to the SMEC environmental
ii        scientist by 25 June 1996.
This document has primarily been based on the Environmental Analysis of the Andhra Pradesh
I1        State Highways Project, comments from the World Bank regarding that report, extensive site
inspections by SMEC personnel and consultation with relevant Government agencies and non-
3         government organisations (see Appendix A).
|         2   BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The condition of State roads in Andhra Pradesh is poor due to limited carriageway width and
3         maintenance, and is expected to deteriorate further as traffic volumes and loads increase. Road
travel times in Andhra Pradesh are unduly long and average speeds down to 30 km/h are now
common on roads designed for 80 to 100 Lrn/h. The pavement surface condition of these roads
I         is generally poor due to a lack of maintenance, poor design and construction and vehicle
overloading. This, combined with congestion and encroachment, has led to the reduction of
vehicle travel speeds. Vegetation growth on the road shoulders and the erosion of verges has
further reduced road serviceability.
Rail and other modes of transport do not offer a viable substitute network so that vehicle
I         ownership and use of road freight transport have been increasing rapidly with India's
development. Without immediate and extensive corrective work the State road system will be
unable to complement the national highway system and subsequently, economic development
will be constrained.

Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project                                   Annexure - 7
In early 1994 the Roads and Buildings (R&B) Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh
commissioned a group of local consultants to identify sections of state highways and major
r          district roads where reduced carriageway width and/or pavement deterioration constrained traffic
capacity. As a result of these initial surveys a team comprising of SMEC and CES identified some
1400 km of roads, which were recommended for upgrade using World Bank funding. Three roads
r          comprising of 400 km of the total length are included as Phase I and the remaining 1000 km
makes up Phase II.
The stated objective of the Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project is;
To reduce the total cost of road transport in Andhra Pradesh by improving road
lR Iconditions and capacity, along with R&B's in-house capabilities to design, manage and
operate the road network.
The project is a rehabilitation and maintenance project, based on existing road alignments with
relatively minor realignment. As such, the risk of significant environrnental degradation across
the whole project is considered low, however the two critical natural habitats mentioned
previously have the potential to be significantly affected by the proposed highway project. The
overall project will therefore be classified as Category A, following World Bank Operational
ijj       Directive 4.01.
The new road will be designed with a standard 7 metre wide pavement and 2.5 metre wide
shoulders (1.5 metres of which are sealed) in order to facilitate a design speed of 80 to 100 km/h
(Annex 9). The widening, where necessary, will occur only on one side of the right of way to
avoid loss of critical habitat, disruption and loss of roadside planting. Following the road
I          improvement works the road batter and right of way will be revegetated using species found
locally within each area. This is to abide by the Green Belt plan of Andhra Pradesh and as
compensation for trees removed during the upgrade works.
Since the proposed work is largely restricted to the existing horizontal alignment there were few
locational alternatives available. These included isolated straightening of sections within the riglht
of way and bypassing larger towns.
5          A draft environmental assessment has been prepared for the project entitled Environmental
Analysis for Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project. Following comments on that assessment
by the World Bank three areas of critical natural habitat were identified as requiring additional
I          study by way of a full EIA and this terns of reference is designed to accomplish that. This terms
of reference will be added as an annex to the Environmental Analysis of the Andhra Pradesh State
X          Highways Project.
The design of the first 400 km in Phase I is nearing completion. The World Bank appraisal of the
APSHP will occur in September, 1996.

3     OBJECTIVES
|          The primary objective of the EIA is to determine the effects of widening existing roads through
the three areas of critical natural habitat, Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuary and Kawal
r          Sanctuary.
Nagarjuna Sagar - Srisailam and Kawal are tiger sanctuaries. The tiger (Panthera tigris) is listed
on the IUCN's Red List as an endangered species and its survival is of great national and
international importance. The EIA must assess the impacts of the road upgrade not just on the
tiger, but on all species that make up the biodiversity of these two ecosystems in which the tiger
rl         lives.
The EIA must determine the potential impacts of the proposed road improvement on both areas.
The World Bank Aide Memoire (March 16 - April 1, 1996)stated that the EIA must address,
among other issues, the following:
-     the direct and indirect impacts on wildlife;
*     the effect of increased human presence on wildlife;
|||         .     the impact of the roads on animal movements; and
*     the impact of noise and increased traffic
I |         within the two areas through the construction phase and beyond. Methods to mitigate these effects
will also be presented.
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4   ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS
I           The EIA  will be prepared following the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01:
"Environmental Assessment".
A key document under the Environmental (Protection) Act (No. 29 of 1986) is the handbook of
Environmental Procedures and Guidelines (1994) which outlines the requirements for
I           environmental clearance of new development proposals. This states that highway development
projects require environmental clearance from the Central Government. The Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MOEF) produced a specific Environmental Guidelines for
Rail/Road/hlighway Projects in 1989, which is generally used as a guideline for the preparation
of environrnental assessments. In this case, however, the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01
will be used.

5   STUDY AREA
This environmental assessment must determine the consequences of the improvement of two
separate roads on areas of critical natural habitat that are situated alongside them. These roads are
r          in Phase II of the project.
Road 2(a) from Lakshettipet to Gudihatnur is located in the far north of Andhra Pradesh and is
included in the full EIA because it passes through the Kawal Sanctuary, an area of rich
biodiversity and home to the Gond tribe. It is important as it forms a link to National Highway
7 from the coastal ports with a bypass of Hyderabad, thereby greatly reducing travel times and
costs. This road and its critical natural habitat is illustrated in Figure 5.1.
Road 2(b) links the major district centres of Guntur and Kumool by traversing the centre of the
state and is one of the most direct routes across it. This route provides a link with National
Highway 7 that runs between Bangalore and Hyderabad, and National Highway 5, which runs
along the coast. Critical natural habitat is found between the towns of Domala and Kurnool as the
Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuary to the north of the road and the Gundla Brahmeswaram
Sanctuary to the south of the road, and the region is home to the Chenchu tribe. This road and the
|          critical natural habitat is illustrated in Figure 5.2.

r          6   SCOPE OF WORK
The EIA will determine the potential of the three roads to "undermine effective biological
conservation" in each area (World Bank Aide Memoire, March 16 - April 1, 1996). The
environmental impact assessment will make specific recommendations on whether any
adjustments or realignments are necessary during design or if mitigation measures recommended
r          will alleviate any harmful impacts on the environment of these areas. The tasks below indicate
major sections of the EIA report and highlight many of the important items to be covered. This
list is not all inclusive and other items of relevance not covered here will be discussed in the full
report. Where possible maps and figures will be used to locate areas and highlight salient points.
6.1   Description of the Proposed Project
This section will involve a brief description of the relevant aspects of the Andhra Pradesh State
Highways Project. This information has already been compiled in the Environmental Analysis
of the Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project report. A summary of the relevant information
presented in that report will be sufficient for this EIA.
6.2   Description of the Existing Environment
5          This section will present of the baseline data on the relevant environmental characteristics of each
study site. This section and those following may best be separated into two, Road 2(a) and 2(b)
to allow easier comprehension for both the reader and preparer.
6.2.1 Physical environment
|          This section will be brief but wvill include a general history of each conservation area, its history
and a general description of it.
1          6.2.2  Biological environmenit
This section shall consist of a far more in-depth review. It will assess the baseline flora and fauna
within each critical natural habitat.
I          Vegetation within each conservation area wvill be identified and mapped, with emphasis placed
on rare and endangered flora species and communities and potential habitat for endangered fauna.
Rare and endangered plants are known to exist within some study areas and an assessment will
f          be made of their conservation value relative to their occurrence in Andhra Pradesh, India and
worldwide.
I |        A 'large carnivore' census will be undertaken by the Wildlife Section of the Forest Department
of Andhra Pradesh from 10 May 1996 and is expected to be completed by mid-June. Other
species seen during the census will also be counted. This will alleviate the need for extensive
I          field work in order to describe and map native wildlife in the conservation areas with particular
emphasis on endangered species and their habitat. Consultation with local Forestry Officers in
charge of wildlife will also occur.

r          6.2.3  Socio-economic environment
A determination of what tribes are located within each area of critical natural habitat and a
discussion of what these tribes are doing to their environment will occur through discussions with
the tribes and relevant Forestry Officers. Furthermore an analysis of the current level of tourism
at each site will be made.
The methodology to obtain the required information will include a search of the available
r          literature, consultation with relevant people and organisations and a field survey if required.
6.3   Legislative and Regulatory Considerations
India is a signatory to all major international conventions and protocols regarding the
fl         environment and was a major participant at UNCED '92.
The key national legislation pertaining to this EIA is the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 and the
n          Wildlife Act of 1972. The Wildlife Act (1972) lists those species that are endangered, bans the
killing of wildlife and describes the areas to be set aside for wildlife conservation. These areas
are ultimately governed by the Ministry of the Environment and Forests (MOEF), however, the
Wildlife Section of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department make most site specific decisions.
The Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) has overall responsibility for
administration and implementation of government policy in respect to wildlife conservation,
ecologically sustainable development and pollution control. The government's concern for the
environment has been promulgated through the National Conservation Strategy and National
Forest Policy among others.
There are a number of regulations and guidelines prepared by the World Bank and MOEF that
are applicable to this EIA including the following:
I          *     Operational Policy 4.04: "Natural Habitats" including Annex A;
Operational Directive 4.02: "Wildlands"; and
Environmental Guidelines for Rail/Road/Highway Projects.
All of the above will considered during this study. A search for other legislative and regulatory
considerations that may be relevant will be made and included in the survey.
6.4   Determination of Potential Impacts of the Proposed Project
I          This section will consist of an assessment of all the potential impacts of the proposed road
widening both during and after construction. These impacts may be direct or indirect, positive or
negative, immediate or long-term, and avoidable or unavoidable. Those impacts that will be
I          similar throughout the whole of the project such as soil erosion, revegetation and pollution have
been covered in the Environmental Analysis of the Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project. A
number of issues were identified during the preparation of that report that are potential impacts
- ~ ~  ~  ,ar                                                                       



rf          Andhra Pradesh State Highways Project                                    Annexure - 7
associated with the project in the two critical areas. Further issues of importance are likely to arise
as the EIA progresses and will be addressed accordingly.
r           6.4.1  Habitat loss
The proposed road widening will only be in the order of a few metres and the surrounding area
rwill be revegetated following the road construction. The impact of each upgraded road during its
construction and when the road is fully operational, with regard to habitat loss, will be assessed.
rl          6.4.2  Animal movements
An upgraded road through these areas may directly inhibit the movements of certain migratory
or wide ranging species. Migratory and wide ranging species will be discussed in the assessment
of baseline conditions and in this section the consultant will determine whether these species will
be significantly affected by the upgraded road. Particular problems in this regard may occur in
IaU         Kawal Sanctuary as Road 2(a) crosses directly through the heart of the sanctuary and in
Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam Sanctuary as it is closely associated with the Gundla Brahmeswaram
Sanctuary on the-southem side of Road 2(b). The proximity of endangered species to other
populations will also be assessed to determine the effect of the road on their reproduction.
6.4.3  Increased traffic
Enhanced traffic, both during construction and after, may directly lead to an increase in wildlife
I          road kills. Many species of wildlife become startled when caught in bright lights and freeze. Such
species may be particularly susceptible to road kills and an assessment of this issue will be made.
1           6.4.4  Increased human presence
Human presence may increase either directly during the construction of the road and indirectly
through enhanced traffic and this may well impact on the environment. Poaching and bush fires
are both likely impacts from an increased human presence and these will be assessed in the EIA.
A Social Report is currently being prepared by the consultant Sociologist of the Andhra Pradesh
State Highways Project and will be available by 15 June 1996. From it and consultation with
|           local tribes and Forestry Officers an assessment of the impact of the scheduled tribes on the
critical natural habitats will be made.
6 4.5  Noise
The upgraded road will indirectly lead to an increase in noise as a result of increased traffic and
I           the EIA will assess the impact of increased noise on the wildlife of the study areas. It is likely that
the majority of noise impacts will occur during the construction phase.

6.4.6  Positive impacts
This project has the potential to provide significant positive impacts on each of the areas of
critical natural habitat, the wildlife found within them and the people located in or nearby them.
The upgraded road will provide a reduction in travel times to each site and increase accessibility
to the sites. This can lead to socio-economic benefits including providing the infrastructure
necessary for making these critical natural habitats into ecologically sensitive tourist
developments. The potential of each site for tourism will be assessed in the report. The
revegetation of many of the sites may result in an increased buffer zone beside each road which
may result in an increase of core habitat.
6.5   Analysis of Alternatives to the Proposed Project
There are currently no alternative proposals to the project. If it is considered that the mitigation
measures will not be sufficient to alleviate any significant adverse impacts of the project,
alternative alignments (horizontal and vertical) as well as the "do nothing" option should be
considered.
6.6   Development of Management Plan to Mitigate Negative Impacts
|l         This section will assess feasible and cost-effective measures that will prevent or reduce any
significant negative impacts and where possible exploit the potential for positive impacts. The
priority of the mitigation measures will be shown in order to assess their relative importance. The
I          consultant will estimate the impacts and costs of those measures and prepare a management plan
to implement them. The management plan will include proposed work programs, costs of each
mitigation measure, schedules of implementation and staffing and training requirements. Such
details will ensure that the proposed environmental actions are in phase with engineering and
other activities throughout the project's implementation.
I          6.7   Identification of Institutional Needs to Implement Environmental Assessment
Recommendations
A review of institutional requirements is currently being prepared and subsequently this will not
be covered in the full environmental assessment.
6.8   Development of a Monitoring Plan
A detailed plan to monitor the implementation of mitigating measures and the impacts of the

8   CONSULTING TEAM
It is essential that the consulting team have the services of a qualified Zoologist. This person
should have extensive knowledge of Indian wildlife and ecosystems, and experience working
with them. In India it is common for wildlife managers to work for the Forestry Department and
by doing so they wvill have gained sufficient knowledge of forestry matters to be able to conduct
this EIA. A person experienced in Botany will also be required. The consultant team should also
-            have the services of people experienced in the fields of entomology, herpetology, ornithology and
mammalogy.

ANNEX 8  CONTRACT RELATED RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1    Revegetation
Table 8.1 below, presents the planting regimes for the first Phase of the APSHP. The quantity and
species composition of each mix is presented in following tables. These regimes are based on
rainfall patterns, soil types and knowledge that similar species are found in each specific area. The
information in this table and in the rest of this Annexure will be added into the Contract
Specifications. A similar planting regime analysis will be carried out for species selection on
roads in Phase II of the Project and will be incorporated into those Contract Specifications.

Species have been selected to complement the endemic vegetation of each area. The variety of
species used means that those species that are not suited to the local conditions and micro-climate
will be accounted for by those that are. Only the 'fittest' species will survive in each locality
thereby maintaining the genetic variation that is essential for biodiversity.
Figure 8.1 shows a typical cross-section for the planting regime with the larger avenue trees
located no closer than 8 metres from the centre line of the road and the seeded species growing
in between. The native seed mix will be applied following the application of water to the recently
turned and topsoiled natural surface. Seeding will not occur in unfavourable weather such as
winds exceeding 15 km/hr or during rain periods. Fast growing ground covering species
mentioned in the grass table will be seeded immediately after the area has been landscaped to
reduce erosion, with the seeding and avenue planting occurring closer to the rainy season.

TYPICAL X-SECTION AT PLANTNG REGION
Figure 8.2 illustrates a longitudinal section of road with the associated planting regime. Avenue
seedlings will be placed at 25 metre intervals with the listed species being placed in turn.
Approximately 2000 seedlings per hectare are intended to be planted. The native trees will be
seeded indiscriminately within the ROW and at bends etcetera where larger areas of right of way
occur, the seeding will fill these areas to create small groves of native bushland. Where ROW
is available, an additional row of seedlings will be placed. This will be to ensure a thick row of
vegetation along the road. This will act as a wind block and will in turn act to increase crop
production through the reduction of evapo-transpiration.

Ii          Turseries may be situated within the road easement. The seedlings will be placed in holes (1 cu.
netre), the base of which will be filled with 0.2 metres of topsoil and organic fertiliser (e.g.
nanure). An area around the base of the seedling will be dug out in the most recent method of
Il          eedling protection used in India (Figure 8.3). This method provides a 'moat' like barrier around

Three months after the seedlings are planted, those not surviving will be replaced with others still
growing at a nearby nursery and of a similar age. About 10% of the total seedlings used should
be stored for this replacement. Areas where the seeding has not been sufficient will also be
reseeded following the application of an organic fertiliser. A similar process will occur one year
after the initial planting. During the first year after planting, watering will occur every month
except in the wet season. In the summer season this will occur more regularly. From 1 February
to 15 April watering will occur every three weeks and from then until 15 June every ten days.
Watering will be done as early in the morning and as later in the evening as possible, to increase
the amount of water reaching the roots by reducing that lost to evaporation.
The Contractor will be paid half his fee following the initial planting and the rest one year later.
All revegetation will occur within 14 days of earthwork completion. Topsoil shall be stockpiled
on site in low mounds of no greater than 3 metres height and where it is to be stored for in excess
of 14 days it shall be seeded with the above mentioned grasses immediately. Where imported
topsoil is required it will be friable and porous, and free of weeds, toxic material, lumps, stumps
or roots.
Fertiliser where required will be organic in nature such as cow manure.
On steeper slopes a binding agent will be used to reduce erosion and keep seeds in place at the
onset of the rains. Bitumen emulsion has been used before in India and this will be used here.
Straw will be mixed with the bitumen emulsion to further aid the binding process.
Other measures to mitigate against environmental impacts that are standard in contract
specifications will naturally be included. These include soil erosion measures and quarry sites.

WIDENING OF THE MAD*APNLI _ CHANDRR1 RoAD ON THE
SRI -VENKATESWARA NATICAl& PA    A  SAUAY    W
As part of the World Bank aidied A. P. State HighWays
Project (APIHp) a proposal to Widen theTirupathi - aCandragiri _
Madanapalli road is under consideratial. This road passes
alcong the boundary of the SgNpS. The Snow Mountain Engineering
nf            Corporation (SMEX) in charge of the A.P.S.H.P, approadced
WWF - A.P. State Office with a request to visit the forests
ill           and Sanctuary area near the road and advise them on the following
points.
(1)   Ccnfirm Whether the road forns the Park boundary
I                     and does not pass inside the park i.e., locate park
I                     boundary with respect to road.
(2)   Gather inf ormation fron local officials al animals
sighted in the area and animal movements With regard to
*                     the road.
(3)   Any other information on flora and fauna of the area.
(4)   Based on the above information and a visit to the
site make a recaommedatiao on Whether any additional
work is required to determine the extent of eavironmental
impact of widening the road.

fl1              ( 5)  If no additional study is required make recommenda-
tions on mitigation measures that should be undertalen
during construction and design to minimize the effects
of the Work.
fl                  I visited the study area from 15th to 17th August, 1996
the details of the progranme are
15th Au:ss Met local off icials and in the Company of local
officials travelled on the proposed road upto Bakra-et: Perambulated
forest areas around the road, Chanmala and Bhimavaram Valleys.
16th Aguclts Travelled on the rbad upto 30th Kilameter stone
and assessed mitigation measures.
7 th Ast   Discussions with local officials and collected
information, map etc. from office of wildlife Warden.
The 15th of August, being Independence day I could meet
a number of Officials (Aanexure A) Who are famili&r with the
area and discuss the issue.  After discussions, accompanied by
Sri Venkateswarlu, Wildlife Warden, SVNPS, and A.V. Narasimhulu,
Wildlife Warden, Artipoaching Sqaad (who have kindly consented to
join me in the inspection inspite Df it being a National HolidayY
I travelled along the Tirupathi - Chandragiri- Madanapalii road
upto Bakrapet. We visited two check-dams by the road_.sde and

and tracks and trails oa the area.
LOC.-ION OF ROAD V&..4.VIS SANCTUARY
The *Tirupathi - Madanapalli road toA::hes the
ni              sanctuary boundary after the 36th Kilometer stone. Till
this point the sanctuary boundary as well as the R,F.
boundary are 1/2 Kilometer to one kilcmeter away from the
|               road; the intervening area is largely private lands under
cultivation. The proposed road widening does not impact
|               even rem:otely on ghe Sanctuary in the stretch of road upto
the 36 th Kilo neter staie.
From. 36th Kiloaeter stone to 27 th KMs, the road
passes thrcoag a ghat section with jieserved forest cn either
side ( P1. see Map enclosed) . The stretch of this road fran
36.5 Kms. to 31 Kms. skirts the southern boundary of t he
| PS;While the road cuts across the Nagapat%a Reserved
F,rest the sanctuary notification limits the sanctuary to
I               the R*F* area to the north of the 4oad.
As per description of the sanctuary boundary issued
in Chittor District Gazette extraordinary published al 30th
December, 1985 the relevant extract is as followss

'HIence the sanctuary boundary runs generally
fi                    western direction .......... upto a point where it meets
the tar road leading fran Tirupathi to Bakkarapet.
Then it meets the Common boundary line f  Nagapatia
R.?. and Bakkarapet Re.
The Sanctuary boundary is demarcated partly by caisl
along a stream running in a val-ley along the northern edge
nII              of the road,

The hills and valleys on either side of the road in the
I                GGhat Section carry some good habitat for wildlife, especially
g                With a stream running along the valley al the southern
boundary of the sanctuary abutting the road'limiting thk
|                sanctuary upto the road boundary appears to have  been done
solely to avoid conflict with macement cf vehicles and public
on the highWay and not because of lack if good habitat for
I                wildlife to the south of the road. This is born out by the
reported movement Of wildlife such as Panther, Sambhar and
5                other deer across the road into the Bhimavaram valley to the
South. These hills and valleys form a good habitat for
I                Sambhar. The biggest of the deer,  Vcording'  to- local
i                officials Sambhar grow to good size in these areas, The cool

vaileys provide good a habttat for Spotted deer.  During
my brief visit   I saw two small herds of spotted deer
in the Ciamala Valley which is a continguous area to the
road. I also cane across actas of sloth bear under
Neredu trees. The beal are.rttracted by Neredu trait.
Panther wilddog, wolf are the major car*ivores. Tiger was
reported in the sevprnties but has not been reported since
then though the habitat is suitable for tiger. Elephants
have visited the Chamala Valley sometime back,
3II                     This sanctuary is also endemic to a number of flora
I                  Chief among then being red sanders; the other endemic
spec ies found are shorea talura, Shorea & tuagi   Cycas
jl                >beddomi, Terxainalia Pallida.
A list of flora and fauna found in the Sanctuary as
well as in and around the road are given in Amexure - 2.

our visit (15th Augast) Shri Adiseshayya, Deputy Range
Officer, Nagapatta saw two panthers oc the ghat road at
7.00 X4. Enquiries with the Officers and staff show that
V                  animals like $ambhar d spotted deer move across the road
particularly in summer *rhaps in search of food and waterj
n                  the presence of villages With agricultural fields and
better availability of water should be a great attractica
in summer. Frequency and locati o where animals cro s

kgSIEIE Imi'ACT OF RoA) WIDENING ON THE SaICTUARYt
The road forms the Southern bc,undary of the
3                  Sanctuary for a distance of approx. six kilometers, for a
distance of approx. three kilometers road runs along a
valley on the Sanctuary side,  Any widening of the road in
this stretch can be done only mn the hill-side to the Soath
of the road and there will be no loss of vegetation or
3                  wildlife habitat on the Sanctuary side, for the balance
3 kiloneters the sanctuary boundary is on the hill-side
5                  and Widening the road Will resfakt in some cutting on the
sanctuary boundary perhaps to a maximum width of 1l to 15'
however this cutting an the uphill side which is not

prime wildlife hbitat, will have minimal adverse effect
on the sanctuary. However during construction activity the
m;vement of lorries and labour and the inevitable fuelwood
collection by the labour will lead to some degradatica of the
babitat for wildlife-'ieasures to be undertaken to mitigate the
adverse impact on the sanctuary should cover the following
as pect.
(a)  Use oil-drive4 road-roller to avoid collecticn of
fuelwool from adjoining forest.
(b)  Prohibit quarrying of stone and earth in the ghat
section of the road.
tc)  No labour camps in the vicinity of the forests.
(d)  Prohibit collection of deadwood by labour fron the
3                        f or ests.
(e) Establish speed..breakers to reduce speed of vehicles
I                        (sane are in place at present),
1                  (.0  Improve culvert design:  At present there are over
/for          15 culverts across the road/flow of rain-water; almost
|                        all of them have snall vents of noemore than one to
2 square meters in size; thesi culverts are designed
based on the quantity of water that flows through

t I
of the culverts providing for much bigger vents at
rl                   places Where animals cross the road (in consultation with
wildlife wing) will prom6te use of the vents by wildlife
to cross the road,. this will greatly redux-e encounters
and accidents on the road prcaiding safety both for man and
animals.
fDi              (c      e tary-habitat devst   mej  Distanbance to the
peace and tranquility of the habitat during construction
work in widening the road would be unav oidable;
subsequently the increased ttaffic on the road blcwing
of horns by speeling vehicles, Would reduce the quality of
I1                   habitat along the road besides increasing vulnerability of
wildlife to road accidents; these are inexorable
consequences of road improvenent under any situaticn and
3                    5~sfme would  be the case here.
5                          A meth;od to mitigate the impact of sach adverse
factors Would be to compensate for such loss    of
J                    habitat quality by improving  habitat in adjoining areas
to wean the wildlife away from the road.  Areas for
such judicious manpulation of habitat are available in
5                    contiguous valleys like the Chamala Volley in Chamala
R,F. which forms a part of the Watershed for Kalyani

and water ccnservaticn measures, removal of weeds like
lantana and development of meadow and edges ) it is
possible to improve the existing habitat and itAcarrying
capacity in Chanala Valley.
The reported sightings of Panther on the road and
rl                 the Bhimavaram Valley to the South of the road is
p&rhaps due to availability of prey animals in the villages
along river Bhima. By a dynamic management of habitat
in Chanala Valley it would be possible to increase
herLivoVus species populations and confine predatiars
fl                 Within boundaries of the Sanctuary.
for
While it is difficult to assess funds neededZsuch
habitat improvement measures it is sugested that one to
ii                 two percent of the total cost of the road project may be
set apart for canpensatory habitat development in the
H    -3Sanctuary. Habitat development is a lcng-term  programne
u                   spread over 4 to 5 years. It is suggested that a develop.
ment plan may be prpared and funds placed at the disposal
3                  of the wildlife wing f0r implementation of the plansuch
prcvision of funds for competnsatory conseivation activities

justice and fairplay in our delaings With nature,

EM WRQS -SM   The scenic land scape of INP and Sanctuary and
particularly the Chamala Valley, the several sacred groves
rn            in the National Park and the crer ten million pilgriris
that visiti Tirumala every year make this place an ideal
locaticn for devel opmen t of eco-tourism; the pzbximity of
Chamala Valley to Tirupathi and the widening of the road
leading to increased traffic should be taken advaatage of
UI            to develop camping places near the Kalyani Reservoir; an
interpretatioh Centre, elephant rides, treks to sacred groves,
and camping in tents could be part of the Eco-tourismr. Such
a prograwnle Will improve the local economy of vitilages
aroand  Chasnala Valley.
