INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
US$5.0 million equivalent development credit to the Kingdom of Swaziland
to help finance an education project.   The credit would be on standard
IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Memorandum on Recent
Economic Developments and Prospects of Swaziland" (AE-25), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 1, 1972 (R72-91). The principal findings
and conclusions of that report, brought up to date, are summarized below.
An updating economic mission is scheduled to visit Swaziland in February
1975. Country data are summarized in Annex I.
3.        Swaziland, which became independent in 1968, is one of the smallest
countries on the African continent. Located in southern Africa, it is com-
pletely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique. In 1973,
its population was estimated at 493,000 with approximately 30,000 citizens
living abroad, mainly as migrant workers in South Africa. The country is well-
endowed with natural resources. It has a variety of mineral deposits, and its
soil and climate are favorable for a diversified agricultural production. Al-
most half of the land is owned by foreigners, and foreign companies hold sub-
stantial mining concessions. The 1950s saw a rapid development of modern
economic activities on foreign-owned land. Several mines (asbestos, iron ore
and coal) were opened up, and foreign companies established substantial plan-
tations (forestry, sugar, citrus, pineapple), which in turn gave rise to in-
dustries, such as a pulp mill, saw mills, sugar mills, fruit processing plants
and various secondary industries. During the period from 1953 to 1962, when
these industries were established, real GDP grew at more than 12 percent a
year. Apart from tourism enterprises, no major new industries were established
after 1963, but expansion of existing enterprises and the establishment of a
number of smaller industries led to a well-sustained real growth in GDP of
about seven percent a year between 1963 and 1972. GNP per capita was estimated
at about $260 in 1972.
4.        Swaziland's sustained economic growth has been a result of vigorous
private investment activity. Over the past three years, gross private invest-
ment averaged about 19 percent of GDP. Government capital expenditures were
on the average no more than five percent of GDP. These developments have led



to a distinct dualism in Swazi society and the economy. As Swazi entrepre-
neurship was, and still is, virtually non-existent, all modern activities have
been carried out by foreign companies, under foreign management, and with
foreign capital. The foreign-owned modern sector now contributes about 70
percent of GDP, 80 percent of wage employment and 90 percent of direct taxes.
The traditional rural sector which has remained stagnant over the years, con-
tributes no more than 10 percent of GDP and recently has been losing signifi-
cance in terms of numbers of people dependent on it. Wage employment within
Swaziland grew by about 10 percent a year between 1960 and 1972, which was
enough to absorb the natural increase in the labor force and the drift from
the land. In addition, the growth in wage labor made possible a reduction in
the number of Swazis working in South Africa. In 1972, it was estimated that
employment in the modern sector was in excess of 60,000 persons, about 40 per-
cent of the estimated total labor force. Projections of the likely increase
in wage employment, based on existing trends in output and investment in the
different sectors, indicate that at least 15,000 new jobs will be created by
1978. There is already a serious shortage of skilled Swazis to work in the
modern sector, and this situation is not expected to improve before the early
1980s.
5.        Agriculture accounted for 35 percent of GDP in 1971/72 with almost
70 percent originating in the modern, foreign-owned sector. The majority of
this output came from estate production of cash crops such as sugar cane,
fruit and vegetables for export after processing. In addition, a number of
large forestry plantations produced raw materials for saw mills and a pulp
mill. Approximately 40 percent of total wage employment in Swaziland is
provided by the modern agricultural sector. Some 80 percent of the total
population live in rural areas and have some land for grazing and the culti-
vation of crops. Many men, however, commute to the centers of modern econo-
mic activity which are all within easy reach. Traditional agriculture is
to a large extent carried on by women, children and old men. Mining contri-
buted about 10 percent of GDP in 1971/72, largely due to the extraction and
export of iron ore, asbestos and coal. Manufacturing in 1971/72 accounted
for 13 percent of GDP and employed about 7,000 people.
6.        Together with Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho, Swaziland belongs
to the rand monetary area and the Southern Africa Customs Union. Swaziland
receives a proportion of the total customs and excise revenue of the whole
customs area, related to her total imports. Movement of goods and funds within
the area is virtually free. In September 1974, Swaziland issued its own national
currency, the lilangeni (plural - emalangeni). The lilangeni has the same par
value as the rand and both currencies are legal tender in Swaziland. The Govern-
ment, with the assistance of the IMF, has established a Monetary Authority to
operate Swaziland's new financial system. In order to remain in the rand
monetary area and be able to continue drawing on the foreign exchange reserves
of South Africa, Swaziland has agreed to maintain 100% of the value of the
emalangeni in circulation in a rand account in the South African Reserve Bank.
This requirement limits the Monetary Authority's implementation of an indepen-
dent monetary policy as the Authority does not have control over domestic
credit creation.



- 3 -
7.        In 1969, the Customs Union Agreement among the four countries
was renegotiated; this provided Swaziland with substantially increased
revenues. These together with additional revenues generated by better tax
collection and the introduction of aew taxes have enabled Government re-
current revenue to increase steadily from E9.5 million in 1968 to E24.3
million in 1973. At the same time, recurrent expenditures were controlled,
increasing from E12 million in 1968 to E21.4 million in 1973. As a result,
budget deficits (E2.5 million in 1968) turned into surpluses (E2.9 million
in 1973). The recent budget surpluses are expected to continue and this
should make it possible for the Government to finance almost 50 percent of
future public investment. To complement the finance from domestic sources,
new commitments of external aid will be necessary in the medium-term, in-
creasing from about E7 million in 1975 to E15 million in 1980. Part of the
public sector investment program cannot be translated into projects that
would attract external financing. To provide sufficient support for the
investment program the external assistance agencies would, therefore, need
to finance about 75 percent of the cost of the projects. This would include
local cost financing, especially for agricultural and educational projects,
where external costs constitute a small proportion of the total cost.
8.        Given Swaziland's membership within the rand monetary area and access
to South Africa's exchange reserves, the conventional concepts of foreign
exchange costs and balance of payments position are not of much significance.
Swaziland's exports increased from E39 million in 1968 to E76 million in 1973.
At the same time, imports rose from E34 million to E63 million. As Swaziland
sells most of its exports overseas, and imports from South Africa account for
about 90 percent of total imports, Swaziland is a substantial net earner of
foreign exchange for the rand monetary area.
9.        Swaziland's National Development Plan (1973-77) emphasizes four
objectives: (1) to create the conditions for a sustained further growth of
the private sector; (2) to promote the transformation of traditional agri-
culture to commercial farming; (3) to improve the relevance and usefulness
of education; and (4) to provide better housing and health conditions for
low-income families in urban and rural areas. The Government realizes that
most of the momentum in the economy will come from the modern sector, and
much of Swaziland's development plan is geared to improving productive capa-
city of the country's modern economy. At the same time, a significant per-
centage of the population remains in traditional agriculture and will continue
in that activity through the next decade. One of the major constraints to the
development of traditional agriculture is the fact that prospects for agri-
cultural earnings do not compare favorably with incomes in the modern sector
in Swaziland or in various sectors in South Africa, and thus there is a lack
of male labor.
10.       Until 1970 the United Kingdom provided funds to cover Swaziland's
budget deficits as well as grants and long-term interest-free loans for
development purposes. During the last few years, Swaziland has sought to
diversify its sources of foreign assistance. As a result, in addition to the



- 4 -
UK, several bilateral agencies have begun to make contributions to the
financing of Swaziland's capital budget. Because of the slow build up of
absorptive capacity, the utilization of foreign assistance has been sluggish.
Recent experience suggests that the country's absorptive capacity is improv-
ing,  as the local staff benefit from training and experience.
11.       On December 31, 1973, Swaziland's external public debt (including
undisbursed) stood at US$46 million, and total debt service obligations
amounted to US$6 million, or five percent of the exports of goods. Swaziland's
future external public debt (including undisbursed) is expected to increase
to US$291 million by 1985 and total debt service obligations to US$15 million,
or three percent of exports. Since the Government is able to draw on the
foreign exchange earnings of the rand monetary area, the debt service ratio
expressed as a percentage of exports is mainly an indication of what
Swaziland's external debt carrying capacity would be if the country became
independent of the rand monetary area.   At present a more useful indicator
of the Government's current debt service capacity is the ratio of debt service
payments to government revenue. In 1973, servicing of existing public debt
represented 4.5 percent of current government revenue; by 1985 we estimate
this will have Increased to six percent.
12.       As a result of favorable export and public revenue prospects,
Swaziland's ability to service debt on conventional terms has improved con-
siderably and the country is now considered creditworthy for limited amounts
of Bank lending. This is the last IDA credit proposed for Swaziland, but
this situation will be reviewed after we have received the report of the
upcoming economic mission.
PART lI - BANK GROUT OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
13.       The Bank Group has so far had three operations in Swaziland.    An
IDA credit of $2.8 million, approved in 1962, helped finance the construction
of an all-weather road across the country; the construction was completed
in 1964. Thereafter, two loans (guaranteed bv the UK) were made to assist
the Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) in the development of the power sector.
The first, a $4.2 million loan made in 1963, enabled SEB to carry out the
Edwaleni hydroelectric project; the second, a $2.75 million loan in 1967,
financed the extension of the same project and the provision of an additiorLal
diesel plant. All three are fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Swaziland.
14.       In our future operations we are aiming to support the G;overnment's
priorities as spelled out in the National Development Plan (see para. 9).
While assisting in the development of the modern sector, we will also attempt
to stimulate growth in the traditional rural sector which, despite its diminish-
ing size and importance, will continue to support a significant percentage of
the population. The Bank Group has not financed a project in Swaziland since
1967. This is partly due to a concentration of our effort on preparing one



- 5 -
major project, the Maphobeni irrigation project. Unfortunately, the Maphobeni
project was found, on appraisal, to be uneconomic. The capital costs and
overhead costs proved to be much higher, and the amount of irrigable land much
less than suggested by the feasibility study. We have, thereafter, intensified
our preparatory work in other areas and, as a result, expect to present three
projects for your consideration in FY75. In addition to this education
project, a water supply and sewerage project, which is being submitted to the
Board along with this project, would assist the modernization of Swaziland's
urban infrastructure. A second roads project, which has been appraised,
consists of the construction of two priority roads linking up areas of major
agricultural production with the country's main commercial centers and trans-
portation routes. Preparatory work is underway on several other projects.
We are attempting to identify a development finance company project to help
promote Swazi enterprise in the industrial sector. In addition, we are in
the early stages of identifying a rural development project whichwould focus
on improving livestock and crop production through the introduction of grazing
controls and conservation methods, and the provision of inputs such as credit
and extension services.
15.       As a result of the substantial increase proposed in Bank Group
operations, debt to the Bank Group as a percentage of total debt is projected
to increase from its current level of 10.6 percent to about 21 percent in
1985. The Bank Group's share in total external public debt service would
increase from 11.4 percent at present to about 34 percent in 1985.
PART III - EDUCATION IN SWAZILAND
16.       Swaziland's education and training sector features:   (a) a
comparatively high enrollment at both primary and secondary levels; (b)
a technical training institute that meets a portion of Swaziland's require-
ments for skilled manpower; (c) a well-conceived scheme for educating and
training high level manpower through the tri-national University of Botswana,
Lesotho and Swaziland (UBLS); and (d) numerous, but uncoordinated, programs
for rural training. For many years, Swaziland's educational system was
shaped by the influence of the missionary societies. Although this resulted
in a fairly high level of literacy, missionary control of Swaziland's educa-
tion operated against the development of a coherent national education plan.
The present educational system suffers from outmoded curricula, inadequate
training of teachers, and insufficient coordination among agencies involved
in nonformal education for rural development.
17.       Swaziland's school system not only fails to produce the skilled
labor required by the modern sector, but it also has a high drop-out rate,
and a high proportion of the children are over-age. Primary school enrollment
is equivalent to 67 percent of the 6-12 age group, while secondary school
enrollment amounts to 18 percent of the 13-17 age group. One-third of the
primary teachers and one-sixth of the secondary teachers are considered



- 6 -
underqualified. The schools also suffer from a lack of furniture and teaching
equipment required for the classrooms. The Swaziland Industrial Training
Institute (SITI) provides vocational and technical training in various areas.
Currently, SITI has over 300 students enrolled in various courses from one to
three years in duration. However, its present output (about 170 full-time
students p.a.) meets only one-fourth of the estimated needs for skilled workers,
technicians and commercial employees.
18.       The Ministry of Education has administrative, financial and aca-
demic control over Swaziland's general educational system. However, several
other ministries and agencies administer programs with educational and
training components. The Department of Labor, a branch of the Deputy Prime
Minister's Office, administers SITI, while the Ministry of Agriculture ad-
ministers the Farming Training Centers and the Agricultural Extension Program.
In 1973 a Rural Development Council was created to coordinate these efforts
and integrate them with investment programs in rural areas. The Government
intends to streamline nonformal education throughout the country and to
incorporate important aspects of agricultural training in both primary and
secondary school curricula.
19.       Since independence in 1968, the Government has moved purposefully
toward an effective educational system designed to meet Swaziland's needs.
In 1973 a National Education Commission, with technical assistance from the
UNDP, USAID, ODM and other agencies, and with wide local participation from
both public and private life, developed a long-term educational plan. The
plan gives priority to: (a) the improvement and expansion of vocational,
technical, agricultural and teacher education; (b) the control of growth in
enrollments and the reorientation of secondary education toward a more prac-
tical content; (c) major curriculum improvements in both primary and secondary
education; and (d) the phased development of a rural and adult education
program.
20.       At present, secondary and university education together account
for 45 percent of the budget allocation for education as compared to less
than six percent for training of middle-level manpower in the technical,
vocational and commercial fields. Under the plan, middle-level manpower
training would receive 14.5 percent of the budget allocation for education
in 1978. By 1985 universal primary education would be achieved; about 20
percent of the age groups would be in secondary education; and expenditure
by the Ministry of Education and the Department of Labor (SITI) would ab-
sorb no more than 16 percent of the total Government budget compared with
the 1973 level of 20 percent.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       The proposed project would comprise: (a) the expansion and improve-
ment of vocational, technical and commercial education and of a teacher training
college; (b) the creation of training centers for youths and adults in the rural
areas; (c) the establishment of a curriculum development center and materials



production center for the entire school system; and (d) the establishment of a
student career-guidance and employment follow-up program. The project has been
prepared by the Ministry of Education with assistance from UNESCO, FAQ and the
World Bank Group. Field appraisal took place in February/March 1974. A credit
and project summary is given in Annex III. The appraisal report (Appraisal
of an Education Project in Swaziland, Report No. 550-SW) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations for the proposed credit
were held in Washington on September 23, 1974, with a delegation led by
Mr. V. E. Sikhondze, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning.
Description
22.       The project would consist of:
(i) Buildings, furniture and equipment for the following:
-    the extension of the existing Swaziland Industrial Training
Institute (SITI);
-    the extension of the existing William Pitcher Teacher
Training College (WPTTC); and
-    seven new rural education centers.
(ii) Buildings, furniture and vehicles for:
-    a curriculum development center;
-    a teaching materials production facility; and
-    three regional teacher in-service training and teaching
materials distribution centers.
(iii) Specialized equipment for a student career-guidance and
employment follow-up service.
(iv) Technical assistance and specialist services for the
Program Unit to assist in implementation of the project.
23.       The full-time student capacity of the project institutions would be
increased from about 1,000 to 3,400 and would be geared to identified man-
power needs; the entire program would conform to present and projected
constraints in terms of both instructor availability and recurrent finance.
The part-time and short-course enrollments in the project schools and centers
are estimated at an additional 7,000 p.a.
Formal Education
24.       The proposed project would influence formal education in Swaziland
at the primary, secondary, vocational and technical levels. Two elements of the
project, expansion of WPTTC and the provisions for the Curriculum Development



- 8 -
and Education Materials Production Center, would directly benefit formal primary
and secondary education. The expansion and diversification of SITI would improve
the country's only formal institution for vocational, commercial and technical
training.
25.       The WPTTC at Manzini is the major teacher training institution in
Swaziland. WPTTC now provides places for 200 pre-service teachers in a two-
year course and 300 in-service primary and lower-secondary teachers. After the
proposed expansion, WPTTC would provide places for 300 pre-service and 360
in-service teacher trainees; due to the housing shortage in Manzini, the proj-
ect would also include five staff housing units. The expansion of WPTTC would
enable the supply of teachers from local training institutions to meet
Swaziland's requirements over the next ten years.
26.       The Qurriculum Development and Education Materials Production Center
is being establishedon the WPTTC campus.    Work on curriculum reform began
two years ago with technical assistance from USAID. This work has progressed
to the point that specialized accomodations are required in order that new
textbook and teaching materials can be prepared and introduced throughout the
system. A small education materials production unit, where prototype materials
would be developed, would be part of the Center. The Government will receive
technical assistance for the Curriculum Development Center from USAID. To
facilitate the distribution of the new materials prepared at the Curriculum
Development Center to the schools, and to train the teachers in their use,
three regional in-service training and materials distribution centers would
be constructed as part of the project.
27.       The proposed project would enable considerable expansion in enrollment
and improvement in the range of programs offered by SITI. The existing capa-
city for full-time students would increase from 370 to 720, and that for
part-time, in-service students from 100 to 450 per annum. The program offered
by SITI would include: (a) pre-technician training courses; (b) craft courses
in a variety of areas; (c) post-secondary technician courses in engineering;
(d) clerical and business training; (e) hotel and food-handling training; and
(f) provisions for training commercial and pre-vocational teachers for
secondary schools. Boarding (280 places) and 16 housing units for teaching
and service staff would be necessary due to the national character of SITI
and the housing shortages in Mbabane, the capital of Swaziland, where SITI
is located.
Non-Formal Education
28.       The Swaziland Government established the Rural Development Council
to coordinate the various programs of nonformal education for rural development
that are currently in existence. The Council has proposed the establishment
of a network of Rural Education Centers (RECs) in the proximity of school
facilities. Because of the comparatively high enrollment ratios they would
be based on junior secondary schools, but represent a major departure from
traditional secondary education since they would offer practically-oriented
agricultural training and rural-skills training to both primary school
leavers and adults. The RECs would also help in promoting the introduction
of practical subjects in the secondary schools. Services to adults would



- 9 -
include community development, agricultural extension work, domestic science,
short courses in rural skills, cooperatives, health and nutrition. In
particular, the RECs would serve as the focal point to coordinate and provide
services at the local level for the existing programs in these fields.
29.       The project would provide the funds to establish seven RECs, two
of which would result from conversion/expansion of existing junior secondary
schools in rural areas. The remainder would be located in more remote areas
where junior secondary schools are not available. Therefore, these five RECs
would also include facilities for junior secondary instruction; the number of
stuc'ent places to be provided at this level is in line with the Government's
objective of controlled expansion of secondary school enrollment. By directing
expansion of school places solely toward rural areas, the RECs would help
overcome the present disparity in educational opportunity between urban and
rural areas. It is estimated that 42 additional instructors would be required
to operate the seven RECs. The Government has agreed that within two years
of signing the Credit Agreement, the necessary instructors would be in trainiDg
(see Section 3.09 of the draft Credit Agreement).
30.       Due to the experimental nature of the RECs, the Government intends
to have their progress continually nonitored by the Education Evaluation Unit,
a working committee that currently exists within the Ministry of Education
(see section 3.08 of the draft Credit Agreement). The Government has agreed
that the Evaluation Unit would submit to the Association for review and comments
the methodology to be employed in evaluating the performance of the RECs within
one year from the date of the Credit Agreement (see Section 3.07(a) of the
draft Credit Agreement). In addition, the Government has agreed to have the
Ministry of Education submit to the Association for its review and comments
the practical study courses curricula proposed for instruction in the RECs
and in the secondary schools in the project within two years from the date
of the Credit Agreement (see Section 3.07(b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Technical Assistance and Career Guidance Provisions
31.       To implement the proposed project successfully, a major program of
staff development and technical assistance would be required to: (a) strengthen
and upgrade the staff of the Ministry of Education; (b) provide for specialist
assistance in rural-adult education and commercial education, together with
fellowship funds for training Swazi counterparts. The project would provide
technical assistance to support a program director and a procurement specialist.
The Government has agreed to provide, or to arrange through other agencies,
the additional technical assistance the Ministry of Education requires to
carry out the proposed educational programs. The Government would submit a
plan for obtaining technical assistance in these areas within six months from
the date of the Credit Agreement (see Section 3.10 of the draft Credit Agree-
ment).



- 10 -
32.       The proposed project would provide the funds for calculators and
data handling machines for the National Employment Service. The equipment
would be used in the Student Career Guidance Program to enable it to operate
effectively in the areas of career-guidance for students, placement advice
and employment follow-up services. The Program will supply manpower data
not now available, helping in the preparation of further plans and projects.
Prolect Execution
33.       The proposed project would be implemented over a period of five and
one-half years after the date of the Credit's effectiveness. The Government
is establishing a Program Implementation Unit with appropriate facilities
and staff within the Ministry of Education for: (a) supervision of implemen-
tation of the programs in support of the education plan, including the pro-
posed project; (b) coordination with the ministries and other parties involved
in the project; and (c) liaisorn with the Association. The Unit would include
a program director, an accountant, and a procurement specialist, whose appoint-
menmswould be satisfactory to the Association (see Section 3.02(b) of the
draft Credit Agreement). The Program Unit's operational expenses would be
financed from the proceeds of the Credit. The establishment of the Program
Implementation Unit and employment of the director are conditions of effec-
tiveness of the proposed Credit (see Section 5.01(a) of the draft Credit Agree-
ment).
34.       The Program Implementation Unit woUld require arcuitectural and
engineering expertise to assist in the design and construction of the project
components. It is expected that architectural and engineering consultants
would be neeced for the expansion of SITI. The Coverrment has agreed to ap-
point these consultants after reviewing their qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment with the Association (see Section 3.02(c)
of the draft Credit Agreement). Appointment of che consultants would be
a condition of effectiveness of the proposed C.di-t (see Section 5.Ol (b) of
the draft Credit Agreement). Architectural assistance would be provided by
the Ministry of Works (MOW) School Facilities Unit, which has been successfully
standardizing primary and secondary schocl facilities throughout the country.
These standard facilities could be adapted to form the basis for the design
of the RECs, Curriculum Centers and expansion of WPTTC. The MOW School
Facilities Unit would also assist the Program Unit in coordinating services
to be provided by the architectural and engineering consultants. The Govern-
ment agreed that the architectural staff of the MOW School Facilities Unit,
which is currently under strength, would be augmented and that the assistance
of the MOW's School Facilities Unit would be made available when requested by
the Program Unit (see Section 3.02(b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Project Costs
35.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.1 million
equivalent and the external costs at US$3.8 million equivalent or 54 per-
cent of the total project cost including contingencies (see Annex III).
Custom duties would not be levied on official government purchases of items
imported for use on the project. The cost estimates include physical contin-



- 11 -
gency allowances of 10 percent for site development, construction and
furniture and five percent for equipment. Contingencies for price increases
are included at an average rate of 15 percent per annum for civil works and
an average rate of 10 percent per annum for equipment and furniture. These
physical and price contingency allowances are considered appropriate for the
type of civil works, equipment and furniture involved in this project.
Project FinancinR
36.       The IDA Credit of US$5.0 million equivalent would finance about
70 percent of the total project cost; it would meet all expenditures of the
project outside Swaziland and would contribute an amount of US$1.2 million
equivalent to the local expenditure. The Government of Swaziland would
finance from its own resources the remaining costs. The financing plan is
as follows:
US$ (Millions)
Swaziland                    Tota-L

2.   Furniture                      0.1          0.2           0.3
3.   Equipment                      0.1          0.9           1.0
4.   Professional Services          0.1          0.1           0.2
5.   Program Administration         0.1          0.1           0.2
6.   Technical Assistance           0.1          0.1           0.2
7.   Contingencies                  0.7          1.6           2.3
Total                     2.1          5.0           7.1
The Government would be able to meet its share of capital costs and the increase
in recurrent costs without curtailing other high priority activities and with-
out overburdening the educational budget. The recurrent expenditures from
the project would be about US$525,000 p.a. when the project is fully operative;
this would be equivalent to about three percent of the projected Ministry of
Education and Department of Labor (SITI) budgets by 1978-79.
Procurement
37.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's Guidelines
for Procurement, but it is unlikely that foreign firms, with the exception
of those from the Republic of South Africa or Mozambique, would be interested
in bidding. Domestic civil works contractors would be allowed a preferential
margin of seven and one-half percent (GDP per capita was less than US$200 per
capita in 1971). The MOW direct labor branch would be used to construct schools
in outlying areas if competitive tendering failed to produce reasonable bids.
Contracts for furniture and instructional equipment would be on the basis
of international competitive bidding except that procurement of instructional



- 12 -
equipment, books, and furniture costing less than US$20,000 up to an aggregate
total of US$150,000 would be on the basis of competitive bidding advertized locally
and in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Association. Domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin
of 15 percent or the existing rates of import duties, whichever is lower.
Disbursement
38.       Disbursement would be made on the basis of:
(i) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported
instructional equipment, furniture and technical assistance
or 100 percent of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
furniture;
(ii) 67 percent of total expenditures for civil works, pro-
fessional architectural/engineering services and program
administration.
Retroactive financing is proposed from September 1, 1974, for Program Imple-
mentation Unit expenditures, the services of consultant architects and advance
work on the WPTTC. The amount of expenditure before the date of the Agreement
is not expected to exceed US$75,000. Procurement is expected to be completed
by April 1978, and the project by June 30, 1980.
Benefits and Justification
39.       The requirement of Swaziland's expanding economy for skilled workers,
technicians and commercial/administrative personnel far exceeds the present
supply. The Swaziland Industrial Training Institute, currently the only
institution training Swazis for technical and skilled positions, is presently
meeting only one-quarter of the demand for its graduates. The project would
provide for SITI's expansion, enabling it to satisfy a significant percentage
of the needs of the modern sector for skilled/technical manpower by the early
1980s. In the interim, the project would give priority to the in-service
training of personnel already in employment in order to extend the capability
of the existing labor force to contribute to economic growth through increased
productivity. Increasing the supply of technically-trained, skilled Swazis
will enable the continued expansion of the modern sector and the gradual
lessening of the country's dependence on expatriates for much of its techni-
cal and managerial personnel.
40.       The project would assist the Swaziland Government's efforts to
coordinate and improve the effectiveness of the numerous nonformal education
schemes in the rural sector that already exist. The Rural Education Centers
would provide specific programs for school leavers and adults to prepare them
for self-employment in rural areas. Based on the training received in the RECs,
the Government anticipates that agricultural productivity would be increased
and this would help in reducing the economic disparities between the traditional
and modern sectors.



- 13 -
41.       Some of the other benefits of the proposed project include the
expansion and reorientation of teacher training, the support of curricula
development,and student career-guidance and employment follow-up. These
are important steps in the reform of the educational system to enable it to
respond more adequately to the Swazi environment and needs of the economy.
42.       The principal risk involved in the project relates to the RECs which
would introduce a new element into the Swaziland educational system. For the
RECs to be successful, the various government bodies would have to coordinate
their efforts and exercise a great deal of imagination in developing courses
and teaching methods. The effective utilization of the RECs would depend
ultimately on the quality of their staff, and the risk exists that some of
the RECs would place undue emphasis on the three-year course for primary
school leavers and neglect the nonformal courses for adults. In order to
minimize this risk, the Government would provide careful monitoring of the
project (see para. 30), and has agreed to prepare, and send to the Association
for review, a project completion report providing a preliminary assessment of
the project's results within six months from the Closing Date of the Credit
Agreement (see Section 4.02 of the draft Credit Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom
of Swaziland and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Certain distinctive features of the draft Credit Agreement, which
in general follows the usual pattern of credits for projects in the education
sector, are referred to in paragraphs 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, and 42 of this Report.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
