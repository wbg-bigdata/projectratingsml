MALI - BIOMASS ALCOHOL AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Government of Mali has requested an IDA credit of US$7.6
million to finance a Biomass Alcohol and Energy Efficiency Project  (the
P'roject).   The Project consists of six components:   (i) biomass alcohol
production from surplus molasses;  (ii) energy efficiency improvements at
the two existing sugar mills; (iii) 'gasohol' blending and distribution
facilities; (iv) technical assistance and training to improve the operating
efficiency of two agroindustrial complexes; (v) a study for future expan-
sion of biomass fuel production; and (vi) technical assistance and studies
to prepare a rehabilitation program for Office du Niger. The Project would
enable Mali to produce about two million liters annually of alcohol to
replace about an equal amount of imported high cost gasoline.  The alcohol
would be produced by upgrading and modifying two existing underutilized
distilleries at Dougabougou and Siribala (Map IBRD 16461) and processing
surplus molasses by-product which is now wasted causing damage to the envi-
ronment.   In addition,  the proposed energy efficiency investments would
allow Mali to use exclusively bagasse, the fiber residues from sugarcane,
instead of petroleum products to generate steam and electric power for its
two sugar mills and distilleries. The import saving from this project com-
ponent is estimated to be about 800,000 liters annually of industrial
diesel oil. At 1983 prices, Project annual production and savings are cal-
culated at about US$ 1.3 million.
1.02       The alcohol produced would be anhydrous ethanol of about 99.6%
purity (Annex 1). On the basis of the regional pattern of consumption and
the existing gasoline supply system, the alcohol would be blended with
regular grade gasoline at the Bamako oil products depot, at a uniform
annual rate. The resultant 'gasohol' blend, containing approximately 3.5%
alcohol, would be distributed through the existing gasoline distribution
system using the same distributors and retail outlets.  Gasohol of up to
210% alcohol blend exhibits equal engine performance compared to the gaso-
line it replaces; the alcohol from the Project would therefore retail at
the same price as regular gasoline.
1.03      The Office du Niger, a parastatal institution, would continue to
own and operate the two distilleries at Dougabougou and Siribala.   The
Dougabougou distillery would continue to produce industrial grade hydrous
alcohol of about 95% purity for the domestic consumer and industrial mar-
ket. Surplus hydrous alcohol production at Dougabougou, estimated at about
two-thirds of total annual production, would be delivered to Siribala for
reprocessing into anhydrous alcohol.   The  Siribala distillery would be
modified and upgraded to produce anhydrous alcohol by fermentation of
molasses produced at Siribala and from hydrous alcohol received from
Dougabougou.   The sugarcane plantations presently serving the two sugar
plants are expected to yield sufficient cane to meet requirements.
However, the thermal efficiency of the sugar mills and annexed distilleries
and the reliability of molasses production need to be improved.   Project
investments in plant modifications, staff training, and the introduction of
improved operations and maintenance systems address this need.

1.04      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$8.3
million, including US$7.2 million in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA
credit of US$7.6 million, equivalent to about 92% of the total financing
requirements, would cover full foreign exchange costs and 36% of local
financing requirements. Office du Niger and the Government would provide
the remaining financing.
1.05      The proposed Credit would be the second Bank Group operation with
Office du Niger and the third operation in the energy and industrial sec-
tors in Mali. The three prior operations are: (i) an Engineering Credit of
US$4.5 million (845-MLI) for Office du Niger, approved by the Board in
October 1978, to provide technical assistance for (a) planning an infra-
structure rehabilitation program, (b) training of irrigation staff, (c)
accounts audit, (d) research, and (e) livestock and socio-economic studies;
(ii) a credit of US$8.0 million (986-MLI) to finance the Industrial Sector
Development Project, approved in May 1980, consisting of support to the
private industrial and traditional sector; and (iii) a credit of US$3.4
million (1134-MLI), approved in April 1981, for a Petroleum Exploration and
Energy Planning project.
1.06   The proposed Project was identified by an IDA mission which visited
Mali in February 1980. The mission recommended that the Government carry
out a feasibility study to: (i) identify the facilities required to pro-
duce, at the least economic cost, anhydrous alcohol, and blend and market
gasohol; (ii) establish the capital and operating cost requirements; and
(iii) assess the economic and financial viability of the required
investments. The Government employed consultants with financing under a
Project Preparation Facility of US$50,000 approved in December 1980. The
feasibility study was completed in July 1981, and reviewed by Government
officials with the assistance of IDA staff. An IDA mission consisting of
Messrs. S. Capoluongo (Chief), N.C. Krishnamurthy, and P. Geraldes
appraised the Project in October 1981. A follow-up mission consisting of
Messrs. S. Capoluongo (IDA) and R. Antoine (Consultant) visited Mali in
June 1982 to review the proposed implementation arrangements for the
Project and to assess the adequacy of sugarcane supply. A second advance
of US$900,000 under the Project Preparation Facility was made in May 1983
to provide urgent support for the rehabilitation of Office du Niger, and
for engineering work for the Alcohol and Energy Efficiency components.
II. ENERGY AND AGRICULTURE
A.   Background
2.01      Mali has a population of nearly seven million and is one of the
ten poorest countries in the world. Per capita GNP was about US$190 in
1982. Mali is handicapped by serious obstacles to development. Extreme
variability of rainfall causes sharp fluctuations in crop and livestock
production, and access to foreign markets is made difficult by its land-
locked position and the long distances--more than 1,000 km--to the nearest
seaports, Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Dakar in Senegal. Development is also
constrained by the substantial internal distances (the country covers an
area of 1.24 million km2), the shortage of skilled manpower, and the narrow
domestic market for industrial and consumer products. About 90 percent of



the population is rural and depends on crop farmaing, animal husbandry,
forestry and fishing for livelihood.    Exports consist almost entirely of
agricultural commodities and livestock, and meet only about 60% of merchan-
dise imports.
B. Energy Situation and Outlook
2.02      Energy demand in 1980, the latest year for which reliable data is
available, is estimated at about 760,000 tons of oil equivalent or about
110 kg per capita. It is estimated that firewood meets about 69% of energy
demand; petroleum products, 24%; and charcoal, the remaining 7%.  Mali has
forests covering 40,000 kin2, possibly holding wood reserves of about 150
million tons, but wood is rapidly being depleted around population centers
because it is used to meet over three-quarters of houisehold energy demand.
Imported petroleum products satisfy virtually all commercial energy demand
that is not met by Firewood or charcoal. The contribution of hydroelectric
power to energy demand is negligible.   Installed hydroelectric capacity,
including the Silingue multipurpose scheme, completed in 1982, totals only
55 MW.
2.03          Mali almost entirely relies on fuel wood and imported oil
products to meet energy demand because its resources, though diversified,
are little developed. The hydroelectric potential of the Niger and Senegal
rivers is estimated to be 2,000 MW.  Oil shale deposits in the east are a
possible source of lhydrocarbons.  There are four Sedimentary basins whose
hydrocarbon potential remains to be established. The Petroleum Exploration
Promotion Project (Cr 1134-MLI) is assisting the Government in evaluating
the hydrocarbon potential of the Taoudeni Basin.   Potential sources of
renewable  energy  include wind,  solar power,  and biomass.   Agricultural
by-products, primarily rice husks, groundnut shells, and sugarcane bagasse
and molasses are either wasted or under-utilized; the latter resources form
the basis of the proposed Project.
2.04      The cost of petroleum products imports rose from US$23.3 million
in 1975 to US$57.2 million in 1979, at an average annual rate of 25%.  In
1975, the value of petroleum products imports was equal to 13% of nerchan-
dise imports and 32% of merchandise exports. In 1979, these ratios rose to
21% and 49%, respectively.   This increase resulted mainly from domestic
demand growth and a deterioration in the terms of trade.  In 1980, it is
estimated that, despite a slight decrease in consumption, the value of
imported petroleum products exceeded 60% of merchandise exports, reElecting
substantial increases in the international price of oil.   High petroleum
import costs are a major factor in the serious balance of payment crisis
Mali now faces. Therefore, the Government attaches high priority to devel-
oping alternative domestic energy resources.
C. Petroleum Products Consumption
2.05       Consumptioni of petroleum products in 1980 is estimated at about
220 million liters (180,000 tons).   Consumptionl grew at an average annual
rate of 9.5% from 107.7 million liters  (88,000 tons)  in 1971 to 222.7
million liters (182,500 tons) in 1979, but decreased slightly to an esti-
mated 220 million liters (180,000 tons) in 1980 because of domestic price
increases.    This trend continued in 1981 and consumption decreased to an
estimated 191.5 million liters (157,000 tons).   In the 1980s, petroleum
products consumption is expected to start growing again, though at a rate



- 4-
lower than in the 1970s, reflecting the trend of the last five years.
Gasoline accounts for almost 40% of consumption volume, and its share is
increasing.   Annex 2-1 shows domestic consumption of petroleum products
from 1971 to 1980; Annex 2-2, their specific gravity.  The following table
summarizes past consumption pattern and growth:

D.   Petroleum Products Pricing
2.06       The Office de Stabilization et Regularization des Prix (OSRP), a
Government agency, regulates petroleum  product prices.  OSRP, in consulta-
tion with  the private importers, reviews periodically retail prices, and
revises them as appropriate. In addition to the ex-refinery prices abroad,
OSRP's calculation of retail prices includes transportation costs, foreign
taxes, domestic import duties and taxes, handling losses, and price stabi-
lization and freight equalization levies.  The two levies achieve the pur-
pose of ensuring uniform retail prices in time, from one revision to the
next, and in various parts of the country.  If the importer's actual costs,
which also include a reasonable allowance for profit, are lower than the
administered price, the Importer pays the difference to OSRP; if costs are
higher, OSRP pays the importer out of the price stabilization fund.
2.07       The system works well and, on average, domestic retail prices of
gasoline, kerosene, and diesel have exceeded import costs in 1980 and
1981.  In January 1982 prices were substantially increased and the current
retail price of gasoline is NP 520 per liter (US$31.04 per gallon).  This
price  is  substantially  higher  than  the  interniational  price.             The
Government, however, taxes kerosene at lower rates than gasoline, for
social reasons, and public utilities benefitting from the investment incen-
tives law are exempt from fuel taxes.  Still, retail prices of all petro-
leum products are above their opportunity value and on average exceed
import cost by about 15%. Under the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Credit



(1134-MiLI), the Government is carrying out a review of its pricing policies
for petroleum products and has agreed to exchange views with IDA on the
recommendations of the study. Historical domestic prices of petroleum
products are shown in Annex 2-3 and summarized below.

E.   Petroleum Products Supply and Marketing
2.08      Mali does not produce any petroleum nor does it have domestic
petroleum refining capacity. Therefore, petroleum product demand is met
entirely by imports. Five companies (Esso, Shell, Mobil, British
Petroleum, and Total) import petroleum products into Mali and distribute
them. They are the affiliates of five major international oil companies
and share the market about equally. The five marketing companies are
members of the Mali Confederation of Oil Distributors (COD) whi^h works
closely with Government in coordinating public and private interests in the
petroleum sector. The marketing companies import petroleum products from
Dakar by rail, and from Abidjan and Parakou by road (Map IBRD 16461).
About 65% of total volume is imported from Abidjan, 33% from Dakar, and 2%
from Parakou. These shares are the result of an acceptable compromise
among several factors, including cost effectiveness, the limited capacity
of the railroad, which is fully utilized, the need to diversify supply
sources to minimize the risk of disruptions, and the varying accessibility
of different regions of Mali to different sources of supply. In 1980,
about 60% of all petroleum products by volume was consumed in the Bamako
area; 17%, Segou; 14%, Mopti; 7%, Kayes; and 2% Gao. Annex 2-4 shows
regional consumption by type of product. All premium gasoline, and about
two-thirds of regular gasoline is sold in the Bamako area. This marketing
and distribution system works reasonably well, is cost effective, and is
considered satisfactory.
2.09      The only bulk storage depot for gasoline in Mali is located at
Bamako. It has a capacity of about 6.5 million liters, equivalent to less
than one and a half months' consumption in the Bamako area. The depot is
owned and operated by the local Mobil affiliate and serves all five oil



- 6 -
companies. Each company individually indents its requirements based on its
market estimates on a monthly basis. Two small gasoline storage facilities
of 300,000 liters each are located at Kayes and Tombouctou.  It is esti-
mated that an additional 1.8 million liters of storage capacity is avail-
able elsewhere in the country at retail outlets and with consumers.   The
overall petroleum products storage facilities in Mali are limited.   The
Project provision of additional facilities to store alcohol produced under
the Project will contribute to relieving this problem by making available
an equivalent volume of gasoline storage (para 4.07).
F.   Agricultural Resources
2.10       Compared to other countries in the Sahel region, Mali has above-
average land and water resources.   The average population density - fewer
than 6 inhabitants per km2 - is relatively low even after excluding the
arid and semi-arid areas.   Except for few densely populated centers, land
availability is not a constraint to agricultural development.
2.11       About 90% of Mali's population lives in rural areas, mostly in
regions with a rainfall of 500 mm annually or higher, which are suitable
for crop or livestock production.   Although over three quarters of the
country receives less than 500 mm of rain annually, the per capita endow-
ment of land suitable for crop production or pasture is more favorable than
for other Sahelian countries. Altogether, some 2 million ha are estimated
to be under cultivation,  of which 90% is in rainfed agriculture and 10%
under irrigation or flooding.  Of some half million farms, about 70% are 5
ha or less. Food crops occupy close to 90% of the land under rainfed culti-
vation while the remainder is devoted to cotton (120,000 ha) and groundnuts
(120,000 ha).  In most areas, land resources are still sufficient to enable
fields to lie fallow, thus ensuring restitution of soil fertility. Animal
traction is more widespread in Mali than in any other Sahelian country.
Fertilizer use is increasing, mainly through the efforts of sugarcane,
cotton, and groundnut development projects.
2.12        Mali also has considerable irrigation potential.   The Interior
Delta of the Niger, the Upper Senegal Valley with its tributaries, and the
lakes region on the Niger's left bank have sufficient water resources to
irrigate over two million ha.   FAO has estimated that Mali's irrigation
potential represents two-thirds of the total irrigation potential of the
six Sahel countries, estimated at 3.1 million ha. Mali's per capita endow-
ment with potential irrigable land was estimated at 0.36 ha, or three times
the Sahel average of 0.12 ha. The cost of developing irrigation, however,
is higher than that required for rainfed agriculture.   Only high value
crops like sugarcane, vegetables and rice can justify irrigation invest-
ments.   Cotton,  groundnuts,  coarse grains,  and rice are the four main
traditional crops.  In the 1970s, sugarcane has emerged as a fifth major
crop.
G.   The Sugar Subsector
1.   Sugarcane Production
2.13      Office du Niger (para 3.01) grows sugarcane with flood irrigation
at Dougabougou, approximately 280 km to the northeast of Bamako, and
Siribala, some 20 km north of Dougabougou (Map IBRD 16461).  There is no



shortage of irrigation water.   Up to about 1,300 ha can be irrigated at
Dougabougou,  and 2,100 ha at Siribala using  existing  facilities.   Cane
yields have averaged about 50 tons/ha at Dougabougou, and over Q0 tons/ha
at Siribala.   This difference is due to improved cane varieties,  better
soil characteristics,  and drainage at Siribala.   The only major disease
occuring in the area, smut, has so far been satisfactorily controlled.
Cultural practices are generally satisfactory although improvements could
be made in land grading and planing for better yield performance.
Technical assistance for this purpose is included under the proposed
Project (para 4.10).  Tractors, vehicles, and other agricultural equipment
are adequate but their timely and efficient availability needs to be
improved. The Dougabougou sugar mill was commissioned in 1966. The one at
Siribala began operating ten years later in 1976.   Both factories are of
standard design and have annex distilleries.   They were built with Chinese
aid. The cane crushing capacity at Dougabougou is 400 tons per day (tpd);
at Siribala, 1,000 tpd.
2.14        Sugarcane production statistics are presented in Annex 2-5 and
summarized below:

a/ First year of operations at Siribala.
b/ Dougabougou factory shut down.
2.15      Total sugarcane production increased gradually from about 177,000
tons in 1976/77 to 225,000 tons in 1979/80.   In 1981, however, the 15-year
old Dougabougou plant, after experiencing frequent break-downs, was shut
down  for  a  full  rehabilitation.    The  Siribala  plant  also  experienced
operating difficulties due to lack of spare parts and inadequate mainte-
nance. Therefore, only 173,000 tons of cane were harvested in 1980/81, and
88,000 tons in 1981/82.   The sugarcane throughput was constrained by the
operability of the two factories, one of which, Dougahougou, was shut down
for the entire 1981/82 campaign.  Now the Dougabougou factory has been com-
pletely rebuilt with Chinese assistance, and started operating in October
1982; the Chinese have started to repair the Siribala sugar mill and com-
pletion is expected in about one year because this mill will continue to
operate while it is being repaired. The Malians achieved satisfactory per-
formance for 15 years at Dougabougou without any prior experience in sugar
operations.   It is therefore reasonable to expect that performance in the
1980's will improve as a result of the experience gained in the 1970's and
the rehabilitation of the sugar mills.
2.16          The sugarcane  planting  programs  were  altered  to respond  to
factory  rehabilitation  and  repair  needs  during  the  last  two  sugar
campaigns.   It was reasonable to minimize the expected cane supply because



- 8 -
sugarcane that cannot be brought to the factory must either be cut and
thrown away or, if left standing, it is likely to affect adversely the
yield of the following harvest. At Dougabougou no new plantings were made
in 1980/81, because of the following season shutdown, but the planting pro-
gram for the current season, 1982/83, is well advanced and 229 ha (out of
the planned 285 ha) have already been planted.   At Siribala factory cane
requirements in the last campaign, 1981/82, were met by harvesting only
1,061 ha out of 1,730 ha.   No new plantings were made at Siribala during
the last season because it is expected that the factory will operate at
about 50% capacity in 1982/83 to allow time for repairs and replacement of
key  spare  parts.    The planting program,  however,  has been resumed  in
September 1982, in time to sustain projected cane requirements of over
200,000 tons in 1984/85 and onwards.
2.   Sugar and Molasses Production

a/ Siribala complex started operations.
b/ Siribala only.
2.18        Dougabougou and Siribala together produced over 18,000 tons of
sugar, and 8,000 tons of molasses annually from 1977 to 1980, when both
facilities were operating normally.  In 1981, however, as explained above,
the 15-year old Dougabougou plant was shut down for a full rehabilitation,
while Siribala also had operating problems. As a result, sugar production
dropped to about 11,600 tons in 1980/81, and molasses production to about
5,300 tons.   Since the Dougabougou factory has been fully rebuilt, and
repairs at Siribala are underway, it is expected that past production
levels of sugar and molasses can be resumed beginning with the 1984/85 cam-
paign  (para  4.18).    These past  levels  of molasses  production  will  be
adequate to meet the requirements of the proposed Project.
3.   Existing Distillery Operations
2.19        Each sugar mill is equipped with fermentation and distillation
facilities capable of producing 95% ethanol from the molasses residues



- 9 -
remaining after sugar production.   Small quantities of this alcohol are
produced and sold in Mali for pharmaceutical and industrial uses. However,
the market demand is small and less than 10% of the available molasses is
used to produce the required alcohol, although the distilleries were
designed with sufficient capacity to process all the molasses. The bulk of
the molasses has no economical export market outlet because its transporta-
tion cost exceeds its current export market value (para 7.07).  It is now
discarded to the bush, where it creates an environmental problem.   This
wasted molasses would be the feedstock for fuel alcohol production under
this Project.
H.  Government Strategy in the Energy Sector
2.20       Since petroleum product imports absorb a high and growing share
of foreign exchange earnings (para 2.04), the Government intends to develop
all potential domestic energy resources to reduce dependence on imported
oil products. Mali is undertaking various energy projects with the assis-
tance  of  the  international  community.    Several  wood  utilization  and
forestry projects are being implemented with assistance from IDA (Credit
883-MLI) and bilateral aid.  As mentioned, a technical assistance project
(Credit 917-MLI) for petroleum exploration and energy planning was approved
by the II)A Board in April 1981.   A power project  (Credit 1282-MLI) was
approved by the IDA Board in July 1982.   Mali also participates in the
UNDP-financed, IDA-executed, global project for testing small-scale solar
pumping systems. Finally, USAID is financing a US$4.1 million solar energy
project.
2.21      The lead time required to exploit most potential domestic energy
resources, such as hydroelectric power and solar energy, is long. In addi-
tion, demand for liquid fuels, mainly in the transportation sector, is
relatively inelastic due to the very low consumption levels, and presents
very limited opportunities for interfuel substitutions due to technical and
economic reasons.  In this context, an opportunity to produce liquid fuel
with a short lead time, and using existing facilities has a high priority.
2.22      The molasses which is now wasted can be used to produce approxi-
mately  two million liters of anhydrous ethanol  (ethyl alcohol of 99.6%
purity) annually, through better utilization of the existing distilleries.
This alcohol would replace an equal volume of gasoline in a blend of gaso-
line and alcohol commonly referred to as 'gasohol'.   Experience in other
countries has shown that gasohol blends containing up to 20% alcohol have
practically the same performance as gasoline and that gasoline-powered
vehicles do not require significant engine modifications to run on gasohol
(see Alcohol Production from Biomass in the Developing Countries, World
Bank,  September 1980).   Because the potential production of alcohol from
the currently available molasses is about two million liters per year
(lpy), the annual volume of alcohol available for blending would be less
than 5% of the current volume of gasoline consumption.   Mali, therefore,
has the option to introduce a gasohol blend with a modest alcohol content,
while achieving significant savings in gasoline imports.

III.  TRE PROJECT SPONSOR
A. The Office du Niger
3.01      In 1932, the French colonial administration created the Office du
Niger (ON) to develop the irrigation potential of the central delta of the
Niger River, and grow rice and cotton.  ON's irrigation system, developed
in the 1930's and 1940's, consists of a dam on the Niger River, the Markala
barrage, which raises the water level by about 5 meters, a feeder canal
upstream of the dam, and two main irrigation canals, the Sahel canal, and
the Macina canal. The secondary and tertiary canals can serve up to 53,000
ha of cultivable land of which about 41,000 ha are currently cultivated -
38,200 ha under rice, and 2,800 ha under sugarcane. After independence, in
1961, the Office du Niger was taken over by the Government and became an
autonomous parastatal entity enjoying a considerable degree of managerial
and  financial  independence.       ON  is  the  largest  rural  development
institution in Mali.
3.02        In addition to the agro-industrial complexes at Siribala and
Dougabougou (paras 2.13-2.19), ON operates four rice mills with a total
annual capacity of about 70,000 tons of rice, and two experimental feedlots
for beef cattle. In 1970, cotton cultivation was abandoned largely because
of low yields, poor financial returns, and the resulting farmers' lack of
interest.   Now ON grows  sugarcane on its estate plantations with hired
labor, and rice with tenant farmers to whom it provides farm inputs and
equipment, credit and marketing services in exchange for a levy covering
the use of the irrigated land, and equipment rental and other services.
3.03      ON's total staff in July 1982 was about 9,500, of which 5,400 are
seasonal labor.   The 4,100 permanent staff include about 400 managers and
800  office  workers.    The  remaining  2,900  are  skilled  and  unskilled
laborers.  Except for Chinese technical assistance in building and rehabi-
litating the sugar mills, ON is managed entirely by Malians who have coped
reasonably well with day-to-day operations, considering the dearth of
trained staff, but need to strengthen managerial, technical and financial
skills.
3.04          ON's statutes allow it a high degree  of independence  over
planning, operations, and finance. The Council of Ministers appoints ON's
chief executive, the Director General, who formally reports to the Minister
of Agriculture.   Seven major departments and three staff divisions report
to the Director General.   The Government has identified two weaknesses in
the existing ON's structure: highly centralized decision-making leading to
delays and insufficient supervision, and inadequate coordination among dif-
ferent  departments.   These matters  are  currently  being  discussed  with
several donors with a view to developing a joint program to strengthen OnT
and improve its management effectiveness and procedures.
B. Operating Performance
3.05        Throughout most of the 1970's, ON's operating performance was
good.   The area under rice cultivation increased from less than 30,000 ha
in  the  1960's  to  nearly 40,000 ha  in  the  mid-1970's.    Paddy  yields



- 11 -
increased from an estimated 1-3/4 tons per ha in 1971 to over 2-1/2 tons
per ha in 1978.  ON's farming population, which had declined in the 1960's,
rose from less than 30,000 in the late 1960's to more than 50,000 in the
Jate 1970's.   Sugar production increased nearly fourfold,  from 5,000 tons
in 1970/71 to nearly 19,000 tons in 1977/78, and stabilized at about 18,000
tons in 1978/79 and 1979/80.
3.06       Many factors contributed  to these good results which contrast
with  the  sluggish  performance  in  the  1960's.    They  include  better
management and the improvement of services provided to farmers which in
turn  brought  about  improved  farmers'  attitudes.    Farmers  welcomed  the
termination of cotton cultivation which had become unrewarding (para
3.02).   ON improved maintenance of in-field irrigation canals,  levelled
several irrigated areas, and rented to smallholders most of its estate rice
plantations which were reduced from over 10,000 ha to a mere 600 ha.
Finally, the drought of the early 1970's combined with the incentives
provided by the producer price increases of 1974 brought an important
inflow of new settlers to ON.
3.07       ON's primary source of revenue is from the sale of sugar, rice,
and related by-products.   The Government sets the sales prices which are
reviewed from time to time but at least once a year.   Several Government
agencies participate in the price review.  They include OSRP (para  2.06),
the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance, and the Office du Niger.   ON's
input in the review is important, reflecting its role as a major food
producer in Mali. Another important source of revenue is the levies tenant
farmers pay ON for the use of the irrigated land, equipment, tools, and
services.    IJnlike most  parastatal  institutions  in Mali,  the Office  du
Niger has operated without direct Government subsidies.
C. Financial Condition
3.08         ON did not issue adequate financial reports on its operations
from 1964 to 1978.  Problems related to the valuation of assets after the
transition of ownership from France to Mali are the main reason for this,
but accounting and financial control systems and staff are also inade-
quate. With technical assistance financed by IDA (Cr. MLI-845), Office du
Niger prepared consolidated financial statements for 1979 and 1980 which
have been audited but not certified, pending Government decisions on the
definition of its rights as a shareholder and as a creditor of Office du
Niger and the verification of key assets, mainly receivables and invento-
ries.
3.09       The 1979 and 1980 consolidated financial statements of Office du
Niger are presented in Annexes 3-1 and 3-2 and summarized in the following
page:

3.10         In 1979,  sugar sales were about 51% of total revenues; milled
rice, 26%; other agricultural products and by-products, 13%; and farmers'
levies 10%.   By-product  sales included alcohol sales of less than 1% of
total revenues.   The 61% revenue  increase  to MF 13.9 billion  (USS 21.5
million) from 1979 to 1980 resulted mainly from price increases, as
physical sales volume increased only slightly. Price adjustments, however,
were not sufficient to offset cost increases resulting from major invest-
ment write-offs charged to income, an increase in staff and other over-
heads,  and  an  estimated  inflation  rate  of 68%.   Relatively  low asset
turnover resulting from inefficient management of inventory and receivables
also explains ON's 1980 loss and subsequent liquidity problems.
3.11         In 1979 ON's working capital was high compared with sales; in
1980, after a decrease of about 30%, it was still adequate for operations
as the current ratio stood at 1.9:1.  While ON's current assets are high,
their quality needs to be confirmed by the auditors because cash of MF 309
million (US$ 0.5 million) at June 30, 1980 was low relative to inventory
and receivables of MF 15 billion (US$ 23.1 million).   In 1980, long term
debt almost doubled to MF 2 billion (USS 3.1 million) but capitalization
remained strong. In summary the above financial statements indicate a good
capitalization but deteriorating profitability and uncertain liquidity. It
is therefore, important that ON restore and improve the productivity of the
assets  that  sustain  its  earning  power.   In  the  sugar  sector,  alcohol
production and energy efficiency investments proposed under this Project
would contribute significantly to increasing the productivity of the exist-
ing sugarcane processing facilities.
D. Recent Developments
3.12       In 1981 and 1982, ON's rice and sugar production decreased from
the 1979 and 1980 levels while costs continued to rise.  ON was unable to
turn over its inventory and collect receivables quickly enough and was
caught in a liquidity squeeze.  In fiscal 1982, ON had a cash flow deficit
and rolled over about MF 1.1 billion (US$1.7 million) outstanding on bank
overdraft facilities of MF 2.6 billion (US$4.0 million). There is concern
that this cash shortage may have further adverse effect on production and
maintenance of facilities.   This liquidity problem was probably caused by
heavy expenditures incurred in the construction of a new irrigation canal



- 13 -
and the reduction in sugar sales (para 2.18).   In fact, a drop in sugar
production was to be expected while the Dougabougou mill was shut down for
extensive rebuilding.   Product prices rose more slowly than rising costs.
ON's tenant farmers were particularly hit by this squeeze and apparently
fell behind in payment of levies and for goods purchased on credit from
ON. Liquidity, however, is expected to improve as sugar production returns
to previous levels.   The alcohol production envisaged under this project
would further strengthen ON finances.
3.13       IDA has financed one previous project to ON for US$4.5 million,
beginning in 1978 (Credit 854-MLI), consisting of a three-year program of
technical assistance and pilot rehabilitation works (Project Performance
Audit Report No. 4414, dated March 25, 1983).   As IDA's first action in
this irrigation scheme, the project was viewed as a vehicle for evaluating
both ON's capabilities and the prospects for larger-scale support, with the
basic objective to lay the groundwork for a future, large-scale rehabilita-
tion project. To this end, the project aimed to strengthen ON administra-
tion, to experiment the alternative types of physical rehabilitation, to
prepare plans for and estimate costs of future rehabilitation, and to sup-
port agricultural research for crop diversification.   The project encoun-
tered several difficulties, including delays and cost overruns caused by
delays in recruiting consultants and their problems in working with the
staff of ON.  During this project, it became apparent that the major con-
straints in ON are institutional, including its organizational structure
and socio-economic conditions of its farmers, and that any improvement in
physical facilities should be subordinated to action in these areas.   ON
has recently taken actions to streamline its management (para 3.14) and to
improve its relation with farmers.   The proposed Project, which combines
technical assistance with productive physical investments in a clearly
defined area, would represent IDA's first effort to support these positive
new developments.
3.14         By early 1982, largely as the result of financial pressures
caused by the deteriorating cash-flow of ON, the Malian authorities recog-
nized that important actions must be taken both to increase sugar and rice
production and to reform the overly centralized administrative structure of
ON. The government also accepted a high-level diagnostic mission in late
1982, led by French representatives with Dutch and IDA financed partici-
pants, which collaborated with Malian authorities to produce an ambitious
rehabilitation plan for ON, covering three phases.   The first would be to
consolidate current activities by getting the existing infrastructure
operating and by intensifying production. The second would be to rehabili-
tate and modernize the irrigation system; and the third would be to expand
production onto newly developed land.   Subsequent to the release of this
rehabilitation plan, representatives of IDA, French, Dutch and other bila-
teral aid agencies and of the Malian government have agreed on broad prin-
ciples for a coordinated, donor financed program to help rehabilitate the
ON.  The agreement includes measures to enhance the working conditions of
rice farmers (along the lines of on-going Dutch-financed experiments), to
improve the quality of irrigation services, and--with respect to the sugar
sector--to establish a separate Sugar Division with full managerial and
financial autonomy within the ON. The purpose of creating a separate sugar
division is to protect the productive assets of the sugar sector and to
enable it to function efficiently within an organization that is otherwise

chronically short of funds and administratively cumbersome.  Tt is all the
more important since sugar profits provide essential financial support for
rice production.  The proposed Project would provide a valuable first step
in implementing both the first phase of the Government's rehabilitation
plan and in carrying out some of the measures agreed upon by the donors and
the Malian Government.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Scope
4.01        The main objectives of the proposed Project are: (a) to reduce
Mali's dependence on imported petroleum products by utilizing a domestic
renewable energy source (molasses) which is currently being wasted; and
(b) to improve substantially the energy efficiency of the two existing
sugar mills to reduce their production cost and eliminate the use of
imported petroleum fuels.   About two million liters annually of anhydrous
(99.6%) alcohol would be produced, blended with gasoline, and used as auto-
motive fuel. The Project will also improve the energy efficiency of Mali's
two sugar mills so they can use bagasse, instead of imported petroleum
fuel, to generate power and steam.   In addition, the Project will assist
Mali to prepare the overall rehabilitation of the Office du Niger.   The
Project will include the following components:
(a) biomass alcohol production by fermenting all the molasses at both
sugar plants and subsequent distillation to produce 99.6% ethanol
at Siribala; and provision of additional alcohol storage, hand-
ling, and transportation facilities;
(b) energy efficiency improvements through installation of yeast
recycling system at the alcohol distilleries and process control
instrumentation and maintenance systems at the sugar mills and
distilleries to facilitate alcohol distillation operation to be
carried out within the same crushing season as well as modifica-
tions to evaporators and piping to utilize steam efficiently and
eliminate the need to use external petroleum fuels;
(c) additional storage capacity at the Bamako terminal for storage of
alcohol, facilities for blending alcohol with gasoline and for
loading system modification;
(d) technical assistance for introducing better systems for plant
maintenance and operations management as well as training of
operational, maintenance, and supervisory personnel:
(e) a study on future expansion of biomass energy production; and
(f) urgently required farm inputs, technical assistance, and studies
to prepare a rehabilitation program covering technical, finan-
cial, and administrative operations of ON in its entirety.

B.    Project Description
1. Biomass Alcohol Production, Storage, and Handling Component
4.02       The Siribala and Dougabougou distilleries are designed to produce
industrial grade alcohol, i.e. hydrous ethanol up to 95% purity.   As des-
cribed in detail in the report: Alcohol Production from Biomass in the
Developing Countries, World Bank, September 1980, only anhydrous ethanol of
at least 99% purity can be used in a 'gasohol' blend of gasoline and up to
20% ethanol.  The principal modification required to produce this grade of
anhydrous ethanol from the existing facilities in Mali is to add process
equipment for additional water removal from hydrous ethanol. This process
commonly involves introduction of an 'entraining' liquid such as benzene or
cyclohexane, which enables the distillation to be extended to produce anhy-
drous ethanol.   Chart 1 on the following page illustrates graphically all
process steps involved in this component, from sugarcane to gasohol deli-
very.
4.03        The existing distillation train at Sirihala would he rearranged
and upgraded to allow it to produce anhydrous ethanol (9.6% purity).  The
same result could also be achieved hy adding two distillation columns to
the existing  facility.   The  rearrangement  of  the  existing  distillation
columns was selected instead of the addition because it will reduce capital
cost and the process energy usage.   This type of modification will not,
however, permit production of the small quantity of hydrous ethanol
(95% purity) required as an intermediate product for industrial and pharma-
ceutical uses.   Therefore,  the Dougabougou distillery would be maintained
as the source of hydrous alcohol to meet local market demand, while surplus
over this demand will be transported to Sirihala for further processing.
Siribala was chosen because it has a higher capacity (10,000 lpd) than
Dougahougou (4,000 lpd).   Charts 2 and 3 on the following pages show the
existing and modified distillation systems at Siribala.
4.04        In order to accommodate the proposed increased alcohol produc-
tion, it will also be necessary to introduce additional storage, loading
and unloading facilities, and vehicles.   These would include: (i) vehicle
loading  facilities  at Dougabougou  to deliver surplus hydrous alcohol  to
Siribala; (ii) vehicle discharge facilities and buffer storage at Siribala
to accommodate the hydrous alcohol received from Dougahougou; (iii) vehicl.e
loading  facilities and  storage  for anhydrous  alcohol at Siribala  to he
delivered to the Bamako hlending depot; and (iv) trucks to transport
hydrous  alcohol  to be  reprocessed  from  Dougabougou  to  Sirihala.    The
existing molasses storage capacity is sufficient to meet anticipated
requirements.
2. Energy Efficiency Component
4.05        The Siribala and Dougabougou industrial complexes currently do
not operate at the level of thermal efficiency for which they were
designed.  The causes of inefficiency include inadequate process equipment,
instruments, and piping as well as poor maintenance and operation.  These
causes and the remedies proposed under the Project are discussed in detail
in paras 4.23-4.25.   Both Siribala and Pougabougou would be modified and
improved to ensure adequate and economic supply and use of energy.  These

provisions will have the combined result of increasing the design thermal
efficiency of both industrial complexes and, more importantly, of improving
actual performance to approach the expected energy input.  The modifica-
tions would involve adding to the sugar mills and distilleries new process
equipment, instruments, and piping which would result in increased effi-
ciency of steam utilization and distribution  facilities.   At Dougabougou,
provision would be made for a cooling tower to aid thermal efficiency, and
a yeast recycling system, to increase fermenter throughput and enahle the
distillery to process the annual supply of molasses within the cane
crushing season.  Any surplus yeast, in excess of the needs for recycling
into fermentation, can be used by Office du Niger as an animal feed
supplement.    Removal  of  the  yeast  before  distillation  will  also  be
beneficial to the distillation.  It is anticipated that there will he suf-
ficient steam available from the sugar factory to meet hydrous alcohol
production requirements during this period.
4.06       At  Siribala,  in addition  to a new cooling  tower and  a yeast
recycling system, the modifications would include complete repiping, addi-
tional  instrumentation,  and evaporation vessels.   The steam requirements
for production of anhydrous alcohol at the modified Siribala distillery at
its maximum expected production rate is estimated to he 2.4 tons per hour.
This is less than half of the quantity of surplus  steam expected  to be
available from the sugar factory to operate the alcohol distillery.  There
would, therefore, be no longer any need for supplementary fuel usage to
service the combined sugar and ethanol production activities at Siribala.
Efficient steam production and distribution will  benefit  both  sugar and
alcohol operations.   While the investments described above would  involve
both the sugar mills and alcohol distilleries it is not always possible to
allocate all of these investments clearly to either the alcohol or the
sugar plants because most of the facilities are shared between the distil-
lery and the mill.
3. Gasohol Blending and Distribution Component
4.07        In order to ensure consistent and satisfactory gasohol quality,
alcohol blending with gasoline must be properly controlled at a central
storage facility.   The only suitable location in Mali is the main storage
depot at Bamako which is owned and operated by a Mobil affiliate (para
2.09).   A 250,000 liters alcohol storage tank with piping and automatic
blending pump would  therefore  be installed at  Bamako  depot.   This  new
storage and blending facility will be owned by the Government and leased to
the depot operator (para 5.07). The depot operator would blend the alcohol
with gasoline when the gasohol is loaded into tanker trucks for delivery to
retail outlets.   The  blending  pump  can be  pre-set  to draw  the  desired
proportion of gasoline and alcohol into the vehicles being loaded.   This
procedure is common in countries where gasohol is widely used and will be
adopted in Mali.   Because the alcohol will displace an equal quantity of
gasoline there would be no net increase in the fleet of delivery vehicles
serving the depot.  The Alcohol Production UTnit of ON will sell the alcohol
ex-distillery to the five petroleum distribution companies for its blending
into gasohol.   The oil companies will arrange alcohol transport from the
Siribala distillery to Bamako depot (para 4.14).



- 20 -
4.08        Alcohol production would be undertaken on a seasonal hasis to
take maximum advantage of the steam and power available from the adjacent
sugar factories during the cane crushing season.  There could be some cost
saving if alcohol were blended with gasoline only during the sugar produc-
tion season while using regular gasoline during the rest of the year.
However,  from  an  operational  viewpoint,  it  is  preferable  to market  a
uniform blend throughout the year.   This latter approach  is contemplated
under the Project.  The local petroleum distributing companies support this
program. During negotiations, it was agreed that, by January 31, 1984, the
Government will enter into an agreement satisfactory to IDA with the Mali
Confederation of Oil Distributors specifying arrangements for the marketing
and distribution of gasohol.
4. Technical Assistance and Training Component
(a) Industry
4.09        Technical assistance would be provided to enhance the skills,
knowledge, and experience of staff at various levels relative to the
requirements of project implementation and subsequent operation. ITnder the
Project, a detailed review would be carried out of the technical and
operational staff training requirements of the two factories by specialized
consultants whose qualifications, selection and terms and reference will he
satisfactory  to IDA.   Upon completion of the review,  consultants  would
prepare a detailed training and technical assistance program. This program
will also include provision for implementing revised operation and mainte-
nance systems, management information and financial controls systems.
Agreement has been reached that the detailed program will he submitted to
IDA for approval by January 31, 1984.
(b) Agriculture
4.10       In order to assist ON to improve per acre yields of sugarcane and
the cane quality,  the Project would also include training and  technical
assistance provisions aimed to support the agricultural staff who manage
ON's  sugarcane  plantations.   This  component  will  further  contribute  to
ensure that future cane supply is sufficient and reliable.  The provisions
would include intensive three-month courses in sugarcane agronomy for eight
senior staff and specialized follow-up courses for the agronomist and for
the irrigation  and drainage managers.   In addition,  a sugarcane  expert
would be internationally recruited to provide technical support and
on-thejob training to the plantations field managers. The sugarcane expert
will be employed for about 12 months. Short term consultants would also he
recruited to advise ON on irrigation and drainage, cane varieties, and
disease  prevention.       ON  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  this
Component.
5. Biomass Energy Study Component
4.11         The Government  is committed  to developing further  renewable
energy resources.  The proposed Project would satisfy only a small portion
of the demand for liquid fuel. The Project would, therefore, also include
provision for a study to assess the potential for additional hiomass fuel
production.   The main objective of the study would be to assess whether



- 21 -
there is economic justification for the production of crops for biomass
fuel in Mali.  The study will be carried out by internationally recruited
consultants acceptable to IDA and will require seven staff-months to com-
plete. Draft terms of reference for the study are given in Annex 4.
6.   ON Rehabilitation Program
4.12      Since late 1982, Government has taken initial steps to develop a
comprehensive ON rehabilitation plan (para 3.14) and discussions with
possible donors on basic aspects of reform and rehabilitation have advanced
satisfactorily.   Given the difficulties in the past, donors have agreed
that future interventions should be part of a collaborative, multi-donor
effort, even though donors may finance actions separately. However, there
is still no feasible program that is both a coherent set of policy reforms
with detailed action plans and an integrated package of projects and
investments that could be financed by various donors.   To prepare this
program, ON would set up a Rehabilitation Task Force (RTF). The RTF would
report to the ON Director.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that by December 31, 1983, the RTF would be created with the necessary
technical assistance and a work program established on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA.
4.13      To develop a rehabilitation program, the assistance would consist
of three resident specialists, qualified in irrigation engineering and
operations, agronomy, management and financial analysis, and agricultural
development generally. To help set up a unified sugar sector (para. 3.15),
assistance would consist of two consultants qualified in sugar industry
management and financial accounting. Approximately 15 work-years of expert
and consultant services would be provided. In addition to technical assis-
tance and logistics needed to develop a rehabilitation program and restruc-
ture the sugar sector, the component may also be used to finance technical
assistance, equipment and training needed to start implementing the reforms
and to finance urgent requirements of fertilizers, and other chemicals for
the sugarcane plantations.
C.   Project Management
4.14        The Office du Niger would be responsible for implementing the
alcohol production, storage, and handling component, the energy efficiency
component for the sugar industrial complexes, the industrial and plantation
technical assistance and training, and the rehabilitation task force. The
Ministry of State for Equipment (ME) would be responsible for implementing
the gasohol blending component and the biomass energy study. Distribution
and marketing of gasohol would be the responsibility of the marketing
companies (para 2.08) which would also take delivery of the alcohol
ex-Siribala.
4.15         For implementation of those components related to the sugar
sector, assurances were obtained during negotiations that by July 1, 1984 a
Sugar Division will be established for all ON sugar operations including
sugarcane plantations, alcohol distilleries, sugar mills, and support
services such as warehousing, storage, maintenance, and transportation.
The Sugar Division would have managerial and financial autonomy, including
a separate bank account, and a manager and a financial manager.   Opening
the separate bank account for sugar, into which ON would deposit all reve-



- 22 -
nues from the sale of sugar, sugar by-products, and alcohol, is a condition
of Credit effectiveness.   Control over sugar and alcohol revenues would
remain under the manager of the Sugar Division until all expenditures for
producing  sugar  and  alcohol  were  met.    In  addition,  assurances  were
obtained  that,  at  least  three  months  before  the  start  of  each  sugar
campaign, the head of the Sugar Division would submit to ON's Director for
approval an Operational Plan for the cane crushing season.  The proDosed
project would also create an Alcohol Production TJnit (APTP) as a separate
profit center, or self-contained organizational and accounting unit under
the Sugar Division.  The head of the APTJ would be project manager for all
aspects of project implementation related to alcohol production.  He would
be assisted by a chemical engineer, a financial controller, and two storage
operators to be recruited under the project to supplement existing staff at
the two distilleries.  Establishment of the APTJ with management, staff and
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA is a condition of Credit effective-
ness.
4.16          An experienced  engineering  firm acceptable  to IDA would  be
employed to prepare the process engineering package for the alcohol produc-
tion, energy efficiency, and gasohol blending components of the Project and
bidding documents for the rest of project implementation work. The bidding
documents would permit invitation of international competitive bids for a
group of contracts covering detailed engineering, supply of equipment,
civil works and erection of equipment and start-up of the plants (para
5.08).  The engineering firm would also be responsible for supervising the
work of the selected principal contractor up to plant start-up and for
demonstrating plant performance in accordance with process guarantees under
their  process  engineering  contract.    This  solution  would  reduce  ON's
requirement of manpower deployment and management time to a minimum.  The
engineering firm would also be responsible for carrying out the technical
assistance Component except for specialized services such as accounting,
and agricultural consultancies, which would be contracted separately suh-
ject to IDA approval of the consultants' terms of reference and qualifica-
tions.
D. Project Schedule
4.17        Chart 4 on the following page shows the Project implementation
schedule.   Advertising is being arranged and negotiations with the engi-
neering firm are expected to be completed in August 19P3.   The major part
of the engineering design and procurement activities will take place during
the 1983/84 cane crushing season.  The distillery modifications at Siribala
will continue during the 1984/85 cane crushing season, while required pro-
duction of hydrated alcohol will be undertaken at the rehabilitated
Dougabougou distillery.  Work at Siribala will be completed before the end
of the 1984/85 cane crushing season, to allow test-runs of the new facili-
ty.   Installation of new evaporators at Siribala will occur in the second
half of 1985 to allow ample time for procurement of the required compo-
nents.   Introduction of the yeast recycling  system and cooling tower at
Dougabougou is also planned for late 1985.   This implementation schedule
was confirmed during negotiations.

4.18          Additional  alcohol  storage facilities at Siribala have been
planned for 1984. This will allow the Dougahougou distillery to produce at
full capacity,  in excess of market demand that year.  The surplus hydrous
alcohol would be stored for reprocessing at the Siribala distillery as soon
as the required modifications have been completed. The timing of the modi-
fications at the Bamako depot is less critical and can be established to
the convenience of the depot operator.   It is, however, necessary to com-
plete it before the end of the 1984/85 season in anticipation of receiving
the first supplies of anhydrous alcohol from the Sirihala distillery in
April/May 1985.       The  timing  of  the  proposed  training  and  operational
support services will be matched to the construction and commissioning pro-
gram.   Initial production is scheduled  for 1%R,  and IQP6 would be the
first full year of anhydrous alcohol production.
E. Environmental Impact
4.19         There are at present no effluent treatment  facilities at the
Siribala and Dougabougou plants. All wastes from sugar and alcohol produc-
tion, and all surplus molasses are currently discharged into the cane field
irrigation water systems and into open fields. The proposed development of
alcohol production will eliminate molasses from the waste flows and hence
considerably reduce the environmental pollution load.
F. Raw Materials and Utilities
4.20         The expected molasses  production  from 19Q  onwards  is shown
below:
ON - Expected Molasses Production From 1986
Dougabougou       Sirihala         Total
Cane crushing capacity (tpd)                400             1,000          1,400
Operating days per year                     210               210            210
Capacity utilization (%)                     80                 IQ            s0
Cane crushed (tpy)                      67,200            168,000       235,200
Molasses Production (% of cane)             3.5                3,5          3.5
Molasses Production (tpy)                 2,352             5,880          8,232
4.21      The above estimates are conservative because the current molasses
yield at Siribala is about 3.9% of processed cane or about 11% higher than
assumed above, and the operating season could be extended by about 10 days
(5%).  The annual molasses production at Siribala, for example, could as a
result be as high as 6,700 tpy.   The low yield and utilization rate were
assumed to take into account Dougabougou's sluggish performance in recent
years.
4.22       Past operating statistics suggest that molasses yield and sucrose
content are relatively insensitive to declines in overall factory perform-
ance, although the sugar yields have declined primarily due to loss of
sucrose  to  bagasse  and  mechanical  causes.    Annual  molasses  production
depends on annual cane throughput, which in turn can be affected by cane
availability and factory down-time.   While cane supply has been generally
adequate, factory down-time has been increasing as performance deteriorated



- 25 -
especially at the Dougabougou factory.  The main cause of this loss of per-
formance is equipment wear and the difficulty of undertaking effective
maintenance as a result of the lack of spare parts and materials, and the
limited experience of operating and maintenance staff.  The Project provi-
sion of spare parts, staff training, and the introduction of adequate
systems of operation and maintenance would be essential to ensure that the
factories are operated efficiently, and future nolasses supply is adequate
for planned alcohol production.
4.23        Conventional cane-based sugar mills,  with annex distilleries,
such as Siribala and Dougabougou, generate all the steam and power they
require from bagasse-fired boilers. Energy requirements of these complexes
can be met by using about 90% of bagasse extracted from the cane pro-
cessed.  Chart 5 illustrates the energy production and usage in the exist-
ing Siribala sugar mill.   The quantities refer to an hourly throughput of
45 tons of cane containing 12.5% sucrose and 137 fiber.   Steam, generated
at a pressure of 25 bars,  is used first for power generation; the exhaust
from this, plus additional bypass steam, is reduced to 2 bars pressure for
subsequent process heating.  Approximately two-thirds of the process steam
(11.75 tons per hour) is used in the quadruple effect evaporator  section,
and a further 25% (4.5 tons per hour) in crystallization.  The balance is
used in juice heating operations which are each effected in two stages, the
second of which takes exhaust vapour from the evaporator section.   Steam
generation from the bagasse-fired boiler is shown as 26.6 tons per hour,
assuming 50% moisture in the bagasse and an average boiler steam generation
rate of 2.2 tons per ton of bagasse.   Similar  pro rata  performance  is
expected at Dougabougou.
4.24          The  expected  performance described above contrasts with the
reported operational experience which has required regular use of supple-
mentary petroleum fuel at both Dougabougou and Siribala. Several causes of
inefficiency  have  been  identified.    They  include  insufficient  steam
generation, excess imbihition of water, and inadequate heat transfer in
juice heaters, evaporators, and crystallization vessels.  Remedial actions
would involve stricter control of boiler and cane mill operations, water
usage, and improvement of maintenance procedures and general process
control.   The Project  provision of new instrumentation,  maintenance and
clearing equipment,  spare parts and materials,  as well as staff training
for operations  and  maintenance  aim  to  correct  these  causes  of  thermal
inefficiency.   As a result  of these measures,  the Siribala plant should
perform at or near the energy efficiency level shown in Chart 5, and so
generate sufficient  surplus steam for the distillery.   Similar  pro-rata
performance are expected from the Dougabougou plant.
4.25         In order to provide a margin of safety,  the distillery stean
supply  will  be  further  increased  by  modifying  the  plant  to  achieve
additional  thermal  economy.   The  energy efficiency of sugar  production
could be further improved by increasing the rate of water removal in the
evaporator section and by using the exhaust evaporator vapour to provide
the heat required for crystallization. Chart 6 shows the energy usage that
would result from the introduction of these modifications at Sirihala.  Tf
compared with the expected performance from the existing facilities shown
in Chart 5, it can be seen that total steam usage for sugar production
would be reduced frorm 17.6 to 16.0 tons per hour.  This saving of 1.6 tons

G.  Employment and Productivity
4.26          Since the Project basically  involves the modification and
improvement of the existing plants, the additional employment created will
be limited to about 200, consisting of additional workers to operate and
maintain the distilleries, and for additional loading, unloading, shipping,
and alcohol blending. After project completion, the labor productivity at
Siribala and Dougabougou is expected to increase significantly, partly as a
result of project training and technical assistance which are expected to
improve the two plants' operating and maintenance standards and their
energy efficiency.
V. PROJECT CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING
A. Capital Cost
5.01      The total financing requirements of the Project, including physi-
cal contingencies, price escalation, working capital, and interest during
construction are estimated at US$8.3 million equivalent (MF 5.4 billion),
including US$7.2 million in foreign exchange.   The capital cost estimates
are detailed in Annex 5 and summarized in the table on the following page.

5.02        Base costs were estimated in June 1983 prices.  The estimates
were prepared by consulting engineers working closely with ON staff and
revised by IDA staff at appraisal.   Local taxes and duties were excluded
from the estimates because Project expenditures wouldl be exempted. Physical
contingencies were calculated at 10% of base cost.   Price escalation for
foreign and local costs is based on projected increases in international US
dollar prices of 8% p.a. in 1983; 7.5%, in 1984; 7%, in 1985; and 6% p.a.,
in 1986 and onwards. The international rates have been used also for local
costs assuming that the difference between domestic and international price
inflation will be offset by adjustments in the foreign exchange rate in
accordance with Government policy.
5.03        About 40% of the Project cost, excluding working capital and
interest during construction, is estimated to be needed for alcohol produc-
tion, energy efficiency, and 'gasohol' blending and distribution; and the
remaining 60% for the technical assistance,  training,  and  study compo-
nents. Project costs include US$ 2.6 million for about 260 staff-months of
services by internationally recruited specialists.   The average cost of
these services is estimated at about US$10,500/staff-month, including
travel and subsistence cost.
B. Financing Plan
5.04     The proposed financing plan for the Project is as follows:
Financing Plan
(US$ million)
Local      Foreign      Total
IDA                  0.4          7.2         7.6
Office du Niger      0.2           -          0.2
Govt. of Mali        0.5           -          0.5
Total Financing    1.1           7.2         8.3
5.05      The proposed US$7.6 million IDA Credit would be extended to the
Mali Government on standard IDA terms.    The proceeds of the IDA Credit,
and the Government and ON equity contributions to Project expenditures
would be allocated according to the table on the following page.

Total Project Expenditures       8.3         100
5.06       The US$4.1 million equivalent loan from the Government to the
Alcohol Production Unit will be funded from proceeds of the IDA Credit.  ON
will use internally generated cash to finance local currency expenditures
equivalent to US$0.2 million during the first year of commercial opera-
tions.  ON's equity contribution to the Alcohol Production Unit will also
include the two distilleries and related assets (para 6.09).   The Govern-
ment equity contribution will finance interest during construction in local
currency and wil[L not involve the disbursement of cash.   The IDA Credit
would also finance the acquisition of blending facilities (US$0.1 million),
the Biomass Energy Study (US$0.1 million), and technical assistance for
agriculture (US$ 0.4 million), and for ON Rehabilitation (US$2.9 million).
The Government will acquire ownership title to the blending facilities at
the Bamako depot and will lease them to the owners of the Bamako depot.
Funds for the Biomass Energy Study Component would be allocated to the
ME budget, while funds for agricultural technical assistance and training
would be granted to Office du Niger.
5.07     The Government would onlend to Office du Niger, for the exclusive
benefit of the Alcohol Production Unit, US$4.1 million equivalent, for 13
years including 5 years of grace at an interest rate of 9% p.a., and a
commitment fee of 0.75% p.a. on the undisbursed portion of the amount. ON
will bear the foreign exchange risk.   The terms of the subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and ON were agreed to at negotiations, and
the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to IDA would be a
condition  of  Credit  effectiveness.    The  Government  will  enter  into  a
financial lease agreement with the owners of the Bamako depot.  The lessee
will be responsible for operating and maintaining the Project facilities.
The lease will expire in 12 years and lease instaLlments would be calcu-
lated to yield 13% p.a.  These terms were agreed at negotiations.  It was
further agreed that the lease agreement will be executed by January 31,
1984.

C. Procurement
5.08      Contracts for goods, civil works and construction, including the
necessary engineering for the Project's alcohol production and energy effi-
ciency components (paras 4.02-4.06) shall be separated into lots; the bid-
ders for such lots will be grouped under the overall responsibility of a
principal contractor who will ensure adequate coordination and efficient
execution of contracts covering detailed engineering construction, supply
of equipment, installation, and start-up of the modified plants (para
4.16). Contracts will be awarded following international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with IDA procedures, with a 7.5% and 15% margin of
preference for local contractors on civil works and local suppliers of
equipment, respectively.   The principal contractor will secure the appro-
priate equipment performance guarantees from the vendors. This contracting
arrangement would mitigate the risk of cost overruns, and minimize the
Project demand on ON's scarce management resources. Because the small size
of individual contracts would be unlikely to attract international competi-
tion, equipment for gasohol blending (para 4.07) will be procured in accor-
dance with local procedures, satisfactory to IDA. Vehicles, tools, office
equipment, and training materials for the technical assistance components
(paras 4.09, 4.10 and 4.13), estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equiva-
lent per contract, and in aggregate not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent,
may be procured through prudent shopping, after soliciting bids from at
least three reliable suppliers, in accordance with procedures satisfactory
to II)A.
D. Credit Allocation and Disbursements
5.09     Funds from the IDA Credit would be allocated as follows:
IDA Credit Allocation
US$ Thousand
(a)  Civil Works                                          300
(b)  Equipment, Materials and Spares                    2,500
(c)  Engineering Services                                 400
('d)  Technical Assistance, Training and Studies        2,650
(e)  Project Preparation Facility                        950
(f)  Unallocated                                         800
Total       7,600
5.10      Disbursements would be against 100% of foreign,and 95% of local
expenditures eligible for IDA financing in the above categories. Disburse-
ments will be fully documented.   The estimated schedule of disbursements
for the IDA Credit is given in the table on the following page.

II            0.3                7.6
The above disbursement schedule is based on the implementation schedule
presented in Chart 4, and on the investment cost allocation presented in
Annex 7-2. The disbursement profile for the Project differs from the stan-
dar(d profile for industrial projects as the proposed Project is a rehabili-
tation project, the extent of civil works and erection work involved is
limited, and the implementation period for this Project is considerably
less than for a greenfield industrial project. The Credit is expected to
be fully disbursed by December 31, 1986.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01     The financial analysis was done in current Malian Francs and the
major assumptions, detailed in Annex 6-1, are summarized in the following
paragraphs.
A. Production and Revenue Estimates
6.02     It is assumed that the Siribala distillery will start commercial
production of anhydrous alcohol in December 1985, 27 months after the engi-
neering and technical assistance contract for the alcohol production and
energy efficiency component is signed in September 1983. In 1986, at 90%
capacity utilization, the Siribala distillery is expected to produce
1,930,000 lpy of anhydrous ethanol by upgrading hydrated alcohol distilled
at Dougabougou and Siribala. This capacity build-up rate is considered
achievable considering the simple nature of the production process and that
hydrous alcohcol is already under production.
6.03     For the financial analysis, the ex-factory prices of fuel alcohol
were calculated to be equivalent to projected domestic prices of gasoline
after deducting the distributors' expenses and margins and the cost of
transporting the fuel alcohol from Siribala to Bamako. The future price of
gasoline was projected on the basis of expected international price move-
ments (para 502) adjusted to reflect inland transportation cost, as it is



- 34 -
the policy of the Mali Government to adjust periodically domestic prices of
petroleum products to reflect import costs (para 5.02); prices also reflect
projected price escalation rates.  The following table summarizes alcohol
prices ex-Siribala projected on the above basis.

B. Production Costs
6.04      Incremental production costs of anhydrous alcohol are summarized
in the following table:

6.05       Detailed production cost assumptions are given in Annex 6-1.
Usage of process chemicals was estimated by consulting engineers according
to recommended rates for the existing distilleries plus provision for the
'entraining' liquid to dehydrate the alcohol.   The average yield of anhy-
drous alcohol was conservatively estimated at 270 liters per ton of molas-
ses,  valued  at a transfer  price  of MF7,000  (US$10.80)  per ton.   The
transfer price used in this analysis is about 20% lower than the economic
opportunity cost of molasses (para. 7.07) to reflect the notion that actual
transportation costs exceed the international price of molasses (para



- 35 -
2.19), while recognizing that the Project would establish an opportunity
value for molasses. Depreciation of plant and equipment was provided by a
straight line method over the average expected useful life of 14 years.
referred charges, including Project expenditures in training and technical
assistance were also amortized over 14 years.

6.07        Incremental annual sales of alcohol are estimated at MF 811
million (US$1.3 million) in 1986 at 90% capacity utilization.  As a result
of real and nominal price increases, annual sales are projected to increase
to MF 1,136 million (US$1.8 million) in 1990, and to MF 1,732 million
(US$2.7 million) in 1995. Because of large interest payments at commercial
terms, return on equity would be moderate, though satisfactory, in the
initial years of operation, and will increase gradually as the debt is
amortized and interest payments decrease.   It is estimated that, over its
life, the Project would generate in excess of MF 14 billion (US$21.6
million) cash from operations, which would be available to amortize total
borrowings of about MF 2.6 billion (US$4.1 million). In addition to income
taxes, the excise tax on alcohol will be equivalent to the amount of taxes
and duties foregone on imported gasoline replaced by the alcohol.



- 36 -
6.08         Provision was made in the financial projections for working
capital adequate to sustain the seasonal inventory build-up of the Alcohol
Production Unit. In addition, in order to ensure its solvency in the event
of operational disruptions, liquidity has been provided in excess of long
term debt amortization requirements. A grace period of five years on long
term debt amortization, and the availability of commercial bank financing
of receivables and inventory, further reinforce confidence that the liquid-
ity of the Alcohol Production Unit will be adequate to meet financial as
well as operational requirements.
6.09      The Office du Niger will be the owner of the Alcohol Production
Unit. ON's paid-in capital will consist primarily of internally generated
cash for working capital, land, buildings, depreciated equipment and good-
will. The market value of those assets has been estimated in the financial
projections at MF 2.5 billion (US$3.9 million) and the paid in capital of
the Alcohol Production Unit has been credited with an equal amount. Based
on these assumptions and the projected drawdown of long term debt, the
financial leverage of the Alcohol Production Unit would increase to its
highest level in 1987 and then gradually decrease as the long term debt is
amortized and earnings from operations are retained. Long term debt would
be an acceptable 49% of total capitalization in 1987.
D. Financial Rate of Return
6.10       The cost and benefit streams for the Project financial rate of
return are shown in Annex 6-5. The financial rate of return, in real 1983
terms, was calculated at 20% before and 16% after taxes. In current terms,
it would be 27%, and 23% respectively. These returns are satisfactory and
can be explained largely because the Project involves production of high
value output--liquid fuel, by processing a low cost input--molasses--in two
plants which are now underutilized.
6.11         Results  of  the  sensitivity analysis  are  summarized  below:
Financial Rate of Return: Sensitivity Analysis
(%)
Before Taxes   After Taxes
Base Case                                        20             16
Sales Revenue down 10%                           17             14
Capital Cost up 10%                              18             15
Operating Costs up 10%                           19             15

6.12       The above sensitivity analysis shows that, even under adverse
circumstances, the Alcohol Production Unit would show a satisfactory finan-
cial rate of return.   If the Alcohol Production Unit did not pay for
molasses and process water to Office du Niger, the financial rate of return
before taxes would be significantly higher at 23% before taxes. These pay-
ments do not represent incremental cash costs to Office du Niger, therefore



- 37 -
they could be excluded in the calculation of 'real' financial returns.
Similarly, the projected income tax rate of 50% is substantially higher
than ON's  effective  income tax rate which  is less than 10%.   The high
income tax rate, therefore, contains an element of return to equity much
like the transfer payments for molasses and utilities.
E. Financial Covenants
6.13      Pending the legal resolution of Government's position as a credi-
tor and shareholder of ON, and considering the interdependence of sugar and
alcohol production, it would not be feasible to organize the Alcohol
Production Unit as a legally distinct subsidiary of ON.  However, in order
to define clearly management responsibility for this Project, and to ensure
that the entire sugar sector will have access to sufficient funds to enable
efficient operations, financial management of the Alcohol Production Unit
and of the Sugar Division would be completely independent within Office du
Niger. At negotiations, it was agreed that the Alcohol Production Unit and
the Sugar Division would have a separate bank account from ON, so that any
funds generated by the sale of alcohol and sugar will be used first for the
operation of the Sugar Division including the Alcohol Production Unit.
6.14        The Government  and Office  du Niger  agreed  that  the Alcohol
Production Unit will maintain (a) at all times (i) a debt/equity ratio of
no more than 55/45; (ii) a level of funded debt not exceeding US$4.5
million equivalent; and (b) starting on a date three months after
commencement of commercial production of alcohol under the Project; (i) a
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.5:1; and (ii)
working capital of at least US$500,000 equivalent.   Beginning no sooner
than 1988, ON is expected to pay for the Alcohol Production Unit income
taxes at the rate of 50% of net  income.   Government  financing of cost
overruns would be in the form of equity injections, if loan financing were
to cause a violation of any of the above financial covenants. The proposed
financial covenants are intentionally restrictive in order to assist ON in
its  institution-building  efforts.       The  covenants  relating  to  cash
management (para 6.13 and above) and other institutional arrangements will
be reviewed with the Borrower one year after Project completion and may be
amended  if  appropriate  to  reflect  ON's         financial  and  management
performance during Project implementation.
F. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
6.15      ON will be required to submit to IDA annual audited consolidated
financial statements and annual financial statements of the Sugar Division,
including the Alcohol Production Unit, certified by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year.   In
addition, the Sugar Division's financial controller (para 4.15) will submit
quarterly financial statements within four months of the end of each
quarter,   and  quarterly   project   progress   and   procurement   reports.
Assistance to carry out the above tasks would be provided by financial
consultants.   Finally, within six months after the closing date for the
Project, the Government will prepare and su'bmit to IDA a completion report
for the Project.

G. Risks
6.16     Risks associated with project technology, start-up, and operations
are not significant because  the  technology  is simple and  commercially
proven.    Blending,  distribution,  and marketing  of  'gasohol'  are also
unlikely to involve any significant risks because the alcohol content of
the blend would be very small and the consumers will find no perceptible
difference from gasoline.   Except for blending, which will involve the
introduction of additional storage and pumping equipment common in the oil
industry, there will be no change in physical facilities and operating
arrangements for marketing and distribution of gasohol. The oil companies
will handle gasohol in the Bamako area the same way they have been handling
regular gasoline. There is no foreseeable risk for this Project in connec-
tion with the future level of gasoline demand. Future increases in gaso-
line demand would cause the alcohol tenor of the blend to be lower; this
would have no adverse impact on the Project. Conversely, a drop in gaso-
line demand would cause the alcohol content of gasohol to increase. Since
gasohol containing up to 20% alcohol has been commercially proven to be a
viable gasoline substitute, there would be a market outlet for the entire
project production, even in the unlikely event that gasoline demand dropped
85% from the current level to about 10 million liters p.a..   Below this
level there would be some surplus alcohol production capacity.   However,
the probability that gasoline demand would drop by more than 80%, is negli-
gible.
6.17      Difficulties in attaining and maintaining the projected rate of
capacity utilization may arise.   The employment of an experienced and
established  engineering  firm and  the proposed  contracting  arrangements
(para 5.08) are designed to minimize these risks.  The firm would be res-
ponsible for engineering, supervision, and commissioning of the Project and
would  provide  technical assistance and training support throughout  the
first year of commercial operations.  The main risk facing this Project is
the possibility of delays in implementation and inadequate cost controls
due to management inexperience which could affect adversely the utilization
of  factory  capacity.    This  risk,  however,  will  be  reduced  with  the
strengthening of the operational and maintenance staff of the APU, the
improved management process for the sugar sector, the involvement of the
engineering firm, the contracting strategy adopted, and the understanding
reached that qualifications and experience of key project staff will meet
the positions' requirements. Moreover, the Project implementation schedule
takes into account, to the extent they can be foreseen, possible delays and
problems.   However,  management  and  institutional  matters  will  require
continuous monitoring by IDA to help avoid problems.  Regarding the RTF,
the risk is worth taking given the great improvement in the dialogue with
ON and the strong interest of other donors in supporting a program of
assistance to ON.

VII. ECONOMIC ANIALYSIS
A. Key Assumptions
7.01      The major assumptions used in the Project analysis are given in
Annex 7-1.  All economic benefits and costs for tradeable items have been
valued at international prices.   These prices were adjusted to reflect
economic transportation costs, as appropriate, and to reflect expected
movements of the world market prices of petroleum products, during the life
of the Project.   Non-tradeable items are valued at their financial costs
excluding taxes and duties and other transfer payments.
B. Economic Benefits
7.02     The principal economic benefit resulting from project investments
in incremental alcohol production and 'gasohol' blending and distribution
would   be the substitution of about two million liters annual gasoline
imports with an equal volume of locally-distilled anhydrous alcohol.   The
economic value of alcohol is assumed to be equal to that of the gasoline it
would replace on a volume basis.   'Gasohol' containing up to 20% alcohol
can be used to fuel existing gasoline engines without any modifications.
Cars obtain about the same mileage performance using 'gasohol' or gaso-
line.    Different  factors  including  octane  rating,  thermal  efficiency,
engine design and conditions individually affect mileage performance of
gasoline  and  'gasohol'  but,  in  practice,  they  offset  each  other.
Therefore,  the economic value  of alcohol  in a  'gasohol'  blend can be
assumed to be equivalent to that of the gasoline it replaces.  The economic
value  of regular gasoline  is estimated at US$0.49 per liter,  in 1983
terms.   This estimate reflects the cost of gasoline delivered to Bamako
ex-Abidjan,  which is the most economically available source of gasoline
supply to Mali.   Gasoline imports from Dakar would be cheaper than from
Abidjan,  mainly  because   rail   freight   is  less  costly   than  road
transportation.   The railroad from Dakar to Bamako, however, is used to
capacity for other petroleum products and virtually all gasoline imports
into Bamako originate from Abidjan.   In 1983 terms, the value of regular
gasoline is assumed to decrease slightly to US$0.46 per liter in 1984, then
to increase to US$0.49 per liter in 1985, and thereafter to increase at an
annual rate of about 3% p.a.   This projection is consistent with current
estimates of international petroleum prices. During 1983-85, petroleum
prices are expected to fluctuate around US'29 per barrel in 1983 terms, the
price prevailing in April 1983.  Prices are expected to remain weak in the
next few months for technical reasons if oil companies continue to draw
down their relatively high inventories. Long-term petroleum prices,
however, are bound to rise in real terms as a result of the underlying
market forces, mainly demand growth, limited opportunity for oil substitu-
tion, and limited scope for additional crude oil supplies.   After 1985,
prices are expected to increase again at a rate of more than 3% p.a. and to
reach about US$41 to 43 per barrel in 1995, in 1983 terms.
7.03        The main economic benefits of the Project energy efficiency
investments are the savings of industrial diesel oil that would otherwise
be needed to generate steam. It is estimated that, without project invest-
ments in the energy efficiency component, about 800,000 liters of this



- 40 -
imported fuel would be required each year to supplement bagasse for steam
and power generation at Siribala and Dougabougou. The present inefficiency
is caused by insufficient steam generation and recovery due to equipment
and operational problems. Project investments would correct these problems
and eliminate the need for supplementary fuel at Siribala and Dougabougou
during the cane crushing season.   The economic value of the energy effi-
ciency improvements resulting from this Project was calculated to be equi-
valent to the economic cost of industrial diesel fuel at factory gate.
This cost is US$0.39 per liter at Siribala in 1983. Similarly to gasoline,
the value was projected according to estimated international price move-
ments.
C. Economic Costs
7.04       All project costs net of taxes and duties were included in the
economic analysis except the cost of technical assistance and training for
agricultural field staff (para 4.10), the cost of the Biomass Energy study
(para 4.11), and the cost of the ON Rehabilitation Task Force (para 4.13).
About 57% of investment costs were allocated to alcohol production and 43%
to energy efficiency improvements.   The Project economic life was assumed
to be 14 years.
7.05      One of the most critical assumptions of this economic analysis is
the opportunity cost of molasses, the bas-Lc feedstock of the Project dis-
tillation process.   In Mali, molasses, the syrup remaining after sugar is
crystallized out of cane juice, is used to make small quantities of indus-
trial alcohol for the local market, but the bulk of it is disposed into the
fields.   In the developed countries, the principal use of molasses is to
feed farm animals.  The addition of urea and other non-protein nitrogen to
molasses enables the micro-organisms in the rumens of cattle and other
ruminants to synthesize their own protein from it; the animals digest the
bacteria and the protozoa.
7.06      The use of molasses as supplementary cattle feed, however, can
only be economically justified in a highly developed intensive livestock
production system. The market conditions and the extensive livestock pro-
duction practices prevailing in Mali would not currently justify economi-
cally the use of a high cost supplementary feed such as molasses on a large
scale.   The Office du Niger has been ope!rating pilot feedlot schemes at
Molodo and Dougabougou and has experimented with various animal feed
supplements including molasses. The preliminary conclusion of these expe-
riments is that livestock producers may be able to justify paying only
local transportation cost for molasses received at no cost from the sugar
mill. To operate at full capacity, these feedlots require only about 200
tons of molasses annually out of total production of about 8,200 tons.
About twice this amount, or 400 tons, would be available annually after the
Project needs have been met.   A cost benefit analysis for feed lots is
available in the Project File, Reference J.
7.07        Because of limited and uncertain domestic market outlets for
molasses, its opportunity value must be determined in terms of export
potential. Mali has not realized this potential for a number of technical
and market reasons, but the calculation of the economic opportunity cost of
molasses provides an objective, though- conservative, measure of the



- 41 -
economic justification of this project.  The opportunity cost of molasses
was calculated to be MF 8,300  (US$12.80) per ton ex-sugar mill.   This
value, which is slightly higher than that used in the financial analysis,
reflects marginal cost calculations and was obtained by projecting the long
term international molasses price and deducting all relevant ocean freight,
port handling, trans-shipment, and inland transportation costs. The inter-
national price of molasses was projected at US$105 per ton FOB Rotterdam in
1983 dollars, compared to the current price of about US$50/ton.   Details
are given in Annex 7-1 and the Project File, Reference G.
D. Economic Rate of Return
7.08      The Project's overall economic rate of return was calculated at
21%. The economic rate of return for t:he alcohol production component
alone was calculated at 20%; and for the energy efficiency component, at
22%.  These returns are satisfactory and lead to the conclusion that pro-
ject alcohol production using entirely renewable energy would be economi-
cally more attractive than using supplementary petroleum fuel.   Detailed
economic cost and benefit calculations are shown in Annex 7-2 and 7-3.
7.09      The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis
of the Project economic rate of return:
Rate of Return
Sensitivity AniaTysis
1.  Base Case                                21
2.  Capital Costs up 10%                     19
3.  Operating Costs up 10%                   20
4.  Alcohol Price down 10%                   18
5.  One year production delay                18
6.  Capacity Utilization down 10%            19
7.  Molasses at 0 cost                       24
8.  Combination of (2) and (5)               17
9.  Combination of (4) and (6)               16
7.10      The economic rate of return appears most sensitive to changes in
alcohol prices and delays in construction.   The probability of lower than
projected alcohol prices would be associated with lower gasoline prices
and  is  considered  low.    Construction  d(elays are always  possible,  but
the implementation schedule allows extra time for the most critical Project
activities to reflect expected difficulties of transportation and communi-
cation.
E. Other Benefits
7.11      The Project will also generate other benefits which have not been
quantified.    Because  of  the  process  interdependencies  among  alcohol,
molasses, bagasse and their upstream feedstock - sugarcane - it is expected
that sugar extraction efficiency will improve. Higher sugar yields can be
achieved through improved plant maintenance and operations which are
expected to result from project training and technical assistance.   The
surplus steam could be used for power generation.



- 42 -
7.12       The Project would also contribute to strengthen the Office du
Niger, its technical and managerial capacity.   This institution building
effort would complement Government programs to reorganize and strengthen
Office du Niger with Bank Group's assistance in the agricultural sector.
The Project provision of additional alcohol storage facilities at Bamako
and Siribala will increase the country's scarce strategic liquid fuel
storage capacity by about 17%. Finally the Biomass Energy Study component
would allow Mali to plan further development of alternative domestic energy
sources to lessen its dependence on imported petroleum products.
F.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
7.13      The foreign exchange benefits of this project will be substantial
because it will directly reduce Mali's import requirements of gasoline and
industrial diesel oil.  The present value of net foreign exchange savings
after deducting principal and interest payments on the external financing
and the foreign exchange portion of capital and operating costs is
estimated, at 10% opportunity cost of capital, to be about US$5.7 million
in 1983 terms, as shown in Annex 7-4.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01       Main matters discussed and agreed upon at negotiations are as
follows:
(a)  With the Government that it will:
(i)  enter into an agreement satisfactory to IDA with COD
regarding marketing and distribution of gasohol by
January 31, 1984 (para 4.08);
(ii)  employ   consultants   whose   terms   of   reference,
qualifications, and selection would be acceptable to
IDA (para 4.11); and
(iii) enter into a subsidiary lease agreement satisfactory to
IDA with the owners of the Bamako depot by January 31,
1984.
(b)  With Office du Niger that it will:
(i)  by  July  1,  1984,  establish  a  Sugar  Division  with
management and financial autonomy, including a separate
bank account (paras 3.14 and 4.15);
(ii) submit to IDA for approval a detailed staff training
program by January 31, 1984 (para 4.09);
(iii) employ consultants whose terms of reference, qualifica-
tions, and selection would be acceptable to IDA (paras
4.09, 4.10 and 4.13);



- 43 -
(iv) create a Rehabilitation Task Force with a work program
satisfactory to IDA by December 31, 1983 (para 4.12);
(v) cause the manager of the Sugar Division to submit to ON
Director for approval annual Operational Plans covering
Sugar operations (para 4.15);
(vi) comply with agreed financial covenants (para 6.14); and
(vii)  submit  Project  progress  reports  and  annual  audited
financial reports in the form and timing acceptable to
IDA (para 6.15).
8.02      The following would be conditions of Credit effectiveness:
(i) the establishment of an Alcohol Production Unit at
Office du Niger (para 4.15);
(ii) opening of a separate bank account into which ON would
deposit all revenues from the sale of sugar, sugar
by-products, and alcohol (paras 4.15 and 6.13); and
(iii)  execution of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory
to IDA between the Government and ON (para 5.07).
8.03         Subject to the above conditions,  the Project is considered
suitable for a Credit to Mali of US$7.6 million equivalent on standard IDA
terms.

Annex 1
Page 1
MALI - BIOMASS ALCOHOL AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE REPORT
Ethanol:                    Ethyl alcohol, or alcohol in common language.
Produced by fermentation of simple sugars
(glucose and sucrose); it can also be produced by
conversion of carbohydrates (starch) or
cellulose materials into simpler sugars followed
by fermentation. Fermentation in this context is
the process in which a particular strain of yeast
is introduced into the sugar base to convert it
into ethanol. Ethanol can also be produced
synthetically from certain chemical feedstocks.
Anhydrous:                  Dry, without any contained water in physical or
chemical combination. However, anhydrous ethanol
(also called absolute alcohol) usually contains
up to 1% water in physical combination.
Hydrous:                    Contains water in physical or chemical
combination. Hydrous ethanol (also called
rectified spirit) contains usually about 5%
water.
Entraining Liquid:          Agent such as benzene or cyclohexane which
enables the distillation to be extended to
produce anhydrous ethanol.
Gasohol:                    A blend of gasoline containing up to 20%
anhydrous ethanol. It can be used as automotive
fuel in conventional four stroke internal
combustion engines.
Denaturant:                 Additive to prevent or discourage use of product
other than intended. Methanol or fusel oil, for
example, are used to denature ethanol to make it
unfit for human consumption by imparting a
disagreeable odor to the ethanol.
Fusel Oil:                  Heavy, acrid, oilyr residue left after final
separation of ethanol from water.
Stillage:                   Residue left after initial concentration of
alcohol from fermented mash. Contains water,
fibrous and mineral matter.

Annex 1
Page 2
Combustion Efficiency:    Measure of the extent of thermal energy
(contained in the fuel) converted into useful
heat or work. In internal combustion engines,
efficiency depends on the extent of conversion of
fuel to work as affected by the temperature,
pressure, and amount of oxygen present in the
engine cylinder.

MALI - BIOMASS ALCOHOL AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR A STUDY TO ASSESS ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL
FOR PRODUCTION OF BIOMASS FUEL
A. Introduction
1.      The Government of Mali has requested the World Bank Group to
finance the first Biomass Alcohol and Energy Efficiency project in Mali.
This will involve utilization of surplus molasses, available at the
Siribala and Dougabougou sugar factories to produce anhydrous ethanol, for
blending with gasoline to produce gasohol fuel.
2.      The new Canal Costes, now nearing completion in the region adjacent
to these factories will make available additional irrigated land.
3.      The Ministry of Industry and Tourism is inviting proposals from
qualified consultants for a prefeasibility study to assess the technical,
financial, and economic viability of additional biomass fuel production.
This study would be part of the Biomass Alcohol and Energy Efficiency
Project mentioned above.
4.      This document presents preliminary proposals, outlining the
suggested scope of work.
B. Potential Crops aftd Products
i. Crops and products for fully irrigated land
5.      Previous assessment by Office du Niger has indicated that irrigated
land made available by Canal Costes would be suitable for annual production
of approximately 300,000 tons of sugar cane; this is more than twice the
current production utilized by the Siribala sugar factory.
6.      The existing local expertise in cane and sugar alcohol production
and the proposed introduction of gasohol fuel in Mali based upon ethanol
derived from cane molasses, make cane the obvious first choice fuel crop.
7.      If the total 300,000 tons of cane were used solely for fuel ethanol
the annual yield would be approximately 19 million litres. This is
approximately 10 times the proposed production from the surplus cane
molasses available at Siribala and Dougabougou, and would increase the
total fuel ethanol production to over 20 percent of the total current level
of gasoline consumption in Mali. Having regard to the existing gasoline
supply and distribution system, this would require significant investment
in blending facilities and possible introduction of modified vehicle
engines because of the high proportion of alcohol in the fuel blend.
Consideration would therefore need to be given to distribution of 'pure'
alcohol fuel to service the needs of a new population of alcohol fuel
engined vehicles, or to use if alcohol as a partial replacement for diesel
fuel.

Annex 4
Page 2
8.      However Mali is a net importer of sugar and, despite the high cost
of imported transport fuel, it is possible that it will be more attractive
to use the cane for sugar production and use only the residual molasses for
ethanol production (as proposed for the existing sugar factories). Used in
this way the crop would yield approximately 30,000 tons of sugar and a
little over 3 million litres of alcohol per year. This quantity of alcohol
could be more readily accommodated as an extension of the presently
proposed gasohol production and blending operations, the total percentage
of alcohol in the 'blended fuel being such as to not require modification of
vehicle engines.
9.      In either case, use of cane solely for production of alcohol or for
production of sugar and alcohol, it would be expected that the majority of
the by-product bagasse would be required for generation of steam and power
in the production processes. Any surplus bagasse would be considered as a
source of supplementary electricity generation as well as an alternative
source of liquid fuel.
ii. Crops and products from partially irrigated land
10.     The marginal land, receiving only partial irrigation, is unlikely
to be suitable for efficient cane production. Having regard to local
conditions and requirements it is suggested that the study should give
consideration to two alternative fuel crops in this land, cassava (manioc)
or wood.
11.     Cassava is an indigenous crop.  Extensive international research in
recent years has led to identification of more productive varieties and
appropriate cultivation and harvesting methods. It is known to be tolerant
of low water levels and would be expected to be suitable for production in
the areas in question.  Its fermentable content is produced in the form of
starch which must be converted to fermentable sugar prior to alcohol
production. Commercial production in Mali would need to be preceded by an
appropriate crop trials program and there may be need for some process
development work. However, the crop is widely perceived as an attractive
ethanol feedstock. The harvesting season normally extends over 9 to 10
months permitting a 275 to 300 day factory operating season. It is
possible that the processing operations could be combined with ethanol
production from cane or molasses by processing the fermentable liquor
obtained from cassava outside the cane crushing season.
12.     One disadvantageous feature of cassava is that the woody stalks are
unlikely to be produced in sufficient quantity to meet the total fuel
requirements of the production processes. On the other hand the cassava
roots are widely used as animal feed.  This could therefore provide an
alternative market for the crop which there is a strong local demand.
13.     Fuel wood production may be considered as a crop for charcoal
production, for which there is understood to be a large unsatisfied
demand. This is clearly a much lower value product than the et:hanol
transport fuel considered for the other crops, but may have have enhanced
value because of local needs.  It may also have value for steam and power



- 56 -
Annex 4
Page 3
generation to substitute for oil fired electricity generation and in this
location, could provide a valuable supplementary fuel sunply for local
sugar and alcohol production activities.
14.     Consideration would be given to suitable fast growing tree
varieties and large scale commercial production would need to he preceded
by appropriate trials work.
C. Scope of Work
15.     The scope of the study should be confined to consideration of the
following basic alternatives:
i.  Cane production on fully irrigated land to be used directly
for alcohol production or for sugar production with alcohol as
a by-product of the residual molasses.
ii. Cassava or wood production on partially irrigated land, the
former to be used for production of alcohol or as an animal
feed, the latter for charcoal production and to provide a
supplementary fuel for power generation or for sugar/alcohol
production.
16.     In view of the basic requirement for expansion of food production
in Mali, preliminary consideration should also be given to use of the land
for this purpose, so that a more complete assessment can he made of the
economic value of the fuel crops.  Sugar itself is of course a food crop.
However, preliminary information should also be presented concerning use of
the land for a staple grain crop.
17.     The study would be a prefeasibility study with the objective of
identifying whether there is a prima facie economic case which would
justify more detailed evaluation. In particular, the scope of work would
be as follows:
i. Agricultural aspects. The analysis will include:
a. Assessment of land preparation costs and the cost of
completion of the irrigation system.
b. Assessment of the land areas and the extent of irrigation
water supply in the fully and partially irrigated zones.
c. Assessment of the expected yield of the nominated fuel
crops and the cost of cultivation and harvesting.
Information concerning cane production activities within
the region. External information would bhe supplied
concerning the anticipated costs and yields for cassava
related to local conditions and the performance obtained
from existing crops. This approach would also be applied
for fuel wood production, consideration haing given to
species for which there was local experience and others
thought to be suitable for local conditions.



- 57 -
Annex 4
Page 4
d. Assessment of the production cost and yield of basic food
crops would be restricted to one or two staple grain crops
such as rice or millet.
ii. Fuel production
18.     Capital and operating costs for sugar and alcohol production
facilities would be prepared from available basic data and adjusted to
reflect conditions in Mali. Primary consideration would be given to basic
processing systems considered suitable for operation in Mali, assessment
being made of economies of scale associated with different sizes of
production unit within the limits of the expected scale of crop
production.. Similar information would be presented for charcoal
production..
19.     Operating costs would include provision for permanent and seasonal
manpower, process materials and services, maintenance and working capital,
etc. appropriate to an autonomous production unit. Allowance would also he
made for transport, storage and distribution costs. Particular
consideration would be given to process fuel requirements and to the
gainful disposal of principal by-products.
20.     Distinction will be drawn between local and foreign currency
expenditure.
iii. Product value
21.     With the possible exception of charcoal, fuel wood and animal feed
by-products, the main products (transport fuel, sugar and other food crops)
are import substitution products and it is proposed that they should be
evaluated in these terms.
22.     In relation to ethanol for use as gasoline dilutant, allowance
will be made for the additional cost of blending and distribution relative
to displaced gasoline, having regard also to the existing pattern of
gasoline usage and distribution.
23.     In the event of large scale ethanol production in excess of the
quantitites which can conveniently be used as a gasohol fuel, additional
information will be provided concerning the approximate cost and other
implications of using high percentage alcohol fuel blends (requiring
modificat:Lon to vehicle engines) and the potential use of ethanol in diesel
(compression ignition) engines.
24.     Other products will be valued in relation to existing market values
having regard to local demand and associated distribution costs.
iv. Economic evaluation
25.     The work is expected to lead to identification of a number of
alternative feasible development options or projects. Total capital and
operating cost and revenue statements will be.prepared for the key options

Page 5
and assessment made of the expected economic rate of return. Distinction
will be drawn between local and foreign currency elements.
26.     Additional information will be presented describing the resource
requirements and implications of the alternative development options and
assessment made of sensitivity of the analysis to variation in the basic
assumption which have been used. Recommendations will be made concerning
future action.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
BASIC ASSIUMPTIONS
A. Production and Sales
1.           Alcohol production will start with the 1985/86 cane crushing
season.   In 1985, annual incremental production of anhydrous alcohol will
be 162,000 liters; from 1986 onwards, it will be 1,930,000 liters,
corresponding to 90% utilization of the modified facilities.
2.        The following table shows projected alcohol prices:

a/  Retail price would be the same for gasoline, alcohol, and gasohol.
b/ Includes transport cost Siribala-Bamako.
c/ Calculated to be equivalent to taxes, duties, and levies on equivalent
volume of gasoline.
3.         The projected alcohol price is equal to the projected price of
gasoline    on a volume basis.  Distributors' margins, and taxes were also
calculated to be equivalent to those for gasoline on a volume basis.
The imported price of gasoline will decrease slightly from 1982 to 1984 in
real terms, increase again to the 1982 level in 1985, and grow at 2.9%
p.a.  in  real  terms  thereafter.        This  projection  reflects  current
projections  of  the  international  price  of  crude  oil,  adjusted  for
transportation and refining costs and margins. Price inflation was assumed
at 8% p.a. in 1983; 7.5%, in 1984; 7%, in 1985; and 6% p.a., thereafter.
B. Variable Production Costs
4.       In 1982 terms, variable production costs are assumed as follows:

Transport Dougabougou-Siribala                  1
Total        74
5.       Price escalation rates were assumed similarly to those described
para. 3 above. The technical parameters used in estimating variable
production costs
were as follows:
6.       Process Chemicals.  Usage was estimated according to recommended
rates for existing distilleries plus provision for the 'entraining' liquid
to dehydrate the alcohol. About 20 Kg of sulfuric acid would be required
1o distill 1,000 liters of alcohol; ammonium sulphate, 20 Kg; calcium
superphosphate, 10 Kg; antifoam agent, 1 liter; and cycloexane, 1 liter.
7.        Molasses.  The average yield of anhydrous alcohol will be 270
liters per ton of molasses. The Alcohol Production Unit will pay the sugar
mills a transfer price of MF 6,500 (US$10) per ton molasses.
8.      Supplementary Fuel.  Although it is anticipated that the sugar
mills will supply the distilleries with the required steam and power,
provision was made for approximately 15 day supply of industrial diesel oil
to fuel the distilleries in the event of temporary operational breakdowns.
The daily requirement would be about 4 tons of fuel at MF 432,000 per ton.
9.      Direct Labor.  Provision was made for three shifts of 15 workers
each for each distillery at a unit cost of MF 1,000 (US$1.54) per
worker/day including benefits.
10.     Process Water.  A transfer price of NF 195 (US$0.30) per m3 was
assumed.
11.     Transport.  The cost of transporting 400,000 liters annually of
hydrous alcohol from Dougabougou to Siribala was assumed at MF 6 (UTS$0.01)
per liter, according to prevailing market rates.
C. Fixed Costs
12.     Maintenance costs are estimated at MF12 million (US$18,000) p.a. in
1982 terms, and will increase in line with projected price escalation
rates. In 1985 this expense will be about 4% of the book value of net
fixed assets.
13.     Insurance was provided at MF 3-6 million (US$5,600) per year in
1982 terms, plus annual inflation.



-62-
Annex 6-1
Page 3 ot 3
14.     Salaries for the General Manager, the Financial Controller, the
Chemist and two storage operators were provided at MF 7 million (US$10,800)
per year in 1982 terms.
15.     Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation of Project plant and
equipment was provided by a straight line method over an average expected
useful life of 14 years. Deferred charges, including project expenditures
in training and technical assistance, and interest during construction were
amortized over 12 years. The residual value of project capital investments
would be 10% of the original cost.
16.     Debt Service.  The Alcohol Production Unit will require a loan of
MF 2,631 million (US$4.1 million) to finance project capital expenditures.
The loan will be drawn down in three years, and will be repaid in 16 equal
semi-annual installments, beginning two years after the last drawdown. The
interest rate will be 9% p.a. and the commitment fee 3/4 of 1% p.a. on the
undisbursed portion of the commitment. Interest during construction of MF
181 million (US$279,000) will be capitalized.
17.     Taxes and Levies.  Beginning in 1986, the Alcohol Production Unit
will pay income tax at the rate of 50%. Alcohol sales were projected net
of excise taxes which are assumed to be equivalent to taxes and duties on
imported gasoline.
D.      Working Capital
18.     While monthly sales will be constant throughout the year, working
capital requirements will experience seasonal variations because the
distilleries will operate only during the cane crushing season to maximize
use of available steam and power. Therefore it was assumed that the
Alcohol Production Unit would carry one month sales as receivables
throughout the year, but inventory would vary from two-month production at
the beginning of the cane crushing season to about eight-month at the end
of the season. The account 'cash required for operations' reflects the
need for seasonal inventory buildup. Transfer payments for molasses and
utilities would be on an open account and settled every 30 days.

a/   This cash surplus arises because the long-term debt amortization schedule was designed to
ensure debt service coverage of at least 1.5:1 at all times. In practice this cash could be used to
prepay long-term debt outstanding.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
BASIC ASSUMPTIONS
1.  Except as noted in this Annex the assumptions are those set out in
Annex 6-1.
2.  All prices are expressed in constant 1983 Mali Francs.
3.  Savings of industrial diesel oil are 134,400 liters in 1984 and 806,400
liters in 1985 and each year thereafter. The economic cost of
industrial diesel is calculated at MF 250 (US$0.39) per liter in 1984,
and MF 245 (US$0.41) per liter in 1985. It will then increase at 2.9%
p.a. in real terms.
4.  Capital costs exclude the study component, and interest during
construction. They were allocated to the Alcohol Production and Energy
Efficiency components as set out in Annex 7-2.
5.  The long term molasses price FOB Rotterdam was projected by using a
forecast model recently developed by Bank staff. The model is
documented in the Project File Reference G and forecasts molasses
prices as a function of corn and sugar prices. Using current
projections of corn and sugar prices the model predicts a long term
equilibrium price of molasses of US$105/ton FOB Rotterdam. The
following table s'hows the corresponding net back price ex-distillery:

Price ex-distillery                (2.89)        12.78
The economic price is higher than the financial price because a marginal
cost analysis has been applied to domestic transportation costs.
