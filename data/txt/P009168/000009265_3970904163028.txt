PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH AND NINTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 99O, 1143, 1377, and 1535-YU)
PREFACE
This report presents performance audits of the following four high-
way projects in Yugoslavia: Sixth Highway Project (Loan 990-lU of May 1974
for US$30 million); Seventh Highway Project (Loan 1143-YU of July 1975 for
US$40 million); Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU of March 1977 for US$56
million); and Ninth Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU of April 1978 for US$80
million). All four loans were fully disbursed as of August 31, 1983.
The report consists of a Project Performance Audit Memorandum
(PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and of three
Project Completion Reports for the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth, and Ninth
Projects respectively prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office.
The audit of these four projects has been combined to provide
insights into the evolution of the Bank's lending for highways in Yugoslavia
and to identify common patterns in the design and implementation of these
projects.
The PPAM is based on the PCRs for the four projects, discussions
with Bank staff, and discussions with Government officials and consultants,
in particular, concerning the Sixth Highway Project.   The assistance of
Yugoslav officials in this connection is gratefully acknowledged.  The tran-
script of the Executive Directors' meeting in which the various projects are
considered have been read and project files and documents have been reviewed.
The audit concurs with the principal findings of the PCRs and
shares many of their conclusions.   The audit, in addition, amplifies some
aspects of the discussion.
The audit was sent to the Yugoslav authorities for their comments.
Their reply is shown as an attachment to the PPAM.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH AND NINTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 990, 1143, 1377, and 1535-YU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The four projects under audit provided for the construction of
about 450 km of roads in Yugoslavia and for improvements in planning, design
and management of the country's highway system.   They cover most of the
second ten year period of a relationship between the Bank and the Yugoslav
highway authorities that has spanned some twenty years and still continues.
During those twenty years, road transport in Yugoslavia has been greatly
expanded and improved and the organization of the transport system has been
reformed in accordance with the country's self management principles.   The
four projects, though significant in size, were part of a much larger process
which reflected the basic dynamics of Yugoslavia's economy.
The roads included under the projects were designed and built by
Yugoslav forces. They were well built and for the most part completed within
specified target dates or earlier, although delays occurred in a few
instances.  The total costs in none of the four projects exceeded the esti-
mates in US dollar terms by more than 17% as the internal inflation was just
about compensated by the fall in the exchange rate.  However, the cost of
several of the individual road sections exceeded estimates significantly in
constant Yugoslav currency.
The rates of return on completion were in almost all cases at
acceptable or high levels.   Even though in most cases the traffic did not
reach levels projected at appraisal, vehicle operating cost savings increased
steeply and more than balanced the reduced traffic and the increases in conr-
struction costs.
Two of the projects provided finance for maintenance and other
specialized highway equipment and three projects included training for high-
way planning and the preparation of several highway master plans.   These
efforts effectively supported the improvement of Yugoslavia's highway author-
ities, particularly in the field of highway planning.   A railway costing
study and a highway user charges study were executed under one of the pro-
jects and provided data for review of pricing policies in the transport sec-
tor. The preparation of a major study on the main North-South trunk road of
Yugoslavia was made in connection with one of the projects and resulted in a
long term improvement program and the provision of loans for this program
from other foreign lenders. This project also resulted in the establishment
of a toll collection system and in the introduction of advanced design
traffic methods for multilane roads.
Although the four projects were generally well conceived and exe-
cuted, certain difficulties were experienced in the construction of some of
the roads.  The circumstances of these problems are not fully documented in



- ix -
the PCR or the files; however, questions are raised whether engineering pro-
cedures applied by the Yugoslav authorities could have been made more effec-
tive. Similarly, the question is raised whether additional attention on the
part of the Bank to the management aspects of Yugoslavia's highway system
would have been useful.
Over the years of the Bank's relationship with Yugoslavia's highway
sector, the Bank has had a dialogue with the Yugoslav authorities on trans-
port policy. This dialogue was greatly complicated by the program of decen-
tralization which was being implemented in Yugoslavia after the mid l960s and
the movement to institute self management which began in the mid 1970s.
These changes tended to accentuate modal and administrative boundaries. The
Bank's main concern was the promotion of a national and intermodal perspec-
tive in transport planning and management.   In the context of rapid and
thorough going political and managerial reorganization, the four highway pro-
jects under audit were not well suited vehicles for the promotion of the
Bank's policy dialogue.  Nievertheless, adaptations were made within these
constraints and the projects did make some, though limited, contributions to
the development of transport policy. Still, the experience under these pro-
jects also suggests that there are significant limitations in the use of pro-
ject lending for sectoral dialogue.



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
YUGOSLAVIA: SIXTH, SEVEx1TH, EIGHTH AND NINTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 990. 1143, 1377, and 1535-YU)
I. BACKGROUND
A.   Transport in General
1.        During the two decades 1960-1980 Yugoslavia's economy grew rapidly
and increasing economic activity and personal incomes led to a corresponding
growth in transport demand.   Between 1960 and 1980, total freight traffic
grew at about 6% annually and total passenger traffic by about 10 per year,
with the most rapid rise occurring in road transport, followed by waterways
and rail traffic.
2.        The  ris- in  transport  activity  also  entailed  an  increase in
transport investments. The Bank made major financial contributions to these
investments. In the 1960-1980 period it lent US$629 million equivalent for
highways and US$441 million equivalent for other transport projects, of which
nearly US$350 million was for railways.
3.        Thus by 1980, Yugoslavia had an extensive and diversified transport
system which was, hoi'ever, somewhat better developed in the northern than the
southern part of the country. It had 110,000 km of classified roads, 10,000
km of rail lines, 7 main ports and a sizeable network of inland and coastal
waterways.
B.   Highways and Highway Transport
4.        Roads and road transport were among the most rapidly growing ele-
ments  in the economy.   The classified networki/ expanded by more  than
one-third between 1960 and 1980, the length of paved roads went up sevenfold
to about 50,000 km and along some of the main arteries limited access, four
lane highways were built.   Total expenditures on roads also rose rapidly
during this period and maintenance expenditure per km of the classified net-
work increased from US$250 equivalent in 1960 to US$1,700 equivalent in 1980,
reflecting in part the greater percentage of paved roads in the system and
1/   The highway network is divided into three administrative classes:  Class
I roads comprise the European ("E") roads, and those connecting the
republics, provinces or important commercial and industrial centers;
Class II roads connect regions within the republics or the provinces;
and Class III roads serve communes within a region.



- 2 -
the higher costs of maintaining such roads.2/  The number of vehicles on
road increased correspondingly; thus passenger cars totalled 54,000 in 1960
and 2,500,000 in 1980.
5.        During this period the Government introduced major new institutions
for management of the economy. In the case of highways this entailed decenr-
tralization of the administration. In the years following 1967, the Federal
Government's role gradually became restricted to the international aspects of
road transport and the formulation of general policies and regulations conr-
cerning road safety, vehicle dimensions and axle loads. The main responsi-
bility for highway administration was vested in the six republics and two
autonomous provinces, each of whom established a Republican or Provincial
Road Organization (RO) or similar body. Each RO is governed by a Board on
which are represented members of various groups with an interest in roads
including the entities who build and maintain roads, transport companies,
industrial enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and road user organiza-
tions. The RO's have available to them the proceeds of certain taxes on fuel
and motor vehicles and contributions from various levels of government and
from external lenders.   Their activities are subject to coordination and
approval by the republican or provincial governing organs. Subsequent to the
mid-1970s, the RO's began to evolve further into Self Managed Communities of
Interest for Roads which are intended to reflect better the various interests
in the road sector.
6.        The day-to-day administration of the RO's is entrusted to smaller
Executive Boards who are elected from the membership of the Boards and who
are supported by a professional staff. In some of the republics, the engi-
neers formed institutes which acquired the functions of consulting firms in
other countries. Their members designed the highways and assisted the RO's
in carrying out construction supervision.   In other republics, the RO's
developed their own in-house capacity for design, laboratory work and super-
vision. The actual work of construction and maintenance is carried out by
separate enterprises who contract for the work with the RO's and operate with
a high degree of worker participation in their management. The enterprises
through their representatives on the RO Boards exercise some iniluence on the
administration of the RO's.
C.   Bank Lending for Highways in Yugoslavia
7.        The Bank approved eleven highways loans for Yugoslavia during the
period 1963-1980 (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Three of these have already
been audited, the Third (Report No. 1385 of December 10, 1976), the Fourth
(Report No. 1632 of June 15, 1977), and the Fifth (Report No. 2465 of April
11, 1979). Starting with the third loan, there was considerable time overlap
among the loans and loans were processed at short intervals.   Frequently
2/   The cost of maintaining roads varies also with the level of traffic;
unpaved roads with very heavy traffic may cost more to maintain than
paved roads with light traffic; however at equivocally optimum traffic
levels unpaved roads have lower maintenance costs than paved roads.



three or four projects were being implemented concurrently. Regional staff
believe this flow of projects represents a cost effective means of providing
Bank assistance to Yugoslavia's highway system. The audit is not in a posi-
tion to determine whether this lending scheme, with its frequent appraisals
and concurrent supervision requirements, made optimal use of the Bank's staff
resources. The scheme has had the virtue of keeping implementation periods
relatively short (around five years) and maintaining a reasonably clear
correspondence between the project as appraised and as executed. This series
of projecis suggests that an analysis would be useful to examine the trade-
offs (in terms of effective use of the Bank's resources and effective
achievement of project objectives) between varying frequencies and sizes of
Bank operations.
8.        While the Bank made its first two highway loans to the Yugoslav
Investment Bank and the third, fourth and fifth loans to the Federal Govern-
ment, it has since dealt directly with various Republican or Provincial ROs.
The Bank thus has adapted itself to the increased decentralization of author-
ity in Yugoslavia while at the same time fostering agencies to *ioordinate
their activities at the national level.  Some choices have been available,
particularly in the later years, regarding the borroving and implementing
agencies with whom the Bank could be working. The files do not provide much
discussion on this point nor is the audit in a position to analyze it. The
audit limits itself to these observations:  the choices were greatly shaped
by Yugoslavia's constitutional and administrative system but nonetheless they
represented opportunities for the Bank in modulating and making more effec-
tive its contribution to institutional development in the highway sector.
9.        The projects predominantly reflected the work of Yugoslav techni-
cians. In view of the general technical competence of these technicans and
the Bank's policy to encourage use of domestic consultants, the contributions
of foreign consultants were quite circumscribed. While Bank staff contri-
buted significantly to project content and design, its role may have been
less marked than in some other countries.  These patterns are illustrated
below:
-    the Bank had limited participation in the identification and selec-
tion of project components. These components were generated by the
established administrative procedures of Yugoslavia which them-
selves reflected the dialogue with the Bank. Beyond that the Bank
in practice was limited either to accept or to reject the proposed
project components;
-    Yugoslav  consultants  prepared  the majority of the feasibility
studies and the engineering design and carried out all the super-
vision work.   The Bank did not participate in financing these
activities;
-    external consultants played little role in specific feasibility
studies and engineering design although they had a major impact on
highway feasibility studies by developing general guidelines and by



- 4 -
providing training.   They also participated in developing master
plans for highway network development in the republics and the
provinces and in a few special studies (road user charges, railway
costs);
-    international competitive bidding was applied throughout but, with
the exception of one foreign contractor in a joint venture under
the Fifth Highway Project, all construction works were executed by
Yugoslav  firms.    No  full  explanation  is  available  for  this
pattern;3/
-    tendering was managed mostly by the Yugoslav authorities but the
Bank monitored the bidding process closely throughout.
10.       The main objectives of lending were the major traffic arteries
although the Bank also participated in financing secondary and tertiary roads
in the less developed republics and provinces. New highway construction or
reconstruction to a higher standard were the principal types of works. Road
maintenance was generally thought to have been adequate, except in the early
years of the relationship and finance was not made available for this purpose
by the Bank except for the purchase of some specialized maintenance equip-
ment. Maintenance funds have become limited in very recent years but mostly
beyond the active period of the four projects under audit.
11.       The Bank projects maintained a fairly even spread in the location,
by administrative areas, of the works being financed, with some concentration
in the less developed regions of Yugoslavia. Up through the Ninth Project
each operation covered only a small number of works but the last two loans
which were for much larger amounts also included many more individual road
sections. The attached map, therefore, has only indicated the location of
works through the Ninth Project.
D. Policy Dialogue
12.       An  active  dialogue  on  transport  policy between  the Bank and
Yugoslavia has continued throughout the past two decades.  The Bank was of
the view that Yugoslavia at least until the later 1970s did not have an over-
all, clearly stated and defined transport policy.   Nevertheless, the Bank
concurred with the implicit policy of the Government that there should be
freedom of choice by transport users in selecting transport facilities, that
entry and competition among transport modes should be open and fair and that
the Government should equally require all modes to charge for their infra-
structure requirements.
3/ A similar pattern has been observed in several other Bank borrower
countries and the audit believes a review of the phenomenom would be
useful particularly in reference to the development of the local
construction industry.



13.       Since the mid-1970s the Yugoslav authorities have been entering
into several Social Agreements to better delineate the responsibilities of
various levels of government in the management of the transport sector.
According to these Social Agreements the principal objectives of the trans-
port sector are:
-    to build the transport infrastructure in support of other sectors;
-    to develop the various transport modes as an integrated network;
-    to open up less developed regions;
-    to provide adequate connections to neighboring countries; and
-    to rationalize energy use in transport and reduce the negative
effects of transport on the environment.
These principles are interpreted to encourage the development of rail and
water transport for long and medium distance hauls and of road for short
hauls.
14.       While  the  Bank  has  concurred  with  the  general  thrust  of
Yugoslavia's transport policy it has over the past two decades expressed con-
cerns about particular aspects of that policy. These were:
-    Coordination of investment.  The Bank identified significant prob-
lems in duplication of investments by various modes, such as ports,
and in the lack of consistent standards for the design of facili-
ties in the various republics and provinces.
-    Institutional development.  The Bank pointed to institutional weak-
nesses, particularly in regard to coordination, which grew out of
the decentralization process both in the coordinating organs at the
federal level and in the republic or province level units.
-    Cost recovery.  The Bank noted that road user charges resulted in
large trucks being undertaxed in relation to the costs they imposed
on the infrastructure and that railways were given Government sub-
sidies.
The Bank has contributed to the solution of these problems by studies, equip-
ment, training and other components in Bank projects. In particular, it has
fostered the development of the Community of Road Organizations (CRO) as a
coordinating instrument and a provider of technical standards and assis-
tance.   The Bank has also negotiated financial covenants in its loans
relating to improved cost recovery in the railways.   The results of the
policy dialogue have been improved investment analysis and strengthening of
Yugoslavia's transport institutions; while road user charges are currently
thought to be generally adequate, some subsidies continue to be paid to the
railways and will only be phased out in about seven years.



II. THE FOUR PROJECTS
A.  General
15.       The four projects under audit spanned a period of nearly ten years
from the middle of 1974 to the end of 1983. They covered road construction
in all but one (Vojvodina) of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous
provinces.   They included finance for several sections of the Trans Yugo-
slavia Highway (TYR), the main North-South road of the country and chief
route for transit traffic from Western Europe to the lower Balkans and the
Near East. Studies under the Seventh Project for the preparation of a high-
way development master plan in the Province of Vojvodina and in the Eighth
Project for the preparation of a highway development master plan in the
Province of Kosovo laid the basis for the more programmatic lending technique
adopted in the Tenth Project. Each of the projects also included institu-
tional development components such as training in economic analysis and
laboratory and field equipment for vehicle weight control and highway
safety. The critical dates for the implementation of these four projects are
summarized in Table 1 along with the seven other highway projects in
Yugoslavia and are presented in graphic form in the attached chart. Tables 2
through 5 summarize the critical dates and principal cost data for the con-
struction components of the four projects under audit.
B.   The Sixth Project
16.       The main thrust of the project was constructing 150.8 km of roads
in Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina which was the Borrower under that Project.
Civil works started promptly following the signature of the Loan Agreement,
and all sections were completed well within times specified at appraisal,
with the exception of the Mesici-Ustipraca section that was completed four
months behind forecasts. During project implementation, the alignment had to
be changed on the Gornji Vakuf - Prozor and the Doboj - Tuzla sections under
pressure from communities which felt bypassed by the original plans.  This
incident illustrates that despite thorough decentralization policies, the
necessary plaiming concensus was not automatically achieved and demonstrates
that effective road planning still required detailed consultation with the
affected communities.i4/
17.       The actual construction costs for this project exceeded appraisal
estimates; the 21% price variation was within the 25% price contingency pro-
vided at appraisal but the 33% average quantity variation considerably
4/ To prevent experiences of this nature, Yugosalvia in 1976 introduced a
law for improved public participation in road planning decisions. The
Self Managing Communities of Interest also are intended to help solve
problems  of  this  nature.    These  efforts have helped  improve  the
coordination of highway planning with larger social concerns but the
continuance of some problems demonstrates the complexities of these
problems (see para. 30 below).



-7-
exceeded the 10% provision made at appraisal.   This degree of variation
points to the need for additional engineering analysis before bidding docur
ments are prepared.
18.       The rates of return on the road sections show considerable vari-
ations from those calculated at appraisal. The sizeable overrun in construc-
tion costs was apparently counterbalanced by increased traffic benefits
(increased traffic and increased vehicle operating cost savings as compared
to appraisal estimates) in some instances but not in others. One road repre-
senting about a quarter of the final costs had an ER of less than 10% but all
others exceeded that level.
19.       The loan also provided for the supply of engineering and laboratory
equipment and for training to be used by all the republics and provinces in
Yugoslavia. The bulk of the equipment was delivered as scheduled, although
certain changes in orders and additional procurements were completed only in
mid-1978. The training program was successful although it had to be adapted
to the background of the available candidates. The original program, which
was agreed at appraisal and whereby 12 candidates were to have been sent to
the U.S.A. and Europe on 14-month courses in transportation economics, could
not be implemented because of lack of candidates. Only a few of the econo-
mist candidates spoke fluently the language of their country of destination
in the training program and others were not prepared to accept long term
foreign assignments. All together, about 19 planners, engineers and econo-
mists received short term training in foreign countries. To deal with the
language and long term assignment problems, courses and seminars were orga-
nized in Yugoslavia and 152 candidates took advantage of these opportuni-
ties. CRO promoted and organized this program with the help of a German con-
sulting firm.   Experts were invited from Switzerland, Austria and Sweden.
The World Bank's Economic Development Institute delivered a seminar on
Preparation, Assessment and Management of Highway Projects in October 1978 in
Zagreb, Yugoslavia. An important contribution to the success of this seminar
was due to interpreters making simultaneous translations of foreign
speakers. The training programs under subsequent projects took advantage of
this lesson.
C.   The Seventh Project
20.       The Seventh Project financed the construction of 90.3 km of roads,
including one section of the TYH in Slovenia, two sections of the TYH in
Serbia and a road in Montenegro to stimulate regional development.   The
Seventh Project elaborated the system whereby CRO coordinated the preparation
of bidding documents and the process of international competitive bidding.
21.       While three of the roads were completed at a cost close to apprai-
sal estimates, with contingencies, two others had large overruns. The files
do not provide a precise estimate of the extent to which the overrun is
attributable to prices and to quantity variations but it is clear that in one
case (Dolgi-Most - Vrhnika) unanticipated soils problems added to the costs
while in the other (Titograd - Danilovgrad) the road had to be redesigned
because of a large underestimate of costs. In the first case, the final cost



- 8-
was 62% over the appraisal estimate including all contingencies (10% physical
and 32% price) and in the second it was 40% over that estimate.  The actual
rise in producer prices between 1976 and 1979 was 34% almost exactly as pro-
jected at appraisal.  The extra costs are thus most likely due to quantity
variations. Weaknesses in the Yugoslav engineering work may also be inferred
from the fact that for the project as a whole, bid prices exceeded base esti-
mates by an average of 29%.
22.       Despite the cost increases, the ER for the project remains high.
Vehicle operating cost savings rose steeply in the project period due to
higher fuel costs and highe; prices for vehicles and spares.  These increases
were large enough to outweigh a considerable shortfall in actual traffic from
the level projected at appraisal (nearly one-half in one case).
23.       The major institutional effort of the Seventh Project was the
introduction throughout Yugoslavia of the guidelines for highway planning and
feasibility studies which were prepared under the Fifth Project.  A large
training program was coordinated by CR0 assisted by German consultants,
with particular emphasis being placed on transportation economics.  As a
result of this training highway planning and planning studies have been
greatly strengthened in all Yugoslav highway agencies. Two other consulting
studies were financed under this project by German consultants to prepare
noise protection for the Ljubljana Ring Road (which became an element of the
Ninth Project) and by French consultants to prepare a Highway Development
Master Plan for the Province of Vojvodina (which became an element of the
Tenth Project).
D.  The Eighth Project
24.       The project covered the construction of about 133 km of roads in
three reoublics and one province, including about 80 km of the TYH in Serbia
and Macedonia. Most of the construction was finished on or before the dates
specified in the appraisal report. However, the work in Kosovo was delayed
by up to 20 months beyond that schedule. Delays against contractual comple-
tion dates were somewhat greater.
25.       While the overall cost of construction was only 13% over the
appraisal estimate, with all contingencies, two of the items had very large
variations from the estimates.  One of these is the Miladonovci - Petrovec
section of the TYR in Macedonia, also known as the Skopje Bypass. This sec-
tion was built across marshy terrain and large additional quantities resulted
during construction of this road.   Additional costs also were incurred on
this road due to redesign, after appraisal and bidding, from a two-lane to
four-lane configuration. The Pristina urban road overran the estimate with
all contingencies by 64%.  The circumstances of this overrun are not known
but the value of the project element is quite small.
26.        The Serbian road's final cost was 23% over the appraisal estimate
with all contingencies.  Design changes were made after bid evaluation rais-
ing the contract base price to Dinars 945 million.  If this price is esca-
lated by the industrial goods index, which rose from 117 in 1977 to 142 in



1979, the final price would be about Dinars 1,237 million as against an
actual cost of Dinars 1,427 million.   This suggests a quantity overrun of
about 15%.   However, in several other instances the bid prices were very
close to the base estimate and the final costs were within 10% of the esti-
mate including all contingencies.
27.       The reestimated ER for the Eighth Project as a whole was almost the
same as at appraisal. Individual elements had both higher and lower reesti-
mates. Actual traffic was generally below forecasts by as much as one-third
although the relatively low volume facility in Kosovo somewhat exceeded the
projected ADT of 515. As in the Seventh Project, the rise in vehicle operat-
ing cost savings more than counterbalanced the reduced volumes of traffic.
28.       The  policy  and  institutional  elements  of  the  Eighth  Project
included a Road User Charges Study, a Rail Costs Study and a Highway Develop-
ment Master Plan for the Province of Kosovo.   The Road User Charges Study
started in late 1977 and was to be completed by the end of 1978. A Yugoslav
institute was the main contractor, who subcontracted to a German firm and a
British firm for minor tasks. After some delays a version of this study with
recommendations became available in late 1979. Editing and translation prob-
lems of the final report delayed its publication until late 1982 when the
rapidly changing economic conditions rendered obsolete some of the analyses
and recommendations and rewriting and updating was necessary.   The updated
version was published in 1983 and, therefore, it is too early to assess the
impact of the study at this time other than noting that the delays in the
study significantly postponed what influence the study might have had on this
aspect of transport policy. The Rail Cost Study also got under way at the
end of 1977 and the same Yugoslav institute, with the same British firm as
subcontractor, did the work which called for cost finding and establishment
of a cost accounting system. The study was completed in 1979 and its find-
ings are currently being tested by the railways in Yugoslavia. The Guarantee
Agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic provided that the latter,
on or before June 30, 1979, would review the results of both studies with the
Bank and determine in agreement with the Bank which of its recommendations
would be implemented and how. The Highway Development Master Plan for Kosovo
was executed by a Yugoslav institute in association with a French consulting
firm.  The work was completed within the contractual deadline and provided
one of the bases for the Tenth Highway Project.
E.   The Ninth Project
29.       Construction under this project concentrated entirely on the TYH
and was based on a master plan study by CR0 of this road which identified a
15-year program of the highest priority works.   About 86 km were built in
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia and included toll facilities.
30.       The Slovenian section was completed only six months after appraisal
estimate on December 31, 1981, even though construction started a year late
after a major interchange was redesigned in response to complaints about



- 10 -
noise pollution from residents.5/  The Croatian section was completed one
year ahead of schedule in June 1980 but some additional undefined work for
this section was approved by the Bank in 1983. Most of the Serbian sections
were opened to traffic ahead of schedule although the final wearing course
was delayed by up to 18 months to allow consolidation of the subgrade and
stabilization of the soils.  The Nis Bypass was delayed by 31 months until
January 1982 due to an alignment change because of soils problems and due to
difficulties in construction of a bridge.
31.       The final cost of the project components exceeded appraisal esti-
mates, with contingencies, by an average of 67%. However, price contingerr-
cies prepared in 1978 ranged from 20 to 30% for completions from mid-1979 to
mid-1981 whereas the actual increase in prices between mid-1978 and mid-1981
was of the order of 92%.  Tlhis would point to significant quantity savings
having been made in the face of inflation. On the other hand the bid price
in the case of Pojate - Deligrad in Serbia was 52% over the estimate at a
time when prices were rising at less than 20% annually. The roads in Croatia
were bid in at only 22% over the base estimate but additional work is being
executed there and there appears to be some uncertainty as to the final cost.
32.       The audit is thus unable to establish whether the costs of the pro-
ject, in constant terms, conformed to the engineering estimates. The project
as finally built appears to be providing roughly the same facilities as des-
cribed at appraisal.  However, major redesigns were required due to problems
-Aith soil mechanics in one case, and soils problems in another case required
a significant delay in the final surfacing of a road.  The design of the
Ljubljana Bypass also was r vised due to incomplete coordination with the
affected residents.
33.       Except for the Nis Bypass all roads had less traffic than forecast
(by roughly one-fourth to one-third); in the case of the Nis Bypass there was
a one-third overestimate of trucks using this road.  As in the other three
projects under audit, the vehicle operating cost savings rose very fast dur-
ing the project period. For the roads in Slovenia and Croatia the combined
interaction of the traffic and vehicle operating cost parameters was a signi-
ficant drop In the ERR from 33 and 301 to 20 and 20% respectively. The two
Serbian roads had greatly increased ERRs of 40 and 100% suggesting that there
may be scope for further improvement works on those sections or that the
improvements should have been undertaken earlier.
34.       The project included the acquisition of maintenance and vehicle
load control equipment for several republics and provinces.  Although this
effort was coordinated by CRO, purchasing and delivery were slow due to dis-
agreement on the equipment to be procured and its distribution and due to
tightened import controls.  As in the case of the Sixth Project which also
included an element for equipment procurement, the files do not provide
details on the manner in which the procured equipment is being used. How-
ever, the equipment is intended to strengthen the institutional framework for
5/   See footnote 3 to paragraph 16.



- 1]. -
the control of vehicle weights on the roads, improved road maintenance and
better road safety.
35.       While not included in the Description of the Project,  several
activities associated with the Project made important contributions to the
development of the Yugoslav road system. These included:
(a) the preparation of an overall framework for the TYH which laid the
basis for the involvement of other external lenders in the future
improvement of that road;
(b) the design of roads with complex grade separations and interchanges
which helped strengthen the local capacity for this type of work;
and
(c) the introduction of tolls on the roads built under the project in a
manner to ensure continued economic use of the roads, thereby
establishing a basis for the wider introduction of toll systems in
the country.
Each of these activities also contributed to further development of Bank
lending for highways in subsequent projects.
III. POINTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
36.       The four projects thus provided for the construction of about 450
km of roads in Yugoslavia and for improvements in planning, design, and
management of the country's highway system. These accomplishments represent
significant contributions to a much larger process of expansion and improve-
ment that occurred in the system.  In the five years between 1975 and 1980
the number of paved roads increased by over 11,000 km and the number of
passenger cars rose from 1.5 to 2.5 million units.
37.       A process of this extent and complexity is obviously shaped by many
forces, most importantly the dynamics of Yugoslavia's own economy. The impe-
tus for the program clearly came from the country itself and the Bank
responded flexibly and ingeniously to facilitate the execution of the pro-
gram. It would be difficult under these circumstances to specify precisely
how the Bank's contribution affected the overall result or how it might have
been reshaped or amended.    Judgements of  this nature are particularly
troublesome due to the limited resources which the Bank had available for the
management of these projects.   Nevertheless, the audit believes that two
aspects of these projects could usefully have received greater attention or
changed emphasis, the engineering work and the policy dialogue.
A. Engineering and Management
38.       As early as the appraisal of the First Highway Project, the Bank
described the system whereby engineering work was generally awarded to engi-
neering enterprises which acted as consultants to the road building agency



- 12 -
and prepared plans to a high technical standard. Supervision of construction
was carried out by another organization working in close liaison with the
design enterprises.   Design and supervision was at that time estimated to
cost about 4Z of construction costs.   With some modification  the Bank
accepted the same basic system for engineering work on the four projects
under audit.   The designs were prepared by Yugoslav engineering firms and
institutes or by various roads organizations with the assistance of such
firms and institutes. Supervision was done by the roads organizations simi-
larly assisted. In all cases the work was described by the Bank's reports as
satisfactory and those carrying it out as competent.
39.       In none of the four projects is there an estimate of the cost of
the engineering work which, according to a footnote in the Eighth Project
Appraisal Report, are costs wholly borne by the Government.  It is not pos-
sible to determine whether engineering costs were included in the calculation
of the ER (either at appraisal or completion)6/ but with the generally high
returns on these roads such an omission, if it occurred, would not have much
effect on the outcome. The absence of this information does, however, make
more difficult any analysis as to whether the amount of engineering was
appropriate to the job and whether additional effort might have been useful.
40.       Questions of this sort become particularly germane in the light of
some  of  the  difficulties  experienced  under  the four  projects.    While
generally the roads were built well and expeditiously, significant quantity
variations occurred in the Sixth Project.   Quantity variations were not
recorded in the other three projects but overruns could be inferred to have
happened in several of the roads which were included in those projects. It
would have been useful if the .roject records had routinely generated
information on contract quantities and if the circumstances had been illumi-
nated which led to the need to redesign the Dolgi Most - Vrhnika road under
the Seventh Project, Skopje Bypass under the Eighth Project, and the Nis
Bypass under the Ninth.
41.       More generally, the question is raised whether the engineering pro-
cedures applied by the Yugoslav authorities could possibly have been made
mere effective and, to the extent that such procedures still apply, the ques-
tion is also raised with respect to the present practice. Perhaps the amount
of money spent on engineering investigations could profitably have been
increased (the audit found references to some tests such as seive analysis,
water content, and Atterberg limits but not others such as triaxial sheer
strength and consolidation and extensive programs of deep borings); pe.-haps
the time allowed to complete the work was not always long enough (in one case
only a month was allowed to complete detailed engineering of a 6 km four-lane
road); perhaps the process of review needed to have been expanded. Similar-
ly, the process for site surveillance and progress reporting could possibly
have been improved to make the application of engineering experti6e promptly
available as problems arise and to provide quickly significant data to
managers of the program.
6/ There is a similar uncertainty regarding land costs.



- 13 -
42.       The Bank may also wish to review the reports which are made to it
under the Yugoslav road projects and, more generally, how the Bank supervises
the projects.   A reading by the audit of a sample of reports indicates a
broad range in their coverage and quality.   The reports may in some cases
provide more information than the Bank needs; in other cases, the Bank may
even wish to dispense with some of the reports and rely on summaries by
intermediary agencies.   In regard to its own supervision, perhaps the Bank
needs to be relieved of some of the burden of site visits and to entrust this
work to others who would prepare reports for the Bank. However, the Region
believes this work should not be delegated to others. (The PCR observed that
significant changes in the design of one road only came to light when a Bank
staff member visited the site.)   Finally, the Bank may need to consider
whether the staff it has had available to look after a series of complex road
projects in Yugoslavia is large enough and whether the needs of this program
would be better served by expenditure of more staff resources. Perhaps also
the Bank'3 supervisory effort needs to have available a broad variety of
engineering expertise to be able to respond more precisely to specific prob-
lems as they arise.   The Region notes that staffing was within the Bank's
parameters and that the Bank could and did provide special expertise by
employing consultants for specific purposes.
43.       The audit also notes that under the four projects being audited,
the major thrust of technical assistance was in the areas of highway planning
and  feasibility  studies.    Relatively  less  attention was  given  to  the
training of managers and supervisory engineers who were making key contribu-
tions in executing greatly enlarged highway construction and maintenance pro-
grams.  Highway management problems assumed added complexity with the conr-
tinued devolution of authority to self managed communities of interests and
would require restructuring of the management functions. Under these circum-
stances, more attention in the Bank's projects to engineering and managerial
matters may have been desirable. The Region notes, however, that there is no
evidence that by the mid 1970s that either management or engineering abili-
ties represented significant problems in the Yugoslav highway organizations.
B.   Sectoral Dialogue
44.       Each of the four projects made some, though limited, contributions
to the aialogue between the Bank and Yugoslavia on the country's transport
sector. Those contributions were in the main in the form of studies, plans,
technical assistance and training.  The four agreements contained few cove-
nants concerning sectoral policies beyond standard provisions on road mainte-
nance, traffic counting and vehicle weight control.  The covenant under the
Eighth Project Guarantee Agreement concerning implementation of the Rail
Costing and Road User Charges Studies is being implemented, though slowly, in
the case of the former study.   The latter study has only recently been
completed.
45.       In using the four projects for its policy dialogue, the Bank had to
work in the available institutional framework and this imposed important conr-
straints on the dialogue.  When it included planning studies for Vojvodina
and Kosovo in two of these projects, the studies were limited to the highway



- 14 -
subsector which had institutions for resolving planning issues, not to the
transport sector which still was developing them. These planning studies did
include analyses of the role of highway investments in relation to other
modes of transport and thus provided analyses of other modes and models for
more comprehensive planning. Similarly, a study of the TYH which CRO made at
the Bank's suggestion and completed in early 1978 reviewed all transport
modes in the corridor when analyzing proposals for improvement of the TYH.
These efforts influenced and presumably improved the decisions on the highway
subsector though they did not directly affe-;t the other modes. As this sub-
sector was the most active mode and had the largest investment program, its
attention to intermodal concerns had special significance.
46.       The dialogue was greatly complicated by the program of governmental
and social reorganization which was occurring in Yugoslavia throughout the
time of the four projects. This program followed upon the decentralization
of road functions in the late 1960s and early 1970s to ROs in the republics
and autonomous provinces and entailed the establishment of self management
principles in all aspects of road operations, in parallel to other sectors of
the economy.  The consequences of self management, which spread throughout
the road sector and gradually replaced the ROs, were increased representation
of user interests in decisions regarding the road system, increased weight cf
lay, elected and political as opposed to professional, appointed and bureau-
cratic personnel in such decisions and a further decentralization as the
lower levels of the organization gained a greater role in management pro-
cess. All these developments also tended to accentuate modal and geographi-
cal and administrative boundaries. The effects of decentralization and self
management were especially noticeable in a country which previously did not
have a well coordinated transport system, which never had an overall trans-
port survey and which had a long history of local rivalry in the planning of
transport investments.
47.       The four projects, each directed to the road sector, thus became
rather ill-suited vehicles to promote the chief concerns of the policy dia-
logue which were the promotion of a national and intermodal perspective in
the planning of transport investments and in the management of the transport
sector. The Bank could only make limited progress in promoting the estab-
lishment of strong coordinating mechanisms when the Government was seeking to
create -grass roots  management.  Moreover, the nature of the dialogue was
inevitably affected by the fact that the Yugoslav managers were tending to be
less versed in the technical aspects of the road system at the same time as
the system was increasing in size and complexity.  The Bank provided only
limited help in the four projects under audit to strengthen the managerial
needs created by the spread of the self management program.
48.       In late 1976, the Government itself began to address the dilemma
created by decentralization and self management when it helped the gradual
creation of a transport policy by presiding over the negotiation of -Social
Agreements  among the constituent agencies of the transport sector.  These
were agreements to define objectives for the transport system, to establish
policy guidelines and to assign responsibilities to modal agencies. The Bank
encouraged this process through its general dialogue with the country. The
Bank's transportation staff also was able to identify crucial data gaps which
could be filled under the Bank's projects and provide the necessary basis for
resolving such intermodal issues as pricing. The Road User Charges and Rail



- 15 -
Costing Studies arose in this context.   Moreover, the identification of
costing systems and their introduction to the railways were to provide a con-
tinuous flow of such information for future discussions.
49.       The audit concludes that under the conditions when the four proj-
ects were appraised and put into effect, the scope was limited for using
those projects to implement Bank policy objectives in Yugoslavia's transport
sector.   The Bank's emphasis on formal coordination of investments and
policies through planning and management was difficult to implement when
intermodal organs were still evolving and when the Bank was mainly dealing
with modal agencies.
50.       The Bank could perhaps have redefined its objectives to more exclur
sive reliance on competition to achieve intermodal coordination; this would
have meant promoting much greater use of intermodal analysis by modal agen-
cies to guide their investments and the application of rigid financial cri-
teria in the allocation of investment funds.   Such a program might have
allowed greater use of the four highway loans in the Bank's policy dialogue
but might not  have been acceptable to the Yugoslav authorities.   More
generally, the audit concludes that, unless the Bank's policy objectives have
an appropriate fit to the parameters of a project loan, they will be diffi-
cult to promote with such a loan. As the Bank in its lending must deal with
established organs of the Government, the Bank also is inevitably limited in
the parameters which it may set for its loans and therefore in the use of its
project lending for furthering its policy dialogue.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 990-YU)
I. Introduction
1.01        Railways in Yugoslavia prior to 1965 were the predominant
carriers of freight and passengers as compared with road transport. Ten
years later, however, they only transported 42 percent of the total
freight and 18 percent of the total passenger load.
1.02        A steady program of road improvement and new construction
continued from the middle 1950s but from 1962 the pace increased. In
1958 there were some 5,000 km of paved roads but by 1972, 30,000 km of
bituminous-surfaced highways had been provided. However these efforts
were not sufficient to cater adequately to the increasing traffic and an
accelerated program was necessary.
1.03        The Bank assisted this expanding road construction and im-
provement program by lending US$150 million between 1963 and 1971 to
Yugoslavia for highway projects. In the last of these operations (Fifth
Highway Project, Loan 751-YU) a technical assistance element was included
aimed at institution building. The present project follows this trend.
It is intended that such lending should continue to assist with the
highway development needs of the country.
II. Project Preparation, Objectives and Contents
2.01        The project was identified in 1972.  It consisted of con-
struction of six road sections in Bosnia-Herzegovina (one of the lesser-
developed regions of Yugoslavia) totalling about 151 km to an improved
standard to accommodate heavy and fast-moving traffic, provision of staff
training for transportation economists and road engineers throughout
Yugoslavia and the provision of engineering and laboratory equipment for
various Republic and Provincial Road Organizations. The Republic Road
Community, Sarajevo, was responsible for the road construction element of
the project while the Council of Republican and Provincial Road Organiza-
tions, Ljubljana, administered the procurement of equipment and staff
training. The Council arranged actual procurement on behalf of the
various Road Organizations.
2.02        The highway sections form part of the Yugoslav "Middle-Term
Plan" (1971-1975) for highway improvement and are sections of major
routes the remaining lengths of which have already been upgraded to the
above standard. The detailed engineering had been completed at appraisal.
2.03        Engineering equipment had been supplied under the Fifth
Highway Project, but more items were required particularly for soil labo-
ratories and for photogrammetric mapping. Consequently, provision was
made in the Sixth Highway Project to provide these additional items toge-
ther with equipment to collect traffic data and check vehicle weights.

2.05        The training program was a continuation of a previous one
initiated under the Fifth Highway Project to assist transport economists
and other specialists throughout Yugoslavia to prepare highway feasi-
bility studies in accordance with uniform guidelines prepared by the Bank
and to update engineers in appropriate specialized subjects.
III. Project Implementation and Cost
A. General
3.01        The Loan became effective on December 10, 1974, and civil
works started immediately after the signing of the Loan Agreement on
May 31, 1974. Construction proceeded well and except for one section,
Mesici to Ustipracal/ where site conditions were difficult, work was
completed before the date envisaged at appraisal (See Annex 1).
3.02        The procurement of the engineering and laboratory equipment
was substantially completed by early 1978. Some further purchases were
made later, but all transactions were completed before the loan closing
date.
3.03        Staff training did not proceed as originally planned because
candidates could not be released from their normal duties to attend over-
seas courses of a prolonged nature. Indeed they were not prepared to be
separated from their families for long periods. Courses and seminars
were arranged to meet these restrictions, and training was completed to-
wards the end of 1978, a year later than estimated at appraisal.
B. Civil Works
3.04        Construction on the six sections of road started three weeks
after the Loan Agreement was signed on May 31, 1974. A schedule of the
sections is at Annex 1 and shows the name of contractor, length of sec-
tion and other relevant information.
3.05        The alignment selected for the Gornji Vakuf-Prozor section
bypassed Prozor, one of the poorest communities in the Republic. The
inhabitants were most concerned that the proposed alignment would detract
from their development and, under strong pressure from them, the Road
Fund changed the alignment to pass through Prozor. Unfortunately the
Bank was not informed of the change until construction was well underway.
After considerable correspondence the Bank agreed to the alignment change.
3.06        The Road Fund requested approval to change the alignment of
the Doboj-Tuzla road section between km 36 and km 49. The varian... was
more costly than the original route, but the community of Lukavac agreed
1/ Part of the link Rogatica-Ustipraca which was split for contractual
purposes into two sections, Rogatica-Mesici and Mesici-Ustipraca.



- 25 -
to pay the additional costs. The benefits of the change it could be
assumed outweighed the increased cost and the Bank approved the request.
3.07        Work progressed well and the Dalina Kosa-Kupres and Vranduk-
Zenica sections were completed ahead of the contract period.  The
Bosanski Novi-Prijedor, the Doboj-Orahovical/ and the Gornji Vakuf-
Prozor contracts were completed on time except the asphaltic concrete
surface course could not be completed by the time the rest of the work
was finished due to unsuitable weather conditions. The work was finally
finished by June 1976, some six to eight months after the completion
dates of the contracts. On the remaining sections progress was not so
well maintained. Heavy rain, flooding, difficult soil conditions and
land acquisition problems delayed work on the Orahovica-Tuzlal/ link,
and the contract was not completed until the end of September 1976, some
12 months behind schedule. In the case of the Rogatica-Mesici-Ustipraca
section, especially the Mesici-Ustipraca portion, where the terrain is
rugged and is as difficult for road construction as anywhere in the
Republic, the work was not completed until 17 months after the contract
completion date in the case of the Mesici-Ustipraca link and 6 months in
respect of the Rogatica-Mesici link. Added difficulties were encountered
during construction of the former section in that a narrow gauge railway
which shares the road route through the arduous river gorge section had
to be kept open to traffic during construction. This was not an easy
task in an area where land slides were prevalent. All sections, however,
were completed well within the appraisal estimate except for the Mesici-
Ustipraca section which overran by about four months.
C. Equipment
3.08        As stated in para. 3.02 all the equipment was procured with-
out any significant difficulties. It was obtained through international
competitive bidding; invitations to bid were advertised in April 1975
for the main batch of equipment and for the remainder in December 1977.
The equipment was issued to the various Republic and Provincial Road
Organizations as it arrived and put into use. Details of the procurement
and distribution of the equipment are set out in the Equipment Report
submitted by the Council of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations,
Ljubljana (Annex 2).
D. Staff Training
3.09        Some 19 candidates working in various highway organizations,
including those engaged on highway studies and research, attended courses
on a wide range of subjects including highway engineering and economics,
traffic engineering and highway financing. A further series of studies
was organized covering another range of highway engineering and admini-
stration related subjects whereby 152 candidates from all eight Republics
1/ The link Doboj-Tuzla evaluated in the SAR was split into two sections,
Doboj-Orahovica and Orahovica-Tuzla, for contractual purposes.



- 26 -
and Provincial Community of Road Organizations (CRO) received training.
The details of the training undertaken are set out in report from
Yugoslavia (Annex 2.)
E. Project Cost
3.10        The comparison of actual costs and appraisal estimates for
construction are shown in Annex 1. US$64.8 million equivalent was spent
as opposed to US$58.0 estimated at appraisal, an overrun of 11.7 percent.
The Bank loan provided US$28.6 million towards this total; the original
provision in the loan of US$24.0 million being augmented by transferring
the US$2.4 million in Category IV (Unallocated) to Category I to provide
the amount required. Additional works, including geometrical design
improvements, increased pavement strengths and realignment of some sec-
tions accounted for the increased costs.
3.11        The cost of training and providing the laboratory and engi-
neering equipment was contained within the appraisal estimates and the
details of the expenditures are set out in Annex 2.
3.12        The distribution of the loan funds by Republics is set out in
Annex 3.
F. Disbursements
3.13        It can be seen from the Schedule of Disbursements at Annex 4
that, from the beginning of the project in mid-1974 until the end of 1977
when the civil works had been completed, actual disbursements kept pace
with the appraisal estimate; in fact, up to September 1976 the rate was
far ahead of that estimated at appraisal. It was only from mid-1977 that
actual disbursements lagged slightly behind the appraisal forecast being
some US$1.4 million behind at that date (5 percent) and continuing behind
until the Loan was closed on June 30, 1979, when US$1,746 remained undis-
bursed. This balance was canceled in mid-1980 in order to close the
books.
IV. Institutional and Operational Development
4.01        The objectives of the project were achieved, namely to assist
the improvement of highway facilities and to foster institutional devel-
opment in the sub-sector. One hundred and fifty (150) km of road in one
of the lesser-developed regions of Yugoslavia was constructed capable of
accommodating heavy and fast-moving traffic and replacing old construc-
tion inadequate for present-day needs. Equipment was provided to improve
soil laboratory, photogrammetric mapping, motor vehicle weight control
and traffic data collection facilities in the highways departments
throughout Yugoslavia. Courses were held for engineers in various spe-
cialized fields, economists and a few engineers were trained in transpor-
tation subjects and the preparation of feasibility studies, and other
staff working in highway departments were given appropriate training in a



- 27 -
series of courses and seminars arranged in a number of European countries
and the United States. The decision to continue the arrangement adopted
in previous Bank-financed highway projects in Yugoslavia for supervision
of civil works by using Road Fund (as the Republic Community of Roads was
then called) staff assisted by university personnel was satisfactory and
provided further training and enhanced the experience of Yugoslav person-
nel in these fields.
V. Economic Justification
5.01        Estimates of traffic made during appraisal have so far proved
conservative on all but two of the road sections (see Annex 5). Further,
vehicle operating cost savings per trip were more than achieved along the
new road sections as the cost of fuel, tires, oil and other items neces-
sary to vehicle operation increased considerably between the time of
appraisal and the opening of the new construction. The estimated operat-
ing costs of various vehicle types and projected savings from the project
at appraisal and later revised at 1977 prices are set out in Annex 6.
5.02        The general increase in traffic and unit user cost savings in
two cases actually resulted in an increase in the estimated economic rate
of return in spite of a modest increase in actual over projected con-
struction costs. In three other cases the estimated rate of return
showed a drop but still remained viable. However, the Rogatica-Ustipraca
road section, which had the highest cost (324X) and the largest contract
time overrun (see para. 3.07) showed a lower ex-post rate of return
estimate (see Annex 7).
VI. Conclusions
6.01        Although several road sectione were not completed within the
contract period, all except the difficult Mesici-Jlstipraca link were
finished well within the appraisal estimate.  The early completion -as nn
doubt due to the prompt start of the work immediately after signing the
Loan Agreement. This factor was also responsible for the rapid disburse-
ment of funds in the initial stages of the work. All but one of the sec-
tions show a highly acceptable ex-post rate of return estimate in spite
of generally higher than estimated construction costs. One section, the
physically difficult Rogatica-Ustipraca road section, had a significant
cost overrun and, consequently, the ex-post rate of return is estimated
at o'ily 6 to 8 percent. The difficulty that arose in releasing staff for
training courses could have seriously affected the programs but, due to
the ability of the organizers, courses of a reduced duration were
arranged allowing the staff to attend. The overall objectives of the
project were achieved in that some 150 km of roads were added to the
highway inventory, replacing old construction inadequate for modern
traffic; some 170 employees received valuable training in a wide range of
subjects; local personnel gained considerable experience in highway
administration and construction; and soil laboratory and road organiza-
tion facilities were improved by the provision of additional equipment.

Re.: Sixth Highway Project by IBRD to the SFR of Yugoslavia -
Equipment and Training Report
Within the Sixth Highway Project by IBRD to the SFR of Yugoslavia (see Loan
Agreement of May 31, 1974 and Guarantee Agreement in the Off. Gazette
of the SFRY No. 56/74), there are certain loan proceeds awarded also for
non-construction purposes such as under:
Part II        Equipment, Technical and laboratory
equipment in the amount of                    US$ 1,100,000
Part III       Staff training in the amount of                US$   300,000
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT BY IBRD-SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT
Supply of Equipment out of the Sixth Highway Project loan proceeds was
realized on the basis of the public bidding competition as explained
herewith below;
The first advertisement for the public bidding competition was published
in the Official Gazette of the SFRY on April 11, 1975, on the very same
day this was also published in the Neue Zuricher Zeitung Switzerland and
on April 17, 1975, in the Engineering News Record, USA. The bidders were
able to receive specifications with a title as follows: Specifications
for public bidding competition for supply of equipment for geologic,
geomechanic and geophysical research, weighing scales for axle load
control, traffic counters, wind velocity meters, road ice detectors,
equipment for micro-film techniques, radar equipment for classification of
vehicles by speeds and apparatuses for measuring exhausted gas in the air.

ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 13
The bidding competition was published on the basis of an approval by IBRD,
deadline for submission of bids was June 12, 1975.
The CRO professional commission for supply of equipment at their meetings
held on June 16, 1975, June 25 and 26, 1975, and July 8, 1975, reviewed
the bids submitted, evaluated the individual bids, and established and
proposed t.e following;
There were within the deadline stipulated submitted 24 bids, after the
deadline another 2 bids were received; 7 foreign firms have also submitted
some other information, however, not in a form of a bid but within the
stipulated deadline.
The commission examined the technical elements and the bidded price by
each individual item in the specification and proposed the final list of
equipment to be supplied.
The main point when deciding on the individual bidder for the individual
type of equipment, pursuant to the specification, was for the commission
to concentrate on technical quality of each individual product; however,
at the same time it took into consideration also the price increase from
the moment such list of equipment was made up and up to the date the bid-
ding competition was held. Reason for not supplying the individual equip-
ment in pa-ts or in whole is in the increased prices on one hand and in
limited financial funds on the other hand. Besides, when deciding finally
on the selection of the equipoent, the commission took into consideration
also the demonstrations made on the individual apparatuses, as this was
also stipulated under conditions for the public bidding competition of
bids, dated April 11, 1975.
Final users were also asked to express their opinions on the equipment to
be selected and supplied which certainly influenced on the final selection
of the equipment. Wherever possible, the attempt was made to unify and
typify the already existing equipment.
It was decided to supply the equipment, pursuant to the bids submitted,
from the following firms: ...... USA; ....., Liechtenstein; .
Sweden; ....., Great Britain; .., ,              .....    , and  ...., all
the representative organizations of foreign firms in Yugoslavia.
The Council of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations in the event
of its 22nd meeting held on July 17, 1975, discussed about the proposal
given by the professional equipment for supply of equipment and with some
corrections. Some CRO-member organizations did not intend to supply
certain equipment and gave approval for the supply of the proposed
equipment.

The proposal for supply of equipment was sent to the IBRD for its approval
on July 25, 1975. On November 20, 1975, the IBRD sent final approval and
agreed upon the contracts to be concluded in order to realize the importa-
tion of the equipment. With regard to the legal rules and regulations on
the importation of equipment into the SFRY, there came to certain delays
in carrying out the contract stipulations. Final realization of the
importation of equipment and dist-ibution of the equipment among the in-
dividual final users is presented in the enclosures.
The second invitation to the public bidding competition was published upon
an approval given by the IBRD on December 8, 1977, in the Official Gazette
of the SFRY of February 24, 1978. The invitation was called for the
supply of portable weighing scales for axle load control, bridge-permanent
weighing scales, controlling the axle load and the total vehicle weight
and for the supply of automatic traffic counters. Deadline for submission
of bids was March 24, 1978.
The CRO professional commission for supply of equipment at its 20th
meeting held on April 4, 1978, reviewed the bids submitted; there were
totally submitted five bids, and taking into consideration also the unifi-
cation of the already existing equipment in the SFR of Yugoslavia proposed
to supply, within the framework of the funds available, the weighing
scales for axle load and total vehicle weight control with the firm ......
Sweden, and automatic traffic counters with the firm ...... W. Germany.
The above firms supplied the equipment mentioned to the SFR of Yugoslavia
already within the Fifth Highway Project Loan proceeds by IBRD. The CRO
at its 33rd meeting approved and agreed upon the proposal for the supply
of equipment given by the CRO professional commission. Such proposal was
on May 10, 1978, sent to the IBRD for its approval. The IBRD approved the
procedure of concluding contracts with the respective firms. Realization
of the importation of equipment was carried out in smaller quantities due
to the fact that already with the realization of the importation of
equipment out of the Fifth Highway Project Loan proceeds there came to
certain increases in price which was paid out of the Sixth Highway Project
proceeds. There were also certain differences occurring due to rates of
exchange at the time such equipment under the Sixth Highway Project Loan
proceeds was imported.
The equipment, imported under the Sixth Highway Project Loan proceeds, is
applied by the final users, the CRO member organizations from all the
republics and provinces. Certain individual equipment was given to the
specialized research institutions to be used by them since they are imple-
menting the research works and studies for the purpose of improving the
highway network in the SFR of Yugoslavia. With it should be especially
noted the very special vehicles for testing the pavement roughness
apparatuses for measuring skid resistance which serves extremely well for
duly removing of the damage on roads and for economic investments for

improving the highway network; also noted should be the weighing scales
for axle load control. At the meeting of all the weighing scale users
held in May 1979 it has been established that during the period from 1975
to 1978 there were carried out 30,405 control measurements of vehicle
weight. There was a rather high percentage of overloaded vehicles. Out
of the pieces of information received up to now it is evident that the
number of overloaded vehicles is decreasing due to the rather severe load
control whereby damages on pavements can be avoided with it in due time.
Automatic traffic counters are used for collecting traffic data on
arterial roads in the SFR of Yugoslavia. By automatic data processing we
receive the necessary actions and steps to be taken on roads and above all
for the purpose of implementation the necessary traffic studies.
Other equipment of minor quantity serves for research work within the
organizations performing such activity for the needs of the highway
service, as well as with the CRO member organizations for control service.
Micro-film equipment was supplied as a supplement to the already existing
equipment and serves for modern organizing of the work and activities
within the CRO member organizations themselves.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT BY THE IBRD STAFF TRAINING(INDIVIDUAL)
Within the framework of the Sixth Highway Project Loan proceeds by the
IBRD, there were individually trained 19 candidates from the different CRO
member organizations as well as from the organizations performing research
work and studies for the needs of the highway service in the SFR of
Yugoslavia.
There were 6 candidates trained in USA, in France 1 candidate and in West
Germany 3 candidates from the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina; 1 candidate trained in USA was from the SR of Croatia and 8
candidates trained in USA were from the SR of Slovenia.
The staff training was realized on the basis of a program adopted by the
CRO already within the framework of the Fifth Highway Project Loan pro-
ceeds where there were exactly defined all conditions for training of pro-
fessional staff from the SFR of Yugoslavia abroad.
According to the above mentioned staff training program, the training was
allocated into several groups such as: highway service, highway design
and construction, planning, traffic, highway maintenance, economics, and
highway financing.
Candidates trained in the USA received their training program through the
U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Can-
didates trained in West Germany have carried out their training with the
Oberste Baubehorde im Bayerischen Staatsministerium des Inneren, West
Germany, and the candidates trained in France with the MinistAre de
l'Amenagement de Territoire de 1'Equipement, Paris, France.
All the candidates who received training considered that they had obtained
a considerable amount of useful experience in their field as a result of
the training. This was particularly true of those who received training
in the USA, which was the country where most of the candidates were
trained. Generally the trainees received assignments upon their return to
Yugoslavia in which their training could be utilized, and often they were
instrumental in using their new knowledge to train their younger
colleagues.
Final costs of the staff program and distribution among the final users
can be seen from the table enclosed herewith. It has to be noted that
with the candidates Messrs. Rozic, Perisic and Kapic there is presented
only the cost difference of the training within the framework of the Fifth
Highway Project Loan proceeds by the IBRD.

The course attended 41 participants, among them 30 graduated civil
engineers, 6 civil engineers and technicians, and 5 engineers from other
technical fields.
Beside seeing the sections of roads, freeways and sites of bighway and
structure construction the course included also the interesting sessions

Rekingen, lectures and visits to the company Betonstrassen AG, visits to
tunnels Seeljsberg and Gotthard, lectures and visits to the firm Motor
Columbus in Bade, the Fed. Scbool of Polytechnics and the Blecherette
Center at Lausanne, information on the tunnel Arlberg, information and
visit to the Brenner freeway; beside this, the course comprised the most
interesting sessions in the Constructional Engineering Administration in
Munich with visit paid to freeway base and center for traffic control in
Munich as well as the lecture on the up-to-date highway designing with a
practical case of the Iraque freeway by Dorsch Consult.
There was also an additional information on the Tauern freeway. The
course participants expressed their observations and evaluated the course
on special inquiry sheets at the end of the course.
Report; Material No. 187
Course No. 17 - FOR LAWYERS AND ECONOMISTS
The course was organized for lawyers and economists within the highway
service with the following topics: "Some organizational, economic and
legal aspects". The course participants have also observed some highways
and structures on them. There were totally 18 course participants of
which 7 were lawyers, 10 economists and 1 managing officer. During the
course itself and besides several trips made for the purpose of observing
the highways, very interesting lectures were held informing the partici-
pants on highways and higbway service in Bern, Aarau, and Munich; several
lectures were held with the Highway Administration and lectures on

modern designing of highways with the firm Dorsch Consult.  Visit to the
Main Department for Directing the Traffic in Munich was also made. There
was also a lecture held on the highway service in Austria (KMrnten).
We have also provided translations of some of the laws on public roads
from Austria, West Germany, Bavaria and Switzerland.
Reports: Material No. 186 (Report on the Course)
Material No. 191 (Laws on Roads).
Summary:
It is our praxis, at the completion of the course, to ask the course par-
ticipants to critically evaluate and express their opinions on the course,
as well as to give any suggestions for similar actions to be taken in
future. This is usually done in writing and if so wished by the partici-
pants also anonymously. According to such assessments, the most part of
the course participants was satisfied with the organization and the con-
tents of the course which would mean that they agree with such type of
staff training - with the course held either abroad or at home together
with foreign expert lecturers, why they obtain within a short period of
time a considerable amount of general knowledge, whereas for the purpose
of more specific training, appropriate and more reasonable should be
individual staff training.
We are of the opinion that staff training should be implemented also in
future, noting that course participants should come from all the regions,
also and specially from the less developed ones, since the highway pro-
blematics exists everywhere and is a general one.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA; SEVENTH HIGHWAY (LOAN 1143-YU)
AND EIGHTH HIGHWAY (LOAN 1377-YU) PROJECTS
I. Introduction
1.01     A combined Completion Report has been prepared for the Seventh
and Eighth Highway Projects in Yugoslavia. Both projects had similar
overall objectives in that they focused on key links in the primary road
network while at the same time promoting regional development by improv-
ing selected regional roads in the lesser developed areas. Each project
included sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) the improvement of
which was to become the primary objective of later highway projects.
1.02     From the late 1960s, Yugoslavia experienced a period of rapid
economic growth, which, further stimulated by its growing integration
with the world economies, placed new demands on the country's transport
system.  The years between 1966 and 1973 saw a burgeoning of road traffic
throughout the country. In addition, as a result of transport policy
being increasingly decentralized and greater freedom of choice being
given to transport users to select the desired mode, road transport cap-
tured greater and greater volumes of traffic, both passenger and freight,
from the railways, further augmenting flows on the highway network.
During this period, passenger car registrations quadrupled to over
1.1 million and the truck fleet doubled to nearly 200,000. Although,
throughout most of the 98,000 km road network traffic flows increased,
generally the brunt was borne by such main import/export routes as the
TYR, and in and among the individual Republics by the roads linking main
centers of increased economic activity. Over the 1966 to 1973 period
quoted above, total expenditures on the network roughly doubled in real
terms to rather more than US$250 million in 1973 prices. Nevertheless,
while the total length of paved roads also doubled to about 33,000 km,
development of the network still lagged well behind the needs of traf-
fic. Of the twelve previous Bank projects in transportation, six (total
loans US$180 million) had been for highways, all focusing on eliminating
the major bottlenecks in the primary network. The Seventh and Eighth
Highway Projects followed the same pattern, and from proposals submitted
by the Yugoslav authorities agreement was reached on the inclusion in
these projects of road sections totalling about 220 km. The Seventh
Project financed the construction of 90 km of primary roads. Three of
the roads concerned are part of the TYH and are important to interna-
tional as well as national traffic, one section in Slovenia, and two
sections in Serbia, whilst the third catered to important regional needs
in the Republic of Montenegro. The Eighth Highway Project financed the
construction of 130 km of roads, including two sections in Serbia and
another in Macedonia, which are part of TYH; two other sections are
important regional roads in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

II. Project Preparation, Objectives and Contents
2.01     The objectives of the Seventh and Eighth Highway 1-ojects were
to relieve congestion and hence to reduce transportation custs on major
arterial routes, particularly key sections of TYH. and to promote
regional development through the improvement of selected regional roads
in Montenegro, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Both projects also aimed
at strengthening and establishing on a systematic basis the major func-
tion of analysis, planning, project preparation and evaluation as well as
provide for specific studies on road user charges and railway costing
designed to further transport coordination and efficiency.
2.02     The Seventh Highway Project was identified in May 1974 and the
loan was signed in July 1975. The project consisted of;
(a) the construction and supervision of the following high pri-
ority road sections in the 1971-75 Middle Term Highway Plan;
(i)   in the Republic of Slovenia, a four-lane divided high-
way between Dolgi-Most and Vrhnika (11 km);
(ii) in the Republic of Serbia, a four-lane divided highway
between Surcin (Airport) and Belgrade (8.0 km) and
between Belgrade (ring road) and Mali Pozarevac
(21.5 km), and
(iii) in the Republic of Montenegro, a two-lane highway
between Titograd and Niksic (49.4 km).
(b) the provision of training in the preparation of highway
feasibility studies and in overall highway planning.
2.03     During the early stages of preparation the Government had wished
to include a larger section of TYR in Serbia between Belgrade and Ralja
(50 km).  However, because of limitations on Bank participation, the pro-
ject only included a 21.5 km section of this road between Belgrade and
Mali Pozarevac. The second section between Mali Pozarevac and Ralja
(28 km) was subsequently included in the Eighth Highway Project.
2.04     The total project cost was estimated at US$117.4 million.  The
Bank financed US$40 million or about 34Z of the total capital costs while
the respective Republics agreed to participate with $77.4 million in
local currency and taxes. The Bank financing included US$3 million in
local costs or some 3.7% of total local costs.
2.05     The Eighth Highway Project was identified in March 1976 and the
loan was signed in April 1977. The project comprised;
(a) the construction of the following highway sections included
in the 1976-80 Development Plan;



- 49 -
(i)   in the Republic of Serbia, two additional traffic
lanes to, and the reconstruction of the existing two-
lane limited access highway from Mali Pozarevac to
Ralja (28 km);
(ii)  in the Republic of Macedonia, two additional traffic
lanes to the limited access main highway between
Kumanovo and Titov Veles including a bypass of
Skopje (52.7 km);
(iii) in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo, a new two-lane
road between Pristina and Leskovac (40 km); and
(iv)  in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a two-lane
limited access road between Banja Luka and Klasnice
(9.3 km).
(b) studies by consultants of road user changes, rail costs and
the preparation of a highway master plan for Kosovo.
2.06     The total project cost was estimated at US$179 million and the
loan of US$56 million covered the foreign exchange component of the
project (31.3Z of total costs). The Republics of Serbia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Macedonia and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo financed the
local costs which were estimated at US$123 million at appraisal.

III. Project Implementation and Cost
Seventh Highway Project
A. General
3.01     The Loan became effective on March 30, 1976 after two postpone-
ments from the initial date of November 17, 1975. The constitutional
changes of 1974 by which much authority was decentralized to the Repub-
lics created a situation whereby, to meet the Bank's requirement, the
individual Republics were called upon to authorize construction works and
to guarantee to fund possible cost overruns. Coping with the new proce-
dures and the time taken in dialogue with the Bank to clarify the issues,
caused the delay in the loan Decoming effective.
3.02     The project road sections were designed by competent Yugoslav
engineering consulting firms. The concerned Republics' Road Organiza-
tions were responsible for the construction works while, as in the two
earlier highway projects, the Council of Republic and Provincial Road
Organizations (CRO), Ljubljana, acted as general coordinator for the
project and took responsibility for the training element. Prequalifica-
tion of contractors was internationally advertised but only 14 local
contractors were prequalified. Four foreign firms submitted information,
but none complied with the prequalification criteria. The Bank approved
the prequalification on September 9, 1975. In all cases, contracts were
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder although for one section in
Montenegro, the Bank had to define clearly its procedures for bid
evaluation to the Roads Organization to ensure the award would be made to
the lowest evaluated bidder.
B. Civil Works
3.03     Work on all but one contract had started by May 1976 (Table 1).
The late contract, that for Titograd/Danilovgrad was delayed because all
bids were rejected due to the lowest offer being greatly in excess (60%)
of estimate. The Roads Organisation then proposed a simplified project
comprising a series of improvements to the existing alignment over this
section, instead of building the entirely new road as appraised. After
discussions, the Bank agreed to this being done. However, the next
supervision mission was confronted with a fresh problem in that the local
Planning Authority would not permit this upgrading because use of the old
road would continue to route the considerable truck-traffic from the
bauxite mines at Niksic through Titograd to the refinery south of the
city, a situation they wished eliminated. The Roads Organisation was
then faced with the problem of reverting to an alignment substantially
the same as that appraised except for the first 5 km from the Titograd
end. Economies were achieved in this first 5 km by having a right angle
crossing of the Moraca river where previously on the original line a
longer skew bridge had been proposed. The new alignment also saved about
2.5 km of heavy earthworks entailed in hilly terrain on the original



- 51 -
alignment. However, the most significant saving was in the deletion from
the project of four grade-separated interchanges, which were apparently
included in the project after appraisal at the insistence of the
Municipal Planning authorities. In the original low bid of YD 299 mil-
lion, these interchanges accounted for YD 105 million, hence the savinigs
achieved by their elimination were considerable.
3.04     In agreeing to the revised appraisal alignment as proposed
above, the Bank expressed its concern at the inclusion without prior con-
sultation of the four grade-separated interchanges in the project as
originally bid. The changes described and the redesign needed for this
section resulted in work on-site not being started until October 1977,
almost a year later than the other project contracts.
3.05     All works were completed substantially on schedule, in that con-
tract. periods were not over-run. The exception was the Surcin-Mali
Pozarevac section in Serbia. However, even here the road was opened to
traffic on schedule in November 1977, but because of the onset of winter,
it was not possible to place the final asphalt surface course until the
spring of 1978.
C. Training
3.06     Under the previous Fifth Highway Project, the Bank had provided
financing for foreign consultants for the preparation of guidelines for
Highway planning and feasibility studies. Under the Seventh Highway Pro-
ject, the guidelines were introduced throughout Yugoslavia to the various
Road Organizations, Planning Institutes and other consultant bodies.
These guidelines have proved to be very useful and effective and they are
now used widely for the preparation and updating of feasibility studies.
Assistance provided by the Bank in preparing and establishing these
guidelines has done much to institutionalize in Yugoslavia the major
functions of analysis, planning, project preparation and implementation.
3.07     Although not financed directly by this loan, as a result of
experience gained on this project the Yugoslav authorities sent one of
their engineers for four months of training in the United States during
1978 to develop expertise in the field of asphalt carriageway applica-
tion. This knowledge was subsequently applied by the engineer in the
construction of high quality asphalt pavements in a series of highway
projects.
D. Project Cost
3.08     Overall, in terms of US Dllars, a project cost overrun of under
17.5% occurred (Table 1). The major component of the overrun occurred in
the Dolgi Most-Vrhnika road section in Slovenia when unexpected problems
were encountered with swampy terrain which slowed progress and added sub-
stantially to construction costs. The problems centered mainly on one
interchange where severe foundation problems were encountered. Although



- 52 -
the contractor was able to complete his work on time in terms of the
final contract, this period was some 40X greater than the appraisal time
estimate and the overall dollar cost overrun was 46.7Z for this road
section. The Serbian road section was completed with only a 1% dollar
cost overrun, and construction of the road sections in Montenegro had a
combined dollar cost overrun of 8.4%. The technical assistance component
of the project had no cost overrun.
E. Disbursements
3.09     The Government's first claims for disbursements were about eight
months late compared with the appraisal schedule (Table 2 and Chart 1).
Thereafter, requests were submitted promptly and the final disbursement
was made in February 1980, about eleven months later than expected at
appraisal.
Eighth Highway Project
A. General
3.10     The Loan became effective on September 7, 1977 after two post-
ponements from the projected date of July 11, 1977. Engineering of the
project road sections was based on design standards satisfactory to the
Bank and carried out by competent Yugoslav engineering consulting firms
and by institutes for geology, soil mechanics and civil engineering. The
concerned Republics' and Provincial Road Organization were responsible
for the construction works while, as in the Seventh Highway Project, the
CRO, Ljubljana, acted as general coordinator for the project. In addi-
tion the CRO was directly responsible for carrying out the Road-User
Charges Study. The Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) was directly
responsible for the Rail Costs Study and the Kosovan Borrower for the
Highway Development Plan in Kosovo.
3.11     Prequalification of contractors was internationally advertised
and completed well in advance of formal effectiveness of the loan. In
fact actual construction was underway on all of the construction
components in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia well in advance of loan
effectiveness and in two of the three road sections in Kosovo. Con-
struction in Macedonia, however, did not officially get underway until
January 1l, 1978, well into the winter season, and some four months after
the loan effectiveness date (September 7, 1977). All awards were made to
the lowest evaluated bidder.
B. Civil Works
3.12     All contract bids were well within the project cost appraisal
estimate. However, the final contract award for Serbia, when received by
the Bank, turned out to be about 40% more than the original evaluated bid
agreed to by the Bank. On investigation this was found to be the result



- 53 -
of design changes in the interim which included the addition of an inter-
change. The Bank made clear to the Yugoslav authorities that such
changes, without Bank review and concurrence, were not acceptable. How-
ever, after reviewing the circumstances for the change, as well as design
details, the Bank concluded that the changes were desirable and the con-
tract was accepted.
3.13     A similar problem arose in Macedonia on the 8.8 km Skopje bypass
on the Kumanovo-Titov Veles road. Although on the basis of traffic and
ecornomic considerations it would have been sufficient to construct the
bypass to two-lane standards, as recommended at appraisal, the Republic
of Macedonia decided to upgrade the road to four-lane standards to avoid
possible constriction near the Skopje airport. The change was also jus-
tified on the grounds of providing continuity as the section was too
short to allow for the transition at each end from four lanes to two
lanes. Although the bid price was increased to cover the change in pro-
ject scope, the Bank was not immediately informed of this matter. The
Bank subsequently reviewed the justification for the changes and the
additional works were approved subject to the understanding that the
additional costs be borne by Macedonia.
3.14     Road construction under this loan was completed as per contract
schedule in Bosnia-Herzegovina, essentially as scheduled for three links
in Macedonia, and ten months early for the fourth link but there was a
delay of 4-1/2 months in completion of critical bridges and one of 9-1/2
months in completion of two tunnels so full use of the Kumanovo-Titov
Veles link by traffic was delayed (Table 3). After a rapid initial pro-
gress, completion of the Mali Pozarevac-Ralja fell some 9 months behind
schedule in Serbia. Progress was particularly poor in Kosovo, with the
various sections of the Pristina-Petrilje road being from 13 months to 29
months behind the original contract completion dates. However, actual
completion in relation to appraisal estimates (rather than contract
dates) was somewhat better in Kosovo, being between about 8 months and 20
months behind schedule. A significant part of the problem in Kosovo was
caused by a flood damage during the winter of (early) 1980 which caused
extensive earth slides and damage to the works. Serbia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina finished their construction programs as estimated in the
appraisal ("late 1979") and Macedonia completed their program from a year
to 7 months early, respectively for four links and for bridges, while the
tunnels were on time in relation to the appraisal estimate ("late 1980").
C. Road-User Charges Study
3.15     Both the Road-User Charges Study and the Rail Costs Study (see
below) were awarded to a local institute with the understanding that
foreign assistance would be sought for the Road-User Charges Study. The
institute contracted with two foreign firms for support and a draft final
report was scheduled for the end of 1978. From the beginning, however,
problems were apparent. The institute's initial report was very volumi-
nous but did not respond to the basic issues. During negotiations for



- 54 -
the Tenth Highway Project, a Memorandum of Understanding
(February 12, 1979) was signed which detailed the primary issues to be
covered in the Road User Charges Study and confirmed the Yugoslav delega-
tion's assurance that a draft final report would be ready by the end of
February 1979. Notwithstanding this, it was not until November 1979 that
an English version of the report (now called "final report") was pre-
sented to the Bank. This was discussed in Washington in December 1979.
Major corrections were required although the basic analysis was generally
acceptable. The study recommended a number of modifications to the
structure and level of road user charges including a simplification of
the existing system. However, before these modifications could be con-
sidered, economic conditions changed quite considerably and the study
recommendations were no longer valid. At this writing, the report is
being updated, using the latest available economic data.
D. Rail Costs Study
3.16     The purpose of this study was to formulate a uniform costing
system for all the railway transport organizations (RTOs) in Yugoslavia.
The study, although part of the Eighth Highway Project, was not financed
by the Bank. It was completed in 1979 but, due to disagreements between
the RTOs, much time elapsed before the report, with amendments, was
approved by a commission representing all the RTOs in 1981. The report
proposes a costing system designed to take account of the complex
arrangements of separate and independent operational units which make up
the Yugoslav railway system. The analysis emphasizes cost control, the
separation of terminal and line-haul costs, and the calculation of costs
by lines and sections. In May 1982 a contract was signed between the
Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) and local consultants for prepara-
tion and testing of the system at RTO Belgrade by mid-1983 and to follow
this with the implementation of the system at the other RTOs beginning in
early 1984.
E. Kosovo Highway Development Plan
3.17     The Kosovo Highway Development Plau was prepared with the
assistance of foreign consultants and served as a model for highway
sector planning in Yugoslavia. In addition to providing a sound basis
for Kosovo's participation in the Tenth Highway Project Sector
Loan (1678-YU), the study had an important institution building impact in
that it established a methodology for the preparation of highway master
plans and investment programs which were subsequently used in other
republics participating in the Tenth Highway Project. The investment
programs of the five participants in this project are now updated regu-
larly on a rolling-plan basis thus providing an overview and improved
control over investments in roads.

F. Project Cost
3.18     The project had an overall cost overrun of lIZ (Table 3).  The
major component of the overrun occurred in the Mali Pozarevac-Ralja road
section in Serbia when as the interchange design progressed it became
apparent that the solution was not as simple as originally supposed, and
that in order to provide satisfactory traffic service to the towns of
Smederevo and Pozarevac, either an expensive multi-level interchange or
else two trumpet interchanges serving each town should be constructed.
After a review of costs and traffic service, the latter option was
adopted and one additional interchange to the four originaLly included in
the project became necessary. This resulted in a 25Z dollar cost overrun
for Serbia.
3.19     The Bosnia-Herzegovina road section was completed with a dollar
cost overrun of 17.3%, Kosovo with a dollar cost overrun of 4% and
Macedonia without an overrun. There were additional works in Macedonia
amounting to 72 million dinars (US$3.5 million) paid entirely by
Macedonia to up-grade the link Miladinovci-Petrovac from the two-lane
section financed by the project to a full four-lane controlled access
facility. Although the link is 8.8 km, the four-lane section constructed
was only 5 km due to the fact that in the design appraised, two four-lane
interchanges had to be constructed at each end of the link as well as two
transition sections necessary to move traffic from four-lane to two-lane
facilities. The technical assistance components of the project had no
cost overruns.
G. Disbursements
3.20     Disbursements began about nine months later than the appraisal
estimate (Table 4 and Chart 2). Thereafter, disbursements speeded up
considerably but fell off again towards the end of the project, the last
disbursement being made in April 1981, about four months later than
expected.

IV. Institutional Development
4.01     The objectives of the project, which were to construct a number
of critical road links, take steps toward achieving inter-modal transport
coordination, provide training in the preparation of highway feasibility
studies and in highway planning, and provide technical assistance in the
development of a highway master plan for the Province of Kosovo, were
largely achieved.  Over 260 km of roadway were constructed, some in the
lesser developed areas of Yugoslavia, which are capable of accomodating
the heavy and fast-moving traffic which the developing economy of the
country increasingly demands. The technical assistance given in the pre-
paration of feasibility studies for highway investment not only provided
the basis for rational allocation of investment funds for the roadway
links studied, but also provided practical training in the development
and analysis of highway projects. Two special studies will provide a
basis for greater inter-modal efficiency as well as the more economic
utilization of transport facilities. Further, with the experience gained
by the local consultants, some technological transfer took place.
4.02     The Kosovo highway master plan study gave that province its
first broad systematic "blueprint" for highway investment and served as
the basis for Kosovo's participation in the Tenth Highway Sector Loan.

V. Economic Re-Evaluation
5.01     The main objective of the civil works was to relieve congestion
or. major arterial highways. However, both projects included the improve-
ment of an important regional road having a major local development
impact. The major arterial road sections carry very high traffic volumes
ranging from about 4,000 vpd on the new Skopje bypass to over 30,000 vpd
on the Surcin-Belgrade section of TYH (Tables 5 and 6). Traffic volumes
on the two regional roads range from about 500 vpd on the Pristina-
Leskovac road to about 1,000 vpd on the Titograd-Niksic road. Generally,
actual trafic levels are marginally lower than projected levels, reflect-
ing the slower growth of the economy in recent years and the major
increases in fuel prices. However, truck traffic is much closer to fore-
cast levels, particularly on TYR sections in Serbia. The largest gap
between actual and expected traffic levels is on the Dolgi Most-Vrhnika
road in Slovenia which connects Ljubljana with the Italian port of
Trieste. Actual volumes on this route are only two-thirds of the fore-
cast level and the diversion to the new road has also been lower than
expected for local traffic. The lower traffic levels are due in part to
the introduction in recent years of higher customs charges at the border
which, combined with higher fuel prices, have resulted in a fall in traf-
fic demand. Additional diversion of local traffic to the new road is
expected after completion of the Ljubljana bypass under the Bank's Ninth
Highway Project and this has been taken into account in the economic
re-evaluation.
5.02     The principal benefits derived from both projects are reduced
vehicle operating costs and time savings for business and commuttr
journeys. Table 7 shows unit vehicle operating costs as estimated at
appraisal of the two projects compared with actual 1981 costs. The
revised estimates show annual increases in the operating costs of about
26% per year over the period between 1974/75 and 1981 mainly due to the
higher cost of fuel and increases in vehicle prices and spare parts.
5.03     In the economic re-evaluation, actual project costs and esti-
mated benefits were adjusted to constant 1978 prices for road sections
under the Seventh Highway Project and to constant 1979 prices for road
sections under the Eighth Highway Project. These prices most closely
reflect the actual construction costs of the civil works. The updated
user cost streams have been estimated based on actual traffic which has
been forecast to increase at a modest 5% per year through the 20 year
project life. Table 8 shows the rate of return (ER) for each individual
road section, as estimated at appraisal compared with the updated esti-
mates. Generally, the ERs are very close to the appraisal estimates; the
revised overall ER for the Seventh Highway Project is estimated at 21%
compared with an appraisal estimate of 23% while the revised overall ER
on the Eighth Highway Project is estimated at 21% compared with the
appraisal estimate of 22%. These results can be explained by the fact
that, although actual traffic levels are lower than forecast, the higher
increase in unit user benefits compared to construction costs tends to



- 58 -
offset the effect of lower traffic. All individual road sections remain
economically well justified with ERs ranging from 16Z to 37Z on the
Seventh Highway Project and between 14Z to 47Z on the Eighth Highway
Project.

VI. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
6.01     Both projects were implemented close to the original schedules
with the exception of the Titograd-Niksic road in Montenegro and the
Pristina-Leskovac road in Kosovo where there were delays of between one
to two years. Although the project scope was increased on the short
8.8 km Skopje bypass, the increased costs were justified by the savings
from diverted traffic. As a whole, both projects have had a beneficial
impact on the highway sector and have enabled the various Republics and
CRO to strengthen their capabilities to plan, prepare and implement pro-
jects. In particular, the authorities gained valuable experience in
multi-lane design techniques which provided a sound basis for the pre-
paration of later highway projects focussing on TYR. Studies included
under the Eighth Highway Project also provided the basis for a future
(Loan 1678-YU) Bank project in Kosovo.
6.02     Both projects have served to clarify to the Yugoslav authorities
the Bank's requirements and procedures for the preparation and review of
project components. The design changes which were proposed without Bank
knowledge for the road section in Montenegro in the Seventh Highway Pro-
ject were not justified and the Bank clearly expressed its concern at
such changes. On the other hand, the design changes which were intro-
duced at a late stage in the Eighth Highway Project and which were
subsequently approved by the Bank were due to circumstances unforeseen at
appraisal. The problems involved in the review and approval of these
changes could have been avoided had the appropriate procedures been
followed. The addition of an interchange on the Mali Pozarevac-Ralja
road as well as the decision to increase the scope of works on the Skopje
by-pass were both justified. The need to add an interchange at Poz-Ralja
arose largely from lack of experience in designing multilane, controlled
access facilities with interchanges. Their interchange design experience
was limited almost entirely to closed toll road oriented structures
rather than to providing a traffic service for the street network. The
Skopje by-pass was a case where the length of road between two inter-
changes was too short to feasibly transition at both ends from a four-
lane section to a two-lane section.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: Ninth Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU)
I. Introduction
1.01     Because of its location, Yugoslavia is an important crossroads,
with its transport system traditionally providing access to the sea for a
number of central European countries as well as international land connec-
tions between the Middle East and Europe. The corridor across Yugoslavia
from its Austrian and Italian borders in the northwest to Bulgaria and
Greece in the southeast, is the shortest route linking Europe with the
Middle East, and is not only a major international route but the backbone
route of Yugoslavia's internal transport network. This corridor, shared by
the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the railway, has within its area of
influence most of the country's industrial and commercial activity.
1.02     During   the   1970s,   high   traffic   volumes   (10,000-15,000
vehicles/day), often comprising more than 30Z heavy trucks, led to severe
congestion on many sections of the mainly two-lane TYH. As part of the
Bank's normal transport and sector activities in Yugoslavia, discussions
with the Government on the development of the TYR corridor led to the
inclusion six key sections of TYR in the Seventh and Eighth Highway
Projects.  Both of these projects,  which were  implemented according to
schedule during the period 1978-80, had broad objectives in that they
focussed on key links of the primary road network while at the same time
promoting regional development by improving selected regional roads ia the
lesser-developed areas. However, by the end of the 1970s, congestion had
become so acute on certain parts of TYH that the improvement of this route
had become the primary objective of the Ninth Highway Project. The focus
of the subsequent on-going Tenth Highway Sector loan returned to the
lesser-developed regions while the on-going Eleventh Highway Project
provides continuity in the improvement of TYH.
II. Project Preparation, Objectives and Content
2.01     The project was identified in March 1977, with the primary objec-
tive of relieving congestion on the "bottleneck" sections of the TYH.  In
focussing on TYH, the country's principal road artery and a major transit
route between Europe and the Middle East, the impact of the project has
been far-reaching and has been felt in all of the main centers of popula-
tion and economic activity.  A subsequent master plan study of the TYR,
which ftillowed identification, defined an overall program of improvements
to the whole route, staged over a period of about 15 years. This study
indicated the following specific sections had the highest priority for
improvement:



- 72 -
(i) the environs of Ljubljana (Slovenia);
(ii) the environs of Zagreb (Croatia);
(iii)  the road section Ivanja Reka-Okucani, east of Zagreb
(Croatia);
(iv) the road section Pojate-Deligrad east of Belgrade (Serbia);
and
(v) the environs of Nis (Serbia).
2.02     The project was appraised in September 1977.  As finally consti-
tuted, it consisted of the construction of:
Ci) in the Republic of Slovenia, a new four-lane limited access
highway from Celovska to Dolgi Most (9.2 km), known as the
Western Bypass of Ljubljana, which would divert through
traffic on the TYH from the city network of Ljubljana;
(ii) in the Republic of Croatia, two additional traffic lanes
to, and the reconstruction of, the existing two-lane
limited access highway from Ivanja Reka to Popovaca
(48.3 km); and
(iii)  in the Republic of Serbia, two additional traffic lanes to,
and the reconstruction where needed of the existing
two-lane limited access highway from Pojate to Deligrad
(22 km), and the construction of a two-lane bypass of the
city of Nis (6.3 km), known as the Southern Bypass.
2.03     In addition the project provided for the procurement of equipment
for maintenance and for monitoring the loading of vehicles using the
primary network,  including the TYH.   Overall,  the construction element
constituted some 99.5Z of total estimated project costs. Total costs were
estimated at US$257 million and a loan of US$80 million covered the foreign
exchange component.
III. Project Implementation and Cost
A. General
3.01     The loan was approved by the Bank Board of Directors on March 23,
1978.  It was signed on April 13, 1978, but it did not become effective
until August  10,  1978.  Engineering of the road sections was based on
design standards setisfactory to the Bank and was prepared by competent
Yugoslav consulting firms and institutes.   The concerned Republican Road
Organizations were responsible for construction works while the Council of
Republican and Provincial Road Organizations (CRO) acted as general coordi-
nator of the project. Prequalification of contractors was interrationally
advertised and completed well  in advance  of  loan  effectiveness.   Four
foreign firms submitted prequalification data, but none complied with the
criteria; 14 local contractors were prequalified. All awards were made to
the lowest evaluated bidders.

B. Civil Works
3.02     Construction in che Republic of Croatia started a month earlier,
in July 1978, and was underway by early October 1978 in Serbia. However the
first construction season was missed in the Republic of Slovenia and
started a year later, in August 1979 (see Table 1). Implementation of the
project was delayed in Slovenia, where residents insisted that measures be
taken to abate future "noise pollution" in the area of the Celovska inter-
change. An environmental impact study was undertaken (by Dorsch Consult),
and the recommendation that a sunken roadway section be constructed in the
urban area, was accepted by the residents. On this basis construction
proceeded, albeit a year late. Despite these delays, the Slovenian section
was opened to traffic only three months beyond the appraisal estimate.
This section was one of the first of its type to be constructed with Bank
assistance and involved complex interchange designs. Croatia completed its
sectioa one year ahead of schedule, while Serbia opened one section several
months ahead of schedule, although the final riding course was not applied
until 19 months later in order to allow sufficient time for the poor soil
to stabilize.
3.03     Early in 1980, the Nis Bypass (the second section in Serbia)
encountered severe soils problems which necessitated an alignment change.
This also required an initial completion date extension of some nine
months. Further problems involving bridge construction over the Nisava
River resulted in a further extension, this time of eight months. This
section was finally completed 31 months beyond the appraisal estimate.
C. Equipment
3.04     With the exceptions noted above, construction proceeded well and
generally on contract schedule. The procurement of =aintenance and vehicle
load control equipment was, however, delayed as procurement procedures for
the import of equipment were tightened in Yugoslavia due to a shortage of
foreign exchange. As a result an extended period of time was required to
obtain Republican/Provincial permission and concurrence resulting ir
substantial delays in procurement. Although the Council of Republican and
Provincial Roads Organizations (CRO) was very active in attempting to
resolve the difficulties, progress at the national level and at the
Republican/Provincial level was uneven. Consequently, the CRO informed the
Bank that it would not be possible to finish equipment procurement on
schedule and requested an extension of the Closing Date for the loan. On
this basis, the Closing Date was extended to June 30, 1982. However, the
account was held open beyond that time in order to process the final with-
drawdl applications on outstanding contracts for the imported equipment.
These problems could have been avoided had a detailed list of equipment
been agreed at negotiations, witn advertising and procurement following
immediately afterwards. However, this was not possible because all the
members of CRO were not present at negotiations.

D. Project Cost
3.05     The comparison of actual costs and appraisal estimates of costs
for construction is shown in Table 1. Overall in terms of US dollars, the
project was within 1Z of the appraisal cost estimates. In contrast, the
project cost in dinar terms increased overall by 502 compared with the 1977
appraisal estimates and was financed from road user charges and the general
budget. The difference between the two currency costs reflects the gradual
depreciacion of the dinar against the dollar during project implementation,
thus offsetting cne effects of high local inflation since 1980. Project
implementatian was not affected by a snortage of local funds. In dinar
terms, the main increase (about 100') was on the Celovska-Dolgi Most
section in Slovenia. This was due to tne delays and design changes which
followed the enquiry into the environmental impact of the road.  The
Croatian section was completed ahead of schedule, with only a 20% increase
in costs in dinar terms, while the two Serbian sections each showed a 50%
increase in coscs in dinar terms.
E. Disbursements
3.06     As can be seen from the Schedule of Disbursements (Table 2), up
until the end of 1979 actual disbursements more than kept pace with the
appraisal estimate. After that time, delays encountered in the start up of
the Ljubljana Bypass (see para. 3.02) and the engineering difficulties
encountered in the construction of the Nis Bypass (para. 3.03) slowed
disbursement, as did difficulties in procurement of maintenance and load
control equipment (para. 3.04). The last disbursement was made in
May 1983, about 22 months beyond the appraisal estimate.
IV.  Institutional and Operational Development
4.01     The overall objective of the project, which was to facilitate
traffic flows on Yug'slavia's main highway artery, has been achieved.
Improvements to the route provide support for industry, agriculture,
regional development and export expansion, with broad effects on economic
activity throughout the whole country. Through the Bank:s involvement in
TYH as well as the master;plan study of the whole route to determine an
overall program of action and implementation, a framework and catalyst were
provided for the direct involvement in future improvements to the TYH of
private international lending institutions as co-financiers. The project
helped strerL'then local planning and design capabilities for multiline,
controlled a4. css facilities with grade separations and interchanges.
Further, the procurement of specialized maintenance and load control equip-
ment for use on the primary highway network has strengthened the institu-
tional framework in terms of control of vehicle weights and maintenance
practices and has contributed to improved road safety. Implementation of
the project also led to an increased awareness of road safety problems on
TYH for which a specific program was prepared for inclusion under the'
subsequent Eleventh Highway Project.



- 75 -
4.02     Due to the lack of funds for TYH improvements and the importance
of capturing revenue from international and domestic long distance traffic,
the Yugoslav authorities plan to operate TYR as a toll facility. The road
authorities introduced toll facilities on two of the sections improved
under the project, namely the Ivanja Reka-Popovaca section in Croatia and
the Pojate-Deligrad section  in Serbia.   At  the Bank's  insistence,  the
republic road organizations carried out studies of the effects of tolls on
traffic diversion given prevailing user cost levels and traffic patterns.
The operation of tne toll systems were then closely monitored in order to
correct any possible negative effects.  In both cases, the toll rates have
been set at conservative levels, namely around one-third of user cost
savings derived from the road improvement. As a result, traffic diversion
has been minimal; it is estimated to be within the range of 5 to 7% of
total traffic.  The revenue collected in the first year of operation was
between three and five times the investment costs in the toll facilities,
while the annual operating costs of the toll system represents 15 to 20% of
annual revenue.  These results are in line with the findings of a Toll
Study which is curreitly being finalized under the Eleventh Highway Project.
This study, which has been reviewed and approved by the Bank, will provide
overall guidelines in ttie wider implementation of toll facilities on the
TYR system.
V. Economic Justification
5.01     The main objective of the project was to relieve congestion on key
sections of TYH.  Two project components were designed  specifically to
reduce heavy urban traffic congestion by constructing bypasses around urban
areas, namely the Western Bypass of Ljubljana in Slovenia and the Nis
Bypass in Serbia.  The Western Bypass of Ljubljana carries heavy through
traffic flows between Slovenia, Austria and Hungary on the one hand, and
the Adriatic ports of Trieste and Koper on the other; this project has
considerably eased the traffic situation in the city of Ljubljana.  The
construction of the Southern Bypass of Nis, together with the locally-
financed Northern Bypass, has eliminated one of the major bottlenecks in
the TYH system where long-distance traffic between Serbia and Macedonia is
joined by international traffic to and from Bulgaria and the Middle East.
The  other  two  sections  of  TYH  improved  under  the  project--Ivanja
Reka-Popovaca in Croatia and Pojate-Deligrad in Serbia--are some of the
most heavily trafficked sections on the whole of TYH with actual traffic
volumes in the range of 13,000 to 16,000 vpd.  Generally, actual traffic
levels are currently about 70 to 80Z of expected levels because of the
slowdown in the growth of the economy over the past two to three years
(Table 3). However, the gap between actual and expected traffic levels is
even higher for the Western Bypass of Ljubljana, the former reaching only
60% of forecast traffic. This appears to be due in part to a general fall
in traffic to and from the Italian port of Trieste.  However, the full
benefits of the Western Bypass will not be felt until the completion of the
Southern bypass of Ljubljana on which construction has been delayed because
of technical problems. The European Investment Bank is now financing the
completion of  the Southern  By-pass  under  their second  TYH loan.   The
coRpletion of this link will enable additional long distance traffic on TYH



- 76 -
to and from the Zagreb area to use the bypass network rather than tran-
siting through the city. This additional long distance traffic would bring
actual traffic much closer to the expected levels.  In contrast,  actual
traffic on the Nis Bypass is slightly higher than forecast levels, but with
major differences between light and heavy traffic volumes. Actual passenger
car traffic is almost 30. higher than forecast levels, while truck traffic
is about 307  down on expected traffic.   These variations underline the
difficulties in forecasting traffic diversion on urban bypass roads.
5.02     The main benefits derived from the project are reduced vehicle
operating costs and time savings for business and commuter journeys.
Table 4 shows unit vehicle operating costs as estimated during the prepara-
tion of feasiblity studies in 1975, compared with actual 1981 costs. These
estimates show that user costs have increased by about 25% per year between
1975 and 1981, almost a fourfold increase, mainly due to the higher cost of
f-el and increases in vehicle prices and spare parts. During the same
period, road construction costs have generally increased over twofold.
5.03     For the economic re-evaluation, actual project costs and benefits
were adjusted to constant 1981 prices. Actual traffic has been forecast to
increase at a modest 3.5 to 4.5% per year through the 20-year project
life. Table 5 shows the revised rate of return (ER) fuL each road section
compared with the appraisal estimates. Although the overall revised ER is
estimated at 30% compared with an appraisal estimate of 31%, there are
important variations among individual components.  For the Slovenian and
Croatian sections, actual traffic is wit:iin the range of 60 to 80X of
expected levels and projected growth is reduced by about 50%. In addition,
actual construction costs for these sections are about twice the feasibi-
lity study estimates in 1975 prices.  However, these effects are offset to
a great extent by about a four-fold increase in unit user cost savings
since 1975. For both sections, the revised ER is about 20% compared with
the appraisal estimate of about  31%.   In the case of the two Serbian
sections, substantially higher ERs are now estimated compared with the
appraisal  results.   For the Pojate-Deligrad section,  the higher ER--49%
compared with the appraisal estimate of 27%--reflects a much smaller
increase in construction costs over the appraisal estimates than for other
components.  In the case of the Nis Bypass, higher than expected traffic
volumes combined with the substantial increase in user savings have
provided a revised ER of about 100% compared with the appraisal estimate of
54%.  All individual road sections,  therefore,  remain economically well
justified with ERs ranging from 20% to 100%.
VI. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
6.01     While the Seventh and Eighth Highway projects had included sec-
tions of TYH, the Ninth Highway Project was the first in Yugoslavia to be
oriented entirely towards TYH.   In this way,  it drew  the attention of
commercial banks to the possibility of financing sections of TYH and
provided a start on a road safety program. Commercial bank co-financing of
TYH was a key element in the follow-up Eleventh Highway Project, as was a
special road safety component.             -



- 77 -
b.02     In general, the civil works components were implemented close to
the appraisal schedule except for a minor delay caused by environmental
problems in Ljubljana and a more substantial delay related to adverse soil
conditions on the Nis Bypass.   However,  equipment  procurement  suffered
major delays because of foreign exchange restrictions and difficulties in
reaching agreement among the participants on the equipment requirements and
their distribution. Agreement on the equipment component should have been
finalized at negotiations, thus enabling advertizing and procurement to
take place immediately afterwards. The Western Bypass of Ljubljana offered
a number of complex problems and was one of the first projects of its type
to be implemented with Bank assistance.  The project called for special
expertise in dealing with the design of complex interchanges as well as
design changes which followed the enquiry into "noise pollution" in the
Celovska  area  of  Ljubljana.   Subsequent  projects  in  urban  areas  have
included an environmental impact study in order to mitigate the effects of
noise pollution.
6.03     The introduction of toll facilities on two of the project road
sections has provided the Yugoslav authorities with an opportunity to
monitor the effects of tolls on traffic diversion. Recent experience with
these and other facilities has shown that there is only minimal uneconomic
diversion of traffic (5 to 1O%), provided that toll levels are set at rates
which are in the range of one-third to one-half of user cost savings
resulting from the improved road.  A general study of toll facilities has
been completed under the Eleventh Highway Project which will provide guide-
lines for the introduction of tolls throughout the TYH system.
6.04     The project called  for a relatively  low amount of supervision
effort in the field, namely 17 man-weeks, excluding the collection and
review of data for the PCR.  This was due to the fact that the project was
relatively problem-free and that supervision was always undertaken concomi-
tantly with three other on-going projects (Sixth, Seventh and Eighth
Highway Projects) as well as with the preparation of the subsequent Tenth
Highway Sector Loan.
