APPRAISAL OF
A SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YIJGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government has asked the Bank to help finance the construction
of about 235 km of highways in the Socialist Republics of Croatia, Macedonia,
MIontenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The Bank has selected 90 km of highways in
Montenegro, Serb:ia and Slovenia, having the highest priority in these Republics.
ii.       The project consists of the construction and supervision of:  (a)
a four-lane divided highway between Dolgi Most and Vhrnika (11.4 km) in
Slovenia, (b) a similar facility between Surcin (Belgrade Airport) and
Belgrade (8.0 km) and between Belgrade (Ring Road) and Mali Pozarevac (21.5
km) in Serbia; and (c) a two--lane highway between Titograd and Niksic (49.4
km) in Montenegro and of a training component by providing professional serv-
ices to help prepare highway Eeasibility studies and to assist in overall
highway planning.
iii.      The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Republican Road
Organizations of Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro. The Governments of the
respective Republics would pass a guarantee to cover the financing of the
project road sections, including any cost overruns. The total loan amount
would be US$40 million, comprising the foreign exchange component of US$37.0
million and US$3.0 million for Local costs (3.7% of total local costs).
iv.       The Council of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations will act
as fiscal agent for the project, be responsible for the training and act as
coordinator in matters relating to the Bank. Construction contracts on the
basis of unit prices will be awarded after international competitive bidding
In accordance with the Bank'E, Guidelines for Procurement by prequalified con-
tractors.  Prequalification procedures according to Bank guidelines for all
the three subprojects are scheduled to begin in June 1975.
v.        The project was appraLised during November/December 1974.  The ben-
eficiaries of the project come from a wide range of sectors and income groups
due to the diversity in the 'traffic using the highways. Savings in congestion
costs constitute the main benefits (about 80% of total) of the project roads
in Slovenia and Serbia.
vi.       In the case of Montenegro the traffic is mostly generated by the
bauxite mines, iron and steel plant, aluminum plant and the brewery at Niksic.
The highway is of decisive importance to the economy of Montenegro and espe-
cially its foreign trade and its trade with the other Republics.



- ii -
vii.      The economic benefits attributed to the project road improvements
take into account only savings in vehicle operating costs, travel time sav-
ings during work and time savings accruing to commuters.  The proposed in-
vestments on the road sections would produce economic returns ranging from
15% to 49%.
viii.     Sensitivity tests were made on the assumption of a 15% increase in
construction costs and on a reduction of 10% of the traffic forecast base in
the case of the roads in Slovenia and Serbia. For the Montenegrin project
road, the test was made only on account of a 15% construction cost increase.
Even under these unfavorable assumptions, the economic returns would range
from 12% to 40%.
ix.       On the above basis and subject to the conditions of effectiveness,
the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40 million to the Road
Organizations of Slovenia, Serbia anid Montenegro for a 23-year term, including
3-1/2 years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
A SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has asked the Bank to
help finance the constructiona of about 235 km of highways forming part of the
highway plans of the Socialist Republics of Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro,
Serbia and Slovenia and of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo.  The
Bank has selected 90 km of highways in Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, having
the highest priority in these Republics. The feasibility studies for the high-
ways in Montenegro and Serbia were prepared by Yugoslav consultants (Road
Research Institute of Belgrade) and the study for the Slovenian highway was
carried out by the foreign consulting firm of Dorsch-Berger (Federal Republic
of Germany/USA). Detailed engineering by the Belgrade Road Research Institute
for the Montenegrin and Serbian highways and by consultants Project Mizke
Zgradbe of Ljubljana for the Slovenian highway is completed. The proposed
Bank loan would be made to the Republican Road Organizations of Montenegro,
Serbia and Slovenia to help them finance their respective project highways.
The total loan amount would be US$40 million. The total project cost is es-
timated at US$117 million of which US$37 million represents the foreign ex-
change component.
1.02      This report is based on information provided by the Yugoslav au-
thorities and by the consultants, and on the findings of an appraisal mission,
consisting of Messrs. R.H. Snel (engineer) and E. Haker (consultant-economist),
which visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1974.
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
2.01      Yugoslavia has an area of about 255,000 km2, with a population of
about 21 million that is increasing at 1% p.a. The country's topography
largely determines the shape of the transport system, with major national and
international routes avoiding the crossing of the rugged coastal and southern
mountains and flowing in a northwest-southeast direction, mainly from Ljubljana
via Zagreb and Belgrade to Skopje. For historical reasons, the system is morn'
developed in the north and, prior to World War II, the railroads dominated a
primitive roadl network. Construction and maintenance costs of the transport
infrastructure are high due to the mountainous terrain and the severe con-
tinental climate.



-2 -
2.02      Yugoslavia's diversified economy has grown rapidly since World War
II.  During the past decade, per capita incom.e has grown by about 6% p.a. to
reach about $900 (1973). Rising economic activity and personal incomes have
led to a rapid growth in transport requirements. Between 1958 and 1972 total
freight traffic grew at about 8% p.a. (Table 1), and total passenger traffic
by 12%o p.a. (Table 2).
B. The Transport System
2.03      At the beginning of 1974, Yugoslavia's transportation system com-
prised 98,000 km of roads; 10,400 km of standard and narrow gauge railways;
a sizeable network of inland and coastal waterways; 5 major ports on the
Adriatic; and 15 airports, 10 of which handle international flights.  Pipe-
lines are still insignificant as a means of transport, but will become more
important after the completion of planned major gas and oil pipeline systems.
2.04      During the past decade, the railways have lost a considerable
proportion of their freight traffic to roads. Railway freight traffic
measured in ton kms declined from 69% of the total in 1962 to 39% in 1972.
For passenger traffic. the railways have lost their dominant position from
62% in 1962 to 18% in 1972 in terms of passenger kms. Inland water transport
is still significant, carrying in 1972 about 9% of the total freight traffic
in ton kms. The ports have almost doubled their cargo handling since 1962
and currently handle about 17 million tons per annum (Table 3).
2.05      Physical improvements to the transport infrastructure have pro-
gressed rapidly over the past decade, yet much remains to be done. The rail-
ways need further modernization, and the capacity of some ports needs to be
increased. Many roads are still below standard for the traffic they carry
and need improvements to handle expected traffic increases efficiently and
economically.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.06      Yugoslavia has no clear'ly announced and defined transport policy,
tut its thrust is implicit in the country's overall economic policies. The
main tenets of these policies are: freedom of choice by users in selecting
transport facilities; free entry into the sector and competition in a market
econom.y among autonomous transport enterprises. In line with other major
changes in overall economic policies, transport policy has become increasingly
decentralized and has encouraged liberalization of the transport industry.
2.07      Introduction of these liberalizing policies during the past decade
has g:eatly contributed to the dynamic growth of road transport and related
economic activities, while railway transport has shown only a modest growth
in traffic. The railways have been adversely affected by Government controls
over tariffs which were not sufficiently flexible in a period of significant



inflptlon.  Undetr the Bank's Fourth Railway Project, the Railways have, how-
ever, considerably improved their planning techniques, have established a
realistic investment program and are moving toward a situation of financial
viability.
2.08      As suggested by the Bank, a Federal Secretariat (lately changed
into Committee) for Transport and Communications, was established in December
1971 with corresponding secretariats in the Republics and Provinces and all
levels of Government have given considerable attention to the transport
sector. However, because the Yugoslav constitution does not provide for a
strong central authority, the role of the Federal Committee for Transport and
Communications in transport coordination and planning is limited.
2.09      To improve coordination in the highway sector, a Council of
Republican and Provincial Roa.d Organizations (CRO) was established in 1971
(para. 3.05).  Because of the CRO's limited authority and because of the
extent of decenltralization prevailing between the Federal Government and
the Governments of individual republics and provinces, highway coordination
and planning is still of an a.d hoc nature within the context of finding short-
term solutions to specific problems. The nee,& for improved highway coordina-
tion and planning is, however, recognized by tne Yugoslav authorities which,
under the Sixth Highway Project, have agreed on the use of uniform guidelines
for the preparation of major highway projects and which are examining arrange-
ments under which improved highway planning and coordination can be obtained.
In view of this it is expectetd that, under the new Five Year Plan, emphasis
will be given to a more coordlinated approach.
D. Previous Projects
2.10      The project would be the 13th for the transport sector as a whole
and the 7th for highways. Total Bank lending for the transport sector amounts
to US$531.4 million, including US$180 million for six highway projects, US$59.4
million for the Naftagas pipeline project, US$248 million for four railway
projects and US$44 million for the Bar port project. Details of these projects
are in Annex 1.
I]LI. THE HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
3.01      Since the late fifties the highway network has been considerably
improved. The network expanded from 82,000 km to 98,000 km by 1973; paved
roads increased from about 5,000 km to 33,000 km or 33% of the total (Tables
4 and 5). Under the highway improvement program gravel roads are being
paved and geometrically improved and many older type paved roads with only
an asphalt wearing course are being reconstructed to a modern type with a
bituminous base thus able to withstand heavier traffic loads. Some major
highways are being upgraded from two to four-lane divided highway standard
to accommodate high traffic densities.



-4-
3.02      Administratively highways are divided into Class I roads linking
Republics, Provinces or important economic centers; Class II roads linking
regions within Republics or Provinces; CLass III roads serving communes in
the regions; and Class IV roads which are local roads. Since Class IIl and
IV roads serve the same type of traffic, these roads will in future adminis-
tratively be designated as local roads.
B. Traffic
3.03      Passenger car registration increased about fourfold and truck
registration doubled from 1966 to 1973 (Table 6). High traffic densities
and a large percentage of truck traffic on some of the major arteries (e.g.
25% on the Belgrade-Nis road) are increasingly causing congestion. Conges-
tion is also aggravated during the summer season by vehicles of foreign
tourists, especially in Slovenia (e.g. in 1973 foreign passenger cars on
the project road in Slovenia contributed 22% of total traffic on an aver-
age annual basis).
C. Administration
3.04      Highway administration in Yugoslavia is decentralized and concen-
trated in the Republics and Provinces. The Federal Government's role is re-
stricted to the usage of highways (traffic regulations, vehicle dimensions,
axle loading and road safety aspects) and the international aspects of high-
way administration. In place of the Highway Administration or Public works
Departments found in other countries, responsibility for roads in Yugoslavia,
except for those of a purely local nature, lies with the Republican or Provin-
cial Road Organizations which in turn are highly decentralized and based on
the concept of worker's self management. Their members represent various
interest groups such as transport companies, industrial enterprises, the
tourist industry, agricultural cooperatives and professional and road user
organizations. The members elect an Executive Board which is responsible
for the drafting and execution of Five-Year Highway Plans which are coor-
dinated with the plans for other sectors and need the approval of the Re-
publican or Provincial Governments. The organizations have their own pro-
fessional and technical services to prepare and execute highway plans. The
financial resources of the Road Organizations are mainly derived from fuel
taxes, license fees and taxes paid for foreign motor vehicles entering
Yugoslavia (para. 3.07).
3.05      Coordination on technical matters among the Road Organizations is
provided through the Council of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations
(CRO) which was founded in 1971 with representatives from each of the Re-
publican and Provincial Road Organizations. It has, however, limited author-
ity in formulating policy or establishing plans for road transport which must
be approved by each Republican or Provincial Government. The CRO has also been
instrumental in the preparation of guidelines for feasibility studies (para
3.09) and in the review of the feasibility studies for the proposed project.



- 5 -
D. Planning
3.06      Five-Year Highway Plans are conceived by the Road Organizations,
coordinated with the Plans for other sectors by the Republican or Provincial
Planning Organizations and approved by the Republican or Provincial Assemblies.
The new plans for 1976-1980 are being prepared for presentation to the Assemblies
in the second half of 1975. Inter-Republican roads are planned on the basis of
agreements among the respective Governments. Although this has proven to be
an acceptable solution in the past, there is a need for improved coordination
in highway planning among the Republics and Provinces as well as for transport
coordination in general (para 2.09).
E.  Finaing
3.07      Overall highway expenditures for new construction and upgrading
in 1973 amounted to about 73% of total highway expenditures (US$250 million
equivalent), with the remaining 27% earmarked for highway maintenance (Table
7)0 The Federal Government's contribution to highway financing declined
further in 1973 to about 0.5 of 1% of total expenditures (Table 8), reflecting
the phasing out since 1970 of the Federation's participation.  Earmarked rev-
enues from Turnover Taxes and special Road Taxes on gasoline and diesel oil
provided 54% of the total expenditures in 1973 for highway construction and
maintenance (Table 9).  The remaining 46% consisted of Loans and Credits (12%),
to which the Bank contributed US$20.8 million or 8% of total expenditures,
contributions by the Federal Government (0.5%), the Fund for Less Developed
Regions (10%), contributions by the Republics and Communes (22%) and other
sources (1.5/%).
3.08      Expenditures for highway maintenance in 1973 (27% of total high-
way expenditures) amounted to Din 26,600 (US$1,560) per km (Table 7). In
1972 these figures were 23% and US$1,300 per km respectively.  The satisfac-
tory standard of road maintenance in Yugoslavia indicates that adequate
amounts have been made avai]able during the last few years.
F. Engineering, Construction and Maintenance
3.09      Engineering for highway projects and supervision of construction
is normally carried out by competent Yugoslav consulting engineers and tech-
nical institutes. Feasibility studies are commissioned to local consultants
and to foreign consultants.  One foreign consultant, the joint venture Dorsch-
Berger (Federal Republic of Germany/USA) has provided "Guidelines for Highway
Feasibility Studies" and assisted in the preparation of the proposed project.
Their activities were financed under the Bank's Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects.
International competitive bidding for previous Bank financed highway projects
has, with one exception for a Yugoslav-Italian tunnel contracting firm, re-
sulted in contract awards to Yugoslav construction enterprises. The local con-
tracting industry is competitive and capable and its past record is satisfactory.



-6-
3.10      Road Maintenance is carried out on the basis of yearly contracts
negotiated between the Road Organizations -and Road Maintenance Enterprises.
The num.ber of maintenance enterprises per Republic or Province varies from
13 (Croatia) to 1 (in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Vojvodina
and Kosovo). Tne enterprises are highly decentralized which facilitates
prompt winter maintenance services.
IV.  THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The project would:
(a)  relieve traffic congestion on two highways of national and
international importance in Slovenia (Dolgi Most-Vrhnika) and
Serbia (Surcin-Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac) by upgrading the pre-
sent two-lane highways to four-lane divided standards;
(b)  upgrade the existing deteriorated two-lane paved Titograd-Niksic
highway to a modern two-lane facility with improved geometric
characteristics and riding surface, thus providing a reliable
highway link between Titograd, the capital of Montenegro, and
Niksic, an important industrial center, and stimulating the
development of the Titograd-Niksic region; and
(c)  help to improve the preparation of highway feasibility studies
by providing related training in trarsportation economics, and
by maintaining the dialogue with the Government in devising
ways of improving overall transport coordination.
B. Description
4.02      The project would consist of:
(a)' the construction and supervision of the following highway sec-
tions of the 1971-75 Middle Term Highway Plan.(see Map 10862R),
having the highest priority in the respective Republics:
(i) in the Republic of Slovenia, a four-lane divided highway
between Dolgi-Hlost and Vrhnika (11.4 km);
(ii)  in the Republic of Serbia, a four-lane divided highway
between Surcin (Airport) and Belgrade (8.0 km) and
between Belgrade (Ring Road) and Mali Pozarevac (21.5
km); and



- 7 -
(iii)  irL the Republic of Montenegro, a two-lane highway between
Titograd and Niks:ic (49.4 km).
(b) the provision of training in the preparation of highway feas-
ibility studies and in overall highway planning.
Road ConstructioTI
Slovenia, Dol gi iost-VrhnLika Road
4.03      This new road would be part of thie international road link between
Austria (Vienna, Graz) and the Adriatic and would replace the heavily con-
gested and technically substandaLrd existing road. The construction of this
section would close the gap between Ljubljana and an already completed 41 km
four-lane highway section leadling towards the seaports of Rijeka, Koper and
Trieste, which was financed unader the Bank's Third and Fifth Highway Projects.
Serbia, Surcin-Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac Road
4.04      This road consists of 2 sections, separated by the metropolitan
area of Belgrade. The Surcin-Belgrade section is part of the link between
Belgrade and its airport and is also part of the Belgrade-Zagreb road, which
in turn is part of Yugoslavia's most important road link within the European
network. The Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac road leads southwards to Nis. Both
sections would be upgraded from two-lane to divided four-lane standard, by
providing a second two-lane carriageway adjacent to the existing two-lane
road. The Serbian road authorities have undertaken to complete concurrently
with the Bank f.inanced Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac road an adjacent 6 km section
towards Nis up to an appropriate intersection at which point the four traffic
lanes of the new road will, for the time being, merge with the two lane ex-
isting road.
Montenegro, Titograd-Niksic Road
4.05      The existing Titograd-Niksic road runs over about half of its length
through a mountainous area. Its pavement is severely damaged by heavy truck
traffic and is too narrow (5.0 m to 6.0 m wide) over more than 75% of its
length. The new 7 m wide road will follow a new alignment reducing the dis-
tance between the two cities by about 6 km.
4.06      Major structures in the new road will comprise a 295 m bridge over
the river Moraca near Titograd and a 1,116 m tunnel near Niksic. Because the
mountainous section in which the tunnel is located is already long overdue,
the Government of Montenegro has started on a small scale with preparatory
works for the tunnel. A 5.8 million Dinar (US$350,000) contract was awarded
for these workEs after bidding in accordance with local procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank. Because the prior completion of the preparatory
works in advance of the major tunnel works will shorten the construction
period for the tunnel by about 9 months, retroactive financing of the for-
eign cost (about US$110,000) and about US$30,000 of the local cost of the



-8-
preparatory tunnel works is included in the proposed Loan. Further details
of all road sections are given in Table 10 (design standards) and Annex 2,
Training&
4.07      Under the Bank's Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects, trainirng in en-
gineering subjects and transportation economics 4s provided for selected staff
of the Road Organizations and iastitutes which carry out road feasibility
studies. Training under the Fifth Highway Project is directed to engineering
as well as transportation economics whereas training under the Sixth Highway
Project focuses nearly exclusively on transportation economics. The foreign
training program under the Fifth Highway Project was delayed because of dif-
ficulties in finding suitable foreign institutes and consultants willing to
accept trainees. A restricted program is now well under way and the remaining
part of the program may be modified by inviting foreign consultants and spe-
cialists to give training courses i-n Yugoslavia. Staff training abroad for
economists will be continued under the Sixth Highway Project which includes
also training by foreign experts in Yugoslavia.
4.08      Aided by the foreign consultants which prepared the "Guidelines for
Highway Feasibility Studies" (para. 3.09) and which also assisted in the pre-
paration of feasibility studies, considerable progress has been made in the
preparation of highway projects. To familiarize the staff of the Road
Organizations and related institutes with the application of the "Guidelines"
and to assist in overall highway planning, the proposed project includes about
12 man-months of services by expatriate transportation economists. The scope
for these services has been discussed and agreed with the Borrowers during
negotiations.
C. Engineering
4.09      Engineering according to the design standards of Table 10 was
carried out by competent Yugoslav engineering consulting firms (Belgrade Road
Research Institute for the Serbian and Montenegrin highways and Project Mizke
Zgradbe for the Slovenian highway) and by institutes for soil mechanics, geo-
logy and civil engineering.

4,11      The cost estimates for construction are based on quantities from the
final design and on the expected unit rates at about mid-1975.  The cost es-
timate for training is based on 12 man-months of professional services.
4.12      A 107% quantity contingency for construction is for extra earthworks
because of unforeseen unstable side slopes in all three subprojects, for
larger embankment settlemients than anticipated for the Dolgi M$ost-Vrhnika
road, which crosses a nmarshy area (Annex 2), for extra drainage facilities
in unstable side slopes, and for minor adjustments of pavement thicknesses.
No  ai cular quantity contingencies is provided for the Titograd-Niksic
road tunnel excavations (para. 4.06) because the rock material is expected
to be similar to that of an existing parailleling railway tunnel at about
150 m distance.  The price escalation for construction of 32% in local and
foreign costs is based on projected price increases of 17% for 1975, 14% for
1976, 12% for 1977 and thereafter, and a construction period of 2-1/2 years
for the Surcin-Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac road and Titograd-Niksic road and of
3 years for the Dolgi Most-Vrhnika road.  The price escalation of 15% for
training reflects a projected increase on local and foreign costs of 16% for
1975 and 14% for 1976.
4.13      Tne foreign exchange component is estimated at US$37.0 million, i.e.
32% of total project cost, on the assumption that the construction contracts
will be won by local firms which is in accordance with past results of inter-
national competitve bidding in Yugoslavia (para. 3.09).
E. Financing
4.14      The proposed loan of US$40.0 million would finance the foreign cost
of the project (32% of the total costs) and US$3.0 million of local cQStS
for the civil works in Montenegro (3.7% of total local costs). The remaining
local costs, estimated at US$77.4 million, of which about US$8.9 mmillion for
taxes and duties, would be largely borne by the Road Organizations of the
Republics of Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro and to a minor extent by the
Road Organizations which participate in the training component. The proposed
loan amount would include retroactive financing of the foreign cost (about
US$110,000, and about US$30,000 of the local cost of the preparatory tunnel
works in Montenegro of which the total costs are estimated at US$350,000
"para. 4.06).  A condition of loan effectiveness is that the Republics of
Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro have adopted the necessary regulations au-
thorizing the construction of their respective road sections.
4.15      The loan wi1l be made to the Road Organizations of Slovenia, Serbia
and Montenegro. A condition of loan effectiveness is that the Governments of
Slovenia, Serbia anid Montenegro have passed a guarantee to cover the finan-
cing of their respective project road sections, including any cost overruns.
TIe proceeds allocated for training will be relent through a single Relending
Agreement between the Road Organizations of Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro
and the participating Road Organizations of the other Republics and Provinces.
The execution of a satisfactory Relending Agreement is a condition of loan
effectiveness.



- 11 -
4.16      Sloveria plans and Serbia may consider operating their respective
highway sections as toll roads as is already done for the Vrhnika-Razdrto
highway section in Slovenia (41 kmi, and financed under the Third and Fifth
Highway Projects). It was agreed under the Third and Fifth Highway Projects
that if tolls should be imposed such tolls would be applied flexibly so as
not to divert an unduly large portion of through traffic to the alternative
toll free facilities or means of transportation. The Borrowers have agreed
that the same principle will apply to the highway sections financed under the
proposed project.
4.17      Withini the Socialist Republics of Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia,
the three Road Organizations are responsible for the public roads, except for
communal roads. They operate on the basis of annual work programs derived
from five-year programs and financial plans which have been approved by the Re-
publican Assemb'lies. The annuaL work programs take into account the available
financial resources consisting of earmarked fuel taxes, budgetary support from
the Republics, contributions from the Fund for Less Developed Regions (for
Montenegro and Serbia), Public Loans and contributions from industrial or
commercial enterprises and from cormunes. The Road Organization of Slovenia
participated in Bank Loans 344-YU, 608-YU and 751-YU (First, Third and Fifth
Highway Projects). The Road Organizations of Montenegro and Serbia participated
in Bank Loans 344-YU and 678-YU (First and Fourth Highway Projects). All three
Road Organizations participated also in the staff training and purchase of en-
gineering equipment financed under Bank loans 751-YU and 990-YU (Fifth and
Sixth Highway Projects). Under all the above loans the three Road Organiza-
tions have performed satisfactorily.
F. Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
4.18      The three Road Organizations will be responsible for the implementa-
tion of their construction subprojects.  Supervision of construction will be
carried out by the Yugoslav consulting engineers and technical institutes
which carried out the detailed engineering. To facilitate the Bank's super-
vision of the project and to coordinate the disbursement procedures it was
agreed during negotiations t'nat: the CRO (para 3.05) act as fiscal agent for
the project, be responsible for the training as a continuation of its role
under the Fifth and Sixth Highwiay Projects, and act as coordinator in matters
relating to the Bank. A condition of Loan effectiveness is that the necessary
consents and approvals for the CRO to undertake these obligations have been
obtained.
Land Acquisition
4.19      The Road Organizations of Slovenia and Serbia have indicated during
negotiations that the land acquisition for their sections is expected to be
completed by October 1975. lhe land acquisition of the 11 km Bogetic-Niksic



- 12 -
section of the Titograd-Niksic :road in Montenegro is completed and the ac-
quisition of the remaining part of this road is expected to be completee in
August 1975.
Procuremenit
4,2.0     Construction contracts on the basis of unit prices will be awarded
after international competitive bidding in accordarce with the Bank's GC;ide-
lines for procurement by prequalified coutractors.  Prequalification oroce-
dures for all three subprojects are scheduled to begin in June 1975.  B-.ds
for the construction contrracts will be invited iin August 1975 and coritracts
are expected to be awarded in December 1975. DThe contracts will include
price escalation clauses and are expected to be wonr by Yugoslav cciostruction
enterprises (para 3.09),
Schedule for Construction and Training
4.21      The sections in Serbia and Montenegro are expected to be completed
by mid-1978. The construction of the section in Slovenia, although it is
short in length, poses particular problems. Because of the unstable and
compressible subsoil, the construction of embankments will have to proceed
slowly and in stages and a consolidation period of 6-12 months will be re-
quired before the carriageways can be constructed. It is therefore expected
that total construction will last three years which corresponds with comple-
tion at the end of 1978. The training program should begin in the second
quarter of 1976 and be completed by the end of 1976.
G. Disbursements
4.22      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance 30% of the
civil works in Slovenia, 32% of those in Serbia, 41% of those in Nontenegro
and the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance. Any surplus remain-
ing in the Loan Account and not required for project purposes would be can-
celled.
4.23      A schedule of cumulative quarterly disbursements is shown in
Annex 3, assuming that the loan would become effective by November 1975.
H,  Environmental Impact
4.24      None of the three project roads will adversely affect the environ-
ment.  The alignment of the new Titograd--Niksic road will allow traffic from
the Adriatic coast and from Albania towards Niksic to bypass Titograd, thus
relieving the urban area from traffic noise and air pollut4on.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
General
5.01      The quantifiable economic benefits attributed to the project road
improvements are savings in vehicle operating costs, occupants' time for
passenger vehicles on work trips and in commuting to and from work. Other
travel time savings as well as the greater comfort and safety that will re-
sult from the project have not been included in the calculation of the eco-
nomic returns (ER's). Without the improvements vehicle operating costs would
become unacceptably high and cause a slowing down in key sectors of the econ-
omy and especially in industry, mining, tourism, and commerce and effect the
competitiveness of many of the country's exports in these sectors.
5.02      The beneficiaries of the project come from a wide range of sectors
and income groups due to the diversity in the traffic using the highways.
They also include foreigners, namely international truckers and tourists,
stimulating the foreign exchange earning potential for the country as a whole.
B. Economic Evaluation
General
5.03      Based on the most probable estimates of construction costs, vehicle
operating costs, time costs, base year traffic and traffic growth, the pro-
posed investments on the project roads sections produce ER's ranging from 15%
to 49%. Savings in congestion costs constitute the main benefits (about 80%
of total) of the project roads in Slovenia and Serbia. To check the effects
of unfavorable circumstances, a sensitivity test was made on the assumption
that construction costs would increase by 15% and on the assumption that the
traffic base would be reduced by 10% in the case of the roads in Slovenia
and Serbia. The latter assumption was not applied for Montenegro since a
high proportion of the projected traffic using the project road can be
specifically traced to the four industrial plants (para 5.10) whose expan-
sion plans are currently in execution. Even under these unfavorable assump-
tions, the ER's would range from 12% to 40%.
Slovenia
5.04      The subproject constitutes part of the country's primary network,
serving both republican and fEederal traffic and international transit traffic.
The international traffic is from Central Europe and Vienna to Trieste and
from Central and Western Europe towards Istria and the Dalmatian coast. The
present facility has an Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of about 14,500 vehicles
which is expected to grow at between 5-9% per annum over a twenty-year period



- 14 -
depending on the traffic type. The capacity of the existing road is insuffi-
cient to adequately service both the existing and expected volumes of traffic.
5.05      The alternatives considered have been:
(i) improving the existing road;
(ii)  constructing a new two-lane road closely following the
existing road; and
(iii) constructing a new four-lane road adjacent to the existing
road. Alternative (iii) constitutes the subproject which
gave the optimum economic solution.
The subproject is expected to reduce combined vehicle operating costs and
time costs by about 33% for the opening year of 1979 to result in an ER of
20.5% (Table 12).
Serbia
5.06      The subproject constitutes part of the country's primary network
serving republican, federal and international transit traffic. The latter
concerns Western and Central Europe at one end, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and
the Middle East at the other. The improvement of the roads is therefore not
only important in a national context, but also in the context of Yugoslavia's
foreign trade and its role as a transit country for major commodity movements
across Europe.
5.07      In 1973 ADT ranged between 9,000-16,000.  Traffic is expected to
grow between 4-11% per annum over a twenty-year period depending on the vehi-
cle type and time interval, compared to an annual growth rate of 13-15% be-
tween 1966-73. The existing facility is badly congested and inadequate to
handle the traffic volumes, present and future. For the economic evaluation
the subproject was divided in three subsections. The subproject is expected
to reduce combined vehicle operating costs and time costs by between 9-25%
for opening year of 1979 depending on the subsection. ER's range between
19-49% (Table 12).
5.08      As two sections of the subproject originate at the boundary of the
Belgrade Metropolitan area, the influence on traffic volumes of a future outer
ring road which is planned for the metropolitan area was analyzed. It was
found that only traffic on the Surcin-Belgrade section, which would be within
the area enclosed by the planned ring road, would be affected. Due to the
high ER and related discount factor, the project ER would not decline even
assuming that the outer ring road can be constructed by 1985 which is tech-
nically the earliest possible opening date.



- 15 -
Montenegro
5.09      The project road is a main artery of the Republic of Montenegro
which is one of the least developed regions of Yugoslavia. Montenegro has
a very rough terrain and access to the Republic is difficult.
5.10      The road and the adjacent railway are very important for the
economy of the Republic. They handle traffic mostly originating in four
local industries:
(i)  Bauxite Mines in the Niksic vicinity
(ii) Aluminum Plant in Titograd
(iii) Iron and Steel Plant at Niksic
(iv) Brewery at Niksic
The Titograd-Niksic railway, which was built some 50 years ago, is of a low
standard; it has grades of up to one in forty and lacks modern signalling
equipment. It has limited capacity and can be improved only at considerable
investment.  Furthermore, the major freight movement between Titograd and
Niksic consists of bauxite. Given the distance from the mines (about 20 km)
to the rail head in Niksic, the high cost of intermodal transfer and the
relatively short haul from Niksic to Titograd, (about 50 km), the road
transport offers considerable economies over the rail alternative.
5.11      The standards and capacity of the present road are inadequate for
the realization of the considerable expansion program now in execution for
the four major industrial concerns in the area. A considerable proportion
of these industries are export oriented.
5.12      In 1973 ADT's on the road varied between 1,000-2,300.  Total traffic
is expected to double between 1973 and 1980 on the existing road if the proj-
ect road would not be built. By 1985 traffic is expected to increase an ad-
ditional 50% over the traffic in 1980. The benefits from the improvements
derive largely from savings in vehicle operating costs and time savings;
they amount to an annual cost reduction of about 13% for the Titograd-
Danilovgrad and 28% for the Danilovgrad-Niksic subsection for 1980. By 1985
these ratios become 15% and 37%, respectively. The related ER's are 15% for
the first, and 19% for the second section.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations!, agreement was reached on the following princi-
pal issues:
(i) the CR0 will act as fiscal agent for the project, will be
responsible for the training and act as coordinator in matters
relating to the Bank (para 4.18); and



- 16 -
(ii)  if any toll rates are imposed on the use of the project high-
ways, such tolls will be set at such rates as will ensure an
economic use of the highways and alternative routes or means
of transportation (para 4.16).
6.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that:
(i) Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro have adopted the necessary
regulations authorizing the construction of their respective
road sections (para 4.14);
(ii)  Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro have each given a guarantee
to cover the financing of their respective road sections,
including any cost overruns (para 4.15);
(iii) the Relending Agreement between the Road Organizations of
Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro and the participating Road
Organizations of the other Republics and Provinces has been
satisfactorily executed (para 4.15); and
(iv) the necessary consents and approvals for the CRO to act as
fiscal agent, to be responsible for the Training and to act
as coordinator in matters relating to the Bank have been ob-
tained (para 4.18).
6.03      Subject to the conditions of effectiveness described in para 6.02,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40 million to the Road Organiza-
tions of the Republic of Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro for a 23-year term,
including 3-1/2 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Transportation Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
Previous Projects
1.        So far the Bank has lent US$531.4 million in total to the transport
sector, including US$180 million for six highway projects, US$59.4 million
for the Naftagas project, US$248 million for four railway projects and US$44
million for the Bar port project.
Highway Projects
2.        The first highway project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was financed
in 1963 for the completion oi- the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway
(422 km) and parts of the Belgrade - Nis road (174 km).  The second highway
project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the improve-
ment of 367 km of roads connecting the Adriatic Highway via Sarajevo and
Tuzla with the Zagreb - Belgrade road. Both projects were completed within
the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The third (Loan 608-YU,
US$30 million), financed in 1969 and comprising about 120 km of roads in
Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, was completed in August 1974 with a 20 months
delay and an 8% cost overrun because of inflation and foreign exchange adjust-
ments. The fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was financed in 1970 for the
construction of about 220 km of roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Monte-
negro, Serbia and Vojvodina. Because of expropriation problems the section
in Bosnia-Herzegovina will cause project completion to be delayed by about
20 months. The other project roads are open for traffic and the project is
expected to be completed in the fall of 1975. A 12% cost overrun is expected
because of inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The fifth highway
project (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective 8 months late due to
Government administrative delays. The project comprises 153 km of roads in
Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth of engineer-
ing equipment, consultants' services and a staff training component to improve
highway planning and project preparation. All roads are open for traffic with
the exception of one road section in Slovenia which is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of 1975. The engineering equipment is being delivered and
the consultants' services are completed. The staff training component was
delayed because of difficulties encountered in securing training of candidates
in the head offices of foreign consultants and in foreign institutes and be-
cause of language problems. A restricted program is now well underway and the
remaining part of the program may be modified by inviting foreign consultants
and specialists to give training courses in Yugoslavia. Present estimates



ANNEX 1
Page 2
indicate an 3% cost overrun because of the combined effect of inflation and
foreign exchange adjustments. It is expected that the project will be com-
pleted on tirme. The loan for the sixth highway project (Loan 990-YU, US$30
million) was made in May 1974 and became effective in December 1974 with a
delay of six weeks.  The project finances six road sections, totalling 150 km,
in Bosnia-Ilerzegovina, training of transportation economists and road engineers
and US$1.1 million worth of engineering and laboratory equipment. Project
execution is on schedule with 2 road sections nearly completed. Construction
worls for all six projects have been or are satisfactorily carried out, re-
flecting the competence of the Yugoslav contracting industry.
Naftagas Project
3.        The loan for the Naftagas project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million)
was made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reforms within the enter-
prise, became effective in March 1974 after almost six months' delay. Be-
cause of considerable price increases in pipe, the project faces a signifi-
cant cost overrun and a reduction of its scope is being considered.
Railways
4.        The first railway loan (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million) was made in
1963 and was substantially completed and put into operation in 1970, i.e.
with a delay of about two years. The second railway loan (Loan 395-YU,
US$70 million) was made in 1964 to help finance a Modernization Program for
the main lines. The project, which covers electrification, signalling, tele-
communications and marshalling yards, was to be executed between 1964 and 1968,
at an estimated cost of US$185 million, but due to long delays project comple-
tion is expected to be at the end of 1976. The total project cost is esti-
mated at about US$405 million. The loan was fully disbursed in November 1972.
The third railway loan (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million) in 1968 helped to finance
the completion of 372 km of the Belgrade-Bar line. Completion was originally
scheduled for 1973, but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in
mountainous terrain are expected to delay operation of the line until 1976.
The cost estimate has increased from US$225 million to about US$350 million.
The fourth railway loan (Loan 1026-YU US$93 million) was made in July 1974
and became effective by the revised date of February 12, 1975. The loan fi-
nances the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and certain related
investments, including track rehabilitation and further signalling works,
which are needed to obtain the full benefits of that program.
Port of Bar Project
5.        The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in November 1974 to
finance port and railway facilities. The date for the loan to become effec-
tive was postponed from May 12, 1975 to June 13, 1975.

APPRAISAL OF
A SEVENT'lH HIGHWAY PROJECT
'YUGOSIAVIA
Description of Project Roads
Dolgi M4ost-Vrhnika Road (11.4 kin)
1.        The existing Dolgi lNost-Vrhnika road runs over flat terrain in the
northern periphery of a marshy area near Ljubljana. It passes through many
villages and is joined by many feeder roads. The pavement consists mostly of
7.5 wide cement concrete slabs and a 3 m wide adjoining macadam track for
slow moving vehicles. The cement concrete pavement has cracked and settled,
especially in sections where peat layers occur in the subsoil. To alleviate
the heavy traffic congestion a divided four-lane highway with limited access
will be built along a new alignment, not far from the existing road which
will be maintained for slow and local traffic.
2.        The pavement of the new highway will be built in two stages.  The
first stage has a design life of 5 years since it is expected that at the
end of this period settlements of the earth embankment in the marshy area
will cause undulation of the pavement necessitating its rehabilitation. The
second stage will reinstate the original riding surface and strengthen the
pavement, making it suitable for another 15 years of service.
3.        At its Western end the new road will link with the newly constructed
four-lane divided Vrhnika-Razdrto highway (41 km, and financed under the Third
and Fifth Highway Projects) leading to the ports of Rijeka, Koper and Trieste.
At its Eastern end the new road will end at Dolgi Most, short of its inter-
change with the projected future ring road around Ljubljana which is to be
built in stages. As a first stage the Ring Road section between its inter-
changes with the Ljubljana-V'rhnika-Razdrto road and the Ljubljana-Maribor
road will be built, providing a bypass for transit traffic in the east-west
direction and consequently easing the traffic situation in the inner city
of Ljubljana.
Surcin (Airport)-Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac Road (29.5 km)
4.        This subproject comprises 2 sections separated from each other by
the Metropolitan area of BeLgrade.   The Surcin-Belgrade section (8.0 km) is
part of the heavilv congested two-lane Belgrade-Zagreb road and connects the
Belgrade airport access road with the western end of an already completed
part of the future expressway through Belgrade. The upgrading of the Surcin-
Belgrade section to four-lane divided standards will relieve the heavy conges-
tion caused by the Belgrade-Zagreb traffic and the additional traffic from
Belgrade to its international airport.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        The section Belgrade-Mali Pozarevac (21.5 km) is part of the
Belgrade-Nis road which leads further to Sofia and Athens. Because of cor.-
gestion the section requires upgrading to four-lane divided standards.  On
the Belgrade side the section will end short of its junction with a future
bypass road south of Belgrade wq-hich may ultimately be incorporated in a
Belgrade Ring Road.
5.        Since both sections have satisfactory horizontal and vertical
alignments, the four-lane facilities will be provided by constructing a
second two-lane carriageway and adding an emergency lane to the existing
carriageway. Asphalt overlays on the pavement of the existing carriageway
will restore the original riding surface as well as strengthen the pavement.
Titograd-Niksic Road (49.4 km)
7.        The existing paved road (58 km) runs for 36 km over flat terrain
whereas the remaining section (22 kn) traverses a mountainous area.  The road
width varies between 5.0 and 6.0 m except for a 10 km section near Titograd
which has a road width of 7.0 m. The light asphalt pavement has proven to be
unsuitable for heavy truck traffic which has caused extensive damage to the
pavement. Although the pavement has been well maintained in the past the road
will not much longer withstand the traffic loads without either diverting
traffic to a completely new road or total reconstruction and strengthening of
the pavement.
8.        The new 7 m wide road will be built on a new alignment and will
be 6 km shorter than the existing one. For the time being intersections
will be at grade but the design provides for modification to grade separa-
tion at a later stage. The existing road will remain to serve local and
slow traffic.
