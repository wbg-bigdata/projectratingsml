CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowert          Democratic Republic of Madagascar.
Beneficiaries:     Central Bank of Madagascar (CB), participating financial
intermediaries, the Small and Medium Enterprise (SHE,
Assistance Unit at the Ministry of Economy and Plan,
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Association of Young
Entrepreneurs, local training institutions and
cunsulting firms.
Amount:            SDR 36.4 million (US$48.0 million).
Terms:             Standard IDA, 40 years.
Relending Terms:   (i)  The borrower would onlend US$45.0 million
equivalent in local currency to CB at CB's regular
reference rate (currently 12.0 percent p.a.) minus
an administrative fee of 0.5 percent (to cover the
operating cost of the Project Bureau within CB) for 30
years, including a grace period of 10 years. CB would
onlend the funds to qualified participating financial
intermediaries at its   regular reference rate with a
flexible amortization schedule reflecting the aggregate
maturity of subloans extended by intermediaries. The
onlending and final lending rates would be flexible and
adjusted periodically. The spread which participating
intermediaries could charge to beneficiary enterprises
would initially be limited to a maximum of 7 percentage
points. Prior to release of the Credit's second
portion, this cap would be removed. The Government will
assume the foreign exchange risk. With real interest
rates 'n local currency roughly equivalent to real
interest rates in international markets, and as the
exchange rate and interest rate policies are broadly
based on a market-clearance approach, domestic interest
rates would adequately reflect the expectations of
devaluation. The project would include provisions to
ensure the continued adequacy over time of the onlending
arrangements, i.e., that they continue to reflect the
economic cost of capital, including the implicit foreign
exchange risk.
(ii) The US$3.0 million equivalent in local currency
allocated for Technical Assistance would be made
available to implementing agencies by Government on
a grant basis.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A
FINANCIAL SECTOR AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT (APEX) CREDIT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed IDA Credit
to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for SDR 36.4 million (US$48.0 million
equivalent) are submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on
standard IDA terms and. through a combination of investment credit and
technical assistance, would provide term resources, through the country's
financial intermediaries, for investments in all productive sectors, except
housing.
2.         Economic and Sector Background.  With a population of 11.6 million
growing at 3? per year and a per capita income of about US$200 in 1987,
Madagascar remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Its economic
record is mixed, characterized by stagnation from 1972 to 1980, sharp
deterioration between 1980 and 1982 and limited economic growth since 1983,
which appears to have picked up in 1989. Agriculture (42Z of GDP) is the
mainstay of the economy, employing 801 of the population and generating over
8OX of export earnings. Inappropriate economic policies, emphasizing the
public sector and industrialization relegated agriculture to a supporting role
and led to natinnalization of foreign-owned enterpr-ses, axtene!v. consumwer
subsidies, and controls over private sector activity. The Government embarked
on a poorly coordinated policy of massive public investment between 1978 and
1980, financed mainly with external borrowing on commercial terms. This
policy produced a fiscal deficit of 14S of gross domestic product (GDP) in
1980, an annual inflation rate of 302, and a large increase in the external
debt burden.
3.         IMF-supported stabilization and adjustment policies implemented
during 1980-88 resulted in a substantial reduction in the fiscal deficit
(from 142 to 4.51 of GDP in 1988). Largely as a result of these developments,
credit expansion fell sharply and inflation dropped from about 302 in 1981-82
to about 13? in 1983-86. The current account deficit was cut almost in half
from its level of about US$425 million in 1981. Imports dropped by more than
half in real terms since 1982. Real GDP, which had contracted by 101 between
1980 and 1982, started growing again slowly in 1983, reaching over 4S in 1989,
based on preliminary estimates.
4.        After pursuing a cautious reform strategy to address structural
distortions sector by sector, the Government moved decisively, with support
from IDA's PSAC (approved by the Executive Directors in June 1988), to reform
public and banking sectors. With regard to industry in particular, the
Government, in 1985, eliminated most ex-factory price and profit margin
controls. It also improved the quality of public investment in manufacturing,
eliminated most export taxes and promulgated a new investment code. IDA
supported this effort with an Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (ISAC)
in FY86. In 1987, banks tightened crLiit to unprofitable public enterprises,
some of which were closed.



- 2 -
5.         In 1987, the Government moved to establish a trade and foreign
exchange allocation regime broadly based on market forces. The measures
included# (l) a large devaluation totaling 462 In foreign currency terms
(May.June 1987). (ii) replacement of quantitative import restrictions with
a simplified tariff structure (January 1988)g and (tll) Implementation of a
market-determined allocation system for foreign exchange for Imports (July
1988). IDA supported these reforms with the Industry and Trade Policy
Adjustment Credit (ITPAC) in 7Y87. More recently, and in carrying the above
sector specific changes further, IDA approved the Public Sector Adjustment
Credit (PSAC) in 1Y88, which centered ons ti) refoming the budgetary proceas,
(ii) streamlining the parastatal sector, (iii) introducing a first set of
reforms in the coumercial banking system, and (iv) removing administrative
obstacles to the expansion and dlversification of exports, including
elimination of the state monopolies hver traditional export crops.
6.         The financial sector, which consisted of the Central Bank and three
state-owned commercial banks also underment major changes. Until the mid.
19809, the banking system functioned as an extension of the public sector and
had been implementing public policy decisions through a monopoly on credit
allocation. In particular, the banks provided equity and loan financing to
non-creditworthy public enterprises. In addition, administratively controlled
interest rates did not cover overhead costs and provisions for bad debts.
As a result, the Government began taking corre,:tive actions by deregulating
most interest rates in 1985. In an effort to restore commercial autonomy and
accountability, separate boards of directors were created for each bank in
1986. A first step was taken in 1987 at restructuring the banks' portfolios,
through increased provisioning and write-oiff; ceilings were also established
for credit to risky public enterprises. In 1988 a new Banking Law was issued,
providing a new regulatory framework and opening, for ths first time, the
sector to private capital. A fully private bank vas thus accredited and
started operations in mid-1989.
7.         These structural reforms are complex and it will take two to three
years to implement them effectively. During this period, GDP growth is
expected to continue improving gradually. To implement the program
successfully requires further changes in macroeconomic management, including
reform and in some cases sale of state-owned enterprises to the private
sector, further changes in the financial sector and greater availability
of credit for investment. Recognizing these needs, the Government has decided
to improve the availability of term financing through a banking system which
is in the process of being partially privatized and through accompanying
policy changes in the financial and private enterprise sector. The proposed
credit would support the implementation of these objectives. Specific
financial sector policies relate to monetary policy and consist of modifying
authorization requirements, money market and rediscount systems, credit
ceilings and reserve requirements. These conditions have been discussed with
Government in full consultation with the IMF, including a technical assistance
mission of the IMF Central Department (CBD) that took place in August 1989
(para. 14).
8.         Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's involvement in the proposed
financial sector/APEX operation would provide impetus to ongoing reforms
in the financial sector and would encourage more private sector initiatives.
Efficient functioning of the financial sector constitutes an essential
condition for the growth ,bjectives pursued by the Government; the policy



- 3 -
and institutional development measures supported by the project would
substantially contribute to this process.
9.         Prolect Obiectives.  The proposed project would complement the above
mentioned structural adjustment programs and would provide funding for the
investments in rehabilitation and new projects, including joint ventures,
needed to foster growth in all productive sectors of the economy. The project
supports Government efforts to promote financing of private enterprises of all
sizes with a special attention to development of eaall-scale enterprises
througe technical assistance.
10.       Proiect Description.  The project would consist of (a) a US$45.0
million APEX credit line divided into two portions (first portion of US$18.0
million, second portion of US$27.0 million) to finance investments by viable
private and mixed enterprises in all sectors including agriculture and
commerce, and (b) a technical assistance and training component of US$3.0
million. The project would support policy measures primarily concerning the
financial sector, but also supporting private enterprise sector development.
These policy measures would, inter alia, help expand resource mobilization and
improve allocation in the financial sector as well as support improvements in
the private enterprise environment, build on and continue to increase
competition and portfolio restructuring in order to reduce ban.. spreads,
suppress the Central Bank's prior credit authorization prerogative and
increase the efficiency of the system of reserve requirements. Satisfactory
implementation of policy reforms would be a condition of disbursement of the
second portion of the Credit (para. 14).
11.       The credit component would finance: (i) fixed assets and associated
permanent working capital of new investment, rehabilitation and expansion
projects and (ii) free standing permanent working capital for existing viable
enterprises in the productive sectors. The credit component would be made
available under an apex arrangement to all sound existing and future financial
institutions accredited by the Central Bank. Funds under the Credit would be
channelled through the Central Bank to the comnercial banks, which would in
turn grant loans to the final beneficiaries of the project. An apex arrange-
ment is the most suitable for financing numerous majority private projects in
the productive sectors, due to the number of financial institutions that would
participate. As more =termediaries enter the sector, entrepreneurs would
have better accessibility to term credit on a more competitive basis.
Eligible financial intermediaries in good standing would be able to
participate on a first-come first-served basis, provided they have entered
into a participation agreement with the Central Bank.
12.       A multi-faceted technical assistance component of US$3.0 million
equivalent would finance a program to Mi) carry out training and extension
service programs for SNEs, financial intermediaries and other recipients, (ii)
strengthen the Central Bank supervision and monetary management capacity, and
(iii) support the SHE Assistance Unit in the Minist:ry of Economy and Plan, the
restructuring of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the estallishment of
a one-stop Investment Promotion Center.
13.        The total cost of the project is e&timated at US$66.3 million
equivalent, of which US$46.0 million would be in foreign exchange. A break-
down of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as a disbursement schedule,

are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project peccessing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Madagascar are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7712-MAG, dated February 16,
1990, is being distributed separately.
14.        htead Actions.  The Government and the Central Bank have agreed on
the followings A) APEX component (i) signing of a subsidiary Loan Agreement
and establishment and staffing of the Project Unit in the Central Bank, as a
condition of effectiveness; and (ii) content of the draft participating
agreements to be signed (as a condition of disbursement to each intermediary)
between participating intermediaries and the Central Bankt B) Sector Policy
Contents (M) modification of the systems of reserve requirements and
individual credit ceilings by banks, as conditions of effectiveness; (Li)
reorganization of the money market and rediscount mechanisms of the CD,
by October 15, 1990; and (iii) abolition of the Central Bank's prior
authorization prerogative and of individual credit ceilings by banks,
as conditions of disbursement of the second portion of funds.
15.        Benefits.  The proposed APEX Credit would help maintain the momentum
of the reform process in the financial sector, and support increased
competition by allowing equal access to term resources by all financial
intermediaries, including the first new private commercial bank. Improved
private sector resource mobilization and allocation are expected from the
financial sector policy measures supported by the project, which are a logical
continuation of the procese initiated under PSAC. Broader access to credit by
the private sector, throuah 'he APEX component, wovld encourage increased
supp1y respono. in the form of Invegtment and reconotitut inn of permanpnt
working capital within a further deregulated and more competitive, partly
privatized financial system. In addition, the project would generate
employment opportunities thus helping absorb expected unemployment as a result
of possible Public Enterprises closures in the future. Finally, through
targeted SHE assistance, services for this high-potential subsector will be
improved.
16.        Risks.  Madagascar is undergoing substantial changes in its banking
sector not only through portfolio restructuring of existing banks but also
through allowing private capital to re-enter the sector for the first time
since 1972. While the project aims at reinforcing and carrying forward these
reforms, thire remains a risk that the political will to continue with this
process might falter, especially in implementing expected privatization
efforts of financial institutions. The Government's commitment to reform
and achievements during the last five years suggest that the risk is not
excessive.
17.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
