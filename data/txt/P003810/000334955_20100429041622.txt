1. THE EDUCATION SECTOR IN RELATION TO TEACHER TIRAINING
1.01      Overview.   With a land/sea area that would stretch from Scotland
to Turkey and a school-age population (5-14) which is estimated at 41 mil-
lion, Indonesia faces an imposing task in providing basic education and
pre-employment training to its children and young people. In addressing
these needs the Government achieved notable successes during the 1970s:
(a) primary enrollment grew from less than 16 million to over 21 mil-
lion and gross enrollment rates increased from 80% to 94% (Annex 1);
(b) over 5 million new primary school places were created under
the INPRES school construction program (which gave local
authorities the funds to build many more rural primary schools);
ar.d
(c) lower secondary enrollment increased from less than 2 millions
representing less than one quarter of the age group, to nearly
3 million, 29% of the age group.
The Government recognizes that the provision of adequate physical facilities
goes only part of the way toward qualitative improvement, and is now
focussing its attention on improved teacher training and instructional
materials. The expansion in enrollment created difficulties in maintaining
teacher supplies and often less qualified staff had to be employed. The
balance between supply and demand for teachers is becoming more difficult to
maintain, and the restructuring of the educational system planned by the
Government is necessary (para. 2.10).
The Education Sector
1.02      Overview.   The formal system of education consists of a six-year
primary school cycle, lower and upper secondary cycles of three years each and
postsecondary education ranging from three to six years. The system is divi-
ded into several types of schools at the secondary level. A parallel system
of private schools exists at all levels. The quantitative expansion of the
1975-80 period has caused enrollment at the primary level to grow more
rapidly in the public sector than in the private sector. However, at the
senior secondary level, as Table 1.1 shows, expansion has been more rapid in
the private sector.

Primary Education
1.03      In 1979/80, primary education (grades 1-6) was provided to 21.2 mil-
lion pupils in nearly 100,000 schools. General (secular) schools are control-
led professionally by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) although the
Ministry of Home Affairs appoints teachers, pays salaries and controls the
buildings.   Religious schools are administered by the Ministry of Religious
Affairs but are required to adhere to curricula and standards developed by the
Ministry of Education and Culture.
1.04      Enrollment.   Primary school enrollments in 1979/80 averaged 94% of
the school-age population, ranging from 144% in grade 1 to 55% in grade 6.
The typical primary school has 150-200 pupils with one class at each grade
level and six to eight teachers.    The countrywide pupil-teacher ratio is 32:1
compared to 30:1 five years earlier and a goal as high as 35:1 by the end of
the century. Repetition and dropout continue to be serious problems. They
swell enrollment in the lower grades and result in smaller classes in the
upper grades (Table 1.2).

1.05        Teachers.  There were 638,000 primary teachers in school year
1978/79, of whom 240,000, almost 40%, were considered by the Government to be
less than fully qualified (Table 1.3):

In eight provinces, the proportion of qualified teachers falls below 50%
(Annex 2).
1.06      Teacher Salaries. Primary teacher salaries have been rising more
rapidly than most economic indicators, but remain at about US$700 per year,
twice GNP per capita. This ratio is lower than that of any other country in
East Asia and at the lower quartile for all developing nations (Table 1.4).

1.07       Curriculum.  The primary school curriculum is largely devoted to
reading, social studies, mathematics, science and Pancasila (national
culture). Teaching methods are improving but the prevailing practice remains
that of pupils copying and memorizing information supplied by the teacher.
Increased availability of textbooks has resulted in some improved teaching
methods but the movement to more efficient practices remains extremely slow.
The school day tends to be short, often less than three hours in the lower
grades, making it difficult to adequately cover essential subjects. One
reason for the short day is that it is common for teachers to hold second
jobs to increase their income.
1.08      Pupil achievements in the major subjects continue to be lower than
expectations, especially in science. A nationwide study of pupil achieve-
ments in grade 6 was conducted in 1974 when some 1.3 million children were
enrolled in this grade. The study sample comprised about 14,000 children (or
1.1%). Tests in the four major subject areas were designed and standardized
on the curriculum in use in the schools at the time so that a high achieving
pupil could be expected to correctly answer most of the test items. The level
of difficulty of the four tests was statistically equated so that means could
be compared. The results were disappointing: the mean on each subject was
approximately half of the maximum possible score. The scores of even those
children scoring one standard deviation above the mean were less than 70% of
the maximum possible: in science this statistic is 59% (Table 1.5). For the
entire test one standard deviation (33) above the mean (129) is 62% of the
maximum possible (263).

Survey of Achievement in Grade 6," BP3K, 1976.
There were significant regional differences in achievement: Kalimantan,
Sulawesi and East Indonesia were below the national mean in all subjects and
their total mean was fully a half standard deviation below the national
mean. The assessment study also related achievement scores to a large
number of demographic, social, economic and 'educational variables. In
general, children from higher social and economic backgrounds who had books
readily available at home and whose parents were interested in their
schooling had higher achievement levels (Annex 3).
Secondary Education
1.09      Secondary education is provided in two cycles - lower, grades 7-9,
and tipper, grades 10-12. Each cycle is served by general schools and a
number of more specialized types of schools including commercial, home
economics, technical and teacher training schools. There are public and
private schools in each cycle and most categories. The general schools in
the lower cycle enroll 86% of the pupils, while in the upper cycle general
schools enroll about half the students. Secondary schools average about 480
pupils in the lower cycle and about 560 pupils in the senior cycle in the
public sector. School sizes in the nonpublic sector are less than half of
these figures.
1.10      Enrollment rates in secondary education increased significantly
during the second half of the 1970s (Table 1.6). Due to high repetition and
dropout rates, the enrollment rate declines from 34% in grade 7 to 13% in
grade 12 (1979/80).

Government forecasts of enrollment for the first half of thle 1980s indicate
a substantial new demand for lower secondary spaces resulting from the large
number of new primary school spaces opened under the INPRES program. More-
over, Repelita III (1980-84), calls for a minimum of 33% of grade 6 finishers
to be offered space in grade 7. The primary INPRES enrollment bulge should
reach grade 7 initially in 1982 and continue to have a noticeable impact
through the rest of the decade.
1.11      Teacherse. Efficient use of staff is a continuing problem, with an
average of less than 20 pupils per secondary scLool teacher in the public
sector and under 15 in the private sector. This problem is especially acute
in the specialized schools,where student/staff ratios often fall to the 10:1
range, thereby wasting valuable specialized teaching resources. At the
lower secondary level, marginally qualified teachers constitute over a quar-
ter of the total force, and the enrollment wave about to enter the lower
secondary cycle will cause local officials to turn increasingly to unquali-
fied candidates to fill vacancies. While unqualified teachers in senior
secondary schools do not constitute a problem at present (4,600 teachers;
one-eighth of the total), progress of the INPRES enrollment wave to grade 10
in the latter half of the 1980s may create a condition similar to that in
the lower cycle.  Provincial disparity in the use of unqualified teachers in
the two secondary cycles parallels the pattern for primary schools.
Although teachers in general secondary schools are better qualified than
those in primary schools, the Government is concerned that the number of
unqualified teachers is still too high (Table 1.7 and Annex 2). There are
also significant provincial differences in the percentage of unqualified
teachers (Annex 2).

1.12      Curriculum, Pupils in general lower secondary schools follow a
single course of study with most of the school week devoted to six subjects:
Bahasa Indonesia, English, mathematics, science, social studies and Pan-
casila. In the senior general schools, two streams are offered: science-
mathematics (46%) and language-social studies (54%). Textbooks and other
instructional materials are in short supply in most schools, school libraries
are rare, and the students have little opportunity for an active role in
learning.
1.13      Pupil achievement levels are low.   A comprehensive study (1976)
involved 10,000 studencs in grade 9 drawn from public and private schools
in all regions (Table 1.8). The methodology of test design and administra-
tion paralleled that used for the primary achievement study (para. 1.08).
Only about 16% of the students (i.e., those higher than one standard deviation
above the mean) were able to answer half of the questions. Science, English
and mathematics were the weakest areas and there was significant regional
disparity. As in the primary study (para. 1.08) scores were highest in
Java and Bali and lowest in Kalimantan, Sulawesi and the eastern areas.
Regions low in one subject were generally low in all subjects. The study of
grade 9 achievements also included analysis of the relationship between
achievement scores and a large variety of social and educational factors
(Annex 3).

1.14      Special Education.  There are at present 217 special education
schools enrolling 7,900 children in grades 1-9 who are categorized as handi-
capped. The Government has specified five types of disabilities as follows:
(a) blind; (b) deaf; (c) mentally retarded; (d) physically handicapped; and
(e) emotionally disturbed (mostly referrals from the police). All five
categories of children are served by the 217 special education schools.
Government policy calls for as many handicapped children to be absorbed into
regular classrooms as possible. However, regular schools generally lack
adequate staff, physical facilities and equipment to receive such children.
Although few statistics exist in Indonesia on the number of handicapped
children, statistics from other countries suggest, conservatively (Table
1.9), that of the 41 million children aged 5-14, perhaps 5%, or 2 million
children, fall into one of the five categories of disabilities defined by
the Government. One detailed survey conducted in the Yogyakarta region
indicated that the rate of incidence may be above 5%. if upon further
surveys the 5% incidence is confirmed, then the 8,000 children now served by
the special education schools represent less than one percent of all of
Indonesia's handicapped youngsters. Table 1.9 separates incidence by
handicap. Indonesia has a far higher incidence of blindness than the two
comparison nations, due to dietary deficiencies. The incidence of physical
handicaps in the three nations is roughly equal. Problems of measurement,
definition and identification combine to make it difficult to compare the
other figures. However, it is probable that the 0.4% figure for Indonesia
in mental retardation is on the low side or includes only the very severely
retarded. Much more survey research is needed to produce figures upon which
to base national planning.

Teacher Training
1.15      Primary.  Preservice training of primary school teachers is con-
ducted in over 200 public and 400 private schools. Training is three years
in duration (grades 10-12).
1.16      Thirty-eight percent of the present primary teaching force has not
completed the full course of primary teacher training (para. 1.05).    About
half of the unqualified teachers would be logical candidates for upgrading.
The grade 6 achievement study indicated that teachers who had completed
general upper secondary level education were more able than graduates of
primary teacher training schools and therefore they are not prime targets
for upgrading.   Moreover, at least one-third of the unqualified teachers are
nearing the end of their careers and are not realistic candidates for fur-
ther training. Formal government policy now prohibits.employment of
untrained teachers, but provincial and district officials often resort to
such practice when:   (a) output of training schools is insufficient to meet
demand, especially during the period when many INPRES schools were, started;
and (b) there are financial constraints, because untrained teachers are



- 10 -
cheaper. The incidence of less than fully qualified primary teachers varies
by a factor of 4 among the provinces, from a high of 72% unqualified in
Bengkulu to a low of 17% unqualified in Yogyakarta (Annex 2).
1.17      At present there are about 210 public primary teacher training
schools, enrolling a total of 114,000 students. Another 111,000 students
are enrolled in about 400 private schools, bringing total enrollment to
225,000. Typical public and private schools differ sharply in most char-
characteristics (Table 1.10). Annual output is about 55,000 of which about
85% intend to enter teaching. At present it requires 4.6 student years to
produce one graduate, with dropout due to social and economic factors and
acadamic failure. A realistic ratio would be between 3.3 and 3.6, recog-
nizing minimal attrition during the three-year cycle. The instructional
program is about equally divided between: (a) subject matter; and (b)
educational studies, teaching methods and practice teaching. Since
graduates must handle a classroom teaching post covering all subjects in the
primary curriculum, each student is exposed to all subjects but expected to
specialize in two or three. In practice, schools place too much emphasis on
higher levels of subject matter knowledge and too little on methods of
teaching basic skills to young children. This is partly due to their
students' natural desire to continue their academic studies in parallel with
their contemporaries who attend academic senior secondary schools. Most of
the students enrolled in primary teacher training schools do so as a second
or third choice after failing to gain admission to academic secondary
schools or one of the other specialized schools offering commercial or
technical studies. But advanced achievement in subject matter is not
necessary in future primary school teachers. Rather they should have a
sound knowledge of the major subject areas at grade 9 level (the final year
of the lower secondary cycle) complemented with effective training in
teaching methods and an understanding of the physiological and psychological
development of the young child during the primary school years.

1.18      Staff Qualifications.   Staff at primary teacher training schools
received their training at teacher training colleges. A portion of the staff
are subject matter teachers trained in parallel with teachers for academic
high schools. Other staff are trained in educational specializations by the
education departments of the teacher training colleges. Of the nearly 13,000
full- and part-time staff, about 80% are fully qualified (Annex 2), while in
8 of the 27 provinces, the proportion falls below 60%. However, many of
those staff who, on paper, meet qualification standards, have never been
primary teachers and consequently do not have first-hand knowledge of the
conditions under which their students will soon work. Many subject matter
staff view their principal role as one of imparting more knowledge in their
subject rather Lhan of helping their students develop the ability to teach
that subject to primary school pupils.
1.19      Facilities at most primary teacher training schools are inade-
quate. The number of classrooms is low in relation to enrollment in both the



- 12 -
public and private sectors (Table 1.10). Specialized facilities such as
science laboratories, workshops and observation/demonstration units are
especially lacking in the 211 public schools.
1.20      Training of Primary Sports Teachers.   Preservice training of sports
teachers for primary schools is conducted in 59 primary sports teacher train-
ing schools./l These 59 schools enroll over 15,000 students and employ about
1,000 teachers. A three-year curriculum covering grades 10-12, parallels that
of primary teacher training schools. The present goal is to produce enough
graduates to provide one sports teacher for two primary schools. Plans a:e
to raise enrollment during the next several years in order to reach a total of
58,000 sports teachers in the primary school system.
1.21      Secondary School Teacher Training.   Preservice training of teachers
for lower and upper secondary schools is conducted at two types of institu-
tions: teacher training colleges and education faculties at regional univer-
sities. There are 12 teacher training colleges and 22 education faculties
located throughout the nation. (For the sake of simplicity, the term
"college" will be used henceforth in this report to refer to the entire
group.) The 34 colleges enroll some 85,000 students in varying programs
leading to diplomas, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. Only three
colleges award the doctorate. While the nominal purpose of teacher training
colleges is to train educational manpower, in fact less than 10% of the
output is employed in school teaching and less than 20% is employed in the
field of education. These low figures for external efficiency are caused by
many factors of which the following two are the most important:
(a)  Many students originally applied to universities; as more presti-
gious, and are using the teacher training college as a route to
further higher education or employment outside education; and
(b)  course offerings have been permitted to proliferate so that stu-
dents and graduates are not necessarily prepared for any
identifiable career in education.
Internal efficiency is also low because entering students are ill-prepared
for postsecondary study as a result of low standards and poor teaching in
primary, lower and upper secondary schools. As a result, the average actual
number of years required to complete a course is about double the expected
number. Some course requirements may be too demanding considering the weak-
nesses which students bring to the colleges. On the other hand, to make
courses easier would contribute to a perpetuation of low standards. Deve-
lopment of teacher training colleges has been erratic. Many teaching staff
view their institutions as quasi universities with no special relationship to
education. The college administrations have vacillated between university
/1 All but 8 of which are public.



- 13 -
aspirations and recognition of their role as teacher trainers.    Degree pro-
grams have emerged for which there is little demand in the field. Staff
hold additional jobs to supplement salary and devote too little time to
their college duties. Instructional teaching methods emphasize lectures and
rote memorization. Libraries are poorly stocked and utilizatioul by students
or staff is low. Students are beset with economic and personal problems
leading to low academic achievement and dropout and delays in progress
toward their degree targets. Of special concern is the lack of student
ability to learn much simply by studying. Student assignments for reading
and discussion fail. Instead, they try to learn only by listening to the
teacher or copying what the teacher dictates.
1.22      The Government is aware of these problems and has taken positive
steps for reform (Loan 1433, Teacher Training Project I, has assisted in
this regard). The Government has conducted a thorough review of the
structure and practice of teacher training colleges. The study has led to a
new Ministerial Decree (No. 0124/U/1979) through which:
(a)  Degrees have been systematized based on a credit hour equivalency.
The former sarjana and sarjana muda sequence has been modified to
an SO, Si, S2 and S3 scheme with the SO equivalent to the diploma
and S3 equivalent to the sarjana (bachelor's) degree. Logical
career entry levels have been established for each of the new
degrees. Students are permitted to interrupt study for employ-
ment with assurances that credit hours would remain valid if they
return later for more study.
(b) Colleges are being disciplined to eliminate less relevant courses
and majors and to place emphasis on logical sequence of courses
for degrees in each field. Teacher training colleges are moving
to consolidate faculties and programs to make the total more
related to needs of education in the field.
(c) A new policy has been announced which would preclude a recent
graduate of a teacher training school or college from tacing a
government position outside education. However, a graduate could
still accept a nongovernmental position outside education.
(d) Higher salary levels have been announced for college staff, which
should partially reduce their need to seek outside income.
1.23      Another recent development in the teacher training college struc-
ture is the designation of regional centers (Annex 4). The nation is
divided into eight regions, with one college designated as the regional
center in each region. The centers are expected to take a leadership role
and to coordinate the programs of the other colleges in their region. At
present, the system does not extend to teacher training schools, since they
are controlled by another director general. However, creation of the
regional structure is an important step towards a more integrated system.



- 14 -
1.24      Teacher training for special education is conducted in four insti-
tutions, with a present enrollment of 1,010, which produce 480 teachers
annually from their two-year postsecondary program. The number of teachers
currently serving in special schools is only about 1,000, so output is high
in relation to current demand (many graduates do not, however, enter teach-
ing). Nonetheless, output will need to be increased as a higher proDortion
of handicapped children are enrolled in the education system. If only 10% of
the handicapped children were to be served, output of the teacher training
program would need to be nearly doubled (from 480 to 850). It is apparent
that the process will be long, difficult and expensive. A modest starting
point would be to increase total output of teachers from present levels to
2,000 by the late 1980s and 10,000 by the early 1990s. This would permit
coverage of children to grow from 8,000 to perhaps 50,000. The proportion of
handicapped children provided necessary education services would remain low
but above the present unacceptable level. The programs of instruction in
special education schools and in special education teacher training colleges
do not reflect current practices in special education. For instance, the
programs do not differentiate adequately between rural and urban populations,
between degrees of handicap or between variations in learning potential. Nor
do the programs place enough emphasis on occupational self-dependence and
training so that some of the costs of special education can be offset by
avoidance of institutional care in adulthood and by contributions to the
economy.
Inservice Teacher Training
1.25      There are three types of inservice training for primary and
secondary school teachers in Indonesia: (a) refresher programs, designed to
improve the capacity of school staff by providing information and training
in line with recent developments in curricula, learning materials, and
methodology; (b) qualification programs to help unqualified or underqualified
teachers to obtain formal qualification (i.e., a certificate); and (c) pro-
grams to prepare qualified educational personnel for promotion.
1.26      Refresher Programs.   During Repelita II and III major efforts were
made to conduct refresher courses for teachers and headmasters mainly in the
proper use of new textbooks and facilities and in better understanding of
Pancasila. For instance, the MEC established 120 provincial mobile teams
staffed by 1,200 teacher trainers who were able to train about 450,000
teachers and headmasters in textbook usage during ln-14 day courses (this
training was assisted by Credit 387, Primary Textbooks and Teacher
Training). Similar and other types of refresher courses have been and are
being arranged by the different directorates within the Directorate General
for Primary and Secondary Education, and BP3K has conducted and is now
evaluating a project which has provided inservice training via radio for
about 60,000 teachers in 9 remote areas plus Yogyakarta and Central Java.



- 15 -
1.27      Upgrading.  About 10,000 unqualified primary teachers participate
each year in special qualification courses, lasting one, two or three years
depending on the educational background of the participants. These courses
are managed by specially appointed headmasters but utilize teacher training
school facilities and staff. Unqualified teachers can also receive formal
qualification through correspondence courses conducted by an institute in
Bandung; about 1,200 teachers a year participate.
1.28      Promotion courses are organized by the Ministry of Education and
Culture's Training Center mainly for officers within the Ministry or for
candidates from educational institutions and by different directorates
within the Directorate General for Primary and Secondary Education.
1.29      Many teachers are unable to get places in upgrading courses and at
present capacity it would take about 30 years to upgrade all unqualified
primary teachers through courses at regional training centers. Furthermore,
results of inservice training programs conducted so far have not been
entirely successful. Reasons for deficiencies are: (a) programs devote
scant attention to local needs and variations; (b) overemphasis on theoreti-
cal concerns; (c) training away from the teacher's own classrooms and
inappropriate training methods coupled with an attempt to cover too many
topics in too short a time; (d) lack of a coordinated national structure for
pre- and inservice training of educational personnel; (e) scarcity of funds
and too costly programs; and (f) lack of integration of inservice training.
1.30      Ministerial Decrees.  The shortcomings in teacher education (pre-
service and inservice) have been repeatedly debated within and outside the
Ministry of Education and Culture. Two ministerial decrees attempt to deal
with this problem i.e., decrees nos. 039 and 161 of 1980. Decree no. 039
authorizes the Directorate General of Higher Education to pursue development
works on the basis of the Pattern of Reform of the Teacher Education System
in Indonesia, a basic policy statement on the reform of the teacher supply
system including the professional certification of teachers. Decree no. 161
assigns responsibility for the management and organization of the three types
of inservice training to the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary
Education. The Director of Teacher Training acts as training coordinator and
different directorates within the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary
Education act as planning and funding units. Seven national subject matter
centers and 11 regional inservice teacher training centers would be the main
operating units in the system. A national center is expected to provide
training materials and develop training methodology in its subject area.
Regional centers carry out the training, using materials and methods received
from the national centers following guidelines decided upon by the coordina-
ting team. Coordination is needed between the potential credit-earning
activities conducted by the inservice training establishments under the DGPS,



- L6 -
and the accrediting institutions under the DGHE. Without such coordination,
the professionalization of Indonesian teachers provided for by ministerial
decree no. 0124 of 1979 and reaffirmed by Government Act no. 3 of 1980 would
never materialize. Teacher training colleges and universities should
cooperate with the coordinating teams and the national and regional training
centers to: (a) provide part-time trainers for the centers; (b) provide
training materials and develop training methods; (c) design a credit system
for trainees who have finished certain inservice teacher training programs;
and (d) provide a technical educational service for developing the centers.
The decrees also give directives on forms and types of evaluation of inservice
training programs and state that each trainee will get credit(s) when he has
fulfilled certain requirements and that each credit will be useful for the
trainee's career.
Educational Administration
1.31      Indonesia's educational system requires a wide range of educational
administrators ranging from primary school headmasters to provincial and
national educational officials. Education is supervised and managed at five
levels: school, subdistrict-, district, province and nation. Each school has
a headmaster and larger secondary schools have deputies. The subdistrict
(N = over 3,400) is responsible for the primary level (some subdistricts do
not have lower secondary schools). The district (N = 300) is the smallest
unit responsible for the complete range of educational services (grades 1-12).
At the provincial level (N = 27) there is a full educational bureaucracy to
supervise and coordinate the work of the districts. At the apex of the
pyramid is the national Ministry of Education and Culture. The magnitude of
the administrative system is impressive (Table 1.11). The total number of
persons involved in educational administration, including administrators in
the various types of specialized secondary schools and managers in tertiary
education, is over 130,000.

1.32      Throughout the administrative pyramid the significant constraints
to effective operation are inadequate training and experience, finance and
organization. Pre-appointment training in administration is rare at all
levels and nonexistent for primary school headmasters. Inservice training
for headmasters is a recognized need but has not yet been provided on a
regular basis. Many administrators have never served in the roles of the
subordinates they are expected to manage. Financial constraints limit the
number of management staff and their ability to travel in the performance of
their duties. The vital functions of school efficiency and quality control
ought to be shared by inspectors and supervisors. However, these personnel
are seldom able to visit schools and even less frequently able to observe
teachers during the school day.   Since experience has shown that the per-
formance of administrators is a strong correlate of quality of education,/1
enhanced educational administration constitutes a promising avenue toward
quality improvement.

2. ISSUES AND STRATEGY
A. Issues
2.01      Three principal shortcomings in the primary and secondary educa-
tion system were identified in Chapter 1. First, low quality of education
at both levels leading to inadequate pupil learning achievements; second,
lack of opportunity for access to the secondary level, and third, inefficient
structure and management. On each there are provincial differences in
degree of impact. Overcoming problems affecting a pupil population as large
as that of North America /1 will require a combined effort by Government and
external assistance agencies in a series of programs and projects over an
extended period. Simultaneous programs of physical facilities expansion and
improvement, coupled with curriculum, instructional materials and textbook
development and administration reform will be needed.
2.02      The main issues in teacher training parallel those of the broader
sector:
(a) Quality. The ultimate objective is to raise pupil achievement
levels shown to be presently unacceptably low (Tables 1.5 and
1.8). An important means to this end is to provide quality
teacher education for primary (including sports teachers),
secondary and special education in the pre- and in-service modes
through improved facilities, equipment and staff development;
(b) Quantity. Although the national supply of new primary school
teachers exceeds demand, nearly half of the provinces (12) now
have a shortage and this is expected to continue unless new mea-
sures are taken (Table 2.1). A national shortage of new secondary
teachers now prevails and will grow during the remainder of the
century (Table 2.2). The in-service training system requires
quantitative expansion to complete the coverage of national
subject matter centers and regional centers to all areas. Special
education teacher training requires quantitative expansion to
achieve a more complete coverage of the handicapped pupil
population.
(c) Structure. Responsibility for management of teacher education is
divided between two directors general and sepairated under multiple
directorates. T iaison with parallel activities in curricula and
materials deve+o.)pment is also weak.

(d) Administration Training. Quality of the educational program is
dependent upon the performance of headmasters, principals and
district, provincial and national managers.
2.03      Quality.   Most existing general primary teacher training schools are
housed in substandard facilities and lack sufficient equipment to perform
their function. Staff education and training and management also need
improvement. The Government s policy of assigning each sports teacher to
serve two schools will increase the complexity of their jobs and will require
improvement in their training. The expansion projected for the secondary
school teacher training colleges could result in decreased quality unless the
Government continues to emphasize quality instruction in those colleges.
Special education preservice teacher training is not following current
practice (para. 1.14) and requires significant improvement in facilities,
equipment and staff development. Staff development and facilities are also
needed to achieve improved quality of in-service training.
2.04      Quantity.   In 13 of the nation's 27 provinces, the annual output of
primary teacher training schools does not equal demand for new teachers
(Table 2.1). Since there is relatively little mobility of new primary
teachers across provincial boundaries for training or employment, these
deficits are best remedied by increased capacity in shortage areas either in
the form of added capacity in existing schools or establishment of new
schools. At the secondary level, nearly all college regions have a shortfall
in the output of new secondary teachers (Table 2.2). The greatest shortages
are in the East Java, Jakarta and West Java regions.
2.05      Structure for Teacher Training (Chart A).    The best resources for
teacher training are located at the secondary teacher training colleges and
education faculties of universities under the Directorate General for Higher
Education, separated in the organizational structure from the teacher training
schools and the other elements under the Directorate General for Primary and
Secondary Education. National subject matter centers, regional inservice
centers and the leading inservice training agencies, are located near teacher
training colleges and universities and are expected to receive assistance from
college staff, but a direct line relationship is precluded by the structure.
Ideally, teacher training schools should be branches of colleges or education
faculties and together they should provide, all the inservice activities
needed. The Government recognizes this need and, with Bank assistance under
the Third and Fifth Education Projects, has taken positive steps toward an
improved structure. Continuation and strengthening of this process should
form an important part of future Bank Group financed project(s) in teacher
training.

2.06      Administrative Training.   Improved leadership provided by a well
trained headmaster or principal of a primary or secondary school enhances
the performance of teachers and pupils. An effective headmaster coalesces
parent interest in education leading to demand for a higher level of
quality. Administration above the school level merits special attention in
training programs. More responsibilities should be ,;hifted downward in the
pyramid to place the decisions closer to those affected and to give higher
levels (province and nation) more time for policy matters. The management
program should direct attention to:
(a) inservice training for all administrators on a three- to four-year
recurrent cycle;
(b) pre-appointment training for new headmasters and principals; and
(c) research and consultant services to address persistent
administrative problems;
2.07      Special Education.   A thorough review of the needs for special
education is required, including a survey of the incidence of handicaps by
province or district and development of plans for establishment of a
more complete system during the next two decades. Policy decisions are
needed on: (a) the extent to which handicapped children can be provided with
needed services in regular schools; and (b) the advisability of not
providing services to those children whose handicap severely reduces the
probability of successful education or training. Now is a reasonable time
to assist developmental programs and to begin expanding the capacity of
teacher training for special education in order to assure a greater supply
of teachers, since the need for more teachers would be an inevitable
consequence of whatever long-term programs emerge.
B. Strategy
Government Strategy
2.08      Assistance to teacher training and to curriculum, instructional
materials and textbooks is essential to improve quality in primary and
secondary schools. The Government is addressing the need for improved and
expanded school facilities to accommodate increased enrollment. Expansion
will be especially important in lower and upper secondary education where
major enrollment pressures are about to be felt.   These pressures are the
natural result of the success of the INPRES construction program at the
primary level. A large-scale construction program at the lower secondary
level may be required to meet the persistent social and economic demand for
the final three years of basic education (grades 7-9). The Government is



- 24 -
using the results of its two assessment studies (paras. 1.08 and 1.13) to
spur initiatives in curriculum content, instructional materials and teacher
training.  The Government is working to clarify policy on such matters as
the relationship between the public and private sectors, definition of basic
education (i.e., through grade 6 or 9), common or specialized lower and
upper secondary education. The recent ministerial decrees (numbers 39 and
161 of 1980) on in-service teacher training are examples of governmental
activities.
2.09      The government strategy in teacher training for the remainder of
the decade of the 1980s is:
(a)  Primary Teacher Training Schools.   Emphasize quality improvements
over quantitative expansion but expand capacity in those provinces
with a prospective shortage (Table 2.1). Expand and improve
primary ,ports teacher schools to achieve output sufficient to
provide one teacher for every two primary schools. This would
require 55,000 sports teachers trained in approximately 50
locations.
(b)  Secondary Teacher Colleges.   Expand the system to meet demand from
a present capacity of about 85,000 students enrolled to nearly
120,000 by the mid-1990s (Table 2.2). The larger colleges would
be enlarged toward a maximum enrollment of about 12,000 and
existing smaller public colleges would be expanded to meet
regional demand. A few new colleges may be needed. At the same
time revise carricula and instruction to make teacher training
more relevant to the immediate postcollege needs of new teachers.
(c) Special Education. Two major thrusts are envisioned:
(i) Expand teacher training colleges from present enrollment of
about 1,000 to about 2,500 by expanding the present four
colleges and adding two new colleges in areas outside Java.
Expansion would also include staff development and curricula
reform; and
(ii) Conduct intensive surveys and research to measure the
incidence of handicaps among children and develop national
policy to greatly improve the proportion of handicapped
youngsters being served. In this program, the emphasis
would be upon accommodating handicapped children in regular
schools whenever possible.
(d) Inservice Education
(i) Complete the system of national subject matter centers
(para. 1.30);



- 25 -
(ii) Complete national coverage of the regional center system
(para. 1.30);
(iii)  Continue experimentation in inservice training methods and
work toward a more integrated system of inservice teacher
training using the resources of national, provincial and
district educational managers.
(e)  Administrative Training.   Establish a national center for
administrative training and develop a decentralized system of
recurrent training for headmasters and principals including pre-
appointment training of potential managers.
2.10      Impending Policy Changes.   The Government is contemplating two
important policy changes which, if adopted, would be closely related to the
strategy described above. First, the structure of education would be
changed from the existing 6/3-3 pattern to a 5/3-4 pattern. The new pattern
would reduce the primary cycle to 5 grades instead of the present 6 and this
first level would be compulsory for all children. More importantly, the
intermediate years, grades 6, 7 and 8, would become part of basic education
and the Government would aim to provide universal education through grade 8.
The second policy change would move primary teacher preservice training from
the senior secondary school years (grades 10-12 in primary teacher training
schools) to a two-year postsecondary program. The primary teacher training
schools would receive their students after they had completed regular
academic secondary school.
2.11      The change in primary and secondary school structure is in accord
with trends in many neighboring countries which plan to extend basic educa-
tion through grade 8 oi 9. Finishers of these higher grades are far better
prepared for life than finishers of grade 5 or 6. Subjects related to
future employment can be covered in the middle grades since the children are
physically and psychologically more mature. In many cases, however, the end
of basic education is not considered a terminal point by pupils or their
parents, and demand for entrance to the postbasic grades ensues. The cost
of compulsory enrollment through grade 5 and near-universal enrollment
through grade 8 in a large country like Indonesia is imposing, but feasible
in terms of proportion of GNP and government revenues required. The
proposed plan assumes that teachers in grades 1, 2 and 3 would cover all
subjects, and teachers in grades 6, 7 and 8 would be specialists. Teachers
in grades 4 and 5 could ?X2 either type, but would probably be specialists
whenever school size permitted. Physical arrangement of schools is as yet
undecided. Present primary schools are designed for 6 grades, yet only 5
grades would be offered in the new plan. Existing lower secondary schools
cover grades 7-9 but could handle grades 6-8 instead. Since major expansion
in lower secondary schools is high on the agenda for the 1980s, a decision
on the structure should be made as soon as possible. On balance, this
change would appear desirable.



- 26 -
2.12      The proposed change in primary teacher training promises to be
even more constructive for many reasons:
(a) Present primary teacher training school graduates are the equiva-
lent of grade 12 or 17-18 years of age. Under the proposed change
they would be two years older, and these two years would greatly
improve the maturity and stability of new teachers starting their
careers.
(b) Primary teacher training would come after completion of the full
academic secondary school. Thus, students entering training would
have a far better command of the principal subject fields./l
(c) Preservice teacher training could place more emphasis on pedagogy
since the necessary coverage of subject matter would be completed
in senior secondary schools.
This restructuring would entail many changes. Upper secondary school capa-
city would have to be expanded to absorb the present primary teacher training
school enrollment which amounts to one-third of present enrollment. Teacher
training schools designed for a three-year program would be used for a two-
year program but this would not cause undue problems since facilities of most
of the training schools are inadequate for three grades. Presumably primary
sports teacher training schools would change to postsecondary as well and
this might affect planning for national coverage. The proposed change in
preparation for primary teachers would cause higher capital and recurrent
costs in three principal ways: First, upper secondary school spaces would
have to be provided, some of which might be covered by conversion of
existing surplus teacher training schools. Second, two additional years of
recurrent costs for preservice education of primary teachers would be
required. Third, new teachers would enter their career with higher
educational attainment and therefore higher starting salaries. This would
result in higher salaries throughout their careers. But, again, these
higher costs would be justified by a better prepared teaching force. One of
the most persistent problems for primary schools is the low salaries which
attract weaker career entrants.
2.13      These two planned changes have not been officially announced nor
are they sure to be adopted. But unofficial indications are that they are
likely in the next several years. While time should be provided to fully
review all implications, unwarranted delays would cause indecision and dis-
ruption. The strategy under which investment programs are designed must be
adaptable whether either or both proposed changes are adopted, altered or
rejected.
/1 The national assessment found that pupil achievement in classes taught
by upper secondary school graduates was better than that of classes
taught by primary teacher training school graduates (Annex 3).

Bank Assistance Strategy
2.14      The Bank is now developing the tenth and eleventh education
projects in Indonesia in a series beginning in the early 1970s (Table 2.3).
The 11 projects address two broad aspects of education: specialized skill
development in agriculture and industry, and basic education through
nonformal and formal methods. The Bank strategy for education in Indonesia,
in conformity with government desires, calls for an accelerated pace of
project development. The first ten projects were developed in roughly a
decade (1971-81) for an average of one per year. The rate proposed for the
immediate future is roughly two per year. The principal areas of emphasis
would remain largely the same, namely, specialized skill development and
basic education, with the addition of projects in training outside the
domain of MEC. For example, Project XII is expected to address training of
Ministry of Public Works staff.
2.15      Assistance to the formal basic education system has taken two
forms - textbook development and teacher training - thus covering the two
principal avenues to qualitative improvement, while helping also to support
quantitative expansion. The First Textbook Project (Credit 387) supported
the printing of 138 million textbooks and trained 240,000 teachers in their
use. The Second Textbook Project is designed to support the establishment
of a textbook publishing house and a curriculum development center. The
First Teacher Training Project (Loan 1433) supported the development of new
curricula for the teacher training colleges and the training of teacher
trainers who would train prospective teachers in improved teaching methods,
following the new curricula. The present project (Teacher Training II)
extends the quality impact of the previous one by expanding and improving
the facilities for preservice and inservice teacher training and also for
training in administration for education officials and headmasters. It is
planned to continue both the textbook and teacher training series to provide
a fuller coverage of each. Development of curriculum, instructional
material and textbooks is a continuous process requiring frequent revision.
In teacher training, each project can only cover a portion of need because
of constraints on funds and absorptive and implementation capacity.
-Accordingly, a three-project series in teacher training is envisioned during
the decade of the 1980s. The two subsequent projects would emphasize: (a)
meeting the needs of the remaining teacher training schools and colleges,
and (b) furtherance of the Government's in-service training program.
2.16      To date, two OED Project Performance Audit Reports have been
prepared on education projects in Indonesia. One (No. 2998, dated June 2,
1980, SecM80-440), reviews performance on the First Education Project
(Credit 219-IND). This audit stresses the importance of including fellow-
ships to train teachers and school administrators, and the timely appoint-
ment of key staff to project implementation units to ensure the success of
the project. The proposed project addresses these issues as follows:
(a) fellowshipsO are provided to train future project institution staff; and
(b) project implementation staff appointed prior to negotiations. The second

Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3058, dated June 30, 1980, SecM80-
527), reviews performance on the Second Education Project (Credit 288-IND),
and describes the project as being successfully implemented. Major audit
findings of relevance are: (a) the need for more advanced project prepara-
tion; and (b) the overprovision of technical assistance. The current proj-
ect addresses the first issue by selecting sites and preparing sketch plans
and equipment lists, and the second issue by asking that technical
assistance contracts be arranged before project effectiveness.

3. THE PROJECT
3.01      Objectives. Under the strategy outlined above (paras. 2.08 and
2.09), in coordination with the ongoing First Teacher Training Project
(Project V) and with the proposed Second Textbook Project (Project X) the
proposed project would support the Government's long-range plans to improve
the quality and increase the capacity of the primary and secondary general
education systems. To that end the project would seek to improve the skills,
competence and effectiveness of the educational staff concerned. It would
assist the Government to:
(a) improve the quality of primary and secondary teacher education;
(b) achieve balance between demand and supply of primary and
secondary teachers;
(c) improve the quality and quantity of special education;
(d) raise the quality of preservice and inservice teacher training; and
(e) improve and expand the training of educational administrators.
3.02      Project Components. The project would be implemented in five
principal components (Table 3.1):
Table 3.1: PROJECT COMPONENTS BY NUMBER OF UNITS ASSISTED AND

units to               places

- 31 -
Each component would include construction and equipment for the facilities
described in Table 3.1 as well as related technical assistance in the forms of
staff development and specialists services. Assistance for evaluation and
development of future education projects is also included. Assistance would
be provided only in the public teacher education institutions, not in the many
private, predominantly religious, teacher education institutions.
Preservice Training of Primary Teachers (Proposed outlay: US$33.7 million
excluding contingencies)
3.03      Primary Teacher Training School Improvement.   To promote qualitative
improvements and, secondarily, to meet needs for enrollment expansion in
provinces with shortages of primary school teachers, 60 schools would receive
assistance in construction and renovation, furniture, equipment and staff
development (Table 3.2). Enrollment capacity for four school types (A, B,
C and D) would be 1,440, 960, 480 and 240 respectively./l The facilities
provided would include science laboratories, multipurpose workshops, an
observation/demonstration unit, a library and space for physical education in
addition to classrooms, staff room, offices and communal areas (Table 3.3).
These facilities would enable the project primary teacher training schools to
train about 28,ono teachers in new teaching methods and would permit adoption
of new training techniques. Of the total of 60 schools, 50 are located in
provinces where the supply of new primary school teachers falls short of
demand (Tables 2.1 and 3.2). Over 80% of the 60 schools would be in the two
smallest size types reflecting the need to open new facilities in more
sparsely settled areas. With less than 400 new student places to be added
under this component, its principal purpose is qualitative improvement of
facilities rather than quantitative expansion. Laboratories and workshops
would be designed to train students and teachers to prepare and use
instructional materials.
3.04      Primary Sports Teacher Training School Improvement.   To support the
Government's plan (para. 1.20) to improve existing schools, the project would
provide assistance to ten primary sports teacher training schools. All
assisted schools would be type C (i.e. 480 students), the minimum initial size
for efficient use of facilities and staff. The project would include furni-
ture and equipment for four special rooms, namely library, multipurpose room,
facilities for observation/simulation, rhythm, and for gymnastics and outdoor
/1 The four standardized types of training schools were developed under the
Fifth Education Project.

sports, and construction of classrooms, staffroom, offices and communal
facilities. Locations of the ten assisted schools (Table 3.2) were based on
geographical dispersion, regional needs and availability of qualified staff.
The assisted schools would be able to train students and teachers in physical
education in accordance with the new curriculum utilizing modern teaching and
training methods.
3.05      Staff Development.   To provide staff leadership in making better use
of physical facilities, this component would provide staff training as
follo-is: (a) study tours in research and evaluation in teacher education for
one staff member from each of the 70 assisted schools, and (b) master-s degree
fellowships for a special leadership group for development of these schools.
This fellowship program would assist 48 staff in six-person teams from each of
the 8 teacher training regions. The teams would comprise: (i) subject specia-
lists in language, mathematics, social studies and science, (ii) a specialist
in pedagogy; and (iii) a specialist in primary school physical education and
health. The study tour and fellowship participants would be expected to
represent the schools in a coordinated effort within each teacher training
college region to develop a national plan for an integrated teacher training
system (para. 3.10). This program would continue the ongoing staff develop-
ment program started in Project V. The staff development program would be
reinforced with provision of one advisor in the management of teacher
education for each region for three project years. These eight advisors
would work with the participants in the staff development program and school
principals as well as other school staff to promote: (a) effective use of
project assistance (facilities, equipment and staff development; and (b) an
integrated regional program of teacher training working with advisors provided
under secondary teacher training (para. 3.09), special education (para. 3.13)
and inservice training (para. 3.19) components. The advisors would report to
the Directorate of Teacher Training but be stationed in their region, probably
near the regional TTC.

Preservice Training of Secondary Teachers (Proposed outlay: US$38.1 million
excluding contingencies)
3.06      To assist the Government to expand its secondary teacher training
system to meet growing pupil enrollment and to promote qualitative improve-
ment, the project would assist 11 secondary teacher training colleges through
provision of expanded and improved physical facilities and equipment supported
by a concentrated staff development program (Table 3.4). Overall, 16,000
additional student spaces would be provided to partially meet the demand for
new secondary teachers (Table 2.2). Added facilities would include general
and specialized classrooms, laboratories, workshop and micro-teaching units,
including furniture and equipment for each type of space. Emphasis in equip-
ment will be on improvement and expansion of the libraries of the 11 project
colleges. The quantity and quality of existing facilities have been taken
into account in determining the amount of assistance to be provided to each
location on the following criteria:
General Classrooms: sufficient to seat half of the enrollment at one
time.
Science Laboratories: sufficient to house one-fourth of present and
expanded enrollment in sciences to permit an increase in proportion of
the scievne curricula taught in a laboratory setting.
Workshops: to accommodate present and proposed enrollment in such
fields as industrial arts, home economics and commercial subjects.
Observation/Demonstration Units: facilities would be intended to
supplement programs for practical experience in nearby secondary
schools. The number of student spaces is limited to Allow for develop-
ment of a more effective use pattern. If the improved utilization
materializes, more units would be added in future teacher training
projects.
Library: sufficient space to house a number of volumes equal to eight
times enrollment.

3.07      The staff development program would have two major objectives:
(a) develop a stronger cadre of teachers and managers in the colleges; and
(b) help the colleges to retain and attract quality personnel. The program
would enable about 150 academic staff to complete master's-level programs and
100 to complete doctoral-level programs. These fellowships would be divided
about equally between existing and new staff since such inducements are needed
to enable the colleges to retain their best existing staff and attract
promising new personnel. Fellowships would complement the staff development
program now underway in the First Teacher Training Project (para. 3.08).
Programs would emphasize: (i) methods of teaching the principal secondary
school subjects, namely, languages (local and foreign), mathematics, science
and social studies; (ii) administration of, and curriculum development for,
teacher education; and (iii) the philosophy and psychology of education



- 36 -
(including educational psychology and sociology and tests and measurements).
In view of the need for improved management at colleges 33 study tours and
fellowships are included for 2 categories of staff:
(a) study tours in student and space scheduling for two persons (e.g.,
registrars, campus planners) from each project college; and
(b) master's degrees in library science for one library staff of each
project college.
3.08      In order to continue the staff -evelopment program of the First
Teacher Training Project, the projec- would include a continuing inservice
training program for teacher training staff which would accommodate about
1,400 teacher training staff in one-month seminars twice during the project
period. This program would also continue the curriculum and program develop-
ment program of the First Project. The over 1,800 persons benefitting from
the degree and study tour programs and the inservice training would be
expected to play leadership roles in the regional development teams
(para. 3.05) consisting of representatives of primary teacher training/sports
teacher training schools and secondary teacher training college staff and
national and provincial education offices.
3.09      Specialist services for the secondary teacher training college
component would comprise:
(a)  Teams of national advisors in 14 subject areas related to teacher
training and curriculum and materials development; and
(b)  Specialists in college management and administration and planning
of teacher education totaling ten man-years. This program would
also include scheduling and library management to complement the
staff development plans described above.
The subject area advisors would report to the project subunit under the
Director General for Higher Education (para. 5.06 and Chart B) and continue
the work begun under Project V in examining and improving teacher training
in each major subject area included in the curriculum. Their duties would
also influence primary teacher training and inservice training, especially
the programs of the national subject matter centers (para. 3.16) and it would
be necessary to establish contacts with the Directorate of Teacher Training
to render advice to the primary teacher training schools (para. 3.05). The
management specialists wr Id be ncminally under the same subunit but would
be regionally located to work with the rectors and other managers within the

region of colleges (and university education faculties) to promote more
efficient and productive teacher training.
3.10      Integrated Preservice Teacher Training Plan.   To overcome structural
and managerial constraints to effective teacher education (para. 2.05), the
project would include a series of interrelated studies. To promote completion
of these studies, a special unit would be established under the Project
Coordinating Secretariat (para. 5.04) which is intended to bridge the gap
between the two project units. The studies would include:
(a) Integration of Schools and Colleges. The creation of the college
regions (adopted in 1980) (para. 1.23, Annex 4, Tables 2.1 and 2.2)
was a constructive step toward a more logical and integrated
system. However, to achieve a fully integrated system would
require national policy determinations on the relation of college
centers and other training colleges to the teacher training
schools /1 located within the region. The staff development and
specialist services arrangements for the two components recognize
this relationship but, at present, no official policy has been
developed.
(b) Expansion of Secondary Teacher Training Colleges. The additional
16,000 student spaces would meet about 50% of the need for new
teachers in 1995/96 (Table 3.4). The pr-oposed project would add
enrollment principally by bringing the existing strongest colleges
up to or near their optimum enrollment levels. Planning for the
future will require development of continuing national policy on
the size, location and structure of the remaining colleges in the
system.
(c) More efficient operation of schools and colleges. Although
improved by recent policy changes, schools and colleges continue
to have low student/staff ratios and light teacher loads. The
study should propose means to improve these aspects in accordance
with the Ninth Project.
(d) Effects of Proposed Restructuring of Education Organization
A current report on education has recommended two changes which
would surely affect teacher training (paras. 2.09-2.12):
(i) A change to an 8-4 basic and secondary school organization.
The eight years of basic education would be divided into two
cycles: a compulsory primary segment of five years and an
upper cycle of three years.
/1 Includes primary teacher training schools and primary sports teacher
training schools.



- 39 -
(ii) Entry into primary preservice teacher training delayed to
postsecondary (i.e., the primary teacher training schools
would be upgraded to postsecondary education), probably
renamed and possibly placed under the Director General for
Higher Education.
The executive officer of the Project Coordination Secretariat would select the
staff for these studies, drawing upon the leadership of the two directorates
general, school principals and college rectors and the several categories of
specialists.
Special Education (Proposed Outlay: US$14.2 million excluding contingencies)
3.11      The special education component has two specific targets:
(a)  to establish better training facilities for teachers of handicapped
children so that an adequate supply of qualified teachers is
readily available for improved and expanded national programs in
special education (para. 1.24); and
(b)  to develop a national strategy in special education including inter
alia:
(i) assessment of the incidence of the several categories
of handicaps (para. 1.14) among the school-age population;
(ii) formulation of national policy on the educational
programs needed to address the problem (para. 1.14);
(iii) school location analysis for special education showing
locations for special education;
(iv) national estimates of the number of teachers needed by 1995/96
for service in all modes and types of special education; and
(v)  analysis of the capLtal and recurrent costs of special
education.
During negotiations the Government agreed to prepare the national special
education strategy by December 31, 1983 and to submit a copy to the Bank for
review.
3.12      Special Education Teachers' Training Colleges.    To improve and
moderately expand training of teachers of handicapped children, the project
would finance construction, furniture and equipment for two new, and upgra-
ding of four existing, colleges and related technical assistance. The six
colleges would provide training for about 2,400 teachers of handicapped
children. In order to provide ready access during training to handicapped
children, each college would include a laboratory school on its campus. In
addition, a group of nearby primary and lower secondary schools would be



- 40 -
assembled where special education would be practiced in schools also enrolling
normal children. In this way graduates would be suitably prepared for either
mode of instruction.
3.13      In view of the nation's nearly total lack of staff adequately
trained in special education, the project would include a fellowship and
specialist services program for staff of special education colleges:
(a) doctoral degree training for the chief educational officer of
each college (the dean);
(b) master's degree fellowships in the administration of special
education for the principal, deputy principal or promising persons
being groomed as potential principals of each college; and
(c) master's degree training for the chairmen of each college's five
departments.
Fellowships would also be provided for staff of the Directorate General for
Primary and Secondary Education and BP3K who provide leadership in special
education within the Ministry of Education and Culture. The fellowship
program would begin operation at the outset of the project so that newly
trained leaders would be available when new and expanded facilities are ready
for use. This program would not obstruct continuing operation of the present
program because: (a) part of the fellowship program would take place in
Indonesia, thereby permitting fellows to retain some contact with their
institutions; (b) two of the institutions are new, so their staff can be
trained before being employed; and (c) some of the fellows would be drawn from
BP3K and the Directorate of Teacher Training have at present no demanding
management responsibilities. In the selection of fellows, emphasis would be
placed on promising younger educators who would be able to serve for many
years after the project.
3.14      Specialist Services would be provided for two activities:
(a) program, facilities and staff development - teams of
specialists covering the five categories of handicaps for the
duration of the project; and
(b) further development of a national special education strategy
during 1982/83.
While most of the specialist services in special education are expected to be
expatriate, close coordination with staff of the secondary teacher training
colleges offering special education training would be encouraged. The
specialists would officially report to the Directorate of Teacher Training
which has management control of the colleges. In their work on the national



- 41 -
strategy, liaison would be needed with other agencies related to special
education: BP3K, teacher training colleges with departments of special
education, the Ministry of Social Welfare and private schools, colleges and
organizations interested in the field.
Inservice Training (Proposed outlay: US$8.1 million excluding contingencies)
3.15      Component Objectives.   The purpose of this component is to lay the
groundwork for an integrated inservice training program. It would include:
(a) improvement of two types of institutions for inservice training:
(i) national subject matter centers, and (ii) regional inservice
training centers; and
(b) further development of a plan for the implementation of a
national integrated system of inservice training. This planning
report would indicate how the two types of centers developed
principally for preservice training (schools and colleges) could
be involved in a more integrated program.
3.16      National Subject Matter Centers.   In support of the Government's
plan to establish an integrated inservice teacher training system (para. 1.35)
the project would finance construction, furniture and equipment of three
existing centers, one for mathematics in Yogyakarta, one for language in
Jakarta and one for social studies and Pancasila in Malang. Each center would
have capacity for aobout 150 trainees. The facilities provided would include
teaching facilities (classrooms, multipurpose/laboratory workshops, library,
media- and microteaching facilities and a training and developing unit),
service facilities (dormitories, dining room and a religious room) and one
guesthouse for external trainers and housing for 20 permanent staff. These
facilities would enable the centers to:
(a) design and prepare inservice training curricula in their subject
matters in close cooperation with schools and colleges and BP3K;
(b) prepare and develop learning materials and ways of presentation;
and
(c) provide training for trainers who would be working in regional
centers and other inservice training centers.
3.17      Regional Inservice Training Centers.   The Government s plan for
establishing a coordinated inservice teacher training system (para. 1.30)
calls for construction of six new regional centers. Two of these, Menado
and Ambon, would be assisted under the project to serve heretofore neglected
regions of the country. The project would finance construction, furniture



- 42 -
and equipment; and would provide teaching facilities (classrooms,
laboratory/multipurpose workshops, media and micro-teaching rooms, conference
room and a library), service facilities (dormitories for 150 trainees, dining
room and a religious room), and housing for two trainers and five permanent
staff (chief and four section heads). These facilities would enable the
regional centers to conduct training of teachers and administrators; and
provide assistance for decentralized training activities carried out in local
training centers, i.e., primary and lower secondary school centers.
3.18      Staff Training and Technical Assistance.   Technical assistance
(fellowships and expert assistance) on a nationwide /1 basis would be included
in the component to train key staff and assist in development of inservice
training activities. Doctoral-level programs in teacher education/materials
development would be provided to heads and deputy heads of the nine national
subject matter centers; and master's-level programs in subject matter would be
provided to the division head of each center. Master s-level programs in
educational administration would also be provided to regional center heads.
Three man-years of specialist services in primary and secondary inservice
teacher training would also be provided.
Training in Educational Administration (Proposed Outlay: US$4.1 million,
excluding contingencies)
3.19      Unit for Educational Administration.   The project would assist the
Government to improve and expand a newly established Unit for Educational
Administration (UEA) as a national institution for quality improvement of
educational administrators. The project would include financing for construc-
tion of the center, furniture and equipment and related technical assistance.
The UEA, to be located near Jakarta, would be a residential institution with a
capacity for about 250 trainees. It would: (a) develop training programs,
methods and materials for educational administrators; (b) train and upgrade
administrative school staff and educational officers; (c) train trainers of
decentralized school administration training; (d) evaluate training programs
and materials; and (e) undertake research and development.
3.20      The UEA would be headed by an executive officer under whose
direction there would be four divisions responsible for: training; course
and materials development; developmental work and evaluation; and information
service to educational administrators. The permanent staff of the UEA would
be recruited from among experienced educational administrators and
/1 Fellowship and specialist services would be extended to all existing
national subject matter centers and regional inservice training centers,
not just those included in the project for construction and equipment.

educators and would include a principal, four heads of divisions (one of whom
would be deputy head principal), eight trainers, five curriculum/materials
development staff, three staff for evaluation and deve'.upmental work, two
documentation staff and administrative and support staff. To enable staff to
carry out their new responsibilities, the project would finance programs in
education and administration at doctoral level for the principal and two
senior staff and at master's level for eight more staff. In addition, eight
man-years of expert services in educational administration would be provided.
The Government has agreed to appoint a planning group, consisting mainly of
local and foreign experts from the Fifth Education Project, which would
prepare: (a) a tentative staff training program for the UEA; and (b) a
tentative schedule and a program outline for future decentralized training of
headmasters.
Evaluation and Development of Future Projects (Proposed outlay: US$2.7 mil-
lion)
3.21      Monitoring and Evaluation.   Building on the evaluation element
started in the Fifth Project, the Government would establish a monitoring and
evaluation system covering both the project implementation process and the
overall project impact in relation to its immediate and long-term objectives.
Topics to be evaluated include:
(a) numbers of teachers and administrators provided preservice and
inservice training under the project compared to preproject
levels;
(b) knowledge, skills and attitudes of teachers before, during and
after training;
(c) use of training by teachers in and outside the classrooms and
administrators in and outside their offices;
(d) effects of training on pupil achievement, enrollment, attendance
and attitude toward education;
(e) effects of improved system for guidance and placement of teachers;
(i.e., whether graduates from preservice training institutions
enter teaching); and
(f) effects of increased support of teachers through improved
supervision programs.
Execution of the project monitoring and evaluation program will be a respon-
sibility of the Project Coordinating Secretariat working with the two project
units and drawing upon the leadership of the advisors to each component.
Twelve study tours would be provided for Secretariat and project unit staff to



- 44 -
help them in this regard (Table 3.5) and a fraction of the time of each
component advisor would be especially reserved for contributions to the
overall evaluation program (Table 3.6).    Two man-years of specialist services
would be provided to assist the combined evaluation and management elements of
the project (Table 3.6).   Agreements on the scope and methods for the evalua-
tion program would be sent to the Bank for review before Board Presentation.
Staff Development Summary
3.22      A fellowship program is included in each component to provide
leadership and specialized competence (Table 3.5). Doctoral and master's
degree levels of fellowships have been designed in keeping with the Govern-
ment's policy which calls for no more than two years of overseas study and for
articulation between overseas and local programs of study. A total of 73 man-
years of specialist services are included to cover professional voids resul-
ting from the staff training program, and provide specialist services not now
available to the Government (Table 3.6).

4.03      Basis of Cost Estimate.   Base costs refer to December 1981 prices.
Construction costs have been calculated by using the results of recently
completed prototypes. Regional cost differences have been taken into
account using a government index which is summarized in Table 4.3. These
unit costs are in the median range of comparable costs in other East Asian
countries.

(Price/sq m in US$)

Simple structure, 2-story, varying spans             296           168
Average area per student place is modest, as shown in Table 4.4.
Table 4.4: AREAS PER STUDENT PLACE
Area/student
Type of institution                 place (sq m)
Primary teacher training school         3.6
Sports teacher training school          6.2
Special teacher training school         8.5
Secondary teacher training              4.0
These unit areas include both new institutions as well as incremental areas
to existing facilities divided by the incremental enrollment.
4.04      Equipment cost has been established by using preliminary equipment
lists. New equipment would be provided both for existing structures and
for new primary teacher training schools. Furniture cost has been estimated
as a proportion of building cost. The estimated amount is deemed reasonable
in light of information on recently constructed prototypes. Professional
fees (estimated at an average of 12% of construction costs) would be lower



- 52 -
than standard fees because of the highly repetitive nature of the design.
Specialist (expatriate) services costs are based on US$6,700/man-month
inclusive of salaries, allowances and international air fares. Foreign
fellowship costs are estimated at US$1,500/ man-month and local fellowship
costs at US$450/man-month.
4.05      Contingencies.   Project cost estimates include contingency allow-
ances for: (a) physical factors (US$9.9 million) estimated at 9.6% of the
base cost of each expenditure category except "Experiments and Studies," for
which no contingency allowance is made for physical factors; and (b) price
increases (US$36.4 million) estimated at 36% of base cost plus physical
contingencies. Annual price escalation for local prices is estimated at 14%
for 1982, 12% for 1983 and 10% for subsequent years. Foreign price increases
are estimated at 8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983-85, and 6% for subsequent years.
4.06      Foreign Exchange Component.   The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$80.0 million, or about 53% of total project costs. This
foreign exchange component was derived from analyses of the amounts and
composition of imported equipment and technical assistance under the proposed
project. The resulting foreign exchange proportions amount to: (a) 35% for
construction and site development; (b) 75% for equipment and furniture;
(c) 20% for professional fees; (d) 72% for fellowships; and (e) 95% for
specialists.
4.07      Customs duties and taxes amount to about 3% of total project cost,
including contingencies. No customs duties are levied on educational equip-
ment if directly imported by the Government.
4.08      Project Financing.   Of the total project cost of US$150.0 mil-
lion, the Bank would finance US$80.0 million, or 100% of the foreign
exchange costs (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). The Government would provide the
remaining US$70.0 million. The project would be financed as shown in
Table 4.5.
4.09      Recurrent Cost.   The project's impact on recurrent costs would be
in two forms: (a) primary effect: costs of teacher training, and (b)
secondary effect: costs of the education of additional enrollment resulting
from increased teacher supply. Primary effect. About 19,000 additional
preservice teacher training spaces would result from the project /1 and
based on current unit costs this would increase annual recurrent costs by
US$12-13 million or about 0.6% of the present total recurrent costs of
education. Addition of new recurrent costs of inservice and administrative
training would not bring the total of the primary effect to 1%. Secondary
effect. The additional teachers would permit the enrollment of about
/1 Primary teacher training school - 400, primary sports teacher training
school - 1,200, special education teacher training colleges - 1,400 and
teacher training colleges - 16,000.

500,000 additional pupils in primary and secondary schools and in special
education. The recurrent costs of this added enrollment is estimated at
about US$100 million (current prices) per year or 5.0% of the present total.
In actual practice, however, it would not be the project that would cause
these increased recurrent costs but the demographic profile of the society
and the national policy to extend full enrollment through the basic
education years (grades 1-9). Most of the children would be enrolled even
if teachers were not trained for them.
Disbursement Procedures
4.10      The proposed loan of US$80.0 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of six years, as shown in Table 4.6.

contracts for monitoring, evaluation, studies and preparation of
future projects, but excluding the cost of local program and
curriculum development.
To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in
amounts of US$50,000 or more prior to submission to the Bank for reimburse-
ment. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1988.

5. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Structure and Staffing
5.01      Project implementation would be based on the management structure
established under the first teacher training project. This structure would be
strengthened by drawing upon experienced project staff in the Directorate of
Teacher Training of the Director General (DG) of Primary and Secondary
Education and the Directorate of Academic Affairs of the DG of Higher
Education. Cohesion and coordination would be achieved by the establishment
of a high-level Steering Council and a working-level Coordinating Committee
assisted by a Project Coordinating Secretariat (Chart B). This organization
would also liaise with the Coordination Team for the procurement of Infra-
structure and Resources for Formal Education established by the Ministerial
Decree No. 0195/p/1980.
5.02      The Steering Council would be a high-level policy committee composed
of four director general-level personnel (Chart B). This committee would meet
only when there are policies and issues which cannot be resolved at the
working level.
5.03      The Project Coordinating Committee would be a working-level body.
Members of this Committee would be appointed on an ex-officio basis from the
following agencies: the Bureau of Personnel, the Unit for Educational
Administration, the Directorate of Primary Education, the Directorate of
Teacher Training, the Directorate of Academic Affairs, and the Curriculum
Development Center. This Committee would convene as often as necessary to
ensure coordination and compatibility of programs and procedures of the two
project units.
5.04      The Project Coordinating Secretariat would be a small but signifi-
cant office manned by an executive officer and several support staff. This
Secretariat would be responsible for: (a) preparing a composite implementa-
tion schedule and plan; (b) liaising with the Bank on matters concerning all
project components; (c) collecting implementation data from all components and
preparing periodic reports; (d) monitoring and evaluating implementation
progress of each project unit; (e) submitting project execution issues to the
Project Coordinating Committee (para. 5.03) for decision making; and (f) after
liaison with the Committee, forwarding unresolved problems and issues to the
attention of the Steering Council (para. 5.02). This Secretariat would report
to the Project Coordinating Committee. Agreement was reached during negot-
iations on the maintenance of the Steering Council, the Coordinating Committee
and the Project Coordinating Secretariat throughout the project period.
5.05      Day-to-day management of project activities would be conducted by
two project units under two directorates. The Directorate of Teacher
Training would be responsible for management of the following: (a) 60 primary



- 56 -
teacher training schools; (b) 10 primary sports teacher training schools; (c)
6 special education teacher training colleges; (d) 3 national subject matter
centers; and (e) 2 regional inservice teacher training centers. The
Directorate of Teacher Training would also be responsible for the Unit for
Educational Administration which is administratively under the Secretary
General's office. The Directorate of Academic Affairs would manage the
component for the 11 secondary teacher training colleges. The rationale for
having project components managed by two directorates is that these
directorates are under separate directors general: Primary and Secondary
Education, and Higher Education. Each directorate general is autonomous,
reporting directly to the Minister.   Moreover, counterpart and operating funds
flow down each directorate general line of authority.
5.06      In order to implement the project effectively, the Ministry of
Education and Culture would strengthen two existing project units in each of
the two directorates concerned with project management (para. 5.05). These
units are staffed with professionals who have experience from previous Bank-
assisted projects, especially the First Teacher Training Project. Each of
these units would be headed by a director who also heads the related direc-
torate. The project unit in the Directorate of Teacher Training would have
three co-directors: the Director of the Unit for Educational Administration,
the Director for Primary Education, and the Director for General Secondary
Education. These three co-directors are directly responsible for the
operation of the institutions included in the project. General project
implementation would be managed by an assistant director. One or more
officers would be appointed to take charge of educational aspects of the
project.  The appointment of the finance officer, the procurement officer, the
project architect and the secretary would complete the professional staff
requirement.
Administrative Responsibilities
5.07      Detailed functions of the two project units would fall into three
categories: professional services, educational services and administrative
services.
Professional Services
(a)  Engagement of consulting architects, preparation of architects
briefs, monitoring of civil works designs, prequalification of
contractors, tendering and award of civil works and furniture
contracts and supervision of the construction program.
(b) Preparation of equipment lists and specifications, preparation of
equipment bidding documents, tendering, evaluation of bid
proposals and contract awards, arrangement of equipment
deliveries, installation, use, and maintenance of equipment.



- 57 -
Educational Services
(a) Preservice training in primary teacher training and sports teacher
training schools, and in secondary teacher training colleges:
(i) improvement of curriculum and teaching programs of all
preservice institutions using experience gained under the
First Teacher Training Project;
(ii) allocation of responsibilities to institutions (i.e.,
decidi.ig which institutions will be converted or
discontinued);
(iii) technical assistance planning.
(b) Special education:
(i) arrangement of studies of special education (paras. 3.11 and
3.14);
(ii) allocation of functions to special education teacher training
schools;
(iii) technical assistance planning.
(c) Inservice training in national subject matter centers and regional
teacher training centers:
Planning of facilities, equipment, programs and staff training.
(d) Administrator training:
(i) preparation of synchronized plans for Unit for Educational
Administration including facilities, equipment and staff
training;
(ii) development of a system for local inservice training of
administrators; and
(iii) fellowship and technical assistance planning.
(e)  Evaluation
Development and execution (with the Project Coordinating Secre-
tariat) of an overall evaluation program covering, inter alia,
numbers of teachers trained (pre- and inservice), teacher
placement arrangements, teacher training in relation to the
Secondary Textbook Project, student achievements in relation to
teacher training and textbooks, and parent/community relations.



- 58 -
Administrative Services
(a) Coordination of hardware and software aspects of all project
components to ensure compliance with government plans and project
objectives;
(b) Engagement of an executing agency (agencies) for fellowships and
specialist services, and placement of fellows for local and
overseas training;
(c) Development of budget procedures for counterpart and recurrent
funds, statistics and management information systems as well as
procedures to analyze and improve staff, equipmenit and space
utilization;
(d) Preparation of project budgets, monitoring and control of project
costs in accordance with allocations and procedures;
(e) Maintenance of records and accounts, preparation and submission of
disbursement applications and financial statements through the
Project Coordinating Unit to the Bank;
(f) Monitoring and evaluatiorn of progress and submission through the
Project Coordinating Unit of periodic reports to the Bank.
Technical Assistance Procedures
5.08      There would be an extensive program of technical assistance under
the project - 516 fellowships and 73 man-years of specialist services
(Tables 3.5 and 3.6). Careful planning is therefore needed to synchronize
fellowship training and appointment of specialists with physical
implementation and the launching of programs specified in the project.
5.09      The success of the fellowship programs depends on the recruitment of
qualified candidates and their subsequent placement to permit them to make
contributions to the project. To ensure a good start of this program, the
Government has selected about 25% of project-financed fellows to start in
summer 1982. The Government would also select suitable organization(s) to
recruit and place specialists promptly at a reasonable cost to the project.
Procedures, criteria and timetables for selection of fellowship candidates as
well as the packaging, recruitment and assignment of specialist services were
reviewed during negotiations and found acceptable.



- 59 -
Procurement Procedures
5.10      Civil Works Designs.   Under the Fifth Education project (Loan 1433-
IND) a consortium of architects was engaged as a consulting firm for
architectural and engineering designs. The same consortium has been hired to
prepare designs for this project. For the simple and repetitive designs
required for the primary teacher training schools and the primary sports
teacher training schools, a reduction has been obtained in the standard
consulting fee, which is 14% of construction cost. Topographical surveys and
preparation of sketch plans for the first phase construction have been
completed.
5.11      Equipment.   Equipment master lists have been reviewed by the
appraisal missions and found acceptable. These lists were refined before
negotiations with updated unit costs by local experts and selected staff of
project institutions. Work on specifications is in progress.
5.12      Previous projects have experienced delays in implementation of their
educational programs because vital equipment was not delivered on time.
Well-planned phasing of equipment procurement for the 90 project institutions
is therefore necessary to ensure synchronization between equipment deliveries
and the completion of building facilities. A system of equipment deliveries,
e.g., inspection of delivered equipment, would be planned by the project units
because the dispersed locations of project institutions and the amount and
volume of equipment to be procured preclude centralized receiving and ware-
housing. Sophisticated equipment would need special care in installation,
usage and maintenance. During negotiations, the Government agreed to make
adequate provision for installation of equipment procured under the project.
Procurement
5.13      It is expected that civil works and equipment would be grouped to
form attractive bid packages. The contracts for the 12 civil works bid
packages expected to exceed US$1.0 million equivalent in estimated value and
totaling about US$15 million would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. The civil works for
the remaining institutions would cost less than US$1.0 million apiece.
Contracts for these civil works bid packages would be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding under government procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for
equipment bid packages exceeding US$160,000 equivalent estimated value would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). In bid
comparison, local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%
on the c.i.f. cost of equipment, or the existing customs duty, whichever is
lower. Equipment items which cannot be grouped to form bid packages of
US$160,000 equivalent or more in estimated value would be awarded without
prior Bank review on the basis of local competitive bidding satisfactory



- 60 -
to tne Bank, subject to an aggregate total value of items so procured not
exceeding US$5 million equivalent. Miscellaneous equipment items in packages
not exceeding US$32,000 estimated value, and subject to an aggregate total not
exceeding US$3 million equivalent estimated value, could be purchased
off-the-shelf on the basis of at least three price quotations. Bidders for
civil works would be prequalified in accordance with normal government
procedures. All tenders would be awarded on the basis of standard tender and
contract documents agreed with the Bank during negotiations. Except as the
Bank shall otherwise agree bid evaluation and contract awards for all civil
works and for that equipment procured under ICB would require prior Bank
review. Specialist services will be procured through one or more consulting
firms, with all such procurement carried out in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981), as agreed during negotiations.
A short list of proposed consulting firms was provided by the Borrower during
negotiations.
5.14      Project Accounts.   Two project units (para. 5.07) would establish
and maintain separate project-related accounts. These would be operational
from the commencement of project implementation. Accounts would be maintained
in accordance with sound and generally recognized accounting principles and
practices satisfactory to the Bank to enable the project units to provide
interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial performance
and position of the project. During negotiations it was agreed that annual
financial statements would be provided to the Bank, together with an opinion
and the report of the Director of State Audit on such statements, within six
months of the close of the fiscal year, until one year after the Closing Date.
The foregoing accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements would
provide adequate and timely information to the Bank for supervision of
disbursements and general project implementation.
State of Preparation
5.15      Physical implementation of the project would be executed in three
phases as shown in Table 5.1. The implementation schedule is shown in
Annex 5. Phase I implementation is scheduled as follows: (a) site acquisi-
tion and surveys have been completed; (b) consultant architects have been
appointed; (c) site layouts and sketch plans have been completed; (d) first
construction tender documents are scheduled for completion in April 1982 and
first tendering is to start by the end of July 1982, with all Phase I tender
documents to be completed by September 1982; (e) master equipment lists are
completed, and tender documents for Phase I equipment are scheduled for
completion by June 30, 1982; (f) Terms of Reference for specialists have been

important if physical facilities are to be ready in time to admit the first
groups of project students/participants at the beginning of the 1984/85
academic year. Phase II construction would start in mid-1983. Only prelim-
inary steps (preparation of designs and tender documents) would be undertaken
for Phase III institutions. Local training, either as a part of regular
activities or as an integral part of overseas training, would start in June
1982. Overseas training and the appointment of specialists would start about
September 1982. Project implementation would be completed by June 30, 1987.
The Closing Date would be June 30, 1988.

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01       Five principal benefits are expected to result from the proposed
project:
(a)  enhanced quality in pre- and inservice primary and secondary
teacher training through improved facilities, equipment and staff
development;
(b)  expanded output of secondary teachers to meet expected significant
increases in demand through an addition of 16,000 sfudent spaces
in secondary teacher training colleges;
(c)  provision of institutions in special education, teacher training
and educational administration to initiate the development,
improvement and expansion of systems in these areas;
(d)  expansion and further experimentation in the design of inservice
training with a view toward subsequent project assistance; and
(e)  development of strategies for the improvement of the structure and
operation of all types of institutions involved in educational
training.
6.02       The quantitative expansion of colleges would meet about half of the
deficit expected by 1995/96 and the primary teacher training and sports
teacher training school coverage would be systematically related to numerical
demand by province and size of institutions. In this way the efficiency of
preservice teacher training would be enhanced. Infrastructure to produce a
cadre of special education teachers would be created so that future improve-
ments in this area would not have to wait for staff development. The stage
will be set for assistance to inservice training needs in the future. A new
institution for educational administration training would be established to
form the nucleus for expanded and improved training during the remainder of
the century.
Risks
6.03       The project comprises institutional development and expansion, and
planning of future directions and policy in the teacher education subsector.
The implementing units (para. 5.06) will be required to handle diverse
activities: construction on over 90 sites, a fellowship program covering over
500 individuals, and a specialist services program totaling over 73 man-years.
One risk is that the complexity and number of decisions to be made will delay
implementation. Offsetting this risk are the facts that the project has many



- 63 -
characteristics of a repeater project since many related activities were
conducted in the First Teacher Training Project; and that most of the
implementation staff was involved in the previous project. In addition, the
project design includes: (a) an improved implementation structure which more
realistically parallels government structure; and (b) a high level of
specialist services adequate to meet the demands of the study and the
experimentation aspects of the project.
6.04      Another related risk is that the Government, when faced with a
critical shortage of teachers, will proceed with crash remedies inconsistent
with the present project. Rapid implementation of the proposed project could
r,educe pressure to do this. Agreements to be reached on the various studies
and strategies will point out the disadvantages of hasty policy decisions.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMED3NDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the Government and the Bank reached agreement
on:
(a)  a staff training program for the Unit for Educational. Admini-
stration and a schedule and a program outline for future decen-
tralized training programs for headmasters (para. 3.20); and
(b)  procedures, criteria and timetables for selection of fellowship
candidates and the packaging, recruitment and assignment of
specialist services (paras. 5.09 and 5.13).
7.02      During negotiations, the Bank received agreements or assurances from
the Government:
(a) on a timetable for completion of the national strategy paper on
special education (paras. 3.11 and 3.14);
(b)  on the scope and methods for the evaluation program (para. 3.21);
(c)  on the maintenance of the Steering Council, the Coordinating
Committee and the Project Coordinating Secretariat throughout
the project period (para. 5.04);
(d)  that adequate provisions would be made for installation of project
equipment (para. 5.12); and
(e)  that it would furnish the Bank with financial statements for all
components audited by independent auditors, not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year, until one year after the
Closing Date (para. 5.14).



- 64 -
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would consti-
tute a suitable basis for a loan of US$80.0 million equivalent on standard
Bank terms to Indonesia. The Bank loan would be for a term of 20 years
including a 5-year grace period.

SECOND TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Achievement Test Scores in Relation to Social,
Economic and Educational Variables
Primary
1.        There were no differences in achievement between the sexes, in any
subject. Younger children scored higher than older children in grade 6,
largely because the older pupils often are repeaters with very low achievement
levels. Children who had poor eyesight or hearing also achieved very low
scores. Homework showed a curvilinear relationship with weaker children doing
either very little or a great deal of homework. As regards type of school,
private school children showed much higher achievement levels than children in
state or subsidized private schools. Surprisingly, children in large classes
and large schools performed better than those in small classes and small
schools. Teachers with longer training and experience, older teachers, and
women teachers were all associated with better pupil achievement levels.
Overall, higher achievement was shown by pupils in schools with school
libraries, many classroom facilities, and teachers who used modern methods,
frequent tests and regular homework. The relationship of these social and
educational factors to pupil achievement indicates that more and better
teacher training is one avenue to increased achievement.
Secondary
2.        The following factors were found to have an effect on the achieve-
ment scores of grade 9 pupils:
(a)  School libraries were consistently associated with higher
achievement.
(b) Use of Bahasa Indonesia in the home is related to higher
achievement in urban areas but in rural areas this variable does
not affect achievement.
(c)  Morning attendance (rather than afternoon) results in higher
achievement suggesting that more attention needs to be given to
afternoon lower secondary schools which share facilities with
morning schools.

(d) Urban pupils of teachers who have been upgraded by special
inservice training show higher achievement, particularly in
mathematics and science. But the same does not apply to rural
pupils.
(e)  Scholarship bolders perform significantly lower than regular
students indicating that the Government's policy of providing
assistance to poor but supposedly bright pupils is not working.
