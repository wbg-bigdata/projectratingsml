PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
BURUNDI
AGRIBUSINESS PROMOTION PROJECT
(Credit 2419-BI)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Agribusiness Promotion Project, for
which credit 2419-BI in the amount of SDR 2.3 million (US$3.1 million equivalent) was
approved on September 3, 1992 and made effective on January 8, 1993.
The credit was closed on June 12, 1997 at Government's request, almost two years
before its scheduled closing date of March 31, 1999, and the cumulative undisbursed balance of
SDR 2,046,362 (US$2,830,589 equivalent) was canceled effective April 15, 1997.1  Parallel
financing for the project was to be provided by the Government of Belgium in the amount of
US$0.1 million equivalent, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (now Caisse
Francaise de Developpement) in the amount of US$0.1 million equivalent and the European
Union in the amount of US$1.2 million equivalent.
The PCN was prepared by Dirk Nicolaas Prevoo, Agricultural Cluster 3, and reviewed
by Joseph Baah-Dwomoh, Technical Manager, Agricultural Cluster 2 and Nils Tcheyan,
Director, Country Department 9.
The PCN has been prepared in lieu of an Implementation Completion Report, because of
the short period of implementation and low disbursements. Preparation of the PCN was based on
material in the project files and discussions with Bank staff involved in the project's preparation
and supervision.
A first cancellation in the amount of SDR 2,046,325 was made effective April 19, 1996; a second
cancellation in the amount of SDR 37 needed to be made for administrative reasons effective April
15, 1997.

Implementation Assessment
Introduction
1.    As part of its structural adjustment program, the Government of Burundi designed a new
agricultural sector policy in 1988. The new approach signaled a shift in the role of Government from
producer and processor to one of regulator and promoter, and emphasized the development of the private
sector by simplifying the regulatory framework constraining it. However, progress was slow or
unsatisfactory in the reform and privatization of public enterprises and in the broadening of private sector
activities in processing and exports. Progress in the two areas is closely linked because the private sector
could not compete in areas where public enterprises dominated the market, as it was denied the tax and
duty privileges, as well as the preferential credit access and subsidies which public enterprises enjoyed.
2.        As part of the third phase of the adjustment program, supported by the Third Structural
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2376-BI), the Government had decided to accelerate the public enterprise reform
program and the liberalization of private sector activities. The Government, which had initially decided
to limit privatization of key agro-industries to management only, now supported privatization of
ownership or leasing of assets. The Government issued a Letter of Agribusiness Development Policy,
which included the following measures: (i) action plan and timetable for privatization of: the Burundi
Tea Board (OTB, Office du the du Burundi; tea production and processing), the Cotton Company
(COGERCO, Compagnie du gerance du coton; seed-cotton production and ginning), the Moso Sugar
Company (SOSUMO, Societt sucriere du Moso; sugar production and processing) and the Imbo
Regional Development Company (SRDI, Societt regionale de developpement de l 'Imbo; rice production
and processing); (ii) promotion of private sector investment in subsectors that were traditionally a public
monopoly, while placing a moratorium on new public investments; (iii) allow mixed-capital agro-
industries to set producer prices, select their own markets and control their extension system; and (iv)
limit public investments in mixed-capital agro-industries to maintain production levels only.
Project Objectives
3.    The project's objectives were to increase and diversify agricultural exports and induce greater
efficiency in agricultural production, processing and marketing, by supporting the Government's efforts
to privatize publicly held agro-industries and by assisting small private entrepreneurs to establish
themselves and develop agri-businesses.
4.    The project included two components:  privatization of publicly held agro-industries and
assistance to small private entrepreneurs. The privatization component was to focus on four enterprises:
OTB, COGERCO, SOSUMO, SRDI, and was to provide: (i) consulting services in investment banking
for preparation and conclusion of leasing of assets and sale of shares; and (ii) training activities to
prepare employees for privatization. The assistance to the private enterprises component was to create



2
an Agri-business Development Fund (ADF) which would share up to half the cost of marketing and
productivity improvement activities with eligible private entrepreneurs and their professional
associations.
5.    The project was to be implemented over a five year period and was to cost US$6.2 million.
Financing was to be provided by IDA (US$3.1 million), the European Union (US$1.2 million), the
Government of Belgium (US$0.1 million) and the Caisse Centrale de Coopdration Economique (now
Caisse Francaise de Developpement, US$0.1 million), private enterprises (US$1.4 million) and the
Government (US$0.3 million).
6.    The project's design was based on the conclusions of an agricultural sector memorandum and
was designed in support of Government's adjustment program and consistent with Government's Letter
of Agribusiness Development Policy, and the Bank's country strategy and experience with private sector
promotion. The project's objectives were clearly defined and the implementation schedule was in line
with expectations at the time and with the framework of the adjustment program. The design of the ADF
was based on successful experiences in India and Kenya. It seems, however, that the management
structure of this relatively small project was top heavy.
Implementation Experience and Results
7.    The credit supporting the project was approved by the Board on September 3, 1992 and made
effective on January 8, 1993. Project implementation was slow from the beginning, especially for the
preparatory studies for the privatization of the public enterprises. The two exceptions were SOSUMO
and COGERCO, where the time table for the studies and preparatory activities was adhered to with only
minor delays. In the case of SOSUMO, a management contract was awarded in September 1992. The
selection of consultants for the management of the ADF was also carried out by the Borrower.
8.    After October 1993, the project (like all other projects in the Bank's portfolio in Burundi) was
greatly affected by the deteriorating security situation following an attempted army coup, which resulted
in the assassination of the president, the president of the National Assembly, and other elected officials.
Although the coup faltered in the face of international opprobrium, it destabilized Burundi's political
situation and rekindled ethnic strife.
9.    Following these events, both foreign and domestic interest in investing in the sector was greatly
reduced, given the perceived high risk profile of the country. Despite this constraint, preparatory studies
for privatization were finalized for all but OTB. Signature of the contract with the consultant company
selected to be manager of the ADF was delayed by the Bank because it felt that even though the technical
proposal by the selected company was sound, the manager proposed by the company lacked the required
private sector experience. Furthermore, the Bank was concerned about the high cost of the contract and
proposed to merge the management of the ADF with the ongoing Private Sector Development Project
(PSD, Cr. 2359-BI), which had a well functioning project unit. The Bank therefore refused to give a
non-objection to the contract. Signature of a contract with an independent manager of the ADF, was a
condition of disbursement for the ADF and the stalemate that arose between the Bank and Government
on the contract issue effectively blocked the fund from becoming effective.
10.   Given the rapidly deteriorating socio-political environment and the associated reduced desire to
invest in the country, compounded with the high likelihood that pursuit of privatization could exacerbate
existing divisions within the society given the existing socio-political and class structures, it was agreed



3
with Government and the cofinanciers in November 1995 that the privatization component would be
canceled. It was also agreed with Government that following the PSD's mid-term review, arrangements
would be made with the PSD for the management of the ADF. Despite the difficult country conditions,
there was still a surprisingly high demand for the kind of activities supported by the ADF. This was
highlighted during seminars held by the World Bank Resident Mission outside of Bujumbura in 1995. It
was subsequently agreed in February 1996, at the time of the mid-term review of the PSD, that the
Development Credit Agreement of this project would be amended to establish an ADF-like fund, but not
limited to the agricultural sector only, and that the credit supporting the Agribusiness Development
Project would be canceled. These agreements were in line with the Bank's policy to streamline and
increase the synergy of its portfolio. The undisbursed balance of SDR 2,046,325 was therefore canceled
at Government's request on April 19, 1996. For administrative reasons, a second cancellation in the
amount of SDR 37 needed to be made, effective April 15, 1997. The credit was closed on June 12, 1997.
The Burundi portfolio was suspended later in 1996 and the required amendments to the credit supporting
the PSD were therefore not enacted. As of June 30, 1997, the credit supporting the PSD was still
suspended.
11.   Project disbursements amounted to only SDR 253,675 or slightly over 10 percent of the credit.
The main expenditures under the project were related to project management, the preparatory study for
the privatization of SRDI and audits of OTB. Total project costs are not known, as it is not known how
much the cofinanciers contributed in terms of consulting services. No ex-ante economic evaluation of
the project was carried out. The Staff Appraisal Report did identify as benefits that the ADF related
project activities were expected to generate incremental fiscal revenue of about 1.5 times the value of the
ADF grant over a period of five years. As the ADF never became effective, this did not occur. No ex-
post economic evaluation was therefore carried out.
12.   Bank performance during preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory. Performance
during supervision was, however, deficient. There was a high turnover of task managers, who were slow
to react to the problems related to the ADF or take decisive action on the privatization component. The
Borrower's performance during project preparation was satisfactory, but deficient during project
implementation, as it was unable to implement the privatization program as agreed from the start, make
the required counterpart funding available to the project or take a pro-active stand on the ADF. Project
management was weak, with a project manager who was slow in following up on problems or keeping
himself informed on developments related to the privatization component, despite his low work load.
Moreover, audit reports were routinely late and progress reports were not issued as required. His
contract was, however, written in such a way that disciplinary action was difficult.
Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
Assessment of Outcome.
13.   The project's overall outcome is highly unsatisfactory. None of the project's objectives were
attained. The preparatory studies that have been carried out to prepare three of the four public
enterprises for privatization will need to be redone if a new privatization program is adopted at some
point in the future, as they no longer reflect the present state of these enterprises. Moreover, the ADF
never got off the ground. Given the lack of accomplishments, sustainability is unlikely.



4
Future Operations.
14.   No future operations are planned. Given the lack of accomplishments under the project, no plan
was developed by the Bofrower for the continued operation of the project. It is unlikely that publicly
owned agro-industries can be successfully privatized in the near to medium-term future, given the high
risk profile of the country and the relatively low profitability of the companies.
Key Lessons Learned.
15.   Two important lessons learned from this project are:
1.    The need to maintain at all times an open dialogue with Government and donors that
have an active interest in privatization activities given their own past or ongoing investment
programs. In the case of this project, the cofinanciers were reluctant to speed up the
privatization process, because of their desire to ensure that past large investments in the public
enterprises were safeguarded and different sensitivities to a changing socio-political
environment. It is important for the Bank to be sensitive to this issue during implementation of a
privatization program.
2.     Project management has to be in line with project activities. In the case of this project, it
was unnecessary to have an implementation unit outside of the technical ministry, because of the
very limited work load (even if the ADF had become effective). Moreover, the duration of the
contracts for project managers must be limited to allow for timely evaluation. In the case of the
project, the contract was for the duration of the project, with only limited scope for performance
evaluation and disciplinary action.

TABLE 9: ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
No ex-ante economic evaluation of the project was carried out. The SAR did identify as benefits that the
ADF related project activities were expected to generate incremental fiscal revenue of about 1.5 times
the value of the ADF grant over a period of five years. As the ADF never became effective, this did not
occur.
