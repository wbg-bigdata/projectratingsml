MEMORANDTJM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOL MENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF BURLTNDI
FOR AN AGRIBUSINESS PROMOTION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Renublic of Burundi for SDR 2.3 million, the equivalent of US$3.096
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project ior an
agribusiness promotion project.
2.   BackgrunA. Burundi is a small, landlocked country in East-Central Africa (27,b34 km2).
Its per capita GDP was about US$215 in 1991. With a population of just over 5 million and a
population growth rate of 3 percent, Burur.di has the second highest density in Africa, estimated at
193 persons per square kilometer. Social indicators are comparable to the average for sub Saharan
Africa. Despite the demographic pressure on already constrained land, rural migration has been
limited: only 6 percent of the total population is urban. The country has limited natural resources
other than relatively fertile agricultural land. Agriculture is the predominant activity, contributing
half of GDP and 90 percent of employment and of export earnings. The most important export crop
is coffee, which on average accounts for about 80 percent of total exports. Burundi is one of the few
African countries that is self-sufficient in food. The secondary sector (mining and manufacturing)
is still small, accounting for about 14 percent of GDP and 5 percent of exports in 1990. The private
sector, whose share of gross fixed investment is about 18 percent (1990), plays a major role in
agricultural production and transport. By comparison, the public sector dominates manufacturing,
energy and infrastructure and contributes half of the country's formal employment. As a landlocked
country, Burundi is vulnerable to transportation problems in neighboring countries.
3.   Burundi's adjustment program, which began in 1985, has made substantial progress towards
stabilizing the economy and laying the foundations for its structural transformation. However, it has
not yet stimulated as strong a supply response as had been expected, pardy because of the remaining
rigidities of the Public Enterprise (PE) sector and also because of the mixed signals given by the
government to the private sector. Public enterprises account for 84 percent of resourcebased
industrial output. Most of them are in a monopsonistic situation and have little incentive to respond
to market signals or to seek new market opportunities and product lines. Perceived as an integral part
of the government, they lack managerial autonomy and benefit from a number of advantages, such
as customs exemptions, tariff protection, favorable tax treatment and preferred access to credit. The
reform of PEs was a major objective of the First and Second Structural Adjustment Program. A
special Public Enterprise Reform Office (SCEP) was created to handle this task, but its performance
in supporting reform has been poor due to weak management and inadequate organization. Hence,
with the exception of the privatization of coffee exports and the management of the coffee processing
industry under the Coffee Sector Project (Credit 2123-BU), results so far have been slow and
disappointing.
4.   Resource-based agro-industries (agro-industries plus textile and leather) account for two-thirds
of total industrial output and for 60 percent of industrial employment. Private firms represent only
25 percent of output of resource-based industries, but 42 percent of employment in the same sector.
There are only about 300 formal, mostly small, such enterprises in the country. Structural adjustment
reforms have already led to an improved enabling environment for private sector development in non-
traditional products (e.g. fruits, vegetables, cut-flowers, dairy products), where producers generally



2
receive a higher share of the world market price than state-administered crops. The number of fruit
and vegetable exporters has increased from 5 to 15 in the last thre -ars. However, these emerging
businesses continue to face serious obstacles to achieve internationa.  .petitiveness. Many obstacles
result from internal and regulatory constraints, including lack of mark,dng skills and poor knowledge
of foreign markets, while others stem from the geographical location of the country and its low level
of development. in recognition of these constraints, the governmem is pursuing its reform program
to improve the private sector's legal and regulatory framework and overall operating environment,
as well as shifting the role of the State from producdon and processing to that of a regulator and
promoter of private sector development.
5.   The Bank intends to support the government's strategy with three operations. The recently
approved Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III), bui'.ding on the lessons learned from the
implementation of tfie first two SACs, supports a full deregulation in the agricultural sector and the
removal of remaining policy constraints to private sector development. The also recently approved
Private Sector Development operation is to provide an APFX line of credit for private entrepreneurs,
together with additional reforms in the regulatory and legal framework as well as in the financial
sector. In parallel to these two operations, the proposed Agribusiness Promotion Project would
support: (a) the break up of monopolies and accelerated privatization of agricultural PI,s; and (b)
the development of small pr vate agribusinesses.
6.   Proiect Obiectives and Description. The project would help to diversify the production and
marketing of agricultural produce (including exports) and stimulate efficiency improvements by
expanding the role of the private sector and actively supporting competition. To this end, the project
would have two components- (i) assistance, to government in privatizing publicly held agro-industries;
(ii) assistance to private entrepreneurs in developing agribusinesses.
(a)  Privatization of Public Agro-Industries. In supporting the government's plan to privatize
agricultural PEs, the project would give special attention to the largest of these agro-industries,
namely: the Burundi Tea Company (OTB); the Cotton Management Company (COGERCO); the
Mosso Sugar Company (SOSUMO), and the Imbo Regional Development Company (SRDI), a rice
producer. It would fund technical assistance to provide specialized services (e.g. socio-economic
evaluation, assets valuation; bidding documents for management contracts, leasing and sale of assets;
and organization of public offerings) to facilitate the privatization process. Technical assistance
would be provided to the Interministerial Committee for privatization (ICP) and to the Technical
Evaluation Commissions (MC). The project would also finance training activities to prepare
employees for privatization and complement management reforms implemented through on-going
projects funded by Belgium, France and the European Communities (EC).
(b) Development of Private Agribusiness. An Agribusiness Development Fund designed to
motivate and assist private firms and their professional associations in the expansion of their business
would provide financing for commercial services to improve their marketing, product development
and technological development. The fund would finance up to 50 percent of related expenses through
a matching fund mechanism which has been successfully introduced in India and Indonesia with Bank
support as an alternative to supply-driven public exports promotion schemes. Eligible expenses for
commercial services to individual firms would be recovered over a period of five years, but local
training organized by professional associations would be financed on a 50:50 basis. Eligible firms
include an estimated 300 firms ir. agribusiness and other resource based industries. Beneficiaries
would typically be small enterprises seeking to develop export markets and diversify the range of
goods produced. Eligible activities would include any activity within a properly formulated export
expansion or import-substitution plan covering: market prospection, product development and



3
adaptation, and sales promotion. The fund would also organize regular entrepreneurship seminars
to reinforce management skills.
7.   Poject Cost and Financin . Total estimated cost is US$6.2 million, subdivided as follows:
technical assistance for PE privatization: US$1.9 million; Agribusiness Development Fund: US$3.2
million; Project administration: US$0.3 million; and contingencies: US$.07 million. IDA financing
would be about US$3.1 million. Co-financing and parallel financing would be provided by the
government, Belgium, France and the EC. The private sector would participate through cost-sharing
of services. Project costs as well as financing arrangements are summarized in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of IDA operations in Burundi are given in Schedule C and D
respectively. A note on projects with significant disbursement lags is provided in the attachment to
Schedule D.
8.    rject Implementation and Management. The privatization component would be implemented
by the SCEP after completion of its reorganization under SAC III. The Agribusiness Promotion Fund
would be managed by an existing financial or commercial institution assisted by international
expertise. A Project Administrator would be appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture for the
duration of the project to handle procurement, disbursements and maintain project accounts.
9.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The PCR for the First and Second Structural
Adjustment Credits identified weak linkages between macro reforms and micro/sectoral policies as
one of the reasons for the mixed performance of the adjustment program, especially as regards public
enterprise reform. Limited achievements on PE restructuring and divestiture were compounded by
SCEP's poor performance, insufficient coordination with other donors and lack of a privatization
strategy. On the other hand, the creation of private sector coffee processing management companies
and the privatization of coffee exports are being successfully promoted under the Coffee Sector
Project (Cr. 2123-BU). The project would provide sector-specific support to the government's
privatization program of other key agro-industries. It would also help small private agribusinesses
to help them overcome marketing obstacles, particularly at the early stages of their development. The
financing of market development and other professional services through the matching fund principle
have been successfully introduced in India and Indonesia and are now being introduced in Kenya with
Bank support. This component would complement services currently provided by IFC's African
Project Development Facility (APDF) which target larger enterprises than those under the proposed
project.
10.  Rationale for IDA Involvement. Taking account of the major findings of the Agricultural
Sector Memorandum, the project was designed as a major contribution to public enterprise reform,
a key objective in the country assistance strategy. The government is committed to the privatization
of agro-industries, but lacks the specialized expertise required. MTe project is part of a package
designed to strengthen the supply response to structural adjustment reforms supported by IDA.
Policy measures to address legal and regulatory constraints are included in the recently approved
Third Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2376-BU) and Private Sector Development Project (Cr.
2359-BU). By providing technical and financial support to private initiatives in agro-industries, a
crucial growth sector in Burundi, the project would help create entrepreneurial talent and develop an
incipient private sector culture. The political sensitivity of privatization in a sector where smallholder
producers are involved and the consequent need for the government to ensure that the process is
transparent and continuous, justifies IDA's coordination of the necessary technical assistance.

11.  Project Sustainability. The privatization process is expected to be completed at the end of the
project. The sustainability of the Agribusiness Development Plnd will be assessed during the mid-
term review of project implementation. Cost recovery of commercial services on a revolving fund
basis would contribute to sustainability of the fund. The fund beneficiaries would be invited to create
a professional organization which would take over the management of the fund from the managing
firm. Operating costs of the fund would be progressively recovered by membership fees.
12.  Agreements Reached. This operation is part of a package which includes the Third Structural
Adjustment Credit and the Private Sector Development Project. Accordingly, many policy conditions
identified as critical for the success of the proposed project have already been included in those two
operations, in particular, the following measures: (i) price liberalization for export crops and for
inputs; (ii) liberalization of coffee, tea and cotton cultivation; (iii) clarification of tiie land code on
pastures and irrigated land; (i-.) simplificatien of regulations for enterprise creation and operation,
and for import-export activities; (v) elimination of Central Bank role in the administration of
procedures for import and export licensing of business firms and individuals in favor of increased
delegation of responsibilities to commercial banks; (vi) elimination of prior accreditation of exporters
and importers by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry; (vii) liberalization of controls limiting the
international transfers of dividends and of salaries of foreign workers in Burundi; (viii) increased
foreign exchange allowances for business travel and tourism; (ix) liberalized international transport
and insurai.ce; and (x) elimination of distinctions in allocating credits, such as between priority and
non-priority sectors, and between rediscountable and non-rediscountable credits. The removal of
these constraints contributes to the establishment of a more favorable working environment for the
private sector and opeLs the way to the privatization and private sector promotion measures to be
implemented under the project.
13.  In addition, the following agreements were reached during negotiations: (i) a letter of
development policy on the agribusiness sector which spells out government divestiture policy in agro-
industries and scope and timetable for privatization; (ii) statement of policies and operating
procedures of the agribusiness development fund, including cost recovery mechanism; (iii) terms of
reference for technical assistance for preparation and implementation of privatization; (iv) terms of
reference of the Project Administrator; and scope, timing and terms of reference of the mid-term
review. Conditions of effectiveness include: (i) the establishment of the Technical Evaluation
Commission for SOSUMO; (ii) the appointment of the Project Administrator and of the accountant,
both with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA; (iii) completion of the reorganization of
SCEP, including the appointment of a financial analyst, a management specialist and a legal advisor;
and (iv) commencement of the recruitment procedure for the consultants services to prepare the
privatization. Conditions of disbursement are the following: (i) submission of a detailed training
program acceptable to IDA; (ii) recruitment of an independent firm to administer the Agribusiness
Development Fund; and (iii) execution of the Fund agreement.
14. Environmental Aspects. Profit maximization objectives by private agro-industries are likely
to induce the development of more efficient use of pesticide (cotton) and fertilizers (tea, cotton and
sugar). This would have a positive effect on the environment and reduce pollution in Lake
Tanganyika. Therefore, the project was assigned Environment Assessment Category C. However,
compliance with existing environmental regulations would be a condition of eligibility for services
to private companies. The introduction of new technologies will be subject to environmental
assessments fully financed by the project.
15. Program Objective Categories. The project would contribute to the following Bank Program
Objective categories: (i) public sector reform, privatization and private sector development; and (ii)



5
poverty reduction through employment creation in the private sector. The Technical Assistance
component of this project would contribute to institut.onal development by providing support to public
enterprise restructuring.
16.  Benefits and Risks. The project would address constraints that have so far inhibited an adequate
supply response to the macro-economic reforms undertaken and would expand the private sector's
involvement in trade and processing of both traditional and non-traditional products. The assistance
proposed above is designed to improve the capacity of private businesses to compete, particularly in
the early stages of development.
17.  The privatization component would transfer to private ownership or management, companies
generating most of export earnings outside coffee and providing income to about 90,000 rural
families. Privatization of agro-industries would contribute to increased value-added in tea and cotton
(30% and 40% respectively over present levels representing additional value-added amounting to US$
1 million and US$ 0.4 million respectively). For sugar it is expected that private management of
SOSUMO would reduce production costs and lead to the capture of a larger share of a growing local
market. The Agribusiness Development Fund component would support small enterprises in
preparing and implementing appropriate development plans which will increase their competitiveness
on international markets. It is expected that these services would generate additional value-added
amounting to ten times its cost over a five year period.  Experience with similar funds in other
countries shows that these results are attainable. Over the duration of the project some 150 firms are
expected to benefit from matching funds. Over a five year period, additional fiscal revenues
generated by the increase in value-added would amount to a minimum of 1.5 times the value of the
grant. A special effort would be made in favor of enterprises led by women through the training
seminars.
18.  Risks are inherent to the pilot and innovative nature of the project. Demand-driven support
services are new in Burundi and disbursements on the Agribusiness Development Fund are expected
to be slow in the beginning. The implementation of the privatization component will depend on the
successful implementation of the government reform supported by the third SAC and the Private
Sector Development Project. The emergence of an active secondary market, to be supported by SAC
Im, would facilitate implementation of the government objective to offer part of the capital of the
agro-industries to the public and employees. Privatization will also be dependent on SCEP's
performance, which has not been satisfactory in the past but is now expected to improve after a
comprehensive reorganization to which the g.vernment has agreed. External risks would include
setbacks in the government's policy on national unity that could delay privatization of industries.
Any serious disruption would affect demand for the matching funds and new investments.
19.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

NOTE ON PROJECTS WITH SIGNIICANT DISBURSEMENT LAGS
1.   Out of 17 currently active projects in Burundi, five have disbursement lags above 50 percent.
Ihey are distnbuted in the (1) the financial and telecommunication sector; (2) agricultural sector, and
(3) the transport sector. A disbursement/procurement review mission which visited Burundi in
January 1992, identified the following generic issues as the main causes for slow disbursement: (a)
high turnover of staff directly involved in procurement and preparation of disbursement applications
and accounting; (b) complexity of Government procurement procedures strictly enforced by the
Ministry of Finance; and (c) underestimation of actual disbursement due to infrequent replenishment
of Special Accounts.
2.   Generic problems are being addressed through a greater involvement of the resident mission
in supervision of disbursement and procurement; monitoring of portfolio management by the country
team; and organization of in-country seminars on procurement/disbursement. In addition, specific
reasons are affecting the five following projects experiencing the most significant disbursement lags.
(a)   Agricultural Services Sector Credit (Cr. 2024-BU): Delays in effectiveness, slow
recruitment of project technical assistance, complexity of the institutional setup of the
project, slow implementation of the cooperative development component contributed to
slow disbursement. In addition, although release conditions were fulfilled earlier, the
policy component tranche was not disbursed due to high reserves with the Central Bank
through the end of 1991. The situation has now changed and the tranche will be
released shortly. Implementation issues are being addressed by the recruitment and
Waining of local consultants and the redesign of the cooperative component.
(1)  MuyinFa Agricultural Development Credit (Cr. 1857-BI l. Ihe geographical isolation
of the project site has aggravated the recruitment and maintenance of qualified financial
staff. In addition, the disbursement on works has been delayed by the difficulty to
attract contcors to this part of the country.
(c)   Small  terprises APEX Credit (Cr. 1889-BIS . Disbursement has been slow due to the
delay in credit effectiveness, low ceilings for eligible investments which excluded a
significant segment of the market. Commitments picked up significantly following
revision of the sub-project eligibility criteria and increased interest from investors and
participating financial intermediaries.
(d)  Telecommunications II (Cr. 1805-B.Unfulfilled disbursement condition explains most   e
of the disbursement delays.
(e)   Transport Sector Credit (Cr. 2105-BU). Weak management and inexperience with
procurement procedures are being addressed by training seminars.
