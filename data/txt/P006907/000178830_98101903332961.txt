INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
APPRAISAL OF POWER AND TEIECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), a Government-
owned entity that operates most of the power and telecommunications
facilities in Costa Rica, has requested Bank loans to help finance its
next stages of development. Loans of US$6.5 million for power and US$17.5
million for telecommunications are proposed. These would finance nearly
all the direct foreign exchange costs together with local costs as indicated
in paragraph iv below.
ii.       To meet the demand of the growing industrial sector, ICE previous-
ly obtained three Bank loans totalling US$33.3 million for the development
of hydropower projects. Projects financed by the first two loans have been
completed but in the third loan, the Rio Macho-Tapanti scheme is seriously
behind schedule due to tunnelling difficulties. In order to avoid load
shedding during the dry season in 1974 and thereafter, ICE has had to bring
forward the installation of its next step of thermal generation capacity
and some associated works. These form the basis of the power project,
consisting of a gas turbine power station of about 30 NW at San Antonio,
a diesel power station of about 3 NW at Limon, power transmission facil-
ities, engineering services, and organization and management studies. The
project cost is estimated at US$8.3 million.
iii.      The development of a modern telecommunication system in Costa
Rica began in 1965 and has been financed with the aid of two Bank loans
totalling US$16 million. The project now proposed for Bank financing is
ICE's further development program for 1972-76.  It includes the expansion
of the telephone network by 25,000 lines, extension of long distance
facilities, establishment of telex services, modernization of the telegraph
service, and engineering studies. The total project cost is estimated at
US$32.2 million.
iv.       Procurement for both projects would be by international competi-
tive bidding, except for purchases of up to US$2.9 million for telecommuni-
cations equipment to extend existing installations where direct compatibility
is essential. Local preference would be allowed on items from Central
American Common Market countries including Costa Rica. Purchases in Costa
Rica financed by the Bank loan would not exceed US$0.5 million for power
and US$1.5 million for telecommunications. Retroactive financing of up to
us$o.6 million will be required to cover costs ICE has had to incur on the
power project.



- ii -
v.        Both power and telecommunications operations are well run
within the organizational constraints, but the nature and growth of the
two sectors have brought about a need for studies on organization and
management to ensure future efficiency. It has been agreed that consult-
ants will be engaged to undertake studies of the power sector and ICE's
internal organization and management.
vi.       About 32% of the funds required for power and 53% of those for
telecommunications are expected to be generated internally during the
project periods. ICE's financial performance has shown a remarkable
improvement since the previous loans were made. The financial position
is sound and the debt service coverage should improve from 1.6 times in
1971 to 1.9 in 1976.
vii.      The internal financial rates of return of the power and tele-
communications projects are about 9% and 23% respectively.
viii.     With the assurances indicated in Section 11, the two projects
are suitable for Bank loans of US$6.5 million equivalent for power and
US$17.5 million equivalent for telecommunications, each for a term of
20 years including a 4-1/2 year grace period for the power loan and a
5-1/2 year grace period for the telecommunications loan.

APPRAISAL OF POWER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of power and telecommunications
development projects of the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE).
The power project includes a gas turbine power station of about 30 MW at
San Antonio to provide dry season energy for the Interconnected System, a
diesel power station of about 3 MW for the port of Limon, power trans-
mission facilities, engineering services, and organization and management
studies. The telecommunications project covers the expansion of the tele-
phone network capacity, extension of service to rural areas, modernization
of telegraphs, establishment of a small telex network, and engineering
studies.
1.02      The estimated costs are US$8.3 million for the power project and
US$32.2 million for the telecommunications project. Together they form
30% of ICE's total program for the years 1972-1976. The proposed Bank
loans of US$6.5 million for power and US$17.5 million for telecommunications
would finance the foreign exchange costs of the two projects including the
costs of possible locally awarded contracts of about US$0.5 million equiv-
alent for power and US$1.5 million equivalent for telecommunications. The
remaining costs of the projects would be financed from ICE's internal
resources and the sale of ICE's bonds in Costa Rica.
1.03      The borrower would be ICE, to which the Bank has made four loans
totalling US$49.3 million.  The first loan (276-CR for US$8.8 million) was
made in 1961 for the first stage of Rio Macho hydroelectric development and
the Colima diesel station. The second loan (346-CR for US$22 million) was
made in 1963; US$12.5 million financed the first stage of the Cachi hydro-
electric station and associated transmission lines, and US$9.5 million
financed the establishment of an initial telephone network capacity of
35,000 lines and long distance facilities. All works under the first two
loans have been completed. In July 1969, Loan 631-CR for US$12 million
was made for the Rio Macho-Tapanti and Cachi second-stage power projects,
and Loan 632-CR for US$6.5 million was made for the second-stage expansion
of the telecommunications network by 22,500 lines with associated long
distance facilities. Construction of these two projects is still under
way. Because of delay on the Rio Macho-Tapanti project, it has become
necessary to advance by one year the installation of about 30 MW of thermal
generating capacity under the proposed new power loan. The second-stage
telecommunications expansion targets have been increased to cater for
increased demand, and progress is on schedule to the new targets.
1.04      The projects are the logical and most economic next steps in
the expansion of Costa Rica's power and telecommunications systems to
meet the increasing demand for electricity and telephone service.
1.05      A mission composed of Messrs. A. Bouhaouala, J. Brown,
I.A. Newstead and E. Wessels visited Costa Rica in May/June 1971 to
appraise the projects. This report is based on the mission's findings.

2. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
General
2.01      Costa Rica, some 51,000 km2 in area and located in the narrow
southern part of Central America between Nicaragua and Panama is a moun-
tainous country except along the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The
population, now about 1.8 million, has doubled over the past 20 years;
however the growth rate declined from 4.0% to 2.8% per annum during the
sixties. Two-thirds of the people live in the central highlands in an
area of 9,200 km2, where elevations range from 500 to 1.,500 meters and
the climate is mild throughout the year, in contrast with the tropical
climate of the coastal plains. There are only two seasons - a wet
season, normally June through December, and a dry season from January
through May.
2.02      Costa Rica achieved remarkable economic growth in the 1960's,
especially in the last five years. The GDP in real terms increased
annually by 6.8% during the decade and is expected to continue growing
at that rate. But because of the rapid population growth, the annual per
capita GDP increased by only 3.2% in the 1960's, reaching about US$504 in
1969. Over the past decade the economy has been stable with price
increases of about 3% per annu. While the economy is still based on
agriculture (24.6% of GDP in 1969), the contribution of the industrial
sector to GDP increased from 17.1% in 1960 to 19.6% in 1969.
Power and Telecommunications Development
2.03      With a per capita power generation of 506 kWh and total
installed capacity of 237 MW, Costa Rica's power system is the most
highly developed in Central America including Panama (without the Canal
Zone). Nevertheless, further power development and increased reliability
are required in order to sustain the growth of the industrial sector.
2.04      The teleconuunications system is making a valuable contribution
to the infrastructure for economic growth. It does so by facilitating
the flow of business information within San Jose, the country's capital
and largest city, and by linking together the capital metropolitan area,
the provincial centers of agriculture and industry, and the Pacific and
Caribbean ports. The telephone density in Costa Rica is 3.3 telephones
per hundred population, compared with an average of 2.8 for the Central
American and Caribbean countries.

3. THE POWER SECTOR
Sector Organization
3.01      Costa Rica's power supply industry is regulated by the Electric
Service Law, enacted in 19h1 and administered by Servicio Nacional de
Electricidad (SNE). Subject to the approval of Congress, SNE awards
concessions for the generation and distribution of electricity; it also
regulates tariffs, subject to ministerial approval, and controls standards
of service.
3.02      Although it is a generally accepted view that power utilities
are natural monopolies, the Electric Service Law stipulates that they
should not be so considered in Costa Rica, and consequently the power
market is shared by 57 public utilities and 120 auto-producers (1969
figures). Most of the public utilities are owned either by the Government
or municipalities; however, this does not prevent some of them from compet-
ing with one another. Some towns have two distribution systems running
down the same streets, and customers switch back and forth from one utility
to another, depending on the tariffs offered by the competing utilities.
3.03      Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), owned by the
Government, and Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL), a subsidiary
of ICE, are the two largest power utilities in the country (generation
figures are given for ICE and CNFL in paragraph 3.07 below). ICE pur-
chased 92.3% of CNFL's stock in 1968, but the two utilities have conti-
nued to operate as separate entities. A complete merger could be expect-
ed to result in savings on investments, and management and operating
expenses as well as economies of scale.
Existing Facilities
3.04      At the end of 1969 the total instaled capacity of Costa Rica
was 237 MW (180 MW hydro, 45 MW diesel and 12 MW steam), with the public
utilities operating 214 MW and the auto-producers the remaining 24 MW.
This capacity was installed at 201 power stations, only four of which
had a capacity of 20 MW or more (see Annex 1).
3.05      About 92% (195 MW) of the public utilities' capacity is in the
central zone, an area served by a power system belonging to 15 public
utilities including ICE and CNFL. This system, which is known as the
Interconnected System (see Power Map), extends from Turrialba on the
eastern slope of the central highlands to Puntarenas on the Pacific coast
and the town of Abangares in Guanacaste province. The rest of the country
is served by small, isolated diesel and hydro plants with an aggregate
capacity of 19 MW.
3.06      At the end of 1970, ICE had an installed capacity of 157 MW,
124 Icn of 138 kV transmission lines, 321 km of 34.5 kV lines and 399 km
of primary distribution lines of various voltages. Except for three
outlying systems at Limon, Liberia and Santa Cruz, all of ICE's



-4 -
facilities are concentrated in the highland region around San Jose and
form the major part of the Interconnected System.  Annex 1 lists ICE's
power stations and Annex 2 describes its most important hydroelectric
developments:  Rio Macho-Tapanti and Cachi.
Generation and Sales
3.07      From 1962 to 1969, total annual generation by the public utili-
ties increased at a rate of about 9% per year, from 468 GWh to 846 GWh.
In 1969, 94% of the total generation or 798 GWh was generated in the
Interconnected System. ICE generated 66% (522 GWh), CNFL 25% (202 GWh)
and the small entities 9% (74 GWh) of the total for the Interconnected
System.
3.08      In 1970, ICE generated 643 GWh and purchased 3 GWh from other
utilities. ICE sold 61% (393 GWh) of its energy to CNFL; 11% (71 GWh)
to other utilities; and 22% (143 GWh) to some 23,000 direct customers
through its own distribution systems. System losses, which were low
because most of the energy was sold in bulk, were 6% (39 GWh).
Sector Program
3.09      Probably because of the number and size of the power utilities
no national sector program is prepared. ICE is in charge of planning the
expansion of the Interconnected System, but the small utilities sometimes
make additions to it despite ICE's opposition.
Tariffs
3.10      The Electric Service Law states that tariffs shall cover the
cost of the service, including a fair compensation for the use of capital.
3.11      The tariffs have some unusual features.  The average rate (US¢2/kWh)
is low compared with other Central American countries, but the rates differ
widely from one utility to another, and the average price per kWh varies
from about US¢1.3 to US¢19.7.  Also, some utilities such as CNFL charge up
to 45% more per kWh to industrial than to residential customers.
Suggested Sector Study
3.12      The sector's unsatisfactory organization and regulation have
led to duplication of facilities, too marn small and inefficient power
stations, no coordinated planning, lack of standardization, and uneconomic
tariffs. It was therefore suggested to the Government and SNE that inde-
pendent conwultants should study the sector and make recommendations for
improving its organization and efficiency and correcting inequities in
tariffs. This suggestion was accepted, and during negotiations assurances
were obtained that independent consultants, to be financed from the proposed
loan, would be appointed by the Government to commence studies by
September 1972 under agreed terms of reference (see Annex 3).

4. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Sector Organization
4.01      ICE has been responsible for providing all of the country's
internal telecommunications, except the public telegraph services since
1963. In that year Law No. 2336 gave ICE a permanent concession to
provide the services and to acquire the rights and properties of the
existing concessionaires, which were small private companies providing
limited and unsatisfactory telephone service.
4.02      By 1975 the public telegraph service, now being operated by the
Ministry of Interior, will have been taken over by ICE. International
services are the responsibility of Radiografica Costarricense S.A., a
concessionary company jointly owned by ICE (50%) and private shareholders.
In accordance with the statute that established Radiografica in 1964, ICE
will also progressively take over the international services by 1977.
4.03      ICE represents Costa Rica on the Regional Technical Commission
on Telecommunications (COMTELCA) of the Central American Cormon Market
countries.  Commencing in early 1972, ICE will own and operate the Costa
Rica section of the new Central American regional network being constructed
under GOMTELCA's auspices (see paragraph 4.09), and financed by CABEI.
Existing Facilities
Local Exchanges
4.04      Most of the existing telecommnications system was established
under ICE's Stage I expansion plan, financed by Loan 346-CR. The system
is being extended to a capacity of 64,900 lines under the current Stage II
(1967-73) expansion plan, financed by Loan 632-CR. In June 1971 there
were 27 exchanges with an installed capacity of 42,000 automatic exchange
lines, and 39,000 connected lines (DEL's). Services are concentrated in
the San Jose metropolis (29,000 DEL's). Annex 4 gives details of the
existing exchanges. The subscriber networks consist of primary underground
duct and cable distribution and overhead secondary distribution. Local
telephone service is generally of good quality.
Long Distance Network
4.05      San Jose is linked to the central highland cities of Alajuela,
Heredia, Tres Rios, Turrialba and Cartago by coaxial cable systems.
Microwave links connect San Jose with Liberia and the ports of Puntarenas
and Limon, and with the southern region as far as Golfito and the Panama
border. Connections from provincial centers to their dependent terminal
exchanges are by open-wire and VHF and UHF radio systems. There are some
300 long distance circuits in service; they are being increased to 675
under the Stage II (1967-73) expansion plan. The main trunk routes are



- 6 -
shown on the telecommunications Map. The main trunk exchange at San Pedro,
in the San Jose area, is the hub of the network, with long distance cir-
cuits to all other exchanges. Nationwide STD is available from virtually
all exchanges and operates efficiently.
Rural Services
4.06      Public call offices, now available at ten remote towns and
villages, are being extended under the Stage II plan to a total of about
100.
Telegraphs and Telex
4.07      Except for an experimental telegraph service operated by ICE
at a few centers and using teleprinters, the public telegraph service,
operated by the Ministry of the Interior, is based on obsolete Morse code
transmission.  Service is poor and for the most part is available only
in the larger centers.
4.o8      There is no national telex service, pending installation of
automatic telex exchanges in the Stage II plan. Some 200 telex sub-
scribers are connected directly to an international manual exchange in
San Jose.
International Services
4.09      Radiografica operates HF and VHF channels to other Central
American countries, giving access through Panama to submarine cable to
the USA. Other overseas services are by HF radio circuits. Regional
service was greatly improved with the completion in November 1971 of the
new Central American microwave network (see telecommunications Map).
Tariffs
4.10      Telecommunications tariffs are intended to cover the cost of
the service, including fair compensation for use of capital.  SNE is
responsible for their regulation, subject to Government approval.
Annex 5 gives details of the present tariffs and those proposed for the
new telex, mobile telephone and telegraph services. The telephone tariff
structure is reasonable, with the tariff levels adequate and substantially
unchanged since 1967.

5. THE BORR0WM - INSTITUTO COSTARPlICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
Corporate Structure
5.01      The borrower for both projects would be the Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). This Government-owned statutory
corporation was established in April 1949 to plan and carry out a coor-
dinated national program of electrification. The law setting up ICE
defines it as an autonomous organization, authorized to carry out its
activities completely independently of the Government, except for approval
of tariffs and bond issues. Except in the matter of tariff approval, the
law does not clearly define the relationship between ICE and SNE, the
regulating agency. The sector study suggested in paragraph 3.12 will
include definition of this relationship.
5.02      ICE has a seven-member Board of Directors, one of whom is a
Government member. The non-Government members are appointed by the
Government for eight-year terms on a staggered basis, and are eligible
for reappointment. At least three of the Board members must be engi-
neers, one a lawyer, one an economist, and the other two must have
acquired experience in either finance, industry or agriculture.
5.03      ICE's chief executive is the General Manager, who is appointed
by the Board. The Board also appoints the two Deputy Managers, the
Treasurer and the Chief Auditor. The General Manager selects and appoints
other officers, subject to Board approval for senior posts.
Management Studies
5.o4      Due to the competence and dedication of its staff ICE is
reasonably well run, but efficiency is impaired by organizational con-
straints which will become more serious with the continued growth of
both power and telecommunications. Management studies by consultants
are needed in three broad problem areas:
(i)  Delegation of authority (paragraph 5.05);
(ii)  Power -  organization of regional and supporting services;
policy on construction projects (paragraphs 5.06 and 5.07);
(iii)  Telecommunications -  autonomy of operations; organization
of headquarters, regional, financial and supporting services
(paragraph 5.11).
Draft terms of reference for these studies are given in Annex 6 and
were agreed during negotiations. The studies are to be commenced by
September 1972 and the consultant's recommendations discussed with the
Bank.



Delegation of Authority
5.05      ICE is highly centralized and too mary management decisions
have to be taken or approved by the Board which meets nine times a month
on average. It is difficult to know just how much ICE's efficiency has
been impaired by centralization, and the management studies will review
and recommend on the delegation of authority by the Board.
Power: Organization, Management and Staff
5.06      ICE's main activities concerned with electric power are handled
by four departments - planning, generation, distribution, and engineering
and construction - supported by service sections. The organizational
units are headed by generally competent staff, and this masks the need
for decentralization of activities, creation of a commercial department
and better coordination among the supporting services. The consultant's
review of ICE's organization and management will include these organiza-
tional matters, along with related studies of demarcation of responsi-
bilities and administrative, operational and purchasing procedures.
5.07      A problem particularly deserving attention is ICE's policy of
using its own staff to construct power projects. Partly because of this
arrangement, ICE's performance under the three Bank loans has progressive-
ly declined. The projects financed by the first two loans, Rio Macho and
Cachi first stages, were completed with 6 and 14 months delay respectively.
The delays on the works financed by the third loan, Cachi stage 2 and Rio
Macho-Tapanti, are more serious, being 12 months and 24 months respectively.
For the Rio Macho-Tapanti project, the delay is due to exceptional tunnel-
ling difficulties, and late delivery of construction equipment combined
with ICE's lack of experience. This illustrates the need for a review of
ICE's policy with respect to construction, which will be included in the
consultant's study; recommendations should be made before ICE starts the
construction of its next hydropower project, Angostura, in 1973.
5.08      ICE's power staff includes 1,800 permanent employees.  This is
appropriate in view of the need to maintain a fairly large number of
engineers and supervisors for construction. Labor for construction is
hired only when required. ICE's staff is competent and no problems in
recruitment or training are expected.
Telecommunications: Organization, Management and Staff
5.09      In October 1963, ICE was given the additional responsibility of
providing telecommunications services. (See paragraph 4.01.) The coupling
of telecommunications and power was an effective method of establishing
these new services, but the need for eventual separation was envisaged at
the time of the last Bank appraisal (632-CR). Some preliminary steps have
been taken toward making telecommunications more autonomous. There is now



- 9 -
a separate Telecommunications Division under a Director who reports to
ICE's General Manager. The Division has the usual planning, construc-
tion and operational departments, and the elements of a separate
telecommunications finance and budget group. A fairly strong economics
and statistics unit has also been established, reporting to the Director.
5.10      These were steps in the right direction, but with the rapid
growth and diversification of telecommunications now envisaged in the
project, further organizational development is needed to ensure future
efficiency. Telecommunications now contribute 34% of ICE's total operat-
ing revenue and this proportion should increase due to the more rapid
growth of telecommunications. Finance and accounting requirements for
each service are different; each should be supported by its own account-
ing systems, with the respective assets clearly apportioned, which has not
been achieved under present arrangements (see paragraph 10.02).  The
technologies of power and telecommunications are also very different and
the differences are increasing. Likewise, supporting functions such as
training, marketing and industrial relations have little in common between
power and telecommunications.
5.11      The proposed management study by consultants will recommend
how to achieve the operational independence necessary for efficient
future development of telecommunications, either within ICE, or by
creation of a separate authority. The consultants should also make recom-
mendations on the need for a regional telecommunications organization, and
the development of a management information system to aid planning and
investment decisions. Agreed terms of reference for these studies are
given in Annex 6.
5.12      The Telecommunications Division has some 700 full-time employees
including 35 executives and engineers. The management is young, well-
qualified and dedicated, with a competence which should continue to develop
with further experience.  The staff numbers about 14 per 1,000 telephones,
which is low for a developing country, especially considering that ICE
does much of the installation work.  The technicians are well-trained, and
the installations are well kept despite the number of staff available; good
maintenance has been possible because none of the main installations is
over eight years old and so far ICE has been able to maintain reasonably
high standards by extensive use of overtime. Recognizing the possibility
of labor problems and falling standards of service if the situation per-
sists, ICE is mounting an expanded training program to provide the additional
staff needed now and in the future. A new training school is to be set up
with assistance under the proposed loan (see paragraph 8.02 (v)).
5.13      Total telecommunications staff is planned to increase from 700
at present to 1,726 (17 per 1,000 telephones) by 1976. The increase in
the technical categories will be greatest - e.g., from 123 maintenance
technicians in 1971 to 554 in 1976 - to overcome the present shortages.
Additional staff will also be required for ICE's progressive take-over of
the public telegraph service by 1975. ICE is studying the logistics of
telegram delivery (the most costly component of the service), which will
remain temporarily with the Ministry of the Interior.

6. THE POWER PROJECT
1971-75 Expansion Program
6.01      ICE's 1971-75 expansion program, estimated to cost 0500 million
(US$75 million), consists of the following items:
(a) Completion of the works financed by Bank Loan 631-CR:
1.  Raising the level of the Cachi reservoir (Annex 2);
2. Construction of the Rio Macho-Tapanti hydroelectric
scheme (Annex 2);
3.  Construction of miscellaneous transmission facilities.
(b)  Completion of the works financed by the second IDB loan of
US$3.8 million equivalent:
1. Addition of two 500 kW and one 300 kW diesel units at
Santa Cruz and Siquirres power stations, respectively;
2. Interconnection of Guanacaste's distribution systems with
the Interconnected System;
3. Reinforcement of various substations;
4. Extension of the distribution systems in various rural
areas of Guanacaste and Limon provinces.
(c)  Completion of an office building financed by ICE.
(d)  Construction of the works and execution of the engineering
and management studies now proposed for Bank financing:
1. Installation of two gas turbine units of about 15 MW in
an extension of the existing San Antonio power station
near San Jose. These gas turbine units, to be commissioned
by the end of 1973, would help meet peak demand during that
winter and would firm up the hydro energy available during
subsequent dry seasons.
2. Installation of extra diesel generating capacity of about
3 MW at the port of Limon, which is currently supplied by
an 8 MW diesel plant in very bad condition. The extra
capacity would avoid load shedding and reduce operating
costs and is to be commissioned by the end of 1973.
3. Construction and reinforcement of various transmission
lines and substations of the Interconnected System as
described in Annex 7. These works are planned to be
carried out during 1972 through 1975.



- 11 -
4. Engineering studies for the preparation of ICE's long-range
expansion program; the design of a future thermal power plant
and the San Jose distribution systems; geological studies for
Tapanti and Angostura hydroelectric projects; and advice on
the design and construction of the San Jose gas turbine units.
5. Management studies as described in paragraph 5.04 et s.
6. Power Sector studies as described in paragraph 3.12.
(e)  Execution of works for which financing will be sought toward the
end of 1972 and which, on the basis of preliminary studies, are:
1.  The addition of a fifth 30 MW unit at Rio Macho power
station for service in 1975;
2.  Starting construction of a new thermal plant of about
30 MW at Siquirres, for service in 1976;
3.  Starting the first stage of Angostura hydroelectric
development (50 MW), for service in 1977;
4.  Various transmission and distribution facilities.
The Project
6.02      The power project proposed for Bank financing consists of the
items listed in paragraph 6.01(d); these items form 10% of ICE's 1971-75
program.
Cost Estimate
6.03      The cost estimate of the project is detailed in Annex 8 and
summarized below:
Colones (millions)         US$ (millions)

*    This amount may include equipment and materials up to us$0.5 million
equivalent to be procured in Costa Rica. Of this amount the foreign
exchange component is estimated at 65% with a maximum local component
of about US$0.2 million equivalent.



- 12 -
6.o4      Equipment costs are based on preliminary estimates provided by
several suppliers, and recent Bank experience. Average physical contin-
gencies, estimated at 5.1% of base-line cost, are intended to cover ary
increase in the cost of goods and services. Average escalation contingen-
cies are estimated at only 3.6% of foreign currency since most of the
equipment would be procured on a firm price basis. For the local costs,
price escalation is estimated at about 8.1% on average.
6.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$6.5 million equivalent would finance
the project's estimated foreign costs and the local costs indicated in
paragraph 6.06 below; other local costs would be financed by ICE. If any
savings are realized, the excess loan funds would be subject to cancellation.
Procurement
6.o6      All equipment and materials for the project would be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. A Central American Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for
Industrial Development, which became effective in May 1969, obliges ICE
to give suppliers from member countries a preference of 50% of the import
duties applying to suppliers from non-member countries. In previous
lending, the Bank agreed that suppliers from the Central American Common
Market, including those in Costa Rica, would be allowed a preference of
either 15% of the CIF landed price or 50% of the import duty, whichever
was the lower. ICE has requested that the same arrangement be agreed upon
for the proposed loan. The items most likely to be competitive under this
arrangement are the same as in previous power loans and include cement,
reinforcing steel, fuel, tires and welding rods; their total amount would
not exceed US$0.5 million equivalent. The Bank should agree to reimburse
ICE, 95% of the cost of these possible local purchases to exclude the
element of local taxes.
Disbursements
6.07      Disbursements of the proposed Bank loan would be made for the
C&F cost of imported equipment and materials, 95% of the ex-factory cost
of contracts awarded to Costa Rican manufactures (not exceeding US$0.5
million equivalent), and for the foreign exchange cost of civil works and
consultant's contracts. In order to meet the construction schedule, ICE
has already invited bids for the gas turbine units, and begun incurring
costs for engineering services. On the assumption that the loan will be
signed by the end of February 1972, it may be necessary to reimburse ICE
for expenditure up to US$0.6 million from June 1, 1971. Annex 9 gives
the estimated schedule of disbursements.
Project Execution
6.o8      With the Bank's approval, the following consulting firms have
already been selected to provide engineering services:



- 13 -
(i)  Sofrelec (France), to assist in the preparation of the speci-
fications, analysis of bids and advice on construction of the
gas turbine units. The firm will also assist in the prepara-
tion of ICE's long-range expansion program and in the design
of a future thermal plant (Siquirres).
(ii)  Geoconseil (France), to provide geological advice on the
Rio Macho-Tapanti and Angostura projects.
(iii)  Electroconsult (Italy), to study the distribution system in
San Jose.
6.09      During negotiations ICE agreed to request the Bank's approval
before appointing consultants to study its management and review the power
sector organization, economy and regulation.
6.10      As in the previous three projects financed by the Bank, ICE
intends to design with its own staff and to carry out construction of
the civil works with its own crews. Although this arrangement has not
proved satisfactory as explained in paragraph 5.07, it would be accept-
able for this project, because it does not involve anr important civil
works other than the construction of the powerhouse for the gas turbines.
Furthermore, the powerhouse will be built by ICE under the supervision
of the supplier of the main equipment, who will also supply the structural
steel.

7. JUSTIFICATION OF THE POWER PROJECT
Load Forecast
7.01      Annex 10 gives details of all sales on the Interconnected System,
actual and forecast, from 1965 to 1985 as prepared by ICE. It shows that
in the past five years the average annual rate of increase in sales has
been 9.3%; the forecast assumes the same average rate. The load factor
is assumed to increase from 55% to 63% between 1970 and 1985, due to the
expected growth of industry. Annex 10 also gives the annual peak demand
that occurs regularly in December of each year, the energy' requirements
broken down between the dry and wet seasons, and the system losses.
7.02      The load forecast, which is based on detailed analysis of sales
in the past ten years, is realistic.  Trends for each class of customer           _
and each area are projected on the basis of past experience, local commer- 
cial conditions, and known future demand from large customers. ICE has
used this approach for a number of years and the actual demand has gener-
ally proved to be very close to ICE's forecast.
Least-Cost Solution
7.03      To meet the energy requirements and peak demands forecast through
1983, ICE studied several alternative programs. The studies showed that
all these programs should include about 60 MW of thermal capacity to firm
up existing and future hydro developments, because their storage capacity
is insufficient to meet requirements during the dry season. Early studies
indicated that 30 MW of this thermal capacity should be installed in 1974,
and 30 MW in 1976. However, the delay in constructing the Rio Macho-Tapanti
scheme, and a slightly higher demand than previously expected, made it
necessary to advance by one year the comnissioning of the first 30 MW of
thermal capacity consisting of two 15 MW gas turbine units, and to adopt
the program for new generating plant shown in Annex 11. The reasons for
ICE's decision are as follows:
(i)  To provide adequate reserve for the peak demand in 1973 and
subsequent years, the capacity of the system must be increased
by about 30 MW before the end of 1973. Annex 11 shows that
without the gas turbine units, reserve capacity would be less
than the capacity of the largest unit in the system in most
of the years from 1974 to 1983.
(ii)  The system would not be able to generate sufficient energy
during the dry seasons of the 1974-83 decade, if the two gas
turbine units were not included in the program. The proba-
bilities that the system will be able to meet energy require-
ments during each dry season increase from dangerously low to
acceptable values, as shown in Annex 12, when the gas turbine
units are added.  The most critical years are 1974, 1976 and



- 15 _
1977, but energy shortages could occur during any year of the
decade. Without the gas turbine units, the shortage forecast
during 1974-83 would total 124 GWh, which would be, on the
basis of probability, spread over the years as shown in
Annex 13 under "Expected Thermal Generation, Gas Turbines",
line 11.
(iii)  In view of the short time available, the only thermal generat-
ing capacity that can be commissioned by the end of 1973 is
either diesel or gas turbine.
(iv)  Because of the low load factor expected, a plant consisting
of two 15 MW gas turbine units is cheaper both in capital and
operating costs than a diesel plant of equal capacity.
Benefits of the Project
7.04      As stated in paragraph 7.03 (ii), without the gas turbine units
there would be a shortage of 124 GWh during 1973-84, of which about 50 OWh
would be lost by industrial consumers. On the basis of Goverrnent statis-
tics on industrial production related to electricity consumption, a
shortage of 1 GWh would result in loss of production equivalent to US$1.0
million.  This means that if the gas turbine units are not installed and
if the industrial consumers take no steps to generate the power they need,
or to reallocate their resources to other uses less dependent on electric
power, the loss of production could be as high as US$50 million. However,
if ICE does not install the two gas turbine units and is thus unable to
meet the requirements of the industrial sector, the latter would probably
resort to captive generation. This measure would take some three years,
1974 through 1976, during which the loss of production would be about
US$20 million, on the basis of mean probability. To this loss should be
added the difference in cost between the electricity generated by ICE's
gas turbines and that generated by the captive plant, which would inevitably
be small and inefficient. In total, the Costa Rican economy without the gas
turbine units, would sustain a loss ranging from US$20 to US$50 million, not
including the effect of the power shortage on residential consumers.  Since
the total cost (including capital and operating costs) of generating the
124 GWh over ten years from the proposed gas turbine units would not exceed
US$7 million, the investment is amply justified.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
7.05      The gas turbines are designed to firm up existing and future
hydropower development. Therefore, no rate of return for the gas turbines
themselves is meaningful.  However, the rate of return on the investment
required to meet the increase in demand forecast during 1972-77 can be
calculated. The internal financial rate of return on this investment
(which include the two 15 MW gas turbine units) is about 9%. More opti-
mistic assumptions with respect to operating costs would increase this
rate to 10% (see Annex 14).

8. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Th- Program
G .01     ICE's telecommunications development program to 1976 consists
of ongoing works in the Stage II (1967-73)expansion plan, being completed
on schedule with the assistance of Bank Loan 632-CR, and new works in the
overlapping Stage III (1972-76) expansion plan, which is the project pro-
posed for Bank financing. In 1976 the Stage IV (1976-80) expansion plan
will get under way.
The Project
8.02      The Stage III project continues the growth, diversification and
improvement of Costa Rica's telecommunication services from 1972 through
1976.  It covers the following main items:
(i) Expansion of the telephone network capacity by 25,150 exchange
lines by adding 19,850 lines to 32 existing exchanges and
installing 5,300 lines in 26 new exchanges, together with cables
and associated plant including mobile-radio equipment for an
initial 100 subscribers in San Jose. Details of the exchange
capacities are given in Annex 4. This will increase the total
network capacity to 90,050 exchange lines.
(ii) An increase of some 1,000 circuits in the trunk network capacity;
consisting of about 475 working circuits on existing microwave,
coaxial and carrier cable systems, 300 circuits on existing and
new VHF and UHF spur routes and 220 new PCM circuits on short-
distance trunk routes; extension of the main trunk exchange by
1,000 lines. Details of new routes proposed are shown in the
telecommunications Map.
(iii)  The establishment of public-call offices at some 600 additional
towns and villages by use of open-wire lines, carrier and radio
systems. Long distance telephone calls can then be made from
these offices, and telegrams lodged for transmission by telephone
to the nearest main telegraph center and thence over the telex
network.
(iv) Expansion of the new national/international telex exchange in
San Jose (established in the current, Stage II Plan) by 350 lines,
and 50 additional lines each at the small telex installations in
Puntarenas and Limon.  The telex network capacity by 1976 will be
1,000 lines.
(v)  Employment of (a) instructors for technical training, (b) tech-
nical consultants to help plan the future extension of telex,
telegraph and data transmission facilities.

in Annex 15, which shows ICE's yearly investment program.

8.04      Costs are reasonable for the scope and composition of the project,
which includes extension of service beyond the main centers into a number of
smaller towns and rehabilitation of major urban cable networks that became
saturated in Stage II, when demand exceeded expectations. The resulting
investment in local-area telephone service is approximately US$740 per DEL,
which is at the upper end of the range of US$300 - US$750 per DEL typically
*       encountered in developing courntries.
8.05      The proposed loan of US$17.5 million would finance the estimated
foreign costs of the project, being imported goods and services listed in
Annex 16 and certain local costs as shown in paragraph 8.08*. The remain-
ing project costs would be financed by ICE from internally generated funds
and sale of bonds.
*   This amount may include cables and accessories up to US$1.5 million
equivalent to be procured in Costa Rica. Of this amount the foreign
exchange component is estimated at 65% with a maximum local component
of about US$0.5 million equivalent.



- 18 -
Contingencies
cLO6      Telecommunications development is a continuous process that
o_~curs through the installation and augmentation of plant at thousands
of locations in any program year; cost estimates (except for a few of
the largest installations) are based on a forward projection of unit
;,sts for the various types of installation.  Because of this wide spread,
plus the variety of telecommunication works, the overall risk of a signifi-
cant cost overrun is negligible. Therefore, no contingency allowances are
explicitly included in the project cost estimates. However, there are
certain implicit contingencies:
(a)  The estimated cost of new exchanges (US$2.6 million) was
based on recent price quotations; with competitive bidding,
the actual prices could be up to 20% lower.
(b)  Local costs provide for an annual increase in average wage
levels of about 6%.
(c)  Allowance is made for known currency revaluations in likely
countries of supply.
Procurement
8.08      All procurement under the proposed loan would be subject to
international competitive bidding, with the exception of switching and
transmission equipment (amounting to about US$2.9 million) for extending
existing installations where direct compatibility is essential; this would
be purchased from five suppliers with whom the original contracts were
placed as a result of open international bidding under the Bank's auspices,
at prices based on those contracts. In accordance with the Central
American Agreement referred to in paragraph 6.06, local preference of 15%
of the c.i.f. price or 50% of the import duty, whichever is the lower,
should be allowed to suppliers from the Central American Common Market
countries from whom wood telephone poles, small-size cables and PVC ducts
(maximum of about US$3 million) might be purchased. Of these items,
purchases in Costa Rica would not exceed US$1.5 million equivalent and
would be covered by the Bank loan to ensure a firm financing plan. (This
amount is shown as foreign exchange in the table in paragraph 8.03.)
8.09      Because of long procurement lead time, it is necessary before
loan approval for ICE to issue tenders for goods to a value of some US$10
million with commitment of $0.5 million for direct purchases, but no retro-
active financing would be required.
Disbursements
8.10      Disbursements under the loan would be made against the C&F costs
of imported equipment, 95% of the ex-factory costs of contracts awarded to
Costa Rican manufacturers (not exceeding US$1.5 million total) and the
foreign exchange costs of consultants' and training experts' services.



- 19 -
8.11      A schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements under the pro-
posed loan is shown in Annex 17. Because of the ongoing nature of Costa
Rica's telecommunications expansion, any unused loan balance could be
applied, after consultation with the Bank, to the purchase of additional
goods similar to those procured under the loan.
Project Execution
8.12      ICE's timetable of exchange installations, with which the
scheduling of other project works is coordinated, is given in Annex 4.
8.13      The professional and technical resources available to ICE are
sufficient to ensure successful execution and operation of the project.
Project planning and engineering ure to be carried out by ICE except for
specialized telex and data planning, for which consultants would be
engaged under the loan (see paragraph 8.02 (v)). Most of the installa-
tions would be done by ICE, with supervisory staff for the larger
installations provided by the contractors.

9. JUSTIFICATION OF THE TELECONMUNICATIONS PROJECT
>O i      Primary issues in the justification of any telecommunications
project are the level of demand to be met, whether the project design
represents the least-cost solution in meeting demand at an adequate
standard of service, and the project's internal financial rate of return.
The 1972-76 project proposed for Bank financing aims at expanding and
inproving telephone service in San Jose and the provincial cities, extend-
ing service to outlying centers, and introducing telex to serve San Jose
and the twc main ports of Puntarenas and Limon.
Market Demand
Local Telephone Service
9.02      Provision of local telephone service constitutes over 60% of
the project investment. Annex 18 shows the past and forecast subscriber
growth and the exchange capacity. Demand has exceeded expectations in the
Stage II (1967-73) plan, which was revised to increase the exchange-line
expansion from an original target of 22,500 to approximately 30,500 lines.
9.03      Growth in connected subscribers (DEL's) has averaged 15% per
year over the past four years. At present there is a waiting list of
some 5,000 applicants.
9.04      ICE has forecast a decline in the growth rate of demand, corres-
ponding to an average annual rate of close to 13% for the next five years,
which would result in 85,000 DEL's connected and no waiting applicants by
1976. If the development rate of 15% per year were to be sustained, there
could be a waiting list of up to 5,000 subscribers instead of zero in 1976,
which would be tolerable. The lower ICE forecast of 85,000 DEL's has been
used for detailed dimensioning of the project, because its extent is in any
case limited by the available resources and an overshoot in demand of the
order indicated above would not affect its justification.
9.05      The project includes introduction of limited mobile telephone
facilities to cater for the specialized needs of medical and other high-
priority users. The tariffs proposed (see Annex 5) would ensure that the
service is financially viable. A market survey showed that the initial
installation should cater for 100 subscribers in San Jose.
Long Distance Service
9.06      Long distance traffic forecasts were made for individual routes
on the basis of past growth trends and subscriber development forecast at
the centers concerned. The overall growth in long distance traffic for
the project period is forecast at 25% per year, reflecting a sustained



- 21 -
high growth rate of STD traffic from existing and new subscribers.
Continued development of the trunk network in balance with this traffic
growth is essential for service and network efficiency.
Rural Telephone/Telegraph Service
9.07      There is a pressing need for basic telephone and telegraph
services in some 600 smaller towns and villages. Service will be limited
to a public call-office, usually operated on an agency basis, at which
trunk calls can be made and telegrams lodged. Besides the social benefits
of reducing the isolation of these rural centers, communi¢ations will
bring non-quantifiable but nevertheless important economic benefits by
promoting the orderly marketing of agricultural products, reducing travel
time and fostering reciprocal trade with other centers.
Telex Services
9.08      The needs of business and government will require the provision
of telex services in San Jose, Puntarenas and Limon to meet a forecast
demand of 700 services at 1976 and to carry the public telegraph traffic
then transmitted over the telex network.
Least-Cost Solution
9.09      Selecting the least-cost solution to meet prescribed portions
of the forecast demand for service involves (i) making the correct tech-
nological/economic decisions when planning the basic network structure,
and (ii) following an optimizing path with respect to the design, dimen-
sioning and timing of the thousands of installations carried out annually
as part of the continuous development process.
9.10      The fundamental decisions determining Costa Rica's basic network
structure over the next decade were made a few years ago and include the
national numbering, charging, switching and transmission plans and the
choice and disposition of coaxial cable and microwave systems for the
long distance network. These decisions are soundly based and provide
the framework for economic overall development; for example, the sizable
expansion of the trunk network capacity under the project can be accom-
plished at low unit cost, largely by increasing the number of working
circuits on existing high-capacity transmission systems.
9.11      Optimizing the design of large works in the project is achieved
by making present-value studies of engineering alternatives over a typical
20-year period, using an appropriate discount rate. For the remaining
small projects, the principle is the same but generalized solutions are
obtained for the various classes of plant to guide decisions about the
particular plant type and size to be selected. These principles were
applied in the design of works included in the project.



- 22 -
9.12      ICE has also adopted realistic approaches to the provision of
telex, rural telephone/telegraph and other facilities, confining service
to essential users and finding minimum-cost solutions - e.g., use of
telex line-concentrators outside San Jose and public-call offices rather
than individual services at rural centers.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
9.13      The internal financial rate of return of the project is esti-
mated as 22.7% at current prices (see Annex 19).
9.14      The improved communications resulting from the project will
confer benefits on all sectors of economic activity. Improved service
will facilitate business information flow and greatly reduce economic
losses due to present telecommunication delays. These benefits, though
very difficult to quantify, are nevertheless important contributions to
Costa Rica's economic development.

10. FINANCES
Summary of ICE's Finances
10.01     Over the past five years, ICE's gross fixed assets have
increased at an annual rate of 9%. About 85% of this growth was financed
by borrowing, and ICE's heavy dependence on borrowing gave cause for
concern.  ICE's financial performance has improved substantially since
Loans 631 and 632-CR were made. Net operating income grew at an annual
rate of over 30% between 1967 and 1970 with the introduction of realistic
tariffs and the rapid growth of telecommunications. ICE's finances are
now sound and are expected to continue to improve. About 40% of funds
required in 1972-1976 are expected to come from net internal caah gener-
ation and customers' contributions.
Accounts and Audit
10.02     Under Loans 631 and 632-CR, ICE agreed to maintain separate
accounts for power and telecommunications. There has been some progress
in this direction and reasonably acceptable separate accounts are avail-
able for the years 1969 and 1970. However, too many major expenses and
assets are apportioned arbitrarily and more accurate assignment of common
expenses and assets is required.
10.03     Coordination of accounting, cost control and forward planning
is weak, and responsibility for all financial functions should be clearly
identified. The functions of the economic and planning departments and
of the internal auditor should be reviewed and clearly defined.
10.04     These problems are to be included in the study of the consultants
discussed in paragraph 5.04.
10.05     Under Loans 631 and 632-CR, ICE agreed to have its power and
telecommunications accounts certified by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank, and to send the auditors' reports to the Bank no later than
four months after the end of the fiscal year. These covenants have been
coiplied with and are repeated in the proposed loans. ICE has retained
Peat, Marwick and Mitchell as auditors for several years.
Present Financial Position
10.06     A summary of ICE's balance sheet as of December 31, 1970 (see
Annex 20) is given below:

10.07    ICE's assets are fairly valued. Fixed assets are recorded at
cost less straight line depreciation at reasonable rates, and adjustments
were made when the Colon was last devalued.
10.08    Funds generated by operations are ful-ly invested in power and
telecaQmunications facilities, as ICE, does not pay taxes or dividends.
Improved earnings have resulted in the reduction of the debt/equity ratio
from 6o/4o in 1968 to 57/43 in 1970. Of the total long-term debt, 44% was
owed to the Bank, 19% to local bond-holders, 5% to local financial insti-
tutions and 32% to foreign creditors. Debt service was covered 1.3 times
by internal cash generation in 1970.
Past Earnings
10.09    Consolidated income statements for 1966-1970 are shown in
Annex 21. The rate of return on total net fixed assets in operation rose
from a low of 7.2% in 1967 to 12.4% in 1970.
Past Earnings - Power
10.10    Income statemeents for power operations (1969-1970) are shown
in Annex 22. The rate of return on net fixed power assets in operation
was 8.8% in 1969 and 11.0% in 1970, well in excess of the minima of 7.5%
and 9.0% set under Loans 346-CR and 631-CR for those years. Power opera-
tions contributed 66% of revenues and 69% of net operating income in 1970.

Past Earnings - Telecommunications
10.11     Actual income statements for telecommnnications operations
during the years 1969-1970 are shown in Annex 23. The rate of return on
net fixed telecommunication assets in operation was 14.6% in 1969 and
17.2% in 1970, well in excess of the minima of 7.5% and 11.0% set under
Loans 346-CR and 632-CR for these years. Telecommunicationa operations
contributed 34% of revenues and 31% of net operating income in 1970.
Financing Plan - Power
10.12     Forecast sources and applications of funds are given in Annex 24.
The financing plan for 1972-1975, the construction period of the power
project (summarized below), is satisfactory. Net internal resources will
meet 32% of requirements, and 68% will be met by borrowings totalling
0292 million. Of the latter, 038 million is already committed under loana
from the Bank and IDB. Future borrowing (in addition to the proposed Bank
loan) would be in the form of bond issues in Costa Rica totalling 035
million and Bank-type financing for the future Angostura project (see
paragraph 5.07).

10.15     The proposed Bank loans of US$6.5 million equivalent for power and
US$17.5 million equivalent for telecommunications are assumed to be for a
period of 20 years including 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 years of grace respectively and
to bear interest at the rate of 7.25%. Bond issues are assumed to be for
_          20 years with no grace period and to bear interest at the rate of 8%. ICE
has had no difficulty in selling its bonds to private investors on these
terms in the past, however the state owned commercial bank has recently
started paying 12% interest on 12-18 month deposits, and this could alter
the situation. ICE's bonds are tax-exempt, but income tax rates in Costa
Ricaare not high enough (maximum 30%) to offset the attractiveness of the
terms offered by the commercial banks. The impact of the commercial banks
deposits on the sales of ICE bonds should be kept under review during the
project periods.
10.16     To increase the attractiveness of its bonds to certain investors,
ICE has in the past entered into repurchase agreements obligating it to
redeem them after due notice. This practice is undesirable because it
exposes ICE to unpredictable demands. Under Loans 631-CR and 632-CR, ICE
agreed that the principal amount of bonds outstanding under such agreements
would not exceed 40% of the total, the proportion prevailing at the time.



- 28 -
There has been a remarkable improvement in this area, and the proportion
at the end of 1970 was 24%. During the negotiations, ICE agreed that the
proportion of outstanding bonds subject to repurchase will not exceed 30%.
10.17     The agreements for Loans 631-CR and 632-CR provide that ICE and
CNFL will not incur debt without the Bank's consent unless net income
before interest and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt
service in any future year. Compliance with this covenant has been satis-
factory and it is repeated in the proposed loan agreements.
Future Operating Results - Power
10.18    Forecast operating results for 1971-1978 (see Annex 22) are
summarized below:

10.19     These forecasts assume that the present power tariffs will not be
modified, which would result in a rate of return in excess of 9% during the
construction of the project. These returns are required for the financing
of the power construction program. ICE and SNE agreed during negotiations
that ICE's power tariffs will not be reduced without the agreement of the
Bank until the project is complete. They also confirmed that the present
agreements on the rate of return of ICE (paragraph 10.10) and power tariffs
of CNFL (Annex 28) will be repeated under the proposed loan. The rate of
return on net fixed power assets in operation is expected to fall to 8.2%          9
in 1978 when the large Angostura project is incorporated in the rate base.
The need for a power tariff increase to comply with the minimum required
rate of return of 9% will be discussed with ICE when that project is
appraised.
10.20    General operating expenses are expected to rise in line with the
growth of sales, but the commissioning of new plant will cause a dispropor-
tionate increase in depreciation costs.
Future Operating Results - Telecommunications

are swmmarized below:

10.22     These forecasts assume that the present tariffs will not be modified,
which would result in a rate of return in excess of 14% during the construc-
tion of the project.  These high returns are required for the financing of
the telecommunications construction program. ICE and SNE agreed during nego-
tiations that ICE's telecommunications tariffs will not be reduced without
the agreement of the Bank until the project is complete. Under Loan 632-CR,
ICE and SNE agreed that telecommunications tariffs would produce a rate of
return on net fixed assets in operation of not less than 11% through
December 31, 1972, and that the rate of return in subsequent years would be
established to meet ICE's financial requirements, after agreement between
ICE, SNE and the Bank. After completion of the project ICE will have to
earn a return of not less than 12% on telecommunications net fixed assets
to finance about 50% of its telecommunications construction program, although
a higher return is to be expected if the present tariffs are maintained as
assumed in the forecast. To ensure that revenues continue to be sufficient
to make an adequate contribution to expansion, ICE and SNE agreed that ICE
will earn a rate of return of at least 12% on its telecommunications assets.
10.23     The rapid growth of telecommunications in Costa Rica is evidenced
by the annual operating revenue, which quadrupled in 1966-1970 and is
expected to increase 3.5 times during 1970-1976. Apart from the increase
in subscribers, increases in revenue will occur as international, telex and
telegraph services are taken over.
10.2h     Operating expenditures are forecast to increase more rapidly
than revenue in the period under review, as a result of the training
program referred to in paragraph 5.12, the strengthening of the staff and
an expected increase in costs per subscriber as the service ceases to be
concentrated around San Jose and expands into less populous areas.
ICE's Future Financial Position
10.25     Consolidated balance sheets for ICE covering the years 1970-
1978 are shown in Annex 27. The projections demonstrate the rapid growth
of both power and telecommunications facilities, and the value of fixed
assets in operation more than trebles during the period.



- 30 -
10.26     Despite further borrowings which will double the outstanding
long term debt, increased retained earninga should improve the debt/equity
ratio from the present 57/43 to 51/49 by 1978.  This improvement is con-
tingent on operating performance, and the burden of debt service will neces-
sitate careful review of expenses and tariffs in the future. Debt service
coverage is expected to increase from 1.6 times in 1971 to 2.0 times in
1978 which would be satisfactory.
Security
10.27     At present, practically all properties of ICE are encumbered.
The Bank's previous loans are secured by mortgages on power and telecom-
munications properties. The proposed loans should also be secured by
existing mortgages and/or by extending such mortgages.

11. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
11 .01    During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  Management consultants acceptable to the Bank will be appointed,
in accordance with agreed terms of reference, to study:
(i) the overall organization, economy and regulation of the
power sector (paragraph 3.12);
(ii) the organization of ICE, including the extent to which
ICE's power and telecommunications activities should be
separated (paragraph 5.04 et seq.).
(b) The following agreements under the existing loanB will be
extended for the life of the proposed loans:
(i) ICE and CNFL will not incur debt without the Bank's con-
sent unless net income before interest and depreciation
is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service in any
future year (paragraph 10.17); and
(ii)  CNFL's tariffs will comply with its concession agreement
(paragraph 10.19).
(c)  The proportion of ICE's bonds outstanding under repurchase
agreements will not exceed 30% of the total amount outstanding
(paragraph 10.16).
(d)  Power tariffs will produce a rate of return of at least 9% on
net fixed assets in operation, and the present tariffs will not
be reduced without the agreement of the Bank until the power
project has been completed (paragraph 10.19).
(e)  Telecommunications tariffs will produce a rate of return of at
least 12% on net fixed assets in operation, and the present
tariffs will not be reduced without the agreement of the Bank
until the telecommunications project has been completed
(paragraph 10.22).
(f) The proposed loans will be secured (paragraph 10.27).
11.02     With the above indicated assurances, the two projects constitute
suitable bases for a loan of US$6.5 million for power and a loan of US$17.5
million for telecommunications, each for a term of 20 years including a
4-1/2 year grace period for the power loan and a 5-1/2 year grace period
for the telecommunications loan.

POWER PROJECT
RIO MACHO-TAPANTI AND CACHI HYDROPOUER DEVELOPMENTS
Rio Macho-Tapanti Development
1.        This development, to be carried out in three stages, utilizes the
upper catchment of the Reventazon river for power generation.
2.        The first stage, financed by Loan 276-CR (February 1961) was
completed in 1963. It consisted of the following works:
(i) a 1.5 km tunnel diverting the waters of the Rio MAcho, a
tributary of the Reventazon, into a regulating pond;
(ii) a 2.2 km tunnel conveying the waters from the regulating
pond to the Rio Macho power station; and
(iii) installation of two 15 Mi units at the Rio Macho station,
which discharges into the Reventazon river.
3.        The two tunnels mentioned in paragraph 2 were sised for an
ultimate installed capacity of 120 MW.
4.        The second stage financed by Loan 631-CR (July 1969) consists
of the following works:
(i) Construction of an intake and a 14.5 kn tunnel 3.62 meters in
diameter, to divert the waters of the Reventazon river into
the regulating pond of the Rio Macho power station; and
(ii) installation of two 30 MW units at the Rio Macho pcwer station.
5.        While the two 30 MW units are on schedule, the Tapanti tunnel is
about two years late. This delay is mainly due to very bad ground at
several faces of the tunnel, and also to ICE's lack of experience in tunnel
driving. The project is now expected to be completed by the end of 1974.
6.        After completion of the second stage, the Rio Macho-Tapanti scheme
will provide (a) 60 MW guaranteed capacity for the peak denand (December)
and (b) 92 GWh during the dry season (January-May), on the basis of mean
probability.
7.        The third and last stage of the development will consist of
installing a 30 MW unit at the Rio Macho power station, thus bringing its
capacity to 120 MW (2 x 15 MW and 3 x 30 MW). This last unit will not
increase the dry season energy of the development, but will provide 30 MW
guaranteed capacity for the peak demand.



ANNEX 2

Cachi Development
8.        This development was designed for construction in two stages.
9.        The first stage, financed by Loan 346-CR (July 1963) was completed
in 1967.  It consisted of the following works:
(i) a thin arch dam on the Reventazon river, the dam was built to its
full height (54 m) but the gates were not installed at the spill-
way;
(ii)  a 5.9 km tunnel from the Cachi reservoir to the power station;
and
(iii)  a power station with two 32 MW generating units, which discharge
into the Reventazon.
10.       The second and final stage of Cachi project is financed by Loan
631-CR (July 1969). The project, still under construction, is expected to
be completed by the end of 1972, one year behind schedule. The works consist
of:
(i) inBtalling gates at the spillway, and
(ii) constructing a grout curtain close to the left abutment of the
dam above the first-stage top water level of the reservoir.
11.       These works wil1  allow the level of the reservoir to be raised
by 20 meters so increasing its storage by about 50 million m3 to a total
of about 60 million m3. The output of the existing plant will then be
increased by about 40 GWh anmually.
12.       After completion of these works the Cachi development will have
a guaranteed capacity of 64 MW during the December peak demand, and mean
probability generation during the dry season of about 200 GWh.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 4 pages
3.        Develop an information system appropriate to the needs of senior
management of the Telecommunications Directorate. In particular, the system
should be aimed at aiding management in:
(a)  Strategic planning and tactical decisions concerning investment
in the various sectors of network development to achieve nominated
service and financial targets. (Such information would include
the estimated capital and operating costs, revenue and profit of
the various classes of telecommunications services provided.)
(b)  Monitoring performance against service and commercial targets for
the organization as a whole, and for each major functional and
regional department.
B.  Question of a Separate Telecommunications Entity  (Duration approxi-
mately two months.)
Having studied requirements for the largely autonomous operation
of telecommunications in Section A above, study and document the arguments
for and against the establishment of a separate entity for telecommunications,
and make appropriate recommendations.
C. Power Organization and Management (To be completed within 9 months from
commencement of studies.)
1.        Review basic documents:  existing legislation, actions of ICE's
Board of Directors, internal memoranda, duties and responsibilities of
senior staff, operating procedures, etc.
2.        Review and analyze the effectiveness and adequacy of the finan-
cial records and reports presently maintained and prepared.
3.        Discuss operating procedures and management techniques with all
senior personnel, and perform such other interviews, inspection and review
as deemed necessary.
4.        Make recommendations concerning the separation of duties and
responsibilities between the Board of Directors and the General Manager.
Particular attention should be given the need for a clear separation of
and understanding between the Board as the policy-making body and the
General Manager as the chief executive officer who must be solely respon-
sible for implementation of established policy.
5.        Propose required amendments to existing legislation to achieve
the separation mentioned in paragraph 4, and increase ICE's efficiency
and autonomy to the extent compatible with the public interest.
6.        Propose by-laws delineating the roles and responsibilities of
the Board and those of the General Manager, and covering such items as:
specific positions in the organization for which personnel actions are
subject to Board approval, authority of the General Manager to make



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 4 pages
certain transfers of budget appropriations, type and frequency of reports
and budget data to be submitted by the General Manager to the Board, and
amount of contracts requiring Board approval before award.
7.        Suggest organizational structure that would avoid overlapping
and that would include a rational amount of decentralization of management
functions and delegation of authority, along with development of area
management units and supporting service departments. Special attention
should be given to:
(i) the need for vesting the responsibility for financial functions
in a senior member of management; and
(ii) the need for defining the functions of the economics and
planning departments.
8.        Propose assignment of functions and responsibilities for all
senior staff down to section chiefs, with due consideration to the need
for proper delegation of authority.
9.        Recommend techniques and practices for the communication of
ideas between the organizational units. Study the forms and the flow of
paper now used by ICE, with the objective of simplifying procedures
wherever possible.
10.       Propose a management reporting system permitting quick and
effective evaluation of operations by management.
11.       Make recommendations for the preparation and revision of annual
operating, construction and cash budgets, ensuring proper control of
expenditure.
12.       Review the accounting system and recommend modern accounting
procedures and optimum use of computer facilities.
13.       Make recommendations concerning purchasing procedures, award
of contracts (including Board approval for major purchases), handling of
materials and supplies, and store control.
14.       Make suggestions concerning personnel management as required.
15.       Make recommendations concerning the advisability of creating a
Commercial Department; determine its responsibilities including rate
design, sales promotion, capital contributions, consumer statistics,
market surveys, and power contracts.
16.       Develop procedures for system expansion planning, securing
maximum coordination between all departments involved and including
preparation of short-range and long-range plans, feasibility studies,
accumulation of statistics and pertinent financial and economic data.



ANNEX 6
Page a of 4 pages
17.       Make recommendations concerning the Department of Engineering
including the collection of basic system operating data required for
system studies, development of mapping systems and design work orders
systems.
18.       Recommend procedures for hiring consultants and contractors
and for supervising construction work. Deternine to what extent construc-
tion work should be done on a task-force basis; special attention should
be given the evaluation of ICE's policy of carrying out construction of
rmajor hydropower projects with its own staff. Comparison with similar
public utilities and detailed studies should be made to appraise the
advantages and disadvantages of the policy and to determine whether it
should be discontinued. The consultants should complete this part of the
studies and submit an interim report summarizing their findings within
four months after the commencement of the studies.

PROPOSED TRANSMISSION FACILITIES
The proposed facilities include the following items:
1.        Angostura substations and lines.  These works are designed to
supply power for the construction of the Angostura hydro-power
development. They include two 34.5/13.8 kV substations of
3 MVA each, and two 34.5 kV lines of a total length of 11 km.
2.        Turrialba substation and line. A 10 km 34.5 kV line will be
built to supply the existing Tu.rrialba substation from Cachi.
The additional line will entail some transformation of the
substation.
3.        Cachi substation.  A 20 MVA 138/34.5 kV transformer will be
installed at Cachi substation to supply Angostura and Turrialba
substations, and to meet the increasing demand of the Juan Vinas
area.
4.        Barranca substation.  The existing Barranca substation supplies
the areas of Barranca, Puntarenas, Guacimal and Abangares.  The
demand of these areas is increasing rapidly and soon the exist-
ing 20 MVA transformer will be overloaded.  ICE intends to add
a similar transformer and carry out the necessary extensions to
the existing switchyard.
5.        La Caja substation.  This substation shares with Colima substa-
tion the supply with power of the San Jose area.  Since Colima
will soon be saturated, it is proposed to increase the capacity
of La Caja to meet the immediate requirements of the central zone.
The construction works will include the installation of a
30 MVA 138/13.5 kV transformer and the addition of 6 line bays.
6.        Este substation. This will be the third substation supplying the
San Jose area. It is planned for 1974, when both Colima and
La Caja become saturated. Este Substation will include a
30 MVA 138/34.5 kV transformer and 4 line bays. The substation
will be supplied with power by the existing double-circuit
138 kV line from Rio Macho to Colima.
7.        Colima - Guadalupe transmission line.  It is proposed to build
a 34.5 kV line of 4.5 km to supply Guadalupe substation in San
Jose, with power from Colima substation.
8.        San Antonio - La Caja transmission line.  This double-circuit
34.5 kV line of 500 meters, is designed to convey from San Antonio
to La Caja substation the power that will be generated by the
proposed gas turbines.

ANNEX 14

POWER PROJECT
INTERNAL FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
1.        The cost and revenue streams for the time slice of investments
required to meet the increase in demand during the 1972-1977 period are
given below.
2.        Construction costs are based on current equipment prices and
exclude taxes and customs duties.
3.        Operating costs exclude depreciation.  They also exclude fuel
costs because in Costa Rica, whenever a public utility incurs fuel costs
it is allowed to recover them from the customers through a temporary
surcharge.
4.        Revenues attributable to the time slice of investments have
been derived from ICE's income and expenditure statements, and exclude
the t, orary fuel surcharge.
5.        At the end of the period of study (1993) some of the projects
included in the time slice of investments will not be conpletely worn out.
To take this fact into account, the residual value of these projects has
been considered as a negative capital expenditure.
6.        Construction and operating costs, and revenue are as follovs:
Colones (Millions)

1976             29.0         13.1         45.7         -       3.6
1977              3.0         17.0         58.0         -      38.0
1978-1992          -          19.0         67.0         -      48.o
1993            (98.4)        19.0         67.0         -     146.4
7.        The calculation shows an internal financial rate of return on
the investments of 9.2%.
8.        Optimistic assumptions with respect to operating costs would
increase this rate to 10%.

Notes on Financial Statements
Revenues
1.        Power sales of ICE (including isolated systems) are expected to
grow by about 10.4% per annum in 1971-1978. Power tariffs are assumed to
remain at their present levels, with a slight decrease in the revenue per
KWh as a result of an increase in the proportion of power sold to industrial
consumers.
2.        Telecommunications revenues are expected to grow as a result of
the connection of new subscribers, the scheduled takeover of international
services in two steps: Central American communications in 1972 and other
services in 1977 (see 7 below), and the proposed expansion of Telex (1973)
and telegraph (1975) services. Telecommunications tariffs for present and
future services are assumed to be as shown in Annex 5.
Expenses
3.        Operating, administration and maintenance expenses are forecast
on the basis of present costs, adjusted for new facilities, projected staff
increases and increases of 6% per annum in wage rates.
4.        ICE charges straight-line depreciation on the basis of the
estimated useful life of assets. In 1970 depreciation on fixed assets
averaged about 2.6% for power, 4.8% for telecommunications and 10.4% for
other properties (mainly common buildings and equipment such as shared
administrative, laboratory and printing facilities, and construction and
transportation equipment.)
5.        Depreciation as shown in the forecast of sources and applications
of funds includes amounts which are charged to capital expenditure and
excluded from operating expenses.
CNFL and Radiografica
6.        The financial arrangements for the acquisition of CNFL by ICE were
detailed in the appraisal report for loan 631-CR (PU-lha dated June 11, 1969).
Briefly, they provide that CNFL's revenues will be sufficient to: cover
operating costs and debt service; make payments to ICE enabling the latter
to service the debt incurred for the acquisition; and carry out necessary
investments in CNFL's distribution networks. Payments to ICE take the form
of dividends on CNFL shares and interest on CNFL bonds (shown under Other
Income in the statement of income and expenditure for power operations)
and amortization payments on these bonds (shown separately in the forecast
of sources and applications of funds for power operations), Debt service on
debt incurred for the acquisition of CNFL is included in power debt service.



ANNEX 28
Page 2 of -2 pages
7.        Under a 1964 contract with the previous holders of the concession
for international telecommunications, Radiografica will be dissolved in
1977 and its operations taken over by ICE. Dividends equalling 37.5% of net
income will be received by ICE until the dissolution takes place; ICE will
receive the fixed assets and 50% of net working capital upon dissolution.
Connection Fees, Deposits and Contributions
8.        Connection fees and capital contributions are credited to equity,
as they are non-reimbursable. Deposits are reimbursable on termination of
service.
Current Assets and Liabilities
9.        Accounts receivable have been assumed to grow with the increase
in revenues. Changes in Inventories and in Other Current Liabilities are
due mainly to deliveries of major orders in connection with the construction
programs.
