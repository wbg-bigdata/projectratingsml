INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
AND PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
and a proposed development credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equiva-
lent, respectively, of US$7.0 million and US$7.0 million to help finance an
agricultural development project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum. The
credit would be on standard IDA terms. Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) of France would also provide a loan of FF 40,000,000
(US$8.9 million) to the Government of Senegal for a term of 20 years, includ-
ing 5 years of grace, with interest at 3.5 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. Country data appear in
Annex I.
Past Development
3.        During the 1960s, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual stagna-
tion, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per capita
GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First, with
Independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French
West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administrative,
and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to the
new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when ground-
nut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, a combination of several favorable factors includ-
ing the recovery of weather conditions, increased incentives for rural pro-
duction, promising results of rural diversification, and a successful drive
to promote industrial exports seemed to mark the beginning of a period of
considerably higher growth. As it turned out, the economic upturn was
brief, as 1972 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in this century.
4.        In 1972, agricultural and livestock production fell by more than
25 percent, setting back the standard of living of the rural population
(representing 70 percent of the total) below the level reached in the early
1960s. Food emergency operations helped avoid widespread starvation, but
notwithstanding this aid, both the fiscal and balance of payments situations
sharply deteriorated in 1973 and early 1974.



- 2 -
5.        During 1973, the balance of payments situation was characterized
by substantial reserve losses. At the end of the year, total net reserves
stood at minus US$31 million, the lowest level since Independence. The main
underlying factors in 1973 were a sharp drop in groundnut production and
exports (somewhat mitigated by exceptionally high world market prices) and
a continued increase in imports, mainly of foodstuffs. Even unusually high
aid inflows, including substantial food aid, were not sufficient to finance
the deteriorating trade balance. In 1974, both imports and exports (goods
and non-factor services) increased markedly, by an estimated 45 and 73 percent
respectively, following rapidly rising prices and slightly higher quantities
of Senegal's major exports (groundnuts, phosphate and petroleum products) and
impor,s (food, petroleum and general imports).    The more rapid climb in exports
resulLed in a n)arrowing of the goods and non-factor services deficit from an
all-tim.e u,g4h of US$83 million in 1973 to an estimated US$35 million in 1974.
which is about a normal figure for Senegal.    Net private capital outflows
increased, however, to an exceptionally high figure of US$33 million.     This
Was largely Ude to:
i.   an increase in trade credits to finance exports;
ii.   accelerated repayments of private foreign debts; and
iii.   repatriation of equity capital after partial take over of
foreignly-owned corporations by the Government. The
phiosphate mining company Taiba alone transferred US$52
million on these accounts.
Net foreirn assets dropped further to a level of minus US$44 million at the
end of 1974. The worsening external position of Senegal obliged monetary
autthorities to draw in December 1974 the US$5.8 million gold tranche with the
IMF, and in January 1975 the full US$19.2 million oil facility.
'.        D)uring 1972 and 1973, wuder the impact of the drought, public fin-
ances also took a serious turn for the worse. Public savings net of amortiza-
tion, which lhad substantially improved during the preceding years, were all
but wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74.    Revenues were affected by the decline
in economic activity. Recurrent expenditures were further increased by a
rise in salaries to compensate for the rapidly increasing cost of living,
substantially higher debt service payments and perhaps most importantly,
heavy consumer subsidies which resulted from maintaining low domestic prices
in the face of skyrocketing food import prices. Thus, at mid-1974, in spite
of a USS46 million higher transfer to the stabilization fund from groundnut
sales, the public finance situation was more difficult than it had been since
1960.
'rospe? s
.         W!eather conditions will remain critical to Senegal's growth pros-
r,,cts.  But with the rapid development of irrigated agriculture which started
in the 1960s, the agricultural development of areas less affected by rainfall



- 3 -
fluctuations (Casamance, Eastern Senegal) and substantial gains in industry,
tourism and fisheries, by 1980 weather conditions should be a less decisive
factor than today. The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74-1976/77) continues
to give highest priority to rural development (36 percent of the total),
housing/public utilities (18 percent) and transport infrastructure (16 per-
cent). Industry and tourism, quite justifiably, see their share increase
from 5 to 10 percent of the total. Assuming average rainfall conditions,
Senegal's growth in real terms in the remainder of the 1970s will be of the
order of 4.5 percent or about 2 percent per capita, which is still a consid-
erable improvement over the past decade.
8.        The balance of payments will continue to be under pressure during
1975, and will remain weak in the medium-term. In 1975, the effects of the
good 1974/75 harvest will be largely offset by the expected deterioration in
the terms of trade, due to a 20 to 25 percent fall in groundnut prices. This
may lead to a further fall in reserves of about US$15 million during that
year.  For the period 1976-78, it is estimated that the terms of trade index
for Senegal will continue to fall, mainly as a result of an expected drop in
phosphate prices of about 30 percent respectively between 1975 and 1977.
Therefore, as no major increase in the export volume is anticipated, Senegal's
exports are expected to stagnate in the corming years. After 1978, a new
phosphate mine is expected to come into production, while phosphate prices
are expected to resume their upward trend. These prospects combined with a
favorable long-term outlook for groundnut production could result in a
healthier balance of payments position towards the end of the seventies.
9.        Faced with the difficult situation in public finance, the Government
took a number of steps in November 1974 which are expected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and groundnut
oil were raised to bring them more closely in line with world market prices.
Thus, the rice subsidy was completely eliminated (an increase of 70 percent
in the consumer price), the price of. sugar was increased by 90 percent (leav-
ing a subsidy of about 20 percent) and that of groundnut oil was raised by
43 percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent). However, high world
market prices for wheat required an increase in domestic flour prices which
the Government is reluctant to pass on to the consumer and which may lead
to a new subsidy on bread. At the same time, when subsidies were reduced,
producer prices for groundnuts, rice, and cotton were increased substantially
(40 percent for groundnuts, 35 percent for cotton and 20 percent for rice) to
stimulate production and offset the effects of accelerating inflation. Also,
Government salaries were raised by 16 percent on the average, but ranging
from 60 percent for the lower salaries to 3 percent for the higher salaries,
to compensate for the rapid increase in basic food prices. Following the
five-fold increase in world market phosphate prices and the revi sion of the
tax agreement between the Government and the major phosphate mining company
in the country, Government revenues from this sector will be considerably
increased in the coming years. The good 1974/75 harvest is unlikely to
augment Government revenues because of the drop in groundnut prices. These
developments are expected to raise net public savings after debt service in
FY75 at the low level of about US$5 million, which may increase to US$35
million in FY76.



-4-
10.       During FY75 the increased domestic resources available to finance
public investment will be mostly absorbed by payments for the Government's
purchase of a 50 percent interest in the phosphate mining enterprise, which
is the main source of future additional income. In the following years
through 1980, projected trends in revenue and expenditure would permit the
generation of investable surpluses (after foreign debt service) equivalent to
20-25 percent of public investment, assuming thie public development program
grows only slightly faster than the overall economy.    Yet, there is considerable
scope to expand the development effort and to raise the share of public invest-
ment above its historically low level of 5-6 percent of GDP. Moreover, w1hile
the improvement in domestic resource iobilization will ease the balance of
pa,n-,rnts situation - particul.arly import demand - moderately, it wi1l not be
e;:nough to restore o(,veaill equilibrium in the medium-term.  Given our asstup-
tions on gross capital inflows, if Senegal finances 20-25 percent of this
imiodest public investment program, an annual unfinanced overall gap in th)e
balance of payments averaging US$25 million a year will emerge in the years
1976/78.  Part of this gap could pioboibly be financed lthrough acccss to tL!he
IMAF facilities including the secor-d oil faciiity, but additional foreign
exchange resources will still be needed.    In sum, Senegal has taken important
and commendable steps to ratioinalize the structure of domestic consumer aind
producer prices, and mobilize additional public savings. Yet, the ecuulomy
remains vulnerable because of its negative reserves, the volatility of world
market conditions for groundnuts, and the risks of drought.     In view of these
factors, external lenders should be prepared to finance not only all foreign
exchange costs but also a high proportion of local costs in priority projects.
Creditworthiness
11.       The terms of foreign aid to Senegal have been progressively harden-
ing over thie years. The proportion of grant aid declined from 85 percent in
the mid-sixties to 50 percent in FY72. Faced with a severe shortage of public
savings, the Government borrowed heavily on the Eurodollar market in tihe past
two years, in order to avoid a slowdown in public investments and to finance
acquisitions and participations by the public sector. Starting in FY74, this
led to a substantial increase in the public debt service which is expected
to absorb about 70 percent of public savings in FY75. This ratio should
decrease again in the coming years, following the marked improvement expected
in the public finance situation. Senegal's external debt service is still
very low, at about 5-6 percent of export revenues. But because of low foreign
exchange reserves and heavy dependence on one crop, Senegal will have to remain
prudent in its public debt management.
PART II: BANRK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
12.       The Bank Group has had 20 operations in Senegal to date.     Total
lending amounts to US$99 million (net of cancellations), including twelve
IDA credits, four Bank loans, cne blend of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC



-5-
operations, and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1975
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project and
the Site and Services Project, is moving forward without undue delays. The
procurement for the railway has been slow due to time consuming contract
approval procedures, but most project components have now been received or
ordered. The Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule,
although physical execution is now progressing satisfactorily. Terracing of
the first sub-site for Dakar was finished in November 1974 with an unexpected
cost saving. The Bank Group and Senegal held discussions recently on delays
in reorganizing the executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere
(OHLM), and in implementing Government's commitment to reorient its housing
policy in favor of lower income groups. Some of the agricultural projects,
such as the Terres Neuves Project and the Casamance Rice Project, were
hampered by delays in receiving the Government's- counterpart contribution;
however, owing to efforts of the project authorities, physical implementation
of these projects is proceeding generally according to schedule. Two agricul-
tural credits (140-SE and 404-SE) (see paragraph 20) provided for technical
assistance designed to facilitate the reorganization of the Office National
de la Cooperation et de l'Assistance pour le Developpement (ONCAD), but little
in the way of positive results was achieved; nevertheless, the Government has
recently taken steps to strengthen ONCAD's management and financial operations
(See Annex II) and continues to consult with IDA on further measures to be
taken.
14.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970-71 to 24 percent over
the 1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid
donor. This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and
disbursed debt from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980.
IBRD/IDA share in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent
in 1973 to about 13 percent by 1980.
15.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Top priority will continue to be rural development, in-
cluding development of irrigation in the Senegal River valley and in the
Casamance region (e.g., the Debi Lampsar engineering credit approved by the
Board although not yet signed, and a proposed second stage of Credit 252-SE),
intensification of groundnut production and diversification into new crops
and new regions (e.g., the project described in the present report and the
proposed Livestock Project in Eastern Senegal). As in the past, our agricul-
tural lending is expected to exceed one third of the total. Secondly, we
shall assist diversification of the economy by lending for the growing
sectors of tourism and industry (e.g., the proposed tourism infrastructure
project on the Petite Cote and a possible Ship Repair Project, based on



- 6 -
studies financed under Loan S-3SE; since these latter studies were undertaken,
the market prospects for such a project have been considerably altered by
virtue of changes in the pattern of international oil consumption, reopening
and possible enlargement of the Suez Canal and other developments affecting
the number and size of ships that will require repair facilities of the type
envisaged--these market prospects are now being reviewed). Thirdly, we shall
continue investment for modernizing and expanding the country's infrastructure
(e.g., two proposed highway projects and a proposed fishing wharf at Dakar
Port).  Finally we shall continue lending to reorient and expand the country's
education system, as in the Second Education Project.
PART III -- THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
16.       Agricuilture plays a central role in Senegal's economy, employing
v3ver 7n percctit of the total labor force.  Although it contributed only 38
percent of CUP in 1974, the sector's leverage on the economy is and will
remain cc.risidcrable through its impact on exports and its purchasing power
for locally--produced goods and services. Groundnuts and millet are the
country's main agricultural proclucts, and groundnuts are the cotuntry's princi-
pal eoxport.  During tle last four years groundnuts have comprised between 35
arid 55 percent of total exports and generated about 60 percent of value added
in tWe agricul tural sector.  Millet continues to be the staple food grain
alt%ough rice and wheat consumption arc increasing rapidly, particularly in
uroan areas.  Since 1968 Senegal has suffered from a series of severe droughts
and in 1968, 1970 and 1972 abnormally large food imports were needed to meet
de;oand.  1972 was the worst season and during it agricultural and livestock
production fell by moic than 25 percent.   Weather has been better in the last
to7o years, but even in years of normal rainfall, domestic agricultural pro-
duction meets only about 60 percent of the country's food requirements, and
food imports absorb 15-20 percent of total export earnings.   This situation is
to the extreme variability of rainfall in Senegal, where not only sharp
annual variations in total rainfall occur, but where there is wide variation
between years in the distribution pattern of rainfall.
17.       Small-scale rainfed farming accounts for 95 percent of production,
and there is a limited though growing amount of irrigated development in the
Delta of the Senegal River and in the Casamance Region. Commercial farming
is restricted to a few vegetable-growing operations and a large sugar cane
plantation in the Delta.  The small farm sector consists of about 360,000
farms most of which range in size from 3 to 10 hectares. The cropping pattern
is very similar throughout the country with millet/sorghum and groundnuts each
occupying about half of the cropped area. Simple animal-drawn equipment is
widely ulsd and there is virtually no mechanized farming.  Per capita annual
incomes from a typical farm average about US$85.   Rural incomes are signifi-
cantly lower in the undeveloped areas of the Senegal River valley, the
nort:l eryi area of the Croundnut Basin and in the relatively undeveloped area
of eastern Senegal.  The use of improved seeds, fertilizers and pesticides



7-
is slowly expanding assisted by government subsidies, but despite this,
production remains low because of poor soils and erratic rainfall and the
country is increasingly unable to feed its growing urban population. Imports
of cereals have amounted to 400,000 to 440,000 tons in recent years, of which
150,000 to 200,000 tons of rice.
18.       Population densities and agricultural development potentials differ
between regions. In the north and east of the country, large areas are only
suitable for extensive livestock production.    In the Groundnut Basin,
where the bulk of the rural population is concentrated within about 100 miles
of Dakar, population pressure, relatively poor soils and erratic rainfall
make it difficult to increase agricultural production and farmer incomes.
However, through introducing improved farming practices supported by farmer
training programs, the prospects are good for increasing and diversifying
crop production in Sine Saloum, which is situated on the southern boundary
of the Groundnut Basin and where rainfall is better and population density
lower than in the rest of the Basin.
19.       In the years immediately following Independence, Government assigned
low priority to the agriculture sector in allocating public investment and
recurrent expenditures. Since then, however, increasing priority has been
given to the sector. Thus while only 4-6 percent of the current budget now
goes to agriculture, the sector's share of the investment budget has increased
steadily and currently amounts to between 20 and 25 percent. In November 1974
Government raised the producer prices for groundnuts (by 40 percent), millet
and sorghum (7 percent) and rice (20 percent) as incentives to their in-
creased production. The consumer subsidy on rice (which cost the Government
about US$30 million in 1973/74) was abolished at the same time. These actions
illustrate Government's determination to increase domestic production and
reduce reliance on imports of food.
20.       Two Bank Group projects (140-SE, 404-SE) have provided medium-term
credit through the National Development Bank of Senegal and the cooperative
network to help farmers purchase draft animals, animal-drawn equipment and
fertilizer. The Terres Neuves Project (254-SE) was a pilot scheme to test
the feasibility of settling farmers in the southeast of the country where
climatic conditions are more favorable than in the Groundnut Basin.     A
second project was appraised in 1974 that would build on the results of the
first project. A livestock project has been prepared with UNDP assistance
for Bank Group consideration in the Eastern Region and is expected to be
appraised in May-June 1975.
21.       The Casamance project (252-SE) is improving extension and credit
services to 5,000 farmers in order to expand rice cultivation by 12,000 ha.
Government has indicated its desire to expand the scope of this successful
project and a follow-up project will be appraised later this year. The Bank
Group has also assisted the private sector by financing through IFC a ferti-
lizer factory (SIES), and a small irrigated truck farmer operation producing
vegetables for the export market (BUD Senegal).



-8-
22.       Regulation of the Senegal River in order to permit irrigated de-
velopment is being sought jointly by Senegal, Mauritania and Mali within the
Organization for the Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS).     OMVS,
helped by UNDP, has prepared an ambitious, long-range development program
that ultimately could permit development of year-round irrigation on 430,000
ha along the river of which about 220,000 ha would be in Senegal. 'The pro-
gram would also include power generation and improvement of navigation on
the river. Two potential regulatory dams have been studied by OMVS: a
multipurpose dam at Maanantali, Mali, and the Delta dam at Diama, Senegal.
Aitltough some parts of the O1RIS program as recently conceived mnay be overly
ambitious, the overall concept is sound and of very high priority,
anoi thie Bank has been actively reviewing witlh oth-ter doniors the merits and
feasibility of the entire program since July 1974.    Planning for irrigation
projects is already starting, and IDA approved the Debi-Lampsar irrigation
enineering project in April 1975.     It will provide engineering and related
sL'idies for 5,000 ha of doujble cropping-, using watevs (1u)ring the diry season
from Diamia reservoir potential ;s soon as it bCcorrcs operational, .15s now
planned, in about 1CMO.
23.       A Bank Group sector mission visited Senegal late in 1974 to assist
the Government in assessing the relative merits of its various agricuiltural
development options. The mission pointed out that scope for significant
increases in productivity and for developing a snall farm structure capable
of generating acceptable incomes existed througili harnessing the country's
walter resources, primarily the Senegal River Valley, but also those of the
Casamance region.   How7ever, the development of irrigation potential in Casamance
and the Senegal River Basin kno-uld not affect the Groundnut Basin and other
arcas of the country whichi i;oust continue to rely on rainfed agricuilture and
in w;hich1 the bulk of the population lives.  For these areas, the sector mission
concluded that, by adopting currently available technology, incomes from a
typical rainfed farm can be increased by about 30 percent.    Even with this
increase, farmers incomes and standards of living will remain low by any
criteria.
24.        In November 1974, fertilizer prices were increased by one-third but
they are still heavily subsidized.    Credit 40!-SE provides for annual consulta-
tions between IDA and the Government on the level of fertilizer subsidies. The
first of these consultations was held during negotiations of the present Sine
Saloum Project.   The Government confirmed that its policy was to progressively
raise prices for fertilizers to market levels as a means of ensuring their effi-
cient use. Agreement was reached during negotiations that consultations between
the Government and the Association would be held in October-November of each
year to discuss the fertilizer price for the following campaign (Section 4.03
of the Credit Agreement).



-9-
PART IV: THE PROJECT
25.       The Government of Senegal requested the Bank, the Association, and
the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France to help finance
an intensified agriculture development project based on a pilot scheme that
the Government and CCCE have financed jointly since 1971. In April 1973, a
PMWA mission identified the project for possible Bank financing, after which
a Government agricultural agency, Societe de Developpement et de Vulgarisation
Agricole (SODEVA), prepared the project using financing provided by the Second
IDA Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 404-SE).
26.       In July 1974, a Bank/IDA mission appraised the project in the field
at the same time as Mr. J. Cantournet appraised it for CCCE. Negotiations
were held in Washington April 15-18, 1975. The Senegalese delegation was led
by Mr. Ousmane Seck, Minister of Plan-and Cooperation.
27.       An appraisal report No. 661a-SE, is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and credit and project
summary, and the attached map (IBRD - 11251) shows the project area.
The Project Area
28.       The project area covers the heavily populated Sine Saloum region
in the southern part of the Groundnut Basin (about 800,000 people). Sine
Saloum's 70,000 farms produce 40-60 percent of Senegal's groundnuts and 33
percent of its millet while supporting livestock herds numbering some 470,000
cattle, and 460,000 sheep and goats. Thus Sine Saloum is one of the principal
agricultural regions of Senegal in spite of an extended dry season during
which agricultural production virtually ceases due to lack of water. In this
area, the farm size per family unit averages between 5 to 10 ha, and the
annual average income per capita is US$100.
Project Description
29.       The project would build on the results of the Government's national
"Programme Agricole," which has been supported by Credits 140-SE and 404-SE.
Begun in the early 1960s, Programme Agricole supplied farmers with a minimum
package of fertilizers, seeds and animal-drawn implements for increased pro-
duction of groundnuts and millet. Some 80 percent of the farmers now parti-
cipate in Programme Agricole and resulting production increases have begun
to level off. This evidence indicates that Programme Agricole may have
reached the limits of its development potential in Sine Saloum. Further
increases in output of groundnuts, cereals, and livestock would be sought
under the proposed project by training farmers in the use of intensive farm-
ing practices involving complete land clearing, use of oxen for deeper plow-
ing, diversification of crops, and advanced animal husbandry techniques.
These methods have been successfully demonstrated in the pilot project in
the region financed by CCCE and Government.



- 10 -
30.       The project would be carried out by SODEVA's extension staff over
the five-year period 1975/76 to 1979/80. Under the project, farmers would
be trained to clear their fields of stumps and other impediments and to
deeply cultivate their soil by plowing every three to four years. To
prevent soil erosion from clearing and stump removal over about 50,000 ha
of land and to compensate for the potential reduction of fuel and forage
supplies, farmers would be encouraged to utilize contour plowing and strip
cropping and to plant trees for windbreaks and fuel. Farmers would also
be urged to try seed varieties and fertilizer rates recommended by Senegal's
research organizations. By project year five, the project's staff would
closely supervise about 50 percent of the farmers in the project area and
production practices would be intensified on about 20 percent of the culti-
vated land. At full maturity the project would also help farmers fatten
16,000 cattle annually by introducing improved husbandry practices and by
providing water lifting equipment and a small animal feed mixing plant at
Kaolack to be o-.wned and operated by SODEVA. The project would also help
reduce calf miortality and raise the calving rate tlhrouglh improved feeding and
animal health care.  All project farmers would maintain farm records under
the close supervision of extension staff, the results to be evaluated by
SODEVA on the basis of a one percent sample of project farmers.
31.       The extension services and other support inputs provided by SODEVA
under the project will allow farmers to reach a higher level of agricultural
development which can be sustained by regular Government rural services fol-
lowing project completion.   Consequently, the project essentially entails
capitalizing over the five-year development period the cost of the extension
effort required to introduce the new techniques; 34,000 farmers would be
trained in these improved techniques and the project benefits would be the
incremeintal production they would generate.
32.       The project explicitly provides for:
(a)  strengtheniing SODEVA by providing it with buildings, equipment
and staff;
(b)  constructing and renovating training facilities, and providing
courses for extension workers;
(c)  demonstrating improved cultivation techniques for cereals,
groundnuts and cotton;
(d)  introducing improved animal husbandry practices for draft
oxen, beef cattle, and breeding cows; constructing and
operating an animal feed plant;
(e)  sLurplying imiplements and seasonal inputs and providing
rmedium-term and seasonal credit;
(f) establishing a tree nursery and distributing trees for
windbreaks and future fuel supplies, and demonstrating
soil conservation techniques;



- 11 -
(g)  monitoring and evaluating the results of project activities;     -
and
(h) hiring consultants to review grain marketing policies,
procedures and facilities.
33.       SODEVA has been designated by the Government as the agency with
overall responsibility for agricultural development in the Groundnut Basin,
and it has already been responsible for the Sine Saloum pilot project. In
carrying out the execution of this project, SODEVA will coordinate closely
with other organizations providing development services in the Groundnut
Basin: Office National de la Cooperation et de l'Assistance pour le
Developpement (ONCAD) for the supply of fertilizers and implements to
farmers and for marketing of groundnuts; Banque Nationale de Developpement
du Senegal (BNDS) for supplying credit to farmers; and Societe de Developpement
des Fibres Textiles (SODEFITEX) for extension services and inputs for cotton
growers and for cotton marketing. SODEVA is well managed and effective and
has already established good working relationships with all of these organi-
zations.
34.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$30.9 million or US$28
million net of taxes and duties (9 percent of gross costs). The foreign exchange
component is US$3.9 million, or 14 percent of the total net of taxes. Phy-
sical contingencies and expected price increases would amount to 30 percent
of base cost estimates, which are based on mid-1975 prices. The proposed
Bank loan and IDA Credit of US$14 million would cover the foreign exchange
component and US$10.1 million (42 percent) of local costs for a total of 50
percent of the total costs net of taxes and duties.
35.       The Bank loan would be made to the Government for a term of 20
years, including a five-year grace period. The IDA Credit would be made to
the Government at standard terms. The CCCE would also provide a loan
of US$8.9 million to the Government for a term of 20 years, including
a five-year grace period, bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.5 percent.
The remainder of project costs would be financed by the Government and Banque
Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS).
36.       Since SODEVA, which has no revenues of its own, would carry out the
project on the Government's behalf, the Bank/IDA and CCCE financing (US$22.9
million), plus the Government's contribution to SODEVA's costs of US$4.2
million, would be passed on to SODEVA as grants. In addition, the Government
would provide SODEVA with an interest-free loan for a term of at least six
years, in an amount of CFAF 200 million (US$889,000), equivalent to about
three months of its expenditures, as working capital for the project.
Credit Arrangements
37.       BNDS would channel credit to project farmers through cooperatives
using, in part, the rollover fund created by two earlier IDA credits (140-SE
and 404-SE) and funds borrowed on favorable terms from the Central Bank.



- 12 -
Medium-term loans (five years) would finance 100 percent of the cost of
implements, and short-term loans (six to nine months) would cover 100 percent
of seasonal inputs. The loans would bear interest at 2.0 percent above the
Central Bank rate (currently 5.5 percent). The effective interest rate
for seasonal loans would be on the order of 12 to 16 percent since the
nominal rate is charged on an annual basis while the loans must actually
be repaid within six to nine months.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       Vehicles, equipment and civil works expenditures would total about
US$2.15 million. Contracts for buildings, equipment and vehicles for more
than US$50,000, aggregating about US$400,000, would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guide-
lines for procurcmrent. Locally manufactured goods would be allowed a prefe-
rence of 15% or the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower, when
comparing domestic with foreign bisls. 'Iontracts for ;Tuounts bot.weeen TJStOOO0 and
US$50,000 totalling US$1.6 mill-ion, including the bulk of civil works contracts
which are small and widely scattered would be awarded on the basis of competi-
tive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which
are satisfactory to the Bank.   The remaining equipment purchases, totalling
US$150,000 would include office and house furnishings and equipment for agri-
cultural demonstrations that are for small amounts and would be purchased
chiefly from local sources.   Consultant services, totalling about US$200,000,
would be obtained according to the Bank Group's normal procedures. The balance
of project costs would be for personnel and management (U}S$24.9 mil1ion), and
for farm inputs (US$3.69 million) and would be unsuitable for competitive
bidding.
39.       The proceeds of the IDA credit and Bank loan would be disbursed over
five years to cover 60 percent of:
(a) - the costs of buildings, vehicles, equipment and
furnishings (US$1.0 million);
(b) - the salaries and allowances of staff employed
under contract by SODEVA (US$7.5 million);
(c) - SODEVA's other project operating costs (US$2.0 million).
The IDA Credit and then the Bank loan would be disbursed plri passu with
the CCCE loan in the ratio of 60:40 so that the Credit and the two loans would
together cover 100% of the costs of the above items.    The balance of the IDA
Credit and Bank loan would cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs of the
consultants (US$160,000), and a contingency reserve of US$3.3 million.
Marketing Arrangements
40.       ONCAD has a marketing monopoly for groundnuts, whichi it buys through
cooperatives and sells to domestic processors of groundnut cake and oil for
export, while SODEFITEX has the marketing monopoly for cotton and operates



- 13 -
its own ginneries. Government sets producer prices for cotton and groundnuts
which, at present levels, provide good incentives to project farmers. Govern-
ment has undertaken to fix these prices at levels advantageous to the farmers
taking into consideration various criteria such as world market prices and.
costs of marketing and processing. At the request of the Government or of the
Bank/IDA, annual exchanges of views will take place on the fixing of producer
prices for cotton and groundnuts. (See Sections 4.02 and 4.03 of the draft
Credit Agreement).  Most of the project's production of these two crops would
be acported.
41.       Much of the project's cereal production will be for subsistence
consumption; however, withdrawal of the consumer subsidy for imported cereals
has greatly improved the prospects for marketing surpluses. Consequently, it
may be necessary to expand marketing, storage and processing facilities to
handle the domestic cereal crop. The project would provide for consultants
to be retained by SODEVA to study these questions and propose appropriate
measures. Although it is Government's present policy that ONCAD should have
a marketing monopoly for cereals, the Government has undertaken to ensure
adequate marketing of cereals and, to that end, to utilize as and when needed
all available marketing channels. (See Section 4.05 of the draft Credit
Agreement.) At the request of the Government or of the Bank/IDA, annual
exchanges of views will take place on the level of cereal prices and on the
system for marketing cereals. (See Sections 4.03 and 4.05 of the draft
Credit Agreement.) The Government has also agreed that, if subsidies on the
retail price of imported cereals are reintroduced, it would inform the Bank/
IDA which may request consultations with the Government. (See Section 4.04
of the draft Credit Agreement.)
42.       Livestock products would be sold in urban centers through local
traders; the price of livestock and livestock products are expected to remain
high in the foreseeable future because of the losses suffered by breeding
herds during recent droughts.
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
43.       At full development, the project would produce an additional annual
output of 27,000 tons of groundnuts, 31,000 tons of cereals, 1,000 tons of
cotton, 1,600 tons of milk, 1,500 tons of beef and 6,000 calves. At the end
of the fifth year, the net value in 1974 terms of this incremental production
would amount to about US$8.5 million and would also entail a contribution of
about US$7.5 million to Senegal's net foreign exchange earnings. The economic
rate of return of the project is estimated at nearly 25 percent over 10 years.
Project cost increases or benefit decreases of 25 percent would lower the rate
of return to 13 percent and 12 percent respectively. The project is expected,
therefore, to have a satisfactory rate of return.
44.       Project benefits would help raise the standard of living in the
project areas. About 80 percent of the beneficiaries have pre-project incomes
between US$60 and US$90 per capita, which under the project would be increased



- 14 -
to about US$115, this would be above the average for rural areas but equiv-
alent only to about one-third of national per capita GDP. In addition to its
satisfactory rate of return and production increases and the directly quanti-
fiable benefits derived from increased production, the project would help
reduce the threat of soil erosion, and the resulting long term losses in pro-
ductive capacity, whichi accompanies increasing population pressure. It could
demonistrate efficient farming techniques that could be adopted by many of
Senegal's farmers to increase their incomes and would create a nucleus of
some 34,000 farmers who could be expected to expand the application of these
tecnniques on their own farms and serve as an example for other farmers.     It
could also help develop in SODEVA an experienced extension service capable
of expanding the scope of the proposed project to include even more farmers,
or of carrying out future development projects in Sine Saloum or other regions.
PART V:  LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUThORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and Loan Agreement between
the Republic of Senegal and the Association and the Bank, respectively, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the texts of draft resolu-
tions approving the proposed credit and loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
46.       The draft Development Credit and Loan Agreements provide that the
effectiveness of the credit and loan is conditional upon notification to the
Association and the Bank by the Caisse Centrale that its conditions of effec-
tivciness have been fulfilled; upon notification to the Association and the
rjank by the Governr,ment that it and SODEVA have entered into an agreement
satisfactory to the Association and the Bank under which SODEVA is charged
wit'n the responsibilities for carrying out the project; and also upon recep-
tion from the Government by SODEVA of an interest-free loan for a term of at
least six years, in an amount of CFA francs 200,000,000 as working capital
for the project. Other matters of particular interest are discussed in
paragraphs 40 and 41 above.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit and loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and of the Bank.

them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 252     Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 19, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Good management and adequate rainfalls during the last campaign
ensured good crops for groundnut and rice, which are well above appraisal
estimates. The number of farmers participating in the project is expanding
at a faster pace than anticipated and their response is good. Housing and
offices were commissioned early in 1975, three months behind schedule. The
road improvement program is in progress, but most of the improvement of bottom-
iand for rice cultivation probably will not be implemented, because of lack of
funds and of technical expertise. The project has incurred some cost overruns,
main-ly because extension staff were increased to cope with good farmers'
rasponse, and because of salary increases. In addition, changes in the
US$ exchange rate will cause a loss equivalent to US$900,000. As a result,
the project will be short of funds at the end of 1975, instead of 1976. Gov-
ernment intends to ask the Bank Group to finance a new project in the same
arma starting early CY 1976. Terms of reference for the preparation of this
seconld project have been proposed to the Government. RMWA is coordinating
that preparation, and appraisal is tentatively scheduled for July 1975.
Cr. No. 253     Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18. 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
Several changes to the architectural design of the main construction
C-"ponent of the project and the resulting delays in the procurement of
i-l -iture and equipment made it necessary in June 1973 to lengthen by about
six months the original implementation and disbursement schedule.     Implementation
is now within the revised schedule and progressing well. The initial delays in
irtpThmentation, the effect of the US dollar devaluation, and recent abnormal
price increases all result in a cost overrun of about US$500,000.
Cr. No. 254     Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pat--d at appraisal.  Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops last season. Thae project has been successful in providing higher
incomes than expected for settlers and has attracted more active people than
anticipated in 1974. STN (the State Corporation in charge of the project)
has taken over project management from the management agency agreed upon at
appraisal. This change, together with personnel shifts,,have caused mana-
gerial ar.d administrative problems that are not yet solved. The project's
accounts have been audited recently. Government's contribution to project
costs has been paid in full, and the previous financial difficulties encoun-
terezu by the proiect are now overcome. IDA and Government have agreed on
the scope of a follow-up project, appraised in July 1974, although some dis-
ai---ement persists on some technical features and organizational matters.

Loan 835-SE/Credit 314-SE      Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date June 30, 1975
Initial planning and procurement were slow but procurement for
track renewal is now complete and about 90 percent of equipment for workshop
rehabilitation has been ordered. Construction and track renewal are expected
to start soon about a year behind schedule. Poor management, inadequate use
of locomotives, lack of spare parts and cumbersome financial restrictions have
prevented the railway from satisfying the demand in Senegal for rail transporta-
tion. However, in the last six months Government has taken measures to assist
the railway, including tariff increases, subsidies for unprofitable lines and
a study to reorganize technical assistance; the railway had its first positive
cash flow in many years in 1973/74. At Government's request US$1.5 million
was reallocated under the project for the immediate rehabilitation of locomo-
tive power and rolling stock and for other high priority investment items
in order to increase the railway's capacity, particularly to carry phosphates
for export and international traffic to Mali.
Cr. No. 336     Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Although credit effectiveness was delayed, physical implementation
of the project is now proceeding well. Terracing of the first sub-site for
Dakar was finished in November 1974 and preparation for the second sub-site
is underway. However, major problems remain regarding the reorganization of
the executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere (OHLM), and it
has been difficult so far to find suitable counterparts for the expatriate
technical assistance team. Selection of occupants is underway for the first
tranche of the project although several problems in the application of selec-
tion criteria remain to be solved. In addition, Government's commitment to
reorient substantially its housing policy in favor of lower income groups
has not been entirely fulfilled. The last supervision mission discussed with
Government and OHLM officials these various problems, including Government
policy towards housing and the execution of the project in light of its ori-
ginal objectives.
Ln. No. 866     Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the 1973-1976 telecommupications rehabilitation
and development program of OPTS (Senegalese postal and telecommunications
organization). It provides for the expansion and modernization of local and
long distance facilities in Dakar and in the northern region of Senegal.
The project is about 18 months behind schedule mainly due to delays in the
appointment of engineering consultants, in preparation of the bidding docu-
ments, and in procurement. Moreover, project costs have increased from US$8.9
million (including US$6.8 million foreign exchange) at appraisal, to US$20.3
million (including US$13.2 million foreign exchange). This cost overrun is
due to delay, unforeseen inflation, lack of international competition, changes



ANNEX II
Page 5
in design, and changes in exchange rates. To finance part of this cost
overrun, the Borrower applied to and obtained from Caisse Centrale de Coopera-
tion Economique (CCCE) a loan of US$3.8 million and made arrangements to
obtain suppliers' credits for another US$3.8 million.
Ln. No. 867    Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Work on the extension of the Dakar airport runway is scheduled to
be completed by the end of .June 1975 as forecast. Total cost is expected
to be within appraisal estimates although the borrower may be faced with
additional costs *u'e to the lower rate of exchange of the US dollar.
Cr. No. 350    River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Credit of January 9, 1973, Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Credit became effec,tive in June 1973. Procurement is now
comipleted for the main components of the project and contracts have been
awarded. Construction of works is progressing satisfactorily. The Senegalese
authorities requested that the Debi/Lampsar components of the project be
deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reformulated within the broader franework
of integrated development of the Senegal River Basin. The proposed reformula-
tion was agreed upon by IDA and an engineering project for Debi/Lampsar was
appraised in December 1974 and approved by the Board in April 1975. Because
of price increases and US dollar devaluation, the procecds of Credit 350-.SE
will not be sufficient to cover the project as appraised, despite the Jeletion
of the Debi/Lampsar component. The project authority, SAED (Societe d'
Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres cdu Delta), is presently seelking a
supplementary financing of about US$1.2 million to complete the project.
Cr. No. 366    Second Highway Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of April 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering studies
started about six months behind schedule and execution has been slow. Work
on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later than
appraisal estimates. The scope of work will have to be reduced due to cost
increases and declining value of the US dollar. Engineering studies for
the next phase of pavement strengthening are on schedule and will form the
basis for a third project to be appraised in May 1975.
Cr. No. 404    Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million
Credit of June 7, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good. Groundnut and cereal production
reached their highest level since 1969, about 50% over the 1973/74 productLon
level. Demand for medium-term credit remains stronger than anticipated, but
available credit funds would be sufficient to cover requirements for the
next campaign. The subsidy on fertilizer has not been reduced, as required,



ANNEX II
Page 6
but the scheduled study under the Credit should provide a basis for policy
review. Major organizational and financial problems still exist at ONCAD
despite technical assistance provided since 1969. Government has taken steps
to remedy this serious situation by giving ONCAD management more financial
autonomy and by strengthening it with qualified accountants.
Loan No. S.3-SE      Ship repair engineering loan:  US$0.6 million loan of
September 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 6, 1976
The project consists of carrying out studies to determine the
feasibility of a dry dock project, including:
A.   Technical studies including those of physical and geophysical
factors affecting site situation.
B.   Economic studies including a market survey, a revision of the
dry dock project feasibility study and survey formulating a
training program.
The loan became effective in February 1974 and the studies are
being reviewed by the Bank.
Cr. No. 446-SE   Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to help people in drought
affected areas to re-establish their self-sufficiency by assisting them to
redevelop and improve their farms and lands. The credit became effective
in February 1974. All sub-project plans have been approved by the Bank.
Orders were placed in late 1973 for all project items, most of the equipment
is already in place and initial delays in disbursements should be reversed
shortly.
Ln. No. 987-SE   SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This development finance company project would meet SOFISEDIT's
financial requirements for financing industrial and tourism projects through
1976.
Cr. No. 530-SE    Second Education Project: US$15.0 Million Credit of
February 19, 1975; Closing Date:   June 30, 1980
The credit for science centers, vocational training and non-formal
rural education became effective in April 1975.

Procurement Arrangements:
Vehicles, equipment and civil works expenditures would total about
US$2.15 million. Contracts for buildings, equipment and vehicles for more
than US$50,000, aggregating about US$400,000, would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
guidelines for procurement. Locally manufactured goods would be allowed a
preference of 15% or the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower,
when comparing domestic with foreign bids. Contracts for between US$10,000
and US$50,000 totalling US$1.6 million, including the bulk of civil works
contracts which are small and widely scattered would be awarded on the basis
of competitive biddiag advertised locally and in accordance with local proce-
dures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. The remaining equipment purchases,
totalling US$150,000 would include office and house furnishings and equipment
for agricultural demonstrations that are for small amounts and would be pur-
chased cliefly from local sources.    Consultant services, totalling about
US$200,000, would be obtained according to the Bank Group's normal procedures.
The balance of project costs would be for personnel and management (US$24.9
million), and for farm inputs (US$3.69 million) and would be unsuitable for
competitive bidding.
Consultants:         Total consultant's services would amount to 18 man/months.
Rate of Return:      The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at
nearly 25 percent over 10 years.
