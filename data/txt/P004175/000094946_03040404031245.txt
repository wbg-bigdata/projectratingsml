3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The projectfs overall objective was to promote the effectiveness of an urban rail transit system in Pusan
City, through demand management measures and modal integration and policy reforms in areas of public
parking and transit pricing. The specific goals identified in the SAR were to (a) increase ridership and cost
recovery of the subway network through an integrated strategy that includes transport demand management
(TDM), construction of intermodal facilities, and expansion of the transit system; (b) enhance PUTA's
subway capacity so it could accommodate future growth and serve as an altemative to auto use; and (c)
strengthen the capacity of existing institutions to plan and program urban transport investments.
The objectives of the project were clear and supported the Govemment's priorities of the time. In the early
1990's Korea's industrialization, improved living standards and rapid population growth were accompanied
by rapid increases in nearly all types of transportation. The city's total passenger traffic was projected to
grow at 5% per annum between 1993 and 2001, with the biggest increases anticipated in subway and
suburban rail traffic at about 15% per year. The Government's National Transport Action Plan, 1993,
provided for capacity expansion and traffic system management (TSM) strategies for urban areas.
Capacity expansion was planned for roads, rail, airports, and subway systems. New subways were
planned for four cities with populations greater than a million, with new lines to be added to the existing
systems in Seoul and Pusan. The project took an integrated approach to these issues, through the use of
demand management and improvements in supply directed towards encouraging and facilitating use of the
subway and improving the efficiency of the urban transportation system.
As discussed in the text, the viability of the program depended upon two key assumptions: (i) the proposed
demand management interventions would influence behavior in desired ways; and (ii) ridership growth
would continue in accordance with past trends. In retrospect, largely due to external factors, neither
expectation came true to the extent anticipated.
3.2 Revised Objective
The original project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project included three components, at an estimated project cost of US$365.4 million (including
contingencies and taxes). The base cost was estimated at US$286.7 million; physical and price
contingencies at US$45.7 million, and taxes at US$32.9 million (for details of actuals and estimates, see
Annex 2). The individual components are briefly described below:
Component A - Congestion Management (US$ 52.93 million). Introduction of a system to manage
vehicle traffic and encourage the use of subway and bus transport; this was intended to be the first step in
the development of a comprehensive congestion management program for Pusan. The component included
the following:
(i)  Transport Demand Management - Modal Integration Facilities at Nopo and Tongnae included the
construction of parking areas, bus turnarounds and passenger pick up facilities (US$ 27.98 million).
(ii) Transportation Systems Management strategies to be implemented along the East-West Bus Lane to
improve bus speeds, particularly during the peak traffic periods (US$ 2.18 million).
(iii) 5 year Transport Demand Management/Transportation Systems Management program to develop a
comprehensive policy and action plan for improved traffic management (US$ 22.8 million).

Component B - Expansion of Pusan Urban Transit System Capacity (US$ 309 million). Purchase of
subway cars to supplement trains on Line 1, and cars for trains on Line 2 which was planned to open in
1996. PUTA's capacity expansion plan called for an additional 310 subway cars, of which 258 cars (43
trains of 6-cars each) were for Line 2 (Phase I), and 52 for trains on Line 1. The latter 52 cars were
intended to reduce peak period overcrowding on Line I by increasing the length of 26 existing trains from 6
to 8 cars each. In 1994, during peak periods, over 230 passengers occupied the space of an average rail
car, which was designed to hold 125.
Component C - Institutional Development (US$ 3.42 million). Improvement in staff expertise in urban
transport investment planning/programming at the national and local levels through short and long-term
training courses, workshops, manuals and overseas training programs. It was agreed that the training and
education program would be financed by MOT, while the project financed the following studies: (i) Pusan
Transit Fare Structure Study; (ii) 5-year TDM/TSM Program Study; and (iii) a Study to identify
Altemative Long-term Financing Strategies for PUTA. Technical assistance (TA) consisting of one or two
professionals to advise the Pusan City Govemment on the implementation of TDM and TSM measures was
also included. The three sub-components had budgets as follows:
(i) Training (US$ 1.8 million)
(ii) Studies (US$ 1.5 million)
(iii) Technical Assistance (US$ 0.12 million)
3.4 Revised Components*
The project components were not revised. During project implementation the following Borrower requests
were approved by IBRD.
(i) The original closing date was extended on April 16, 1999, by one year, from June 30, 2000 to June
30, 2001; a second one year extension was approved on April 4, 2001, primarily to accommodate the
delivery of the last batch of subway cars.
(ii) The Loan Agreement was amended on March 22, 1999, to allow purchase of subway cars for Phase
II of Line 2 with the savings generated by the fluctuation of the exchange rate. The original
agreement included train cars for only Phase I, Line 2.
(iii) In October 2001, the Borrower requested cancellation of the unwithdrawn amount of
US$7,931,005.09; the request was approved and the loan and commitment charges for this amount
ceased to accrue from November 2, 2001.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project was well prepared, and quality at entry is rated satisfactory -- in addition to the SAR, a
comprehensive report on the Korean transport sector was completed and provided a rich background for the
project itself. Overall, the project was in line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, as articulated in
the Financial Intermediation Project (Loan 3689-KO); the key elements with a bearing on the development
objectives were identified during the preparation process and lessons from previous Bank projects in the
urban transport sector in Korea were incorporated.
At the time the project was being prepared, Korea had passed the income threshold for graduation from the
Bank, a graduation process had been agreed with the Government and was underway. The Bank's strategy
was to continue lending until graduation m areas where Bank involvement would provide value added, e.g.,
through sectoral policy advice or institutional strengthening, in addition to the resource transfer itself.
Urban transport was deemed one such area, as demand for urban infrastructure services was growing
rapidly due to rising incomes and consumption. The Pusan Urban Transport Project was designed as part
of a comprehensive metropolitan area program to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution from vehicles,
while improving coordination among different modes of transport.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall, the project outcome is Satisfactory. The project has succeeded in its overall objective to promote
the effectiveness of an urban rail transit system in Pusan City, through demand management measures,
modal integration, and policy reforms in the areas of public parking and transit pricing. Due to efforts by
PCG and PUTA, both within and transcending the framework of this project the quality of passenger
services has been maintained or improved, and the overall capacity of the subway network to meet current
and future travel demand has been increased. The objective of improvements in PUTA's operational cost
recovery was adversely affected by the Asian financial crisis, 1997-98, compounded by a slowdown in
population growth and decline in densities due to urban sprawl. The achievement of the specific objectives
of the Project is presented below.
A. Expansion of Pusan Urban Transit System Capacity
The progress towards this objective has been satisfactory. PUTA has significantly expanded the subway
network and increased its service capacity while maintaining a very good track record in terms of safety.
336 rail cars have been purchased, delivered, and are in use on Line 2 of the metro system. The number of
cars purchased under the project is higher than the originally planned 310; the increase in cars bought was
made possible by the devaluation of the Won during the Asian crisis. The overall increase in capacity on
Phase 1, Line 2, is thus higher than what was planned under the project. The number of cars in service on
Line 1 has also increased as PUTA used its own funds, which would otherwise have been directed to
funding cars for Line 2, to procure 60 cars for Line 1. These have been used to increase the length of trains
on Line 1 from 6 to 8 cars each.
At the same time that service capacity on Line 1 and Phase 1, Line 2, has been increased, the size of the
subway network has also been substantially increased, though the Bank did not participate in the financing
of the civil works for network expansion. With the completion and opening of Lines 2 and 3, the subway
network will have more than tripled in length from the original network of Line 1 (32 km) to a network of
more than 100 kms in length, with 5 transfer stations and more than 100 stations at an investment cost of
6,000 billion Won or about USD 6 billion equivalent. (See Section 4.2, Outputs by Component, and
Section 5.4, Costs and Financing).
While system capacity has been successfully expanded, the subsidiary goal of influencing modal shares in
favor of mass transit has been less successful. The share of cars in total trips (all modes) has increased
from approximately 17% in 1991 to about 30% in 2001. At the same time, metro ridership has not
expanded as rapidly (see table 1). Following a period of passenger growth at the rate of 12% per annum
between 1988 and 1993, the average annual growth in ridership declined to 3.6 % between 1994 and 2001.
Consequently, between 1991 and 2001, the share of metro in total trips (all modes) increased to about 12%
as compared to a share of 22.5 % forecast at appraisal. As the latter number includes ridership for Line 2
and Line 2 only became fully operational towards the end of 2002, there is room for an increase in metro's
modal share as Line 2 ridership matures.
These numbers reflect the shift in Busan's traffic mix since the time of appraisal - automobiles have
assumed greater significance than before. In Busan, a steady rise in income and living standards,
demographic and industrial land use changes, and the development of Korea's car manufacturing industry
were all factors influencing the ownership and use of cars (see section 5.1). Compared with 1991 car
ownership has increased from 76 vehicles per thousand population to 141 per thousand in 2001. This
-4 -



despite the growing vehicle ownership restraint measures, including a certificate system that
proves the availability of a garage for each new car buyer, and the obligation to purchase subway
bonds while purchasing a vehicle, to curb growth in motorization.
In the past, urban transport prices in-Korea have been regulated by the central government in the interest
of inflation control. More recently the authority to set tariffs has been decentralized to local governments -
responsibility for bus and taxi fares was decentralized in January 2000 while subway fares setting authority
was transferred in April 1999. Since decentralization, subway fares have been increased but remain
below full cost. Direct costs for private vehicles also do not reflect full costs to society, despite
recent increases in fuel prices. For example, the cost of a 10 km trip by car is estimated to be
over 600 Won. A metro ticket for travel over the same distance costs 600 Won; any marginal
cost advantage the metro has, is not sufficient to overcome the greater convenience and comfort
of travel by car. The regulated prices tend to stimulate transport demand and distort modal choices.
In general, usage costs tend to favor private cars over public transport and even buses have been losing
their share of total trips though they are the dominant public transport mode in Busan. In fact, the share of
all public transport (bus, taxi, MRT) in passenger movement has declined from about 80% in 1991 to
approximately 68 % in 2001.

B. Increase in Cost Recovery
Increasing cost recovery was one of the development objectives of the project cited m the SAR, and it was
incorporated as an operating ratio covenant in the Loan Agreement. The target, starting in 1996, was to
maintain an operating ratio of 100; i.e., PUTA's total revenues from passenger fares and advertising should
be at least equal to total operating costs (includes working costs, depreciation of rolling stock and
equipment plus a replacement reserve).

It is seen from Table 2 that the objective of full cost recovery was not achieved. During implementation, the
Bank focused on recovery of operating costs (working costs plus rolling stock and equipment depreciation).
On this measure, PUTA did better; between 1994 and 1997, PUTA was within a few percentage points of
the target and in 1994 and 1997 did meet the target of 100% cost recovery. The increase in depreciation
associated with the start of operations on Line 2 was a main factor in the failure to meet the target in 1999.
The intention was to maintain and improve PUTA's excellent operational performance and strengthen its
ability to service existing and future debt. The improvement in operating cost recovery was to be
accomplished through a combination of fare increases in step with inflation and increased ridership.
The history of fare increases, shown in Table 3, Annex 3, is of interest. There were four fare increases in
the period 1994-2001, representing cumulatively a real increase of about 44% in the base fare and about
27% in the average fare paid. In the early part of the project, up to 1998, real fares were maintained at the
1995 level. Subsequently, fare increases exceeded the general inflation level by a substantial margin. For
example, a base fare increase of 11% was approved in 1999 and another one of 20% in 2000, while the
inflation rate was less than 1% in 1999 and 2.25% in 2000. Between 1999 and 2001, average fares
increased by approximately 35%. This was partially offset by a loss of traffic, so that the real increase m
business revenue from Line 1 was roughly 30% over this period.
Slow ridership growth rates have been one of the factors in PUTA's failure to meet cost recovery targets.
The growth rate of metro usage has been impacted by the following factors: delays in completion of Line 2,
the 1997-98 Asian Crisis, inadequate integration of service with buses and other vehicles, suburbanization
and motorization trends.

In reviewing ridership trends it is necessary to take into account the country's economic situation during the
project period. In 1997, Korea suffered a financial crisis accompanied by a rapid depreciation of its
currency. The GDP growth rate fell from 5.5% in 1997 to -5.8% in 1998; unemployment increased from
less than 2.5 percent of the workforce before the crisis to 8.7 percent in 1999. The consequences of the
economic decline were felt in PUTA's ridership - passenger demand on Line I actually declined in 1998
with a marginal recovery in 1999. Passenger and advertising revenues fell by about 10% between 1997-98
while working costs were driven up by the depreciation of the Won. The costs of materials and supplies
alone increased at an average annual rate of more than 26% between 1994 and 2001. Korea's labor laws
did not allow reduction in skilled labor costs while need for professional staff pushed up labor costs with
the opening of Line 2. PUTA's management plans not to hire additional staff for the operation of Line 3.
This is expected to lower unit operating costs and improve PUTA's financial position in the coming years.
The project supported pilot TDMI/SM measures for better bus-subway integration and improvement of
subway utilization. These included, inter alia, introduction of a bus priority scheme on the East-West
highway linked to the Tongnae facility, urban bus turn arounds, bus, taxi, and car pick up facilities, and
construction of park and ride facilities at Nopodong and Tongnae stations. The pilots have been fully
successful in creating convenient transfer possibilities between the subway and road based vehicles. While
some of the physical deficiencies in improving bus-subway network connections have been addressed, some
major changes have either been recently completed or are outstanding: the inter-city bus terminal was
re-located from the CBD to the Nopo station area as recently as September 2001 while the highway
connection to the Nopo metro station is still to be constructed. Both of these are expected to increase the
accessibility of the metro at Nopo station and facilitate metro usage.
Feeder bus services, for suburban commuters, to the metro are inadequate and available at few subway
stations. PUTA attempted to remedy this by offering connecting services by mini buses in residential areas,
but faced strong opposition from private operators. Bus operators continue to oppose route restructuring
and perceive themselves as competing with, rather than complementing, the subway. Operators claim to
have lost ridership with the opening of Line 2: at least 6 bus routes were closed in 1999-2000 and 12
shortened with the opening of Line 2. Inadequate bus-MRT service and fare integration continues to be a
major obstacle in improving metro patronage levels. Since the bus system is run privately and the subway
is publicly owned, bus-metro integration is taking longer to coordinate and implement. It has been a major
contribution of the project to promote recognition by the City, PUTA, and private bus operators of the need
for inter-modal integration. Up to now the city has introduced a fare card, the Hanaro fare card, which can
be used for both the bus and metro systems. Working with the MoF and MoTC, the City is getting ready to
implement revenue sharing arrangements with the bus sector which would allow introduction of an
integrated bus-metro fare system. Once implemented, these would go a long way towards integrating and

improving the efficiency of public transport.
Suburbanization and motorization trends in Busan, discussed in Section 4.1 A above, have not favored the
use of the subway. Subway usage has been affected by population movements driven by the financial crisis
and real estate developments in the Busan metropolitan area. Most strikingly, overall population within
Busan actually declined by 2% from 1991-2001. The decline in major industries such as shoe
manufacturing and re-location of others, including Dongguk Steel and Cheil Sugar, to the suburbs, affected
the growth and location of Busan's population (see section 5.1). Low income populations living along Line
1 have been re-locating to Gupo and Hwamyung, along the west corridor of Line 2. These residential areas
offer low cost housing and easy road access to the re-located factories in the Kimnhae area, near the airport;
this area is not served by the metro. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this has adversely impacted
ridership on Line 1. Benefits to Line 2 are not yet evident, and will be seen as the ridership numbers for
Line 2 mature. Overall, suburbanization and motorization trends have led to an increase in average distance
travelled, reduced public transport accessibility, and more passenger-car dependent travel patterns.
A major factor in the slower than expected growth of metro usage has been the delay in completion of Line
2. The construction of Line 2 was phased such that the first phase was built in a less populated area to
accommodate future growth while the second phase was set in a high density area. While the costs of
operating line 2 are already part of PUTA's expenses, ridership from line 2 has still to mature as
completion of both phases was substantially behind schedule, and lagged the completion dates estimated at
appraisal. Both phases of Line 2 experienced completion delays of about one and a half years each. Since
phase II, of Line 2, was completed only in September 2002, ridership numbers for phase II are not yet
available, and the usage levels for phase I will be impacted by the opening of Phase II. As patronage on line
2 matures, PUTA's operational cost recovery is expected to increase.

C. Financial Status of PUTA
Going beyond the financial covenant agreed under the Loan, the real concern during appraisal was the
sustainability of PUTA's capital financing program. At the end of 1993, the outstanding principal of loans
held by PUTA totaled W1,394 billion. Between 1990-93, PUTA's annual borrowings were well in excess
of the amount needed to cover construction costs. The net difference was used to meet interest and
principal payments on existing debt. The upcoming borrowing requirements for Line 2 were large and also
relied on short term debt. The practice of rolling over existing debt with short term debt, in conjunction
with borrowing for ongoing construction, had the potential to put PUTA into a position of ever increasing
debt.
In December 1993, a debt management plan was formulated whereby the central govemment committed to
- 8-



finance 25% and the PCG to finance 20% of PUTA's capital costs with cash grants. However, to
strengthen PUTA's balance sheet, durng the course of project implementation, the central government and
PCG actually contributed a much higher share -- 78% of the investment costs of Line 2 were financed by
the central govermment and PCG. A hundred percent of the capital costs of Line 3 are being borne by the
central government and PCG. Despite the higher capital contributions for Line 2, PUTA's financial
position has weakened over the course of the project and since 1998, PUTA has received both capital and
operating subsidies.
At present, PUTA needs a constant external cash injection each year to meet its cash shortages due to
operational losses, ongoing capital investment, and debt service requirements. The subsidy requirements
are higher than anticipated at appraisal. For example, in 2001, PUTA received government
subsidies of Won 461.8 billion as compared to the estimated Won 132.2 billion, at appraisal. The
company's liquidity problems have deteriorated in the 1995-2001 period, with the current ratio
falling from 0.75 m 1995 to a very unsatisfactory 0.07 in 2001.
Starting in 1997, PUTA's total debt has exceeded or been equal to its total assets. Further, the
ratio of current liabilities (maturities of less than one year) to total debt has increased from about
17% in 1995 to 30 % in 2001. Most of PUTA's debt is inherited from the borrowings for Line 1.
It is estimated that about three quarters of all debt has a 3 to 5 year maturity. At the end of 200 1, the
outstanding principal on loans stood at W1,924 billion and this is expected to continue growing (See Annex
3b, Table 3). Most of PUTA's debts are inherited from the borrowings for Line 1: about 80% of PUTA's
total interest payments in 2001, and about 83% of its principal payments in 2001 were on pre-'94 debt. It
is clear that PUTA cannot survive without a restructuring of its balance sheet involving either earlier
repayment of its debt and/or removal of debt from its balance sheet (See Annex 3b, for scenario analysis).
Regardless of the method and timing to clean PUTA's balance sheet, it is likely that in the future the central
government will shoulder an even greater burden. After restructuring, the concern would be if PUTA can
meet its operational expenses. PUTA's ability to recover operating expenditures will depend on growth in
metro ridership and fare increases. It is expected that patronage will improve as Line 2 ridership matures.
With regard to fares, although the transit market could potentially absorb higher fares, fare increases would
need to be carefully assessed for potential impact on ridership, before implementation.
In sum, the increase in PUTA's overall debt is due mainly to borrowings to finance pre-94 principal and
interest payments for Line 1. The situation has been aggravated, in part, by delays in completion of Line 2,
motorization and suburbanization trends, and the financial crisis. On the positive side, the government has.
improved the capital structure for Line 2, funding an increased share of capital costs, and reducing PUTA's
debt burden from the construction of Line 2. For Line 3, the local and central government are providing
100% financing. So far, under MOT ownership, PUTA has received financial support from the
government, as needed. As per law, the ownership of PUTA has to revert back to PCG in 2007. If this
transfer does take place, the sustainability of PUTA's operations will depend on growth in ridership and the
City's capacity to provide adequate financial support for PUTA.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component A. Congestion Management is rated Satisfactory, based on the following:
(i)  PCG has changed the city's parking policies to discourage parking and the use of private vehicles in
the CBD. City investment for new parking is now mainly directed for park-and-ride facilities for
metro passengers at suburban metro stations. In the CBD, parking supply has been reduced and
public parking charges have been increased to levels comparable with private parking fees.
(ii) Construction of modal integration facilities was completed in two subway stations - Nopodong and
Tongnae - to allow passengers to transfer more easily from one mode to another. These included
urban bus turn-arounds, and bus, taxi and car pick up facilities. New park-and-ride facilities were
constructed in Nopo (348 car spaces), and in Tongnae the parking lot was expanded, adding 273
parking spaces to reach a total of 419. The benefits from the transfer facilities at the Nopo-dong
station were linked to the re-location of the inter-city bus terminal from the CBD to Nopodong. The
inter-city bus terminal was completed in September 2001, and monthly ridership at this metro station
has already increased by about 20%. Ridership at this station is expected to continue to increase.
(iii) TSM measures to improve traffic performance on the East-West highway were linked to the Tongnae
inter-modal facility. A bus priority scheme on a 4.7 km link, along with junction and bus stop
improvements, on this highway has increased speeds from 14 kms per hour to over 20 krns per hour.
Moreover, operations of the Tongnae Road intersection have improved substantially.
(iv) Congestion management measures identified in the Five-year TDM/TSM Study under the project
have become part of the City governrnent's agenda. Implementation of the following, inter alia, is
under way: bus priority schemes on 17 road sections totaling 78.14 kms, installation of watching
cameras on bus-only lanes; and doubling of parking spaces in park-and ride facilities between 1995
and 2002.
Component 1B. Expansion of Pusan Urban Transit System is rated Satisfactory. The project has been
successful in expanding the service capacity of the metro. The largest share of the loan proceeds ($82.08
million) was used to purchase 336 railways cars (56 trains of 6 cars each) - 26 more than the 310 originally
planned. The increase in cars purchased was made possible by the devaluation of the Won while the
contract for cars was denominated in Wons. The overall increase in capacity is thus much higher than what
was planned at appraisal. According to the technical review for the ICR, the cars purchased meet or exceed
the contracted technical specifications, comply with the quality assurance and inspection requirements and
are presently being used on Line 2. The number of cars on service on Line I have also increased as PUTA
used its own funds to procure 60 cars for Line 1.
The total metro network has also expanded significantly since 1994. In 1994, the network consisted of one
line with a total length of 32.5 km and 34 stations. During the project implementation period, PUTA
expanded its capacity and coverage with the opening of Line 2. With the opening of line 3, scheduled for
2003, the network will have more than tripled in length to about 102 km, with 5 transfer stations, and a
total of more than 100 stations. The Bank loan did not finance any of the civil works for network
expansion, which cost an estimated 6,000 billion Won (or about USD 6 billion equivalent (See section 5.4
Costs and Financing and Annex 3b). Table 5 below shows the construction costs of the Busan subway.

Component C. Institutional Development was Satisfactory. The various studies under the project were
carried out as planned. The Bank reviewed the details of the MOT training program in the earlier
stages of implementation. The review indicated a well developed and functioning training
program which responds to national needs and is financed accordingly. This reduced the need for
Bank follow up and monitoring during supervision.
The Busan Urban Subway Financing Study, completed in September 1996, appears to have influenced the
correction of the capital structure for Lines 2 and 3. The government has committed to 100% grant
financing for line 3 construction costs, and has substantially increased its contribution to line 2 investments.
These are positive developments, however, the government still does not have an articulated debt
management strategy and it is not clear how the government plans to reduce existing debt service
obligations. PUTA continues to rely on central and local subsidies, along with short term debt, to meet its
current debt service requirements.
The Busan Transit Fare Structure Study, completed January 1997, focussed on developing a public
transport fare structure based on demand and cost conditions, rather than cost considerations alone. This
has provided the PCG a basis for adjusting tariff levels for the metro and bus transport to support increased
use of public transport. The City has taken on board reconmmendations to deepen bus-metro integration
through revenue sharing measures.
The Ministry of Transport and the Busan City Government financed and carried out training programs to
enhance staff experience in urban transport investment planning and programming at the national and local
levels through short- and long-term training courses, workshops, manuals and overseas training programs.
The government spent about $0.24 million on this component, much below the $1.92 mnillion estimated in
the SAR. No details with regard to the scope and subjects covered, nor the benefits or impact achieved
through these activities are available.
The provision of technical assistance to the Transportation Planning Division of Pusan City was-not
required as the city created, in 1995, the Busan Development Institute. This is a serni-autonomous body
which provides analytical support to the city government. The Transportation Planning Division, together
with the Busan Development Institute, has kept up the momentum on furthering developing TDMITSM
measures for congestion management.



4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The SAR presented the economic evaluation for investments under Component A - the Nopodong and
Tongnae modal integration facilities, and the East-West bus lane improvements. For Component B, the
investment in train cars, representing about 85% of total project costs, the Bank team reviewed the
economic evaluation completed by MOT. The two step system-wide analysis, followed by a detailed
analysis for each line and phase of construction, was found acceptable and a separate calculation was not
attempted. This analysis was also used as the basis for calculating the number of train cars required.
The justification for component A was based on user travel time savings and savings in vehicle operating
costs for subway-nders switching from private cars to the metro. The EIRRs for the modal interchange
facilities were 18% for Nopo and 19% for Tongnae. For the purpose of preparing this report, an economic
reevaluation of the modal integration facilities has been completed, following as closely as possible the
approach used during appraisal. The quantified benefits include mainly transfer-time savings for subway
riders using the improved entry /exit facilities, and reduced travel-times and travel costs for park-and-nde
users. The time savings for various users have been evaluated at unit rates estimated during appraisal. As
per capita regional incomes have increased over the last decade, the value of time is expected to have
increased; economic benefits are therefore likely to be higher than the returns reported here. It is expected
that the VOC savings used in the re-evaluation, based on appraisal estimates, understate such savings.
Vehicle operating costs are likely to have increased over the last decade due to higher average costs and
increased congestion. Higher than expected usage rates of the park and ride facilities are showing intemal
retums equal to or higher than the appraisal estimates, despite the conservative valuation of benefits. On
the cost side, the actual construction and operations and maintenance costs have been used in the
re-evaluation, and are lower than forecast in the SAR. The post-project EIRR's are 23 % for Nopo and
18.00% for Tongnae.
For the East-West bus lane, vehicle counts, modal shares and vehicle speeds are not available. Discussions
with bus drivers indicate improved speeds and continued occupancy rates. Since motorization rates in the
city have increased, the differential in bus speeds in the "with" and "without" scenarios is likely to be
higher. The resulting passenger time savings are thus expected to be higher than those cited in the SAR. It
is considered likely that the economic benefits of the investments in the East-West highway have been
realized. The project has also had a substantial demonstration effect in the introduction of TDM and TSM
measures in Busan. While these benefits are not quantified, it is expected that they would increase the
post-project EIRR.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
A financial rate of return was not calculated at appraisal and has not been calculated for this ICR. A
financial assessment of PUTA has been completed to evaluate the financial viability of the subway system
(See Annex 3b). Overall, PUTA's financial situation has deteriorated over 1994-2001. The
company has received constant cash injections from government to service debt and since 1998,
operating expenses. PUTA remains a high debt company (since 1997, total debt exceeds or is
equal to total assets), and about 75% of PUTA's debt has a maturity of 3 to 5 years. At the end
of 2001, it is estimated that PUTA's debt stood at W2,765 billion, in comparison to W1,394
billion at the end of 1993. About 80% of the outstanding debt is due to borrowing for
investments in Line 1. The capital structure for Lines 2 and 3 has, however, been corrected. 100%
of Line 3 investments are financed by the central and local governments and almost 80% of the
total capital financing for Line 2 is coming from government. Subway fares increases, exceeding
or in step with inflation, have been implemented over the project period.
- 12 -



To improve PUTA's financial viability, PUTA's debt overhang from Line 1 needs to be
addressed. Scenario analysis shows that PUTA would be able to balance its income statement
from 2008, if 50% of its debt is converted to equity and fares increase annually by 8%. Removal
of Line 1 related debt from PUTA's books would allow the income statement to be balanced
earlier.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
While it is not always easy to identify how the Bank has influenced individual decisions about reforn at the
PCG and PUTA level, the overall impact of the Bank's involvement and the project has been very positive.
There has been a significant shift within PUTA and PCG from isolated supply-oriented measures to a more
balanced supply and demand-oriented perspective; although the practice of developing mode-specific
isolated solutions has been changing slowly. Important initiatives have been taken to plan, design and
construct a multi-modal and comprehensive urban transport system, and to treat investments and modal
policies in a more integrated fashion.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
In 1997-98, Korea was affected by the Asian financial crisis accompanied by a rapid depreciation of its
currency. This event had a direct effect on income and employment levels for Busan, the patronage of the
metro and the actual financing of the project. The crisis contributed to lower than forecast ridership with
obvious consequences for operational cost recovery. In addition to tempering ridership growth
directly, the crisis appears to have impacted the completion of phase I, Line 2. This in turn
contributed to the lower than expected operational cost recovery. On the positive side, because the
contracts for purchase of metro cars were denominated in wons, the depreciation of the won against the US
dollar allowed more metro rail cars to be bought (See Section 5.4, Costs and Financing).

Trends in population growth and urban densities did not support ridership levels anticipated at appraisal.
A decline in the labor intensive shoe manufacturing sector and affiliated industries in 1995 led to an
unanticipated outflow of population (to Seoul or neighboring cities of Kimhae and Yangsan), while
immigration from rural and small towns to Busan petered out. Instead of increasing from 3.9 million to 4.5
- 13-



million over 1991-2001, as expected, the population of Busan actually decreased slightly to 3.8 million.
Though population levels remained more or less constant, population densities in the CBD have been
declining. The economically active population increased only about 2.5% from 1.61 million to 1.65 million
in a decade, and the overall number of daily trips increased about 11%, which is less than expected.
The growth of motorization has been much faster than in the past. Of the approximately 810,000 vehicles
in 2001, cars accounted for about 66 percent. The growth in household incomes (despite the financial
crisis) over the last decade, the growth of the Korean car industry, and a distortion of urban transport
prices in favor of cars has led to increased ownership and use of cars.
The financial crisis and the depreciation of the won affected Korea while procurement of the train cars was
under way. Since the contract for the cars was denominated in wons, and the component costs were cited
in US dollars, PUTA realized substantial dollar savings in this component. The savings were used to
purchase additional cars for the second phase of Line 2.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control.
The most serious issue regarding PUTA's financial sustainability is its overall debt service level. Though
the government had agreed on the need for a long term plan to manage PUTA's debt and the Busan Urban
Subway Financing Study was completed, the central government has not yet adopted a plan to address this
issue. Addressing PUTA's debt related to Line 1 is critical before the intended transfer of PUTA's
ownership from MOT to PCG in 2007. Further, despite low ridership levels on Lines 1 and 2, the
Pusan subway expansion plans are continuing to be implemented in line with the national transport vision.
This has the potential to worsen PUTA's operational cost recovery in the future. On the positive side, the
government is providing 100% grant flmding for construction of Line 3, has increased its grant contribution
for Line 2 capital costs, and has provided operational subsidies to PUTA as needed.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
PUTA continues to perform well compared with similar mass transit authorities in the region and world
wide. It has improved its management practices and technical knowledge of transport demand management
and transport systems management, which in turn has had a positive impact on the achievement of the
project objectives and outcomes. Due to the unavailability of long term debt instruments, and inadequate
government financial assistance for existing debt, PUTA has had little choice but to contract additional
short term debt for servicing current liabilities and to fund part of the capital costs of Line 2. This has
weakened PUTA's financial position.
The lack of adequate Bus-metro service and fare integration is one of the factors impeding growth in metro
ridership. Progress towards increasing complementarity between the bus and subway system has been slow
although some measures, such as the Hanaro card usable interchangeably on buses and the metro, have
been implemented. During supervision, Bank aide-memoires underlined the need to speed up work on
inter-modal integration in view of the low ridership numbers. The PCG is now developing revenue sharing
measures and has committed to implementing these.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The overall project costs decreased by about 45 % (in US$ terms) during implementation. The major
source of savings was the lower unit costs of train cars from the bidding process and a further decline due
to the depreciation of the Won. The contracted cost per unit car was about 70% of the estimated amount.
After the Won's depreciation, the actual costs per car (in US$) were only 43% of the SAR estimate; the
savings were used to increase the size of this component. 15% savings were realized in the construction of
the Nopo inter-modal facilities while the civil works at Tongnae were 38% higher due to an expansion in

Component A. Congestion Management.
The table below presents the sub-projects appraised, and includes investments identified in the 5-year
TDMITSM program study, and completed with loan proceeds and counterpart funds. Most of these
sub-projects were contracted and completed before 1997, and therefore were not affected by the financial
cnsis.

[I] Actual costs estimated using and average exchange rate of I US$ = 800 Won
The multi-modal integration facilities in Nopo and Tongnae were contracted and completed before 1997.
The total actual cost (US$11.7 million) of the civil works in Nopo were about 15% less than the SAR
estimate (US$13.8), while the total actual costs (US$14.5 million) of the works in Tongnae were 38% more
than the estimate (US$10.5). The latter increase in costs was due to an increase in the size of the parking
lot (273 spaces as compared to 175 spaces). About 32% of the total costs under these contracts were
financed with the loan proceeds, as originally envisaged.
Component B. Expansion of the Urban Transit System Capacity.
The contract to purchase the railway cars included a simulator, technical assistance, parts, tools, training
and VAT. Actual costs under this component changed significantly during implementation as the contract
for the train cars was signed in local currency and the won depreciated in 1997-98. The table below
provides relevant cost data.

obtain a total of US$240,000 financed by the implementing agencies, which is only about 13% of the
expected amount in the SAR (US$1,910,000).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The overall sustainability rating of "likely" applies to what the project was most successful in, which is to
have (i) expanded the capacity of the metro system, revised public parking policies, and introduced TDM
measures; (ii) successfully piloted mter-modal integration facilities at Nopo and Tongnae metro stations,
revised public parking policies, and introduced TDM measures; (iii) highlighted the need for and put
inter-modal planning firmly on the City's agenda, and (iv) framed PUTA's financial situation discussion in
terms of operational cost recovery and sustainability of its debt service.
Regarding the physical assets, it is certain that the new train cars and maintenance facilities have been
received by an organization with an established and excellent operations and maintenance culture. The
benefits of these investments, all things being equal, will continue over the life of these assets. PUTA has
been amongst the top two or three metros in the world in terms of its operational cost recovery; its
management is committed to containing costs and introducing measures to increase ridership. Extemal
factors and delays in completion of line 2 have had a large role in PUTA's failure to meet operational cost
recovery targets. Since 1997, however, the cost recovery ratio has increased every year. The City has
initiated bus-metro service and has developed an integrated ticketing system to encourage use of public
transport. The City is now reforming the fare system, to introduce differentiation by trip length, location
and time of day. Busan City has reached an agreement with Dongnam Bank for the financing of
infrastructure (computerized information base) needed for revenue sharing between diverse public transport
operators. Traffic demand management measures, such as "Voluntary Driving Restriction Day" and
- 16 -



conversion of company parking lots into commercial lots, have become part of the city's transport agenda
and are being continually expanded. All these efforts are highly likely to increase overall ridership levels,
specially when combined with an urban transport fares policy responsive to demand and cost conditions.
This bodes well for PUTA's operational sustainability.
The issue of PUTA's high and mushrooming debt service has been somewhat mitigated by increases in
government contributions to Line 2 investments but overall PUTA's debt has continued to grow. Though a
revised debt management plan is not available, the government has committed to providing hundred percent
financing for Line 3. The government has also subsidized PUTA's operations, as needed. As long as PUTA
remains under central government ownership, the government takes responsibility for its liabilities. Before
PUTA reverts to PCG, its former owner, PUTA's balance sheet would need to be re-structured either
through early retirement of its debt or through removal of debt from the balance sheet.
6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations
The project was implemented by a working metro authority and a City Government. Both organizations
are well in control of the various project components and no special transition arrangements are required.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending.
The Bank's performance in the preparation stage of the Project was Satisfactory The CAS and graduation
plan for Korea had identified the transport sector, in particular urban transport, as an area where the
Bank's expertise would be desirable, and the project was targeted accordingly. The design of the project
components was relatively straightforward, and well within the implementing capacity of the project
agencies. The Borrower's own experience in project development and past experience with Bank projects
meant little time was lost in moving from identification to appraisal and negotiations, all of which were
completed in 22 months. The Bank's appraisal was comprehensive. All aspects of individual components,
all of which were in an advanced stage of preparation, were addressed in detail. The inter-disciplinary
appraisal team was staffed with high level professionals, two urban transport specialists, a senior engineer,
a financial analyst, and an environmental specialist.
The strong commitment of the Government and the implementing agencies was correctly assessed,
including their commitment to institutional development, and allocation of resources and staff for
implementation. The Bank's safeguard policies were appropriately taken into account, including land
acquisition and resettlement, even though none of the proceeds of the loan were used to finance the civil
works for the construction of the subway lines. While the risks associated with the weak capital structure of
PUTA were correctly assessed, the appraisal team was perhaps optimistic as to what PUTA or PCG could
realistically do to address the structure of PUTA's debt. While PUTA was responsible for servicing its
debt and for preparing an annual debt management plan, the financial instruments available to PUTA for
long term borrowing and the level of Government subsidies available were areas where the Government had
de facto power.
Even though the size of the IBRD loan (US$ 100 million) accounted for less than about 7% of the estimated
construction costs for Phase I of Line 2 (about US$1,500 million), and less than 2% of the total estimated
construction costs of the entire subway system (Line 1, Line 2 and Line 3 US$6,000 million), the Borrower
highly appreciated the Bank's involvement and the project's contribution to the development of the public
transport system and introduction of TDM/TSM concepts to enhance the efficient use of public
transport and the road system in Busan.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank staff performance during supervision was Satisfactory. After graduation, in view of the Client's
capacity for implementation, the Bank reduced its supervision efforts to one mission a year. The
spacing of supervision missions, approximately once a year, over the project's life was adequate. The
missions were adequately focused and provided sound professional guidance to the government. The
continuity of the task manager from preparation through supervision, with just one change during
supervision, provided consistency for both the Bank and the Borrower. The Bank's supervision missions
reviewed the Borrower's progress reports in detail, held discussions with the implementing agencies, and
followed up appropriately in action letters. Mission reporting in project status reports was sufficiently
detailed and gave realistic performance ratings. Proposed adjustments to the components were extensively
reviewed and discussed with the proposing agencies and internally prior to providing no objections.
Institutional and financial issues did not receive uniform attention from missions, and could have benefited
from a closer review. The Project correspondence indicated that Bank staff were constructive, flexible and
responsive to Client requests.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall, the Bank performance during preparation and implementation was Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The performance of the Borrower during the preparation stage was Satisfactory. With governent support
and consultant assistance, the implementing agencies prepared the project within 22 months of
identification. Technical reports and proposals were of high professional quality. The implementing
agencies were committed to the project and allocated adequate staff and resources to project formulation
and preparation.
7.S Government implementation performance:
The satisfactory performance and involvement of the MOT during preparation continued during
implementation. Further, the government has decentralized fare setting powers to the local
governments, it has increased the city's share in PUTA's capital, and the transfer of PUTA's
ownership from MOT to PCG in 2007, remains on track. Apart from support for the agreed
investments and procedures, the MOT and subsequently PCG, supported the cost recovery covenant
through fare increases in line with (and some greater than) inflation. The MOT's commitment to cost
recovery was stronger than its commitment to addressing the capital structure of PUTA. While the central
government has provided full grant funding for the expansion of the metro system (construction of line 3)
and increased its grant contribution to line 2 capital costs, it has not adequately addressed the issue of
PUTA's long term debt obligations. A debt management plan to reduce PUTA's outstanding debt and
associated debt service obligations is not available, and PUTA's debt service requirements have continued
to increase.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of both implementing agencies, PUTA and PCG, was Satisfactory. Procurement
procedures and contracts were handled with great care by the agencies. Both agencies successfully
implemented and supervised their respective components, mostly within the agreed costs, performance
parameters and the two year extension time frame. The noncompliance with the cost recovery covenant
resulted from a slower growth in metro passengers attributable to the financial crisis, slower population
growth, increased suburbanization and motorization, as well as a delay in completion of Line 2.
Semi-annual progress reports, environmental reports and annual audit reports were submitted to the Bank
in the required time and were of high quality. The Borrower's contributions to the Implementation
- 18 -



Completion Report were submitted to the Bank on time as required.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, the Borrower's performance was Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The following lessons emerge from the implementation of this Urban Transport Management project.
Public Transport is essential to address congestion but not sufficient to control motorization. Both PT
capacity and access to PT are needed for optimal use of PT services. The project has been successful in
enhancing metro capacity and demonstrating the importance of integrated public transport services to
service usage. It has also effectively demonstrated the importance of demand management measures, such
as PT pricing and parking policies. However, availability of PT services is only one factor influencing
demand for automobiles. Income levels, car prices, and the relative costs of private vehicles use versus PT
use are some of the others. As long as total costs of car usage do not reflect their full social costs,
increasing the supply of PT alone is insufficient to deter growth in motorization levels.
Full operating cost recovery in metro systems is possible under the right conditions. The Pusan metro
is amongst the few metros worldwide which have the potential and are able to cover operating costs,
excluding depreciation of assets. For the most part, the difference in the level of cost recovery is
attributable to differences in revenues rather than costs. Both high fares and high levels of usage are
needed for operating cost coverage. Though fares were increased over the project period, it was the delays
in completion of both phases of Line 2, which led to under-achievement of the targeted 100% cost recovery
ratio (the target included asset depreciation and contributions to a replacement fund). Still, the Pusan
metro demonstrates that a well run metro system does not need its operational costs subsidized, provided
there is a high level of usage and the fares resonate with demand and cost conditions.
Building institutions is necessary for implementation of comprehensive transport management. Urban
transport integration and sustainability have significant institutional requirements. In the case of Pusan, the
Urban Transportation Planning Unit within the City Government, along with the Busan Development
Institute, established at the start of the project, have been responsible for coordinating the implementation
of the TDM/TSM measures both within and outside the project. At the same time PUTA was and continues
to be a very competent technical organization, and has been an important factor in the success of the
project. Without a good coordination between PCG and PUTA, it would have been difficult to pilot the
integrated transport management approach of the project.
Up-front initiatives taken by the Government contribute to successful project outcomes. The project
has shown that it is extremely useful to require that key reforms - at various decision-making levels - be
taken up-front as a clear demonstration of the Borrower's commitment. Examples of those are: (i) the rail
transit authority rationalized the subway fare policy to contribute to a self-sustaining operation; (ii) the city
government revised the public parking charges and investment policies to promote transit use while
inhibiting car use in congested areas; (iii) the Central government committed to decentralizing fare setting
powers to local governments, and (iv) the Korean Government put in place an effective and acceptable
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure and institutional framework to monitor all capital
projects, including urban transport infrastructure.
External factors are major determinants of project success or failure. We should never lose sight of
the fact that factors well beyond the scope of the project can be major determinants of the success or failure
- 19 -



of project implementation and final outcomes. The financial crisis of 1997-98 impacted the city's
population growth, income levels, and more directly subway finances and start of operations of Line 2
which were delayed. Despite extensive attention to PUTA's financial health during project preparation, and
PUTA's continued excellent operational performance, the financial targets specified in the project could not
be fully met.

Busan Metropolitan City Traffic Planning and Management Department
1. Introduction
The population of Busan was 1.36 million in 1963 when its status was raised to that of a metropolitan city
and it has showed continuous growth because of its rapid economic development - 3.16 million in the
1980's and 3.79 million in the 1990's. With the rapid population increase more systematic and effective
counterplans becarne necessary in order to provide its citizens with speedy and comfortable transportation
and to solve the traffic congestion problems. Therefore, the Busan Metropolitan City planned and
established a new traffic network system focusing on easy connections with neighboring cities and the
extension of trunk roads in 1972.
Busan has continuously tried to find ways to disperse the increased heavy traffic such as constructing the
frst city highway (completed on Oct. 7, 1980), subway line #1 (completed on June 23, 1994), and the
second city high way (completed on Dec. 28, 1994). However, Busan still had to face new problems such
as how to build a city traffic network that connected with the metropolitan traffic network, how to expand
the harbor support roads, how to increase the number of parking lots around some subway stations, and
how to easily transfer between bus and subway lines.
To solve these new problems Busan, due to its poor financial status in March 1995, obtained a loan for
US$100,000,000 from IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development). The Busan
Metropolitan City Goverrment budgeted US$17,500,000 for the purpose of establishing better transfer
facilities in order to induce its citizens to use the subway more frequently.
The balance of US$82,500,000 was to be distributed to the Busan Urban Transit Authority for the purpose
of purchasing subway trains.  Busan city completed the transfer facilities project with only
US$9,568,621.72 by parring down expenses.
2. Purpose
The purpose of The Busan City Traffic Management Project was to provide the citizens of Busan with a
more comfortable and pleasant city life which included establishing transfer centers to improve the
efficiency of subway line 1.
3. Expansion
- 20 -



The Busan Urban Transit Authority applied for a loan from IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development) to construct subway line #1 on March, 9, 1992. IBRD agreed to the loan only under the
condition that the Busan Urban Transit Authority would also plan a total inter-model system on May,
1992. An M.O.U. (Memorandum Of Understanding) between the Korean government and IBRD was made
on March, 3, 1995.

4. Performance
*   The project was composed of five sub projects to 1.) build parking lots and transfer facilities at
Nopo-dong and Dongnae subway stops, 2.) build TSM, 3.) build a Dongseo bus only lane, 4.) develop
a 5-year traffic congestion management plan, and 5.) move the intercity bus terminal in Nopo-dong.
The biggest of the sub projects, building the parking lots and transfer facilities, was constructed by
Daeseong Construction Co. Ltd., Heungguk Construction Co. Ltd., and Saerim Landscape Co. Ltd.
and the constructional materials were purchased from supplying administration.
*   No technical construction difficulties occurred due to the accumulated experience and know-how of the
three construction companies used to build the parking lots and transfer facilities.
*   There was no significant increase in the number of passengers per day using the Nopo-dong station
after building the transfer facility and parking lot.

5. The Bank's role
IBRD played a major role in the success of the project by financing the project and lending their expertise
in construction, technical and financial matters.
6. Project related organizations
a   Traffic Planning and Management Department
The departnent took a major role as a organizer by planning the city traffic management project, the
budget, and detecting deficiencies and correcting them.
a   Busan Metropolitan Police Agency
Provided full cooperation and assistance with Busan Metropolitan City regrading the traffic signal
systems and lane changing usage,
o   Supervising Organization
Provided supervision on construction and testing the system.
7. The Role of the Busan Metropolitan City
The Busan Metropolitan City did everything possible to ensure the success of the project by providing all
the necessary data required. They held numberous meeting with reluctant companies to iron out any and all
problems as the project was being implemented. They also helped developed the various traffic
management policies. As a result of their efforts successful results are being seen in every aspect of the
project.
8. The Valuation of the Result
The results since the project has been completed have been very satisfactory to date.
9. Future Management
o   Facilities and operation of the system.
o The efficiency in connecting between the subway system and the bus system will have to be
improved. Busan Facility Management Corporation, which is in charge of managing this, will have
- 28 -



to make a greater effort to improve upon this system.
o   The traffic flow has been improved in the city center as a result of moving the intercity bus
termninal. However, there is not a noticeable change in the number of passengers using the subway
system even after its removal. A greater effort to provide incentives to use the subway system such
as extending the hours of operation and reducing the fees for using the parking lots should be
considered.
o   Traffic congestion has to be minimized by determning the traffic flow in the city at all times and
by determining better usage of lanes.

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Part B.
Pusan Urban Transit Authority Implementation Closing Report IBRD Loan 3828-KO, April 2002
1. Preface
*   This loan   contract was  made   between  REPUBLIC    OF   KOREA     (the  Borrower)and
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT(the Bank) projects
to proceed clearly one of infrastructure building projects, "Pusan Urban Transport Management
Project" with the loan.
* The project is composed of PART (A), PART (B) and PART (C). Pusan City of Govermnent
performed PART (A) and PART (C), PUTA did PART (B).
*   PART(B) was consisted with two to improve the growing traffic congestion and tighten the Pusan
Urban Transit System Capacity.
The first thing is PUTA's responsibility for the subway expansion (procuring subway 336 railcars).
The second one is to appoint consultants to conduct the Pusan Transit Fare Structure Study and the
study for the identification of the alternative long-term subway financing.
*   PUTA received $82.5(mil.) to proceed the project all from IBRD Loan by subsidiary Loan Agreement
between Republic Of Korea and Pusan Urban Transit authority and finished the project. The project
was made from Feb. 1996 to Mar. 2002 for 6 years. PUTA now finishes it and hand out ICR to IBRD.
2. Project Purpose
*   Under PART (B), the project's overall purpose is to initiate a multi-modal urban transport management
strategy in Pusan. That is, by opening Line 2 (Hopo - Somyon) reaching East and West, connected
with Line 1 reaching North and South in Pusan to expand transport capacity and increase the
proportion of total trips served by subway.
*   In details, the first thing, is to receive IBRD Loan Funds for opening Line 2.
From the sensitivity analysis by IBRD, the result shows that PUTA can retain a healthy working ratio by
making relatively small changes in fares that are indexed to inflation and must receive additional cash from
the PCG or the Government. So, PUTA will implement the Transit Fare Structure Study and a study for
altemative long-term financing strategies.

with internal funds.
4. Project Objective/Achievement
(1) Objective
o   Given the geographical constraints the project objective is 1) to expand the roads, to release
traffic-congestion and enlarge the overall capacity of the transport system in subway.
In addition, by increasing Internal Sources (Ticket Sales and Operating Revenue), 2)to meet the
working costs and vehicle depreciation.
O   According to final report of Sunway Financing Study consultants Services, 3) to increase fares side by
side and expand subsidiary funds from the Government and PCG for overcoming the financial deficit
from 1996 - 2001.
(2) Achievement

total trips increased well compared to those of 1995's, original year of borrowing the Loan.
O   Intemal Sources will meet the vehicle depreciation after opening the total Phase 2 Line 2 on August.
2002 because of anticipating hikes of them.
O   PUTA receives Construction Cost from(the Government 50%, PCG 50%), prospects no additional
debt increases and 60/o- 70% of interest payment for operating cost from the Government every year
(At first, promised 100% subsidy, currently receiving 60%, due to the budget lackness, anticipating
subsidy increase)

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Annex 3.a
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
The following table provide the assumptions and results of economic evaluation for Component A
investments in the Nopodong and Tongnae inter-modal facilities: Table I for Nopodong improvements, and
Table 2 for investments in Tongnae. Table 3 shows the history of metro fare increases.
The EIRR for the East-West bus lane improvements has not been calculated for this report. However,
reported changes in vehicle speeds along this corridor are in line with appraisal estimates, and benefits in
terms of savings in travel time and vehicle operating costs are likely to have been achieved.

Annex 3.b
Part I FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF PUTA
Preface
1.     The financial analysis, similar to the SAR, will be focused on the consolidated financial conditions
of PUTA which constitutes over 85% of the total project cost. The methodology used in the ICR will also
be similar to that employed in the SAR. At present, PUTA has two operating subway lines (Lme I and
Line 2) and one line (Line 3) under construction. Line 1 (32.5 km) was completed in June 1994; Line 2-
the project line (phases I and II, 39.1km), was put into partial operation in June 1999 and completed in
September 2002; and Line 3 (29.5 km) which is under construction, is scheduled for partial operation in
December 2005 and completion in December 2007.
2.     The financial evaluation of the project is comprised of two parts. Part I is the overall financial
evaluation of PUTA and Part II is the calculation of the FIRR and NPV of Line 2 (the project line),
including sensitivity analysis, probabilistic risk analysis and scenarios analysis. The financial cost of the
project was calculated on the basis of the weighted average cost of the various sources of funds. The
weighted average financial cost of the capital is estimated to be 5.14% (72.8% from the Bank at 5.0% and
27.2% from domestic funds at 5.5%).
PART I: FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF PUTA
3.     PUTA was established in 1994. Invested by the Ministry of Construction and Transportation
(MOT), this state owned company was formed for the construction and operation of PUTA. The
evaluation will be focused on the consolidated financial statements of the company. The main revenue of
the company is the fare income and the fare is strictly regulated by the Pusan City Government (PCG).
4.     Based on the current practice, the major financial operation features of the company can be
summarized below:
(a)    A high debt company. MOT is the sole owner of the PUTA. The company needs a constant
extemal cash injection each year to full fill its cash shortages which results mamly from operating losses,
the capital investment and the financial obligations.
(b)    The Rule of the PCG: Starting 1998, the PCG and MOT share equally the capital investment of
the PUTA. The PCG does not own the PUTA but can decide the fare of the PUTA, as well as its key
personnel appointments and the development plan.
(c)    The Low Fare Policy: The PCG is adopting the low fare policy to the subway users. The current
operating revenues of PUTA is barely be able to cover its operating expenses.
(d)    The Debts Structure: Most of the PUTA's debts are inherited from the borrowings for the
construction of Line 1. And, it is estimated that three quarters (75%) of the total debts are either short or
medium terms (the maturities are 3-5 years). This borrowing structure generates the cash pressure on
PUTA's daily operations.

The fimancial Objective and the Fare
5.     The main purpose of the operating revenue is to meet the minimum financial requirements for
operation, instead of maximizing the financial rate of return on the capital investment. The actual basic
subway fare, during the project's implementation period (1994-2001), has increased from 350 Won to 600
Won (or average 8.0% pa). For the long-term fare growth forecast, it is assumed that the fare will grow by
6.0% pa.
Traffic
6.     The actual passenger traffic growth from 1994 - 1997, compared with the SAR' forecast, was in
the acceptable range. The variation of the actual traffic growth rate was less than 10% of the forecasted
figures made at the time of the appraisal. The Asia economic crisis in 1997-98, in which Korea was one of
countries that was hit the hardest in the region, caused the large decrease in traffic demand. In 1998, for
example, the total traffic was 203.3 million, which is similar to the 1993 data (203.7 million), backwards
by five years. The traffic then slowly grew back from 1998 to 2001, by about 7.1%. pa. The Crisis
caused a lower traffic growth rate from 1994-2001 (3.6% pa), compared with 14.2% pa forecasted in the
ICR. And the overall traffic volume in 2001 was only about half of the SAR's estimate.

7.     In terms of the long term traffic forecast, the annual growth rate for the completed lines (Line 1
and Line 2) is expected to be 2% pa. It is expected that the opening of the Line 3 in 2006 will add 30.66
million passengers in that year, 118.63 million in 2007, 160.32 million in 2008 and grow 2% pa thereafter.
In the SAR, construction of Line 3 was not taken into account for the traffic forecast. For comparison of
the traffic forecast between the ICR and the SAR, Line 3 traffic has been excluded. Without the Line 3
traffic, the revised traffic growth rate between 1994 - 2007 (the latest available year in the SAR) is
expected to be 4.1 % pa, compared with 9.4% pa assumed in the SAR. And, the revised traffic volume for
2002 - 2007 is about 50% less than the SAR's forecast. Summarized as follows:

10.     All major financial ratios (working ratio, operating ratio and rate of return on net fixed assets)
show a deteriorated situation which results mainly from the lower than the expected traffic volume and
operating revenues. From 1999 - 2001, for an example, the actual traffic and revenue of PUTA constituted
less than 60% of the SAR's estimates.

11.     Despite the lower traffic demand, the total operating loss of PUTA was in much better condition
than the SAR' forecast. Based on the actual data, the total net cash loss for 1999-2001 constituted only
13.7%, 36.0% and 28.3%, respectively, of the forecasted amount in the SAR. The main reasons were: (a)
the higher growth rate on the unit operating revenue, and (b) the lower unit operating expenses. This is
explained as follows:
-43 -



12.    Unit Operating Revenue: From 1994 to 2001, the actual unit operating revenue grew from 347
Won / passenger to 555 Won / passenger or 6.9% pa. This growth rate is faster than 4.0% pa forecasted in
the SAR. In 2001, the actual unit operating revenue was 23.9% higher than the SAR's forecast (554 Won
/ passenger vs. 447 Won / passenger).

13.    Unit Operating Expenses: The total operating expenses were much less than expected. In the
SAR, the unit operating expenses were assumed at very high starting figures, but maintained almost a
constant figure from 1994-2001. The actual growth rate for the unit operating expenses was 9.2%.
Despite the fast growth rate, the actual unit operating expenses are still lower than the SAR's forecast. In
2001, the actual unit operating expenses were 6.6% lower than the SAR's forecast.

14.    Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement 1 states that, starting December 31 1995, total annual
operating revenue of the PUTA should be equivalent to and not less than the total operating expenses. In
the actuality, except for 1998, the PUTA has not met this requirement during 1995-2001. The low fare
policy and the low traffic demand have not seriously affected the daily operations of the company because
of the large government subsidies that have been injected to the company every year. In 2001, for example,
the total amount of the government subsidies to the PUTA was Won 461.8 billion or 3.3 times the PUTA's
total annual operating revenue. The actual subsidy level largely exceeded the SAR's projection of Won
132.2 billion or 56% of total operating revenue for 2001. In the long-term, without changing the current
operating styles, PUTA can only survive if the large amount of the government subsidies continues to flow
to the company every year. (Table 2: Sources and Applications of Funds).
15.    Starting 1997, the total debt (long term plus current) of PUTA exceeded or was very close to its
total assets. Further, the ratio of current liabilities (the maturities of less than one year) to the total debt
has increased from 16.6% in 1995 to 30.4% in 2001. Although the equity was improved in 2001, it is
expected that it will tum negative in 2002 and maintain the negative status almost throughout the project's
life. The negative equity status makes the financial leverage of the company simply nonexistent, and it may
not be able to relieve it's severe solvency problems until 2008 (current ratio, the soundness of liquidity
which should be at least greater than 1.0). The detailed balance sheet is presented in Table 3 and
sununarized for 1999-2001 (actual) as follows:

Future Financial Performance
16.    To forecast the future financial condition, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared
(Tables 1, 2, and 3). The financial statements were prepared on the basis of the SAR's format and
incorporated with the current practice. The operating expenses of PUTA can be categorized as: working
cost (a. labor, b. material and supplies, c. power and d. others), and operating expenses (working cost +
depreciation). All other expenses, e.g., non operating income and expenses, interest payments and others,
are also included in the calculation of the profitability of PUTA. The major financial assumptions are in
Table 4. -
17.    Based on it's current practice, the PUTA would not be able to balance its income statement over
the life of the project. Due to the heavy government subsidies, PUTA will probably not have difficulty
managing its cash flow. However, the company will not have any financial leverage over the project's life
and will be constantly facing solvency problems until 2008 due to the poor profitability. In addition, the
future financial performnance of PUTA is determined by the improvement of the following three major
factors.
18.    Working Cost: Cutting working costs is one of the important steps to improve the profitability of
the operation. In 2001, for an example, total unit working costs (582 Won / passenger) exceeded the total
unit operation revenue (555 Won / passenger). This means, on average, that each passenger was receiving
27 Won of subsidy wlen they used the subway system (unit profits was estimated to be 145 Won /
passenger in the SAR). Adding depreciation, the estimated total subsidies for each passenger would be 269
Won / passenger (unit subsidies was estimated to be 63 Won / passenger in the SAR). Further analysis of
the total unit working costs shows that two thirds of the cost is for labor (386 Won / passenger). To reduce
the labor and to improv'e the operating efficiency, one example is to use the machines to replace the current
manual ticket sales in each subway station.
19.    Traffic: Currently the system transports about 250 million passengers a year. Considering the
city's 3.75 million residents, the average person only uses the system less than 6 times per month (or less
than three round trips per person per month). This number is not very high and the system has large excess
capacity to handle more passengers. Given the factors of (a) the quality railcar maintenance and the
- 45 -



services provided by the system, (b) the low fare policy, and (c) the upward trend of traffic demand over
the last three years after the Asia economic crisis in 1997-1998, the PUTA should have more leverages to
lure more passengers. One of the possible ways to increase the subway traffic would be to upgrade the
feeder line services. Assign more local bus routes to connect with the subway stations to encourage the
potential customers to use the system.
20.    Debt: Reduction of the financial burdens of the company would lead the PUTA to better business
practices and less financial dependency on the government. The current high debt status is not only niining
all the financial ratios but also draining off the cash reserves of the company. In the 2001 income
statement, the total interest payments alone was 102.8% of the total operating revenue. This means that the
total gross operating income of the company cannot meet the total interest payments in that year. The high
portion of the short-term debt (paras 4 and 15) has been causing difficulties for the company in carrying
out normal business decisions and the development plan. Debt reduction is one of the important factors to
improve the future financial condition of the PUTA.
PART H: THE FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR)
21.    The calculation of the FIRR is focused on Line 2 construction (the project) only, and not for the
entire PUTA. The low fare policy, as the government intended, produces a large financial impact on FIRR.
It is estimated that Line 2 operations will not be profitable until 2006. The FIRR of the project is expected
to be 0.7 percent. There are no FIRR and NPV calculations in the SAR. The results are summarized as
below:
PUTA: FMRR and Net Present Value
FIRR (in %)                               0.7
Net Present Value (Won billion, 5.14%)  -134.97
Sensitivity Analysis
22.    The sensitivity analysis tested different scenarios on the bases of the change of some major
parameters assumed in the analysis. The principal endogenous and exogenous parameters that could affect
the project financial results are: traffic growth rate, fare growth rate, total working costs and changes in
interest payments. The results show that: (a) changes in fare and working costs have the greatest impact
on the financial evaluation, (b) there is a moderate impact on changes in traffic growth rate, and (c) the
least impact is caused by changes in interest payments. The financial results summary by different
scenarios is shown as follows:

Probabilistic Risk Analysis (Financial Simulation)
24.    To determine the degree of uncertainty for the project, a probabilistic risk analysis using Monte
Carlo techniques was carried out. In a Monte Carlo analysis, each uncertainty factor is allowed to vary at
random between set limits and all uncertainty factors are allowed to change simultaneously. Monte Carlo
simulation provides probability distributions of the potential outcomes of decisions. By analyzing these
distributions, we can assess the risk associated with making various decisions (or probabilistic risk
analysis). The product of the analysis is a judgment on the possible range of the decision variable, and on
the likelihood of each value within this range.
25.    For the project, four uncertain factors that may affect the result of financial evaluation have been
identified: (a) traffic growth rate, (b) fare growth rate, (c) total working costs, and (d) interest payments.
The result of financial probabilistic analysis reveals that the most likely FIRR on the project would be 0.3
percent, while the worst and the best FIRR would be -1.8 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. The details
of the FIRR and NPV are in Table 5 and summarized as follows:

Scenarios Analysis (Financial Alternative)
26.    There are two special features of PUTA's accounting practice: (a) It is owned by MOT (the
central government) but 50% of the construction costs are grants from the PCG (the local government), and
(b) the PCG does not own PUTA, but can determine the fare. Three financial scenarios have been tested on
the basis of these two features:
27.    The first scenario is a complete decentralization of the PUTA from the central government (MOT)
to the local government (PCG). Without subsidies from MOT, a fare increase is inevitable. An 8% annual
fare increase (current assumption is 6% pa) would be able to shorten the number of losing years by half,
from the entire project life of 20 years (2002-2022) to the first ten years (2002-2012) and there would be
no cash shortage in 2002. The FIRR and NPV of the project would be expected to be 8.9% and Won
169.88 billion, respectively.
28.    The second scenario is to convert part of the debt, particularly for the short and medium term debt,
-47 -



to equity. This one time financial assistance can reduce financial obligations and help to restore financial
leverage of the company. If 50% of debt is converted into equity, the PUTA would be able to balance its
income statement in 2010. There would be no cash flow deficit over the entire project life. The solvency
problems and the financial leverage would be restored in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The FIRR and NPV
of the project would be expected at 0.9% and Won -124.79 billion, respectively.
29.    The third scenario is to combine the first and second scenarios by increasing the fare growth rate of
8% pa and converting 50% of debt into equity. The PUTA would be able to balance its income statement
in 2008 with no cash flow deficit for the entire project life, and the solvency problems along with the
financial leverage would be restored before 2008. The FIRR and NPV of the project would be expected at
9.2% and Won 180.06 billion, respectively.
30.    Comments: The first scenario (increasing the fare) meets the minimum financial requirement to
operate the system. For the long-term financial viability, the fare must be able to exceed or become close to
its working cost. The second scenario (reduce the debt) is to improve the financial borrowing structure of
the company. Reduction of the debt will restore the company's financial leverage and liquidation capacity.
The third scenario is the combination of the first and the second scenarios. It is the most desirable solution
because it will enhance the profitability as well as the financial strength of the company. The FIRR and
NPV of the project for the third scenario also show the best results for the company.
31.    Recommendations: The current total operating revenue cannot cover its total operating expenses.
The addition of heavy debt has put PUTA in a very difficult financial situation for its daily operations and
long term development. Decentralization of the company to the local government will end the subsidies
from the central government and motivate the PCG to adjust its low fare policy. For long term financial
viability, the fare should reflect or lean towards the real operating cost of the system. In addition,
converting 50% of the total debt into equity will fundamentally improve the financial structure of the
company. It is estimated that the total debt of the PUTA, at end of 2001, was Won 2,764.6 billion (or
about US$ 2,236.8 million). If the 50% debt reduction is shared equally between MOT and the PCG, it
would mean a one time payment of US$ 559.2 million from each party. This is a small price to pay
considering that the total subsidies (MOT and the PCG) to PUTA, in 2001 alone, was Won 461.8 billion
(or about US$ 373.62 million).
