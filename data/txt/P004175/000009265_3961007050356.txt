MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IERD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC Ol KOREA
FOR A PUSAN URBAN TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendatiorn
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$100.million
to help finance a Pusan Urban Transport Management, project.  The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years,
including five years of grace.  The proceeds of the loan will be onlent to the
Pusan City Government (PCG) and Pusan Urban Transit Authority (PUTA) on the same
terms as the Bank loan, including foreign exchange and interest risks, plus a
0.05 percent administrative charge.
2.        Backczround.   Over the past two decades,  Korea's rapid economic
development has increased traffic congestion and its accompanying economic costs
and environmental degradation. To improve mobility, the Government constructed
urban rail transit systems in Seoul and Pusan during the past decade and highway
networks in cities of over one million during the same period.  In Pusan, the
country's second largest city (of about four million), PUTA, a Ministry of
Transportation (MOT) agency, currently operates a 32.5 km subway system (Line 1)
as the North-South spine of the city wide transit system. The East-West line,
Line 2 of 39.1 km length, is being constructed in two phases: the first phase
(22.4 km) is underway and scheduled for completion at the end of 1997. Severai
expressways have also been built. However, the city's rapid population and
economic growth (which has increased travel demand), has even outstripped the
capacity of the new infrastructure (as in other Korean cities, as well).  For
example, in Pusan, vehicle registration rose by 390 percent from 1980-91 and the
city became one of the largest container ports in the world--which generated a
great deal of truck traffic. The problem is all the more intractable because of
the city's layout: at present, only two   mnnels and one road connect the central
business district (CBD) to the area to the went, where much of the growth has
occurred and much more is expected. To the east, where growth has soared, land
use is so dense and roadways so limited-that traffic engineering measures can
have only limited effect. Thus, the geographic constraints (steep mountains,
rivers and the sea) and density have intensified the congestion along well-
defined corridors.
3.         The city's bus and subway systems work well, but, for the most part,
separately. PUTA carries about S80,000 riders each day. Since it opened, PUTA
has annually recovered its overall operating expenses and in 1994, replaced
rolling stock from its internal resources--a feat rarely accomplished by other
urban rail transit systems.   The bus system, run by private bus operators,
continues to be the dominant transit mode, and handles 3.3 million trips each
day; but its effectiveness is being gradually eroded due to deteriorating traffic
conditions. Authorities are expanding the highways and subway, however, as there
are limits to this effort, the city needs comprehensive policies that include
travel demand management (TDM) and transportation systems management (TSM)
strategies. Under TDM strategies, a variety of incentives and disincentives can
be promoted to reduce vehicular travel and enhance the use of high occupancy
vehicles (bus, subway and carpooling) such as, changing the pricing policies for



road, transit and parking, bus priority schemes, carpooling programs and parking
management.   TSM actions can aim at optimizing the performance of existing
transport infrastructure through low cost measures, including traffic engineering
and management measures along selected corridors or within defined areas.
Equally critical, the various transit modes need to be integrated into a
comprehensive system, which will involve integrating the bus and rail fares,
simplifying passenger transfers -between subway and station access modes,
providing park-and-ride opportunities in suburbs, and restructuring bus service.
4.        Project- Objectives.  The obJectives of this project are: (a) to
increase ridership and cost recovery of the subway network even further, by
introducing TDM, constructing inter-modal facilities, and expanding the tranoit
system; (b) to enhance the capacity of Pusan's subway to accommodate future
growth and serve as an alternative to auto use; and (c) to strengthen the
capacity of existing institutions to plan and program urban transport
investments.
5.        Project DescriDtion.  The proposed project, to be implemented from
1995-99, will include the following:
a.  ComDonent A - Conoestion Management:   (US$52.9 million, 14.5
percent of project cost)  The project will introduce a system for managing
congestion and set the stage for developing a comprehensive program for Pusan.
Policies and measures will include TDM and TSM programs which will be
complemented by the rationalization of bus and subway fares.
TD:   Parking MXnagement.  The first TDM measure will involve
changing the parking policy. On October 24, 1994, the PCG revised its parking
charges and supply policies which now aim to discourage parking and begin to
manage the use of private vehicles in Pusan's most congested areas; at the same
time, the changes would encourage the use of public transport, notably the
subway, for trips to/from the CBD. With regard to parking supply, the PCG will
mainly channel investments for parking structures to the outskirts, in park-and-
ride facilities linked to the subway. With regard to charges for publicly-
supplied parking (13,000 car spaces), rates have been increased, and in congested
central areas they reach the level of those in the private sector which should
help restrict vehicle use. Approximately 3,000 spaces will be involved in the
congested central areas, which represent 23 percent of the total public supply.
The rates vary by the location, congestion level and duration: for example,
hourly and daily charges have been increased from US$1.60 and US$7.50 to US$3.20
and US$12.50, respectively. As the implementation of these measures did not
require significant financing, no project funds were necessary and the
implementation was undertaken before the project negotiations.
TDoM Modal-Integration Facilities. Another aspect of TDM will be
constructing modal integration facilities, which will account for US$27.9
million, or 7.7 percent of total project costs. To improve subway utilization,
facilities will be built to allow passengers to transfer more easily from one
mode to another (including the subway, buses, taxis, cars and bicycles); also,
it will expand existing park-and-ride facilities at selected subway stations
along Line I (see map). Moreover, park-and-ride facilities would demonstrate the
merit of measures that restrict parking to subway users only.



--3-
TSM% Bust-Wost Bus Lane.   Along with TDM strategies, a bus
priority scheme on a key east-west corridor of 4.7 kms would be implemented
between the Mandok-ro (a critical bottleneck in the west), and the east side of
the city; the cost would be US$2.2 million, or 0.6 percent of project costs.  The
proposed scheme of peak-period, with-flow bus lanes will be linked with the
proposed Tongnae inter-modal facility, which should improve bus access to the
subway station.
S-Y*ar TDI/T8 -Program. In addition -to parking policies,  a-
comprehensive TDM will require a-range of measures affecting vehicle use (such
as user charges, congestion pricing, incentives for transit use,' carpooling and
staggered work hours).  A 5-Year TDM and TSM Program Stuy will be undertaken,
and from the study's recommendations, a set of investments and policies will be
implemented during the project period. For this purpose, US$22.8 million, or 6.2
percent of project costs, has been allocated. The aim is to enhance and su-'-ain
TDM/TS4 measures in Pusan.
b.  ComTonerit B - Expansion of Pusan Urban Transit System Capacity
(US$309 million, 85 percent of project costs):  At present, Line l is seriously
overcrowded during peak periods (an average of -230 passengers/car travel in rail
cars designed for 125 passengers). Moreover, daily ridership is expected to
increase from 0.58 million (1994) to 1.2 million in 1999 and 1.6 million in 2001,
once Phase 1 and 2 of Line 2 are completed. The increase in demand will require
about 310 more rail cars by 1999. Part of this rolling stock will be financed
under the project (US$82 million).
C.  Comnonent C - Institutional Develonment (US $1.8 million, 0.5
percent of project costs): This will enhance staff expertise in urban transport
investment planning/programming at the national and local levels through short-
and long-term training courses, workshops, manuals and overseas training
programs. MOT will finance the educational program. The project will also
finance studies for US$1.5 million, or 0.4 percent of project costs. The Pusan
Transit Fare Structure Study will establish an analytical base for setting
market-oriented fares and for integrating bus and subway fares; the 5-Year TDM.
and TSf Program Study will develop a list of TDM/TSM incentives and policies that
will be implemented between 1996 and 2001. In addition, a study will identify
alternative long-term financing strategies for undertaking subway projects in
Pusan.   To advise and assist PCG, a TA program consisting of one or two
professionals will also be financed.
6.        Protect Imolementation. All civil and traffic engineering works under
Component A, the 5-Year TDY and TSM Program Study, and the TA under Component C
will be implemented by PCG and supervised by its construction bureaus. Component
B, the alternative long-term subway financing study, and the Pusan Transit Fare
Structure Study will be PUTA's responsibility.   A coordinating committee
comprised of representatives from PUTA, PCG, the taxi association, bus operators
and the Chamber of Commerce, will oversee the- transit fare structure study. MOT
will implement the institutional development component that covers training. The
project implementing agencies, PUTA, PCG and MOT, have the experience and
capacity for implementing the assigned tasks.
7.-         The Bank loan of US$100 million, representing about 27 percent of the
total project costs, US$365.4 million, will be made to the government to finance



-4-
the foreign exchange cost of all project components excluding studies. The loan
will be onlent in amounts of about US$17.5 iillion and US$82.5 million to the PCG
and PUTA, respectively, on the same terms as the Bank loan, including foreign
exchange and interest risks, plus a 0.05 percent administrative charge. (see
Schedule A).  Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
process4ng events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are presented
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the project area is attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13332-KO, dated November 15, 1994 is being
distr.4buted separately.
8.        Prolect Sustainability.  The proposed project is a prototype of how
to improve -an urban rail transit system through the process of demand management
and modal integration, along with some key policy reforms. As this project would
be one of the last prior to Korea's graduation from the Bank in 1995, the aim has
been to attain reforms up front, before implementation. Recent initiatives to
decentralize transit and taxi fares, improve PUTA's cost recovery by following
a sound pricing policy, reduce distortionE in public parking charges and address
the subway financing and PUTA's debt would significantly contribute3 to
sustaining the project's institutional and financial efforts. Also, authorities
are increasingly turning to demand management actions (along with capital
construction): for example, during project preparation, Pusan introduced its
first bus priority scheme, built several park-and-ride facilities, and finalized
the plan to increase public parking charges (in order to inhibit car use in
congested areas). The trend to increase political empowerment at the city level
(for example, mayors will be elected in 1995, instead of appointedl will
reinforce municipal governments' capacity to respond to local needs and help
sustain the project objectives.
9.        Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Out of eight loans in support
of urban development since 1979, four prrJects addressed tranrport issues.
Projects in Seoul and Taegu pioneered (in Korea) transport system management
(TSM) strategies. The Pusan Urban Management Project (Loan 2801-K0) made the
first attempt to improve the city's urban management and capital planning/
programming capacities. These projects fully met the objectives but demonstrated
that technology transfer in the area of civil works was easier than in management
and  institution  building.    Environmental  constraints,  particularly  land
acquisition, was found to be a major cause of delay and escalating costs.
10.       The above lessons influenced the design of the proposed project,
particularly in the area of institutional reform. During project preparation,
the Government initiated several reforms that included: (a) creating a multi-
modal special account for transportation that was based mainly on increased
gasoline and diesel taxes; (b) decentralizing bus and taxi fare-setting power to
provincial governments; (c) producing a five-year urban transport action plan
with a strong commitment toward managing demand and expanding transit capacity;
(d) drafting a national law on private sector participation in constructing
infrastructure; and (e) decentralizing the traffic impact fee policy, whereby
cities may levy charges on large, new developments and favor those that adopt
demand management strategies (such as carpools, employer-provided transit and
staggered work hours).  In addition, MOT introduced two key project-specific
initiatives this year (1994), based on he agreement reached in 1993: -first, it
increased PTTA's fares about 35 percent in January 1994; thus, its operations
continue to be self-sustaining. Also, in 1994, it introduced a debt management



plan for PUTA.  Moreover, Bank assistance in liberalizing financial markets has
begun to create opportunities for market-based financing in the sector.  To
address  environmental  concerns,  the  Government  created  an  acceptable-
environmental impact assessment  (hIA) process that is a prerequisite for
implementing any capital project. The present project builds on .he initiatives
of the agencies involved and offers further impetus to the on-going reforms in
urban transport.
11.       Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  Although large Korean cities are
already constructing subway and road facilities to meet the rapidly growing need
for transport services, they must now realize the full potential of these
investments by following a comprehensive multi-modal strategy.  The proposed
project is a prototype of how to make an urban rail transit system -more effective
through demand management measures and modal integration along with key policy
reforms in parking and transit pricing. Bank involvement in the project is
largely justified by the positive impact it would have on current Government
initiatives designed to address the rapidly deteriorating urban transport and
environmental conditions. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy, presented to the Board on December 23, 1993. As it is one of the last
projects prior to Korea's graduation, the aim is to send the right signals for
the future in the urban transport sector.
12.       Aareed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached that:
(a) PCG will undertake a 5-Year TDM and TSM Program Study from which a
comprehensive policy and actior plan will be developed for implementation during
the project period; (b) PUTA's fare structure and operating expenses will be
adjusted as needed. to ensure that total revenues from operations exceed the sum
of working or direct expenses and depreciation o' all equipment and rolling
stock, as well as provide a reserve with which to replace equipment and rolling
stock; (c) , PA, under the supervision of MOT and in consultation with the
Economic Planning Board (EPB), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will complete
a study before March 31, 1996 to identify alternative long-term financing
strategies for subway construction; (d) PUTA will exchange views with the Bank
on its proposed debt-management plan, investment plan and budget each year before
finalizing such plans and budget; (e) PCG will form a coordinating committee
comprising (at the least) representatives of bus operators, taxi operators, PUTA
and the Chamber of Commerce, to oversee the proposed Pusan Trans.it Fare Structure
Study; (f) the Government will submit to the Bank subsidiary loan agreements
between the Government, PUTA and PCG that will be concluded on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank as a condition for loan effectiveness; and
(g) PCG will appoint transport professionals to assist the city in the traffic
and transport sector.
13.       Environmental AsDects. With the focus on institutional reform as well
as on low-cost measures to manage congestion and expand transit capacity, the
project's overall impact on the urban environment will be positive. With this
view, the project has been classified as "B. n The on-going construction of Phase
1/Line 2 is in compliance with the Basic Environmental Policy Law of Korea, which
has been found satisfactory. And, although project funds are not being used for
construction on the first phase of Line 2, the ZIA was reviewed 'and found
acceptable.   Moreover, the Bank will monitor the environmental management
results/reports which are required by MOE for the operation of Line 1 and the
construction of Phase 1/Line 2 each year. Similarly, the land acquisition and
resettlement procedure followed for the above subway line was accomplished by



PUTA and in accordance with Korean laws, which were found to be acceptable by the
Bank.
14.       Prooram ObJective Cateaories.  This project does not directly address
poverty alleviation, but it does contribute to enhancing urban environmental
quality, as well as transport efficiency and wobility for- Pusan residents,
particularly for those without vehicles.
15.       Particinatorv Agtroach.  Besides the main sectoral agencies at the
central and local government levels-(BP3, NOT,--PCG and PUTA), input was sought
from the bus operators' association, traffic police and the regional office of
the Ministry of Environment (MOR) in Pusan during project preparation. Also, the
--city initiated -a- participation process to seek input from the general -public and-
local organizations on the plan to revise city parking charges.   For the
Phase 1/Line 2 construction, both the EIA and the related land acquisition/
resettlement activities complied with the Korean laws that require an elaborate
public participation process.
16.       Project Benefits.  The main benefits of the increased subway capacity
are expected to be reduced journey times and greater comfort. The TDM parking-
-ontrol measures should promote high occupancy modes (bus and subway) and begin
to inhibit car use in critical areas. The inter-modal facilities will reduce
transfer times (bus/taxi/subway) and overall travel times for park-and-ride
users. The demonstration TSM measures (east-west bus lanes) should save time for
bus users and some operating costs for bus operators. Institutional measures and
policy actions would induce a wide range of benefits including: (a) rationalized
fares and locally responsive transit fare setting; (b) improved financial
management of PUTA; (c) introduction of an integrated multi-modal approach to
transport; and (d) enhancement in planning/programming capabilities of central
and local governments. Tie project will serve as a valuable first step in
demonstrating to other Korean cities now considering or constructing subway
systems that modal integration and demand management are critical, as well as
feasible. The overall economic rate of return of the project is 26 percent.
17.       Risks. The primary risks are the delays and political reluctance to
implement the agreed upon actions pertaining to PUTA's tariffs and debt
management. The record of operations, ridership and working ratios (revenues to
direct expense ratios) places PUTA among the top performing urban subway systems,
and it has great potential to maintain a self-sustaining and healthy operation.
The debt management issue will remain a risk, but is less likely to affect
operations because PUTA's financial obligations are serviced by the Government.
However, any failure to manage short-term borrowing will produce a cycle of debt
from which it would be difficult for PUTA to recover, and thus jeopardize the
plan to transfer PUTA to the city by 2008. The NOT and the EPB acknowledge the
implication of current policies on the overall subway expansion plan, and have
shown their commitment to reduce PUTA's debt. Implementation of the 1993 debt
management plan, which included an almost 35 percent increase in fares and
payment of principal and interest, attests to the Government's commitment to
dealing with this issue. Recognizing the multi-sectoral dimension of the problem
(such as capital market limitations) and the time required to implement a lasting
solution, PUTA, under the supervision of NOT, and in consultation with the BPS
and MOP, will undertake a study to identify alternative long-term financing
strategies for subway construction. The findings of this study will form the
basis for a continuous dialogue between the Bank and MOT/PUTA on the preparation
of annual investment and debt management plans for PUTA. Moreover, the project



will monitor the progress and promote reforms for financing urban rail systems.
The success of the proposed East-West bus lanes will depend on the enforcement
of traffic rules along the corridor, particularly the restriction on the use of
bus lanes by vehicles other than buses.   To minimize the risk of poor
enforcement, the traffic police department of Pusan was consulted throughout the -
design phase of the scheme. The Bank will continue to monitor this issue during
the projecc period.
-1I8.    'Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the-Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend-that the-executive
Directors approve it.          '
