May 1992 with the participation of Swiss Development Cooperation, FAC, IFAD and IRAM
(consultants). The mission consisted of Messrs A. Haji (IDA), L. L'Aot (CCCE), R. Brugger (Swiss
Development Cooperation), Y. Yard (FAC), C. Guillemain (IFAD Consultant) and Y. Fournier (IRAM).
The IDA appraisal mission led by Mr. A. Haji took place in June/July 1992. Messrs S. Thillairajah and
A. Ryba were peer reviewers for this project. Messrs. T. Nkodo and 0. Lafourcade are Agriculture
Division Chief and Department Director respectively.

REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVE REHABILITATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Benin
Beneficiaries:      The  (mutualist) Network  of Rural Savings  and  Loan  Cooperatives
(CLCAMs/CRCAMs)
Amount:             SDR 2.8 million (US$ 3.8 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA, with 40 years maturity
Relendina Terms:    Grant
Co-financiers:      CFD, FAC, The Government of Switzerland, EEC, and IFAD
Proiect Descritmion:   The project's central objective is to continue the rehabilitation  and
strengthening of the network of rural savings and loan cooperatives initiated
under the First Rural Savings and Loan (S&L) Rehabilitation Project (IDA Credit
2086-Ben). The project would support the development of a privately-owned
financial intermediation system in rural areas, organized along mutualist lines.
Globally, it is expected that the Network would reach full financial viability and
autonomy only in the longer term (10 to 15 years). The specific objectives of
the project would be to assist the Network in establishing an efficient
institutional structure and making substantial progress toward financial viability.
It is expected that, by the end of the project, all primary level cooperatives
(CLCAMs) would not only break even financially, but also finance up to 30%
of the Network's regional and national levels, in charge of providing policy
guidance, assistance and supervision to CLCAMs. The project would support:
{i) the establishment of efficient service units at regional level (URCLCAMs) to
provide CLCAMs with the necessary technical backstopping (accounting and
financial management) and training; (ii) the establishment of a National
Federation of S&L Cooperatives to be the Network's policy-making and
supervisory body; (iii} technical assistance, equipment, training and annual
audits; and (iv) funding for completing the financial restructuring of CLCAMs
and providing limited financial assistance to a few CLCAMs operating in the
poorest areas of the country and having a potential to reach a deposit base
necessary to break-even financially.

Proiect Benefits:    The project would build upon the achievements of the First Project to further
develop the S&L Cooperative Network into an efficient financial intermediation
system in rural areas, where other formal financial intermediaries are not
operating and are not expected to operate in the short to medium term. It
would provide safekeeping services and credit for productive and social
purposes to its members, and help mobilize rural savings for recycling in the
entire economy. The project would therefore have a beneficial impact on
incomes and standards of living in rural areas and on the general economic
development of the country.
Proiect Risks:       The risk of external interference in the S&L Network's operations has been
reduced by Government's acceptance to limit its role to that of the overall
monitoring of the project through the project's Concertation Committee, and
the Network's decision to impose strict limits on the channeling by CLCAMs
of external lines of credit. The two major risks of the project are (i) a less than
satisfactory internal management of the Network, and (ii) a slower than
anticipated growth in mobilized savings which would jeopardize its financial
viability. The Network's management efficiency would be ensured by the
adoption of clear policy and operational guidelines which would be spelt out in
a 'Statement of Operational Policies" paper which would be closely and
effectively supervised by the Federation's Board and Technical Secretariat.
Growth in deposits depends on income growth in rural areas and in
populations' confidence in the Network.   The financial restructuring
successfully carried out under the First Project and the self-imposed financial
discipline adopted by CLCAMs have restored the Network's credibility with
rural populations. Recent experience shows that the Network has been able
to mobilize rapidly increasing deposits, even in a context of very depressed
international prices for the country's cash crops. Growth and stability of the
Network's deposits would also be improved by efforts at mobilizing deposits
from non-farming rural operators.






REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVE REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01         The rural savings and loan cooperative movement in Benin consists of a network of
50 Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole Mutuel (CLCAMs, Local Savings and Loan Cooperatives) which
are affiliated to 6 Caisses R1gionales de Credit Agricole Mutuel ICRCAMs, Regional Savings and Loan
Cooperatives) located in the main center of each of the six administrative regions of the country. The
CLCAMs/CRCAMs were established in mid-1970s by the now-defunct Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA), a public development bank which controlled the Network's operating policies and
procedures. This linkage with CNCA was largely responsible for the deterioration of the Network's
management and financial situation. Following the liquidation of CNCA in 1987, and in the context
of the restructuring of the country's financial sector, the Government requested IDA's assistance for
the rehabilitation of the rural savings and loan cooperatives. The First Rural Savings and Loan
Cooperative Rehabilitation Project was identified in late 1988 and appraised in June 1989. An IDA
Credit (Credit 2086-Ben) of SDR 2.0 million was approved by the Board in January 1990. The project
was co-financed by CCCE, FAC, EEC and the Governments of Switzerland and Germany, who jointly
provided an additional US$ 7.1 million equivalent towards the project.
1.02         Performance under the First Project has been excellent. Significant progress has been
achieved in restoring the Network's management efficiency and financial situation, and, as a result,
the confidence of local populations in the movement. Although the Closing Date of the IDA credit is
December 1995, funds are now expected to be fully utilized by the end of 1993. The Government
thus approached the project's main co-financiers (CCCE, the Swiss Government and IDA) for a
continuation of their support of the rehabilitation process. A feasibility study (financed jointly by CCCE
and IDA) was undertaken in March 1992. Ajoint mission IDA (pre-appraisal) and CCCE (appraisal) was
carried out in May 1992 with the participation of IFAD, FAC and the Swiss Development Cooperation
(SDC). IDA appraisal mission took place in June 1992.
II. BACKGROUND
A.    Economic Situation and Performance
2.01         Benin has an area of 113,000 km2 and a population of 5.4 million increasing at about
3.2% p.a. (1992). About 70% of the total population lives in rural areas. The annual per capita
income is about US$400 (1991). The primary sector accounts for about 40% of GDP, more than 70%
of export receipts and 75% of employment. The small formal industry sector (19% of GDP) consists
essentially of public enterprises often running at a loss, and in the process of being restructured. The
tertiary sector essentially includes a large and vigorous informal sector. Benin's geographical location
and the deep-water port of Cotonou, together with its relatively good road and rail network, allows the
country to provide substantial transit services to the land-locked countries to its North.
2.02         Between 1983 and 1987 Benin's economy grew slowly, partly because of a general
decline in international trade and the resulting collapse of the regional transit traffic - but mainly
because of the inefficiency and poor management of the productive sectors dominated by the State.



In 1 989, the Government introduced an economic reform program prepared with the assistance of the
Bank and the IMF. This program reflected a fundamental change in Benin's economic policy, centered
on the reduction of the State's role in the economy and the promotion of private sector activities, a
balanced management of public funds, measures to improve the balance of payments situation and
greater concern for the country's natural environment. The strategy for the development of the rural
sector adopted by the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) in 1990 is in line with these objectives
and supported by IDA.
B.    The Aariculture Sector
2.03         Production and Farmina Systems. Benin is largely self-sufficient in food and produces
cash crops such as cotton and palm oil which are the main providers of foreign exchange. About 72%
of the Agricultural GDP comes from crops, 22% from livestock, and 3% each from fishing and forestry
products. The average annual rate of growth of agricultural production in the 1980-1988 period was
4.2%. This good performance was however achieved largely through an expansion of the cropped
area and extensive cultivation techniques. There is much diversity in farm size, labor availability,
ownership of agricultural equipment, productivity and revenues. Despite Government policy of setting
up state farms in the latter part of 1970s, most of the rural output (over 95%) has always been
produced by individual small farm units.
2.04         Food production is relatively diversified and a large proportion of this production is
traded with neighboring countries, especially Nigeria. Maize is predominant in the Southern region and
the most widely-planted crop overall (about 450,000 ha), followed by sorghum in the North (130,000
ha), cassava (115,000 ha), yams (90,000 ha), beans (85,000 ha) and peanuts (100,000 ha). Food
crops are mostly grown in association, and yields are low.  Rice production is marginal.  Its
consumption is however steadily increasing and demand is being met by imports.
2.05         Cotton cultivation expanded rapidly in recent years and covered about 159,000 ha in
1991-92, for a total production of about 177,000 tons of seed cotton and 73,500 tons of fiber. Yields
are satisfactory (1,200 kg of seed cotton/ha) and planted areas are increasing. Cotton constitutes a
well-organized subsector, offering a secure outlet for farm production, guaranteeing a floor price to
producers as well as a reliable supply of inputs and credit. Palm oil production is declining as a result
of the aging of plantations, a water deficit that limits yields, and a lack of competitiveness in an
international market dominated by production from Asia.
2.06         Livestock, with about 1 million cattle, 2 million small ruminants and half a million hogs,
represents one fifth of agricultural production (8% of GDP). Total meat production is about 30,000
tons per year, along with some 43 million liters of milk, and about 200 million eggs. Animal traction
has expanded rapidly, particularly in the cotton production zones where it has contributed to the
growth of cultivated areas. The potential for animal production in northern Benin is high in terms of
the availability of pastures, but limited by poor management of surface water and archaic production
systems. Benin's fishing activities, with a production of about 40,000 tons per year, provide some
50%  of the country's animal protein requirements.  Lagoon catch accounts for two thirds of
production. Production is however declining as a result of problems of lagoon salinity, siltation
resulting from the deforestation of watersheds, and over-exploitation.
2.07         Agricultural Institutions. The Ministry of Rural Development (MDR) has the overall
responsibility for the development of agriculture, livestock, fisheries and  forestry as well as
agricultural research. Under the overall supervision of MDR, the implementation of agricultural
development policies and programs is the responsibility of the Regional Action and Rural Development
Centers (CARDERs) in each of the country's six administrative regions. Over the years, the CARDERs
have expanded their activities to a number of commercial operations, which diverted them from their



-3-
principal mission of providing support and technical assistance to producers. This expansion has often
been supported by foreign donors, including IDA, within the context of externally financed rural
development projects.
2.08          The National Agricultural Production Agency (SONAPRA) is responsible for input
distribution, cotton processing and export crop marketing.  It supplies agricultural inputs (mainly
fertilizer, insecticides and spraying equipment) on credit to farmers and farmer groups through the
CARDERs. Funds for the purchase of inputs either come from foreign financed projects or have been
borrowed from local banks. The recovery of these credits (through CARDERs) has been excellent
(about 98%). Over the past three seasons, SONAPRA has built a large enough revolving fund to be
able to pay for its inputs without any additional external financing or bank credit.
2.09          Significant reforms of the sector's institutional structure are underway under the
Agricultural Services Restructuring Project (Credit 2285-BEN) with the assistance of IDA and other
donors. The main objective of the reform is to strengthen MDR's capacities for policy making, planning
and monitoring, and focus CARDERs' efforts at efficiently providing essential agricultural services that
cannot be provided by the private/cooperative sector (extension, adaptive research, rural works,
statistics). Specific operations will promote the integration of public and private sector activities,
strengthen rural producer organizations and promote the full participation of local communities in the
development of their region.
C.    The Bankina Sector and Financial Intermediation
2.10          Bankinq Sector. Under the Bank and IMF-supported structural adjustment program,
considerable progress has been achieved in restructuring the financial sector since the collapse and
subsequent liquidation of the three state-owned banks in 1 989. By early 1993 five new commercial
banks (including one of international standing) were operational. These banks have been highly
successful in mobilizing financial savings, with their deposits increasing from only CFAF 7.8 billion at
end-1989 to CFAF 70.5 billion at end-1991. With external assistance, progress has also been made
in reimbursing depositors of the liquidated banks, in reducing the Government's obligations to the
central bank (BCEAO), in allowing the postal savings and checking system to become fully operational,
and in reviving the rural mutual credit network. By contrast the recovery of credits owed to the
liquidated banks has been slow due to inefficiencies in the methods employed and deficiencies in the
judicial system. Financial sector reforms currently focus on: i) the recovery of the liquidated banks'
assets and the strengthening of judicial procedures to protect creditors; ii) the restructuring of the
postal checking system and the rural credit network; and iii) the continued regularization of the
relationship between the central bank and the Government.
2.11          Despite the establishment of the new commercial banks, the financial system currently
does not adequately address the savings and financial requirements of the Beninese economy. The
banks have so far chosen to invest their substantial volume of resources on the monetary union money
market, with only a small proportion being devoted to (short-term) credit to the domestic economy.
This practice is expected to change over time as the recent economic recovery is consolidated and
more viable private and para-public borrowers emerge. In the medium term, however, the prospects
for their provision of financial intermediation services to rural areas appears quite limited.
2.1 2         Rural Financial Intermediation. Until the late 1980's financial intermediation in rural
areas was dominated by the state-owned Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA). As already
indicated, the CLCAMs were promoted by CNCA to develop its network of rural financial services.
Under the control of CNCA, the CLCAMs had very little autonomy and essentially served as a savings
mobilization mechanism. CNCA's financial collapse and Government's decision to liquidate it in 1987
left a serious vacuum for banking services in rural areas. As none of the new commercial banks



- 4 -
showed any interest in expanding services outside of Cotonou, the Government decided to make a
major effort for rehabilitating the CLCAMs network. The First and proposed Second Rural Savings
Cooperative Rehabilitation Projects support this rehabilitation and are an integral part of the
Government's strategy for the restructuring of the country's financial sector and for the development
of the rural sector.
Ill. RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVES
A.    Backaround
3.01         The first CLCAMs and CRCAMs were created in 1977, following the establishment (in
1 975) of the CNCA. As cooperative institutions, they are governed by the general cooperative statutes
of 1 966 and fall outside the BCEAO regulatory framework for financial institutions. In line with the
mutualist model, it was initially envisaged that the CLCAMs, grouped into regional unions (CRCAMs),
would be federated under a national, democratically elected, governing body. However, CNCA
assumed the role of the de facto apex institution of the Network and, by mid 1 980s, virtually
controlled all its operations.
3.02         This linkage with CNCA was the root cause of much of the movement's problems.
CLCAMs/CRCAMs were asked to undertake commercial banking operations, subjected to interest rate
ceilings (both on their deposits and lending operations) applicable to banks, and required to align staff
salaries and benefits on those of the banking sector. However, the Network did not have access to
normal banking facilities such as rediscounting or remunerated deposits with the Central Bank. CNCA
control over CLCAMs/CRCAMs management, in addition to diluting the Network's mutualist principles,
was therefore detrimental to the movement's financial viability.
3.03          By the time of the appraisal of the First Savings and Loan Rehabilitation Project in 1990
(para 3.04), the movement was nationally represented by 35 permanent and 64 periodic CLCAMs and
6 regional CRCAMs. It had a total membership of 20,800, a total share capital of CFAF 104 million
and total deposits of CFAF 2.4 billion (through some 67,000 accounts of various types, including those
of non-members). However, this importance of CRCAMs/CLCAMs in the economic and social
development of rural areas was not matched by their overall financial strength. Because of lax credit
supervision and political interferences, recovery rates were low. By 1988, 43% of total loans
outstanding of CFAF 622 million were considered doubtful by the auditors. The profitability of the
Network was also affected by high salaries and other operational expenses as well as an insufficient
interest margin on its lending operations. The Government's decision in 1 987 to liquidate CNCA, and
the consequent loss of the network's deposits (CFAF 565 million) with this institution, pushed the
movement into bankruptcy.
B.    First Rural Savinas and Loan Rehabilitation Proiect
3.04         The liquidation of CRCAMs and CLCAMs was seriously considered by the Government
as part of the CNCA liquidation process. However, given the vital importance of the CLCAM/CRCAM
Network for rural financial intermediation, the Government finally decided to rehabilitate the Network
and transform it into a private, autonomous and financially viable institution. A critical element in
donors' decision to assist in the rehabilitation effort was the Government's undertaking to allow
CLCAMs full autonomy in setting their policies (including interest rate policy) and operating procedures.
The First Rural Savings and Loan Rehabilitation Project was prepared in 1989. Its total cost over a
three-year period was estimated at US$ 12.8 million, including the Government and beneficiaries
participation of US$ 3.5 million. External financing for the project was shared by CCCE (US$ 3.7



-5 -
million), IDA (USS 2.5 million) as well as FAC, EEC and the Governments of Switzerland and Germany
(US$ 3.4 million). An IDA Credit (2086-BEN) for SDR 2.0 million was approved by the Board in
January 1990 and the Credit became effective in November 1990.
3.05          Total project funds were mainly allocated to the financial rehabilitation of the Network:
USS 6.4 million to reimburse CRCAMs/CLCAMs for their deposits lost at CNCA, and US$ 2.0 million
to finance operating deficits of CRCAMs/CLCAMs during the start-up/construction period. The balance
(US$ 2.4 million) financed (a) the cost of the Project's Central Project Unit (CPU), established to design
the Network's key operational policies and supervise their application by CLCAMs/CRCAMs as well as
to provide technical backstopping and training to Network staff at all levels; and (b) studies, audits,
vehicles and equipment. All funds were passed to the CRCAMs/CLCAMs on a grant basis. Although
the IDA credit is scheduled for closing in December 1995, funds are expected to be adequate up until
the end of December 1993.
3.06         Project performance has been remarkably good. The Central Project Unit (CPU), headed
by two expatriate managers (Director and Deputy/Financial Director), well supported by the Network's
"College des Presidents" (comprising of CLCAMs' representatives), provided strong and competent
leadership. The project has met its main objectives of re-establishing rural populations' confidence in
the CRCAM/CLCAM Network, improving management, training staff and managers and generally re-
instituting financial discipline and mutualist principles within the movement. Specific measures taken
and main achievements under the project include the following:
(a)    Statutes. CLCAMs and CRCAMs adopted new Statutes which made their autonomy
explicit, provided for annual elections of office bearers and set forth proper procedures
for annual general meetings, preparation of annual accounts, etc;
(b)    Closure of Non-viable Units. Many of the 64 periodic CLCAMs had been established
without adequate regard to their long term viability, and their operating losses were a
serious drain on the resources of the whole network. Following a detailed financial
assessment of each CLCAM undertaken at the beginning of the project, 57 periodic
CLCAMs were closed down and 7 converted into permanent CLCAMs;
{c)    Staff Reduction and Redeployment. The CPU commissioned an audit of the Network's
staff and, on the basis of its recommendations, terminated employment of redundant
staff and redeployed others to reduce costs and better match available skills with the
functions to be performed;
(d)    Trainina. The project has provided extensive training to the staff and Board members
of CLCAMs/CRCAMs. The CPU staff emphasized the vital importance of members'
sense of ownership and responsibility for the Network, sound lending policies, financial
disciplines and transparency in the Network's operations; and
(e)    Accounts. Insoections and Audits.   The CPU  initiated actions to clean-up
CRCAMs/CLCAMs accounts and improve internal management information systems
and controls. It instituted a rigorous system of inspections and, for the first time ever,
CRCAMs and CLCAMs were audited in 1989 by independent external auditors.
However, improvements in accounting and internal controls have been slower than
expected and, in the latest audit (for the year ended September 1 991) the auditors still
reported discrepancies in the accounts of some CLCAMs and CRCAMs. Actions are
now underway to correct these shortcomings (para 3.16).



C.    Present Situation of the Network. Lessons Learned and Need for Further Reforms
3.07         Structure of the Network. The present network of CRCAM/CLCAM consists of 50
CLCAMs, 6 CRCAMs and the Central Project Unit (located in Cotonou). Each of the 50 primary level
CLCAMs is affiliated to one of the CRCAMs located in the main town of the country's six regions
(Atacora, Atlantique, Borgou, Mono, Oueme and Zou).  Until recently, the six CRCAMs were
performing banking functions (i.e. taking deposits and extending loans) as well as providing services
(mainly accounting and liquidity management) to CLCAMs. This resulted in competition between
CRCAMs and CLCAMs for deposits and lending, and undermined CRCAMs' ability to provide essential
services to the CLCAMs in a timely and efficient manner. To correct this situation, it has now been
decided that CRCAMs should stop performing banking functions and concentrate on providing services
to CLCAMs. To do so, six new CLCAMs have recently been established in the regional capitals to take
over the financial and banking functions presently undertaken by CRCAMs. This transfer of activities
is being completed, and CRCAMs being converted into purely service units. Upon completion of this
transfer, the CRCAMs will be renamed "Unions R6gionales des Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole
Mutuel' (URCLCAMs).
3.08         The CPU is the main body controlling key operational policies and procedures of the
entire network and directing the rehabilitation efforts under the First project.  It manages the
Rehabilitation Fund established under the First Project to receive external project funds (to reimburse
the CLCAMs/CRCAMs for the deposits lost at CNCA), as well as the excess liquid funds of CLCAMs
and CRCAMs (which have a 60% reserve requirement). The two expatriates and its staff of 19
undertake regular inspections, provide assistance in accounting and organize training at all levels within
the Network. The CPU formally reports to the Project's 'Comit6 d'Orientation", set up under the First
Project to monitor its implenientation, chaired by the Ministry of Planning and where the project's
external financiers are represented.
3.09         Selected presidents of CRCAM/CLCAM are invited to the meetings of the Committee,
though on an irregular and ad hoc basis. The presidents of CRCAMs and CLCAMs have however
formed a semi-formal "College des Presidents" which meets periodically to discuss important issues
related to the Network's operations. CPU systematically consults the College on important issues
although it is not bound by its decisions. Under the First Rehabilitation Project, it was envisaged that
the CPU would be transformed into the technical secretariat of a federative apex body of the Network,
to be established in the third year of the project. However, developments in this regard have been
slower than anticipated and the federative body has yet to be created because of a genuine concern
that the newly established financial discipline could be undermined if the controls presently exercised
by a strong and independent CPU were to weaken too quickly. However, the CRCAM/CLCAM
presidents have recently expressed a strong desire to have a greater involvement in the management
of the Network and it has been decided that, at the beginning of the proposed Second Project, a formal
National Federation of CLCAMs would be established as the policy making and regulatory body of the
Network, with the CPU being transformed into the Federation's Technical Secretariat. The detailed
institutional structure of the Network is being finalized with external and local assistance.

deposits is shown in Annexes 1 and 2. Key data as of June 30, 1992, are summarized in the table

3.11          Increase in total membership from 20,800 in September 1989 to almost 40,000 in June
1 992 (i.e doubling in less than three years) clearly attests to the return of rural populations' confidence
in the movement. Total deposits within the network increased from CFAF 2.4 billion in September
1989 to CFAF 3.1 billion during the same period. Of these total deposits, about CFAF 2.5 billion are
savings deposits, remunerated at 3% p.a., the balance being in current accounts earning no interest.
A significant portion (about 60%) of Network's total deposits are mobilized from non-members who
use the CRCAM/CLCAMs as a banking facility without participating in their share capital. Non-
members' deposits increase CLCAMs' resource base for lending and, since part of the deposits can be
placed in interest-earning investments, they also contribute to their profitability. Nevertheless, such
deposits tend to be more volatile and also dilute the mutualist nature of these institutions. Under the
First Rehabilitation Project, CLCAMs and CRCAMs could utilize up to 40% of their deposits, for lending
operations. Including non-members' deposits, this practice allowed CLCAMs to increase their lending
base and therefore their earning potential. However, given the high proportion of non-member deposits
in total deposits, it may also allow CLCAMs to lend to members more than the total amount of their
deposits, which is not desirable. Under the proposed project, the need to continue offering safekeeping
services to non-members and the positive contribution of the latter's deposits to CLCAMs profitability
would be acknowledged. However, to preserve the mutualistic nature of the movement and provide
adequate safeguards, CLCAMs would be allowed to lend up to 50% of total savings deposits (para
6.02 (a)). This policy was included into the Statement of Operating Policies (SOP) of the Network
(para 5.03).



- 8 -
3.12          Details of lending operations and recovery performance since September 1989 are
provided in Annex 3. Loans are provided to members only. Except for medium-term loans under the
IFAD line of credit administered by Borgou CRCAM (para 3.15), most of the loans are short term.
Although loans to individuals are permitted, most loans are made to farmer groups who provide group-
guarantees. These group guarantees have been important for achieving 100% recovery of loans.
However, an even more critical factor has been the strict application of the rule under which a CLCAM
is not authorized to make fresh loans unless all loans fallen due have been fully recovered. This rule,
though very useful has limited the ability of the CLCAMs to diversify the type and timing of their loans.
The Network is therefore proposing to slightly relax the 100% repayment rule within each CLCAM to
allow for loans to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers of a particular CLCAM who have no
outstanding debts even if the repayment within the CLCAM is less than 100%. However, if the total
reimbursement rate for the CLCAM as a whole was less than 90%, no member of the CLCAM,
regardless of his credit standing, would receive credit. Assurances to this effect were obtained at
Neaotiations (para 6.02 (b)).
3.13         CLCAMs and CRCAMs charge an interest of 24% p.a. on their loans. This provides
them with a net margin of about 21 % (taking into account the 3% they pay on saving deposits). This
relatively high margin is necessary for financial viability in view of the yet small volume of lending
operations. As the deposit and lending base increases over time, CLCAMs operations should result in
increased profitability. Future profits would be used to (a) contribute to the cost of services provided
by the regional and national levels of the Network; (b) constitute reserves; and (c) decrease lending
rates, increase deposit rates and/or distribute dividends to members. Measures would be adopted
under the project to ensure CLCAMs provide an increasing contribution to the financing of the entire
Network while preserving their incentives to increase profits (para 3.18). CLCAMs would be free to
decide on the allocation of their profits, after contribution to Network financing and reserves.
3.14          Pooling of Excess Liauidity. Liquid funds not utilized by CLCAMs for lending operations
are managed by the CPU. Funds are placed with commercial banks which currently pay a net interest
of 8.5% p.a.. CPU retains a margin of 1.5% and passes-on 2% to CRCAM and 5% to CLCAMs.
Under current regulations, interest on deposits earned by cooperative institutions are tax-exempt.
However, CRCAMs' and CLCAMs' funds are being managed by the CPU through the Rehabilitation
Fund set up under the First Project and the Ministry of Finance has so far declined to recognize the
cooperative nature of the Rehabilitation Fund and to give it a tax-exempt status. The Government has
however indicated that once the National Federation of the CLCAMs has been established in
replacement of the CPU (para 3.09), interest earned on CLCAMs pooled resources would be tax-
exempt. Assurances to this effect were obtained at neaotiations (para 6.02 (c)).
3.15          External Lines of Credit. To reinforce its fundamental mutualist principles and protect
the Network from the lax repayment performance usually associated with the use of external funds,
neither the first nor the proposed project include external funds for lending operations. However, prior
to the beginning of the First Project, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) had
already put in place two lines of credit: one channelled through CLCAM Borgou (CFAF 800 million,
US$3.0 million) for farm mechanization and loans to women groups, and the second through the
CRCAM Atacora (CFAF 400 million, US$1.5 million) for the same purposes. Actual experience to date
indicates that these lines of credit are serving a critical role in providing much needed long term
resources (in particular to meet the heavy demand by cotton farmers for loans for ox-drawn equipment)
for which credit from other sources is unavailable. Repayment performance on these loans has so far
been excellent. There is also evidence that many women groups who had no prior access to credit



-9-
facilities are benefitting significantly from the IFAD credit lines. It is proposed therefore to let CLCAMs
of Borgou and Atacora manage the two existing IFAD lines of credit, grovided however that (a) the
usual 100% repayment rule is applied to IFAD-financed loans and (b) total outstanding borrowing by
any CLCAM under the IFAD lines does not exceed at any time 30% of its total deposits. Assurances
to this effect were obtained at Neaotiations. Assurances were also obtained that the CRCAM/CLCAM
Network would not borrow any further funds from external sources without prior agreement of the
'Comite de Concertation" (para 5.05 and para 6.02 (d)).
3.1 6        Present and Proiected Profitability of the Network. Audited Profit and Loss accounts
and Balance Sheets of the 50 CLCAMs and 6 CRCAMs as of September 30, 1 991 are shown at
Annexes 4 and 5. In auditing these annual accounts, the auditors noted discrepancies between the
accounting records at the CLCAMs level and those 'centralized' at the CRCAMs level. The present
accounting difficulties are largely due to cumbersome accounting procedures (which involve duplicate
accounting at CLCAM and CRCAM levels) and to manual book-keeping methods. The auditors, jointly
with the financial staff of the CPU, have undertaken to establish an accurate opening Balance Sheet
for each CLCAM as of October 1, 1992. Also, a simple computerized accounting system would be
designed and introduced under the proposed project.
3.17         CLCAMs have made vigorous efforts since 1989 to achieve financial viability. The
latest assessment indicates that over half of the 50 CLCAMs should break even (or show operating
profits) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1992. Projections of CLCAMs profitability beyond
1 992 (Annex 7) indicate that nearly all CLCAMs would become profitable by the end of the proposed
project period (11998). These projections are based on conservative assumptions: (a) increase in
deposits of 10-15% p.a. depending on area potential; (b) increase in operating cost of 7% p.a.; (c)
lending operations limited to 35% of total savings deposits mobilized in FY 1994 gradually increasing
to 45% by the end of the project; (d) interest earnings of 5% per year on excess liquid funds; (e)
interest payment of 3% p.a. on savings deposits, and (f) provisions for losses equal to 4% of annual
lending. They are therefore robust. On this basis, it is projected that the total operating losses of
primary level CLCAMs during the entire project period would not exceed CFAF 30 million (US$
1 20,000). These temporary operating losses would only be incurred by a few CLCAMs located in
areas where there is no cash crop (such as cotton) and deposit potential is lower. In order to underline
the importance of CLCAMs rapidly achieving financial viability and to ensure that unprofitable CLCAMs
do not continue to operate indefinitely, assurances were obtained at Neaotiations that CLCAMs which
are unable to cover their operating costs through internally generated revenues for three consecutive
years would be closed down by decision of the Federation's general meeting (para 6.02 (e)). A Central
Support Fund would be created at the central level to support loss-making CLCAMs for a period not
to exceed two consecutive years. The fund would be established and replenished with annual
contributions from CLCAMs of 10% of their interests on credits. (para 6.02 (f)).

Most of the CLCAMs would break even or make a profit before the end of the project period. The
network is in the process of studying the most effective way of financing the URCLCAMs and the
Federation including annual contributions by CLCAMs, revenue obtained from managing the network's
excess liquidity, or payments by CLCAMs for the real costs of services provided by the URCLCAMs
and the Federation. Meanwhile the financial projections show that a contribution of 30% of profits
by profitable CLCAMs together with the expected donor contributions should be enough to finance the
URCLCAMs and the Federation and it is projected that at the end of the project, CLCAMs'
contributions would cover 75% of the URCLCAMs' operating costs and 20% of the Technical
Secretariat's.  Assurances were obtained at Negotiations that starting  in FY94 and pending the
adoption by the network of a new system for financing the URCLCAMs and the Federation acceptable
to IDA, CLCAMs' generating a profit would contribute about 30% of these profits towards URCLCAMs
and the national Technical Secretariat, in that order of priority (para 6.02 (g)). On that basis, for the
five-year period (1994-98), CLCAMs' contribution to URCLCAMs' total operating costs of CFAF 694
million would amount to CFAF 430 million (62%). Their contribution to the cost of the Technical
Secretariat (CFAF 905 million) would be CFAF 163 million (18%). The balance of operating costs at
URCLCAM and Technical Secretariat levels would need to be externally financed. The projections also
indicate that CLCAMs would be able to fully cover the cost of URCLCAMs operations by 2001 and the



cost of the entire network by 2007. Faster growth in deposit mobilized and cost containment at
regional and national levels would speed up financial viability.
D.     Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.1 9         As for the First Project, the proposed project is consistent with the Government's
strategy of improving the performance of financial intermediaries in the rural sector, removing direct
Government interference in rural savings and loan functions and encouraging greater responsibility of
rural communities in the management of local institutions. The successful experience under the First
Project, and in particular the enthusiasm with which rural populations have participated in the
rehabilitation of CLCAMs, has further reinforced this strategy. The proposed project also clearly falls
within the Bank's strategy to support the development of financial intermediation in the rural areas
through private local initiatives based on mutualist principles. Several countries within the Region are
attempting to establish such institutions, and successful establishment of the CLCAM Network in Benin
will have wide implications for possible replication in other countries. The Government welcomed
IDA's association with the First Project and, during the course of supervision missions, emphasized its
desire for IDA's continued involvement in the second phase project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.    Proiect Obiectives and Summary Description
4.01          Obiectives. The proposed project would support the Government's long-term strategy
to strengthen rural financial intermediation institutions. It would build upon the achievements and
lessons of the First Savings and Loan Cooperative Rehabilitation Project to continue the rehabilitation
of the Network, with the ultimate objective of creating a private system that would be financially viable
and sustainable without external subsidies.
4.02          Summary Description. The project would be implemented over a five-year period
(1994-98). It would support the establishment of an efficient institutional structure for the Network
through: (a) the creation of a representative apex policy-making and advisory body with a strong
Technical Secretariat ensuring the proper policy guidance for, and overall control over, the Network's
operations; (b) the conversion of CRCAMs into efficient service units (URCLCAMs) providing technical
backstopping to CLCAMs; and (c) the training of staff at all levels. The project would finance
investments (office equipment, vehicles, buildings), technical assistance, as well as part of the cost
of development services provided to CLCAMs by the Technical Secretariat and the URCLCAMs, to the
extent that these costs would not be covered through contributions from CLCAMs.
B.    Detailed Features
4.03          CLCAMs Component (26% of total costs). Project support to primary level CLCAMs
would include the following:
(a)    Investment Costs. Office equipment for the new computerized accounting system
(about US$0.2 million) and construction of premises for fifteen CLCAMs (about US$0.4
million); and
(b)    Ooeratino Costs. It is expected that most of the CLCAMs would become profitable
early during the project period. External financing would support: (a) a small provision
(US$0.6 million) included in the project to cover losses incurred by CLCAMs until



- 12 -
September 30, 1992 which were not fully identified because of difficulties in their
accounting system (para 3.16) and therefore not covered under the First Project; and
(b) a provision of (US$0.1 million) to cover part of operating expenses of a few
CLCAMs operating in the marginal, non-cash crop areas of the country which are
taking longer to establish their viability and a contribution to operating costs of four
new CLCAMs to be established during the project period.
4.04         URCLCAM Component (21 % of total costs). The project would support the cost of
development services provided by URCLCAMs to CLCAMs (assistance for accounting/financial
management, training of staff and promotion of the movement to increase membership) to the extent
that these development costs are not totally financed by CLCAMs' contributions. Over the project
period, it is estimated that CLCAMs would contribute about USS 1.8 million towards URCLCAMs'
development costs. The external financing needed would therefore amount to about US$1.1 million.
The project would also finance the renewal of vehicles for the six URCLCAMs (US$0.2 million).
4.05         National Federation Component (53% of total Costs). The establishment of the
National Federation and its Technical Secretariat would constitute the main component of the project.
It would consist of the following:
(a)    Investments. The project would finance the design and installation of the computerized
accounting system (US$0.4 million) as well as other office equipment and vehicles for
the Technical Secretariat (US$0.4 million);
(b)    Technical Assistance/Training and Audits. The project would finance about 78 man-
months of external technical assistance to cover the cost of the Project's Deputy
Executive Secretary and Financial Controller (US$1.5 million); as well as short-term
consultancies, external training and study tours, and the annual external audits of the
accounts and operations of the Network's different units including the 50 CLCAMs
(US$2.1 million); and
(c)    Development Costs. The total cost of the Federation/Technical Secretariat's support
to CLCAM and URCLCAMs would amount to about US$3.8 million over the project
period. It is expected that, in addition to their contribution towards the cost of
URCLCAMs' services, CLCAM would contribute about US$0.7 million towards the cost
of services provided by the Federation's Technical Secretariat through the (1.5%)
commission retained on pooled liquidity earnings (para 3.16). The balance (US$3.1
million) would be financed from external sources under the project.

as of June 1 992 adjusted to the negotiations date of March 1993 and includes appropriate price and
physical contingencies.

2.    Financina Plan
4.08         The project's detailed financing plan (Annex 6) has been agreed upon with the project's
main co-financiers (CFD and the Swiss Development Cooperation). It is summarized in the table below.
Proiect Financing PLan
CLCAM   IDA    CFD   SDC   FAC   IFAD    EEC        TOTAL
--------------------------(USSmiltlion)------------------------------
CLCAM Component            2.6            1.0          0.2   0.1      p.m.      3.9
URCLCAM Coriponent         1.8    0.7    0.1                 0.3      0.2       3.1
Federation Component       0.7    3.1    1.7   1.9   0.7    -          -        8.1
Total     5.1    3.8    2.8   1.9   0.9   0.4        0.2      15.1
4.09         The proceeds of the IDA credit would not finance past losses or operating cost deficits
of CLCAMs. They would finance part of the cost of development services provided by URCLCAMs
(other than those of Atacora and Mono that would be financed by IFAD and EEC respectively under
on-going operations) and those of the Federation's Technical Secretariat that would not be financed
by CLCAMs themselves out of their annual profits (para 3.18). The Swiss Development Cooperation
(SDC) has indicated that it would finance, out of the balance of the grant funds under the Bank-
administrated Assistance to Public Enterprises Project, the project's training component, part of the
technical assistance component and the cost of annual external audits. CFD and FAC funds would
finance CLCAMs' past losses and operating deficits, buildings, computerization of accounting systems,
equipment and part of the technical assistance. IFAD and EEC would finance part of the services of
URCLCAM and the temporary operating deficits of CLCAMs in the Atacora and Mono region through
their on-going Atacora and Mono Rural Development Projects.
4.10         IDA funds would be made available to the Government on standard IDA terms on 40
years including a ten-year grace period. All external financing, including IDA funds, would be passed
on by the Government to the movement as grant. The signing of a Subsidiary Agreement acceptable
to IDA between the Government and the Federation would be a Condition of Effectiveness of the IDA
_re (para 6.03 (i>). The Technical Secretariat of the Federation would manage the Special Account
(SA) which will be opened with a bank acceptable to IDA, into which IDA would deposit CFAF 100
million (US$400,000) as an initial advance for project implementation.
3.    Disbursements
4.11         Disbursements would be fully documented except for expenditures below US$20,000
equivalent where statement of expenditures would be used. Related documentation would be kept by
the Technical Secretariat of the Federation and made available for scrutiny to Bank supervision
missions and auditors. The disbursement profile for agricultural projects in Benin show that project
funds would be disbursed over a period of seven and a half years as indicated in Annex 8. IDA funds
would finance part of the development services provided by the URCLCAMs and the Federation's
Technical Secretariat to CLCAMs. Annex 7 presents the projected share of the cost of URCLCAMs'
and Federation's development services that would be financed by the CLCAMs, and the share that
would be covered by IDA. It is summarized below:

4.12            It is projected that CLCAMs would be able to finance about 60%  of the total cost of
URCLCAMs' development services during the project period, with their contribution increasing from
about 45% in project year 1 to about 75% in project year 5. CLCAMs would also contribute about
20% to the cost of services provided by the Federation's Technical Secretariat over the project period.
Accordingly, IDA disbursements would be as follows:
Disbursements of IDA Credit
Categories                   IDA Allocation                   x of Expenditure to be financed

(3) Unallocated                 0.2
Total                3.8
4.13            CLCAMs actual profitability will depend on the amount of deposit mobilized, the quality
of their loan portfolio and their operating expenses. Should CLCAMs become profitable sooner than
expected, their contribution to the cost of URCLCAMs and Technical Secretariat's development
services would be higher than projected. IDA disbursements would then exceed URCLCAMs' and
Technical Secretariat's financing  needs.   Assurances were obtained  at Neaotiations that IDA
disbursement percentage would be reviewed as part of the mid-term review, when the profitability of
the Network could be better assessed, to correct for possible excess IDA disbursement (para 6.02 (h)).
4.14            It is also possible that CLCAMs profitability during a given year, and therefore their
contribution to URCLCAMs' and Technical Secretariat's development costs, be less than projected.
Any shortfall would be covered through appropriate internal cost containment measures. Assurances
were obtained at Neaotiations in that respect (para 6.02 {i)). CLCAMs that will incur losses for three
consecutive years would be closed down (para 3.17). During negotiations cost reduction measures and
key monitorable indicators (Annex 11) were developed and agreed upon with the Network. It is
expected that these measures, together with (a) the incentives provided by the CLCAMs retaining 70%
of their annual profits and (b) the respect by CLCAMs of the Network's Statement of Operating Policies
(para 5.03), would be effective in promoting productivity and cost effectiveness at all levels of the
Network.

4.    Procurement
4.1 5        Goods and services financed under the project would be procured in accordance with
procedures acceptable to each co-financier. IDA would not finance the project's technical assistance.
However, the qualifications and terms of contract of the Technical Secretariat's managerial staff
(Executive Secretary and Financial Controller/Deputy Executive Secretary) would be subject to IDA's
review and approval. Procurement arrangements are summarized in para 4.17 below. Amounts in
parenthesis indicate IDA financing. Development costs, including salaries of contractual staff, staff
travel allowances, vehicles operations and maintenance, equipment and office costs, given their
individual nature and the small unit amounts involved, would not be subject to competitive bidding.
However, to the extent practicable, contracts for materials and office equipment would be grouped in
bid packages of the equivalent of US$100,000 or more and be subject to International Competitive
Bidding (ICB). Materials and office equipment estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
US$100,000 but more than the equivalent of US$30,000 would be procured through Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) acceptable to IDA. Materials and office equipment estimated to cost less
than the equivalent of US$30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the
equivalent of US$ 1 million may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of
price quotations solicited from a list of at least three suppliers eligible under the Bank's Guidelines.
4.16.        The proposals for advertising, draft bidding documents, bid evaluation, and award
proposals for all contracts of US$30,000 or more would be subject to review by IDA prior to their
execution. The review process would cover at least 80% of the total value of contracts to be financed
by IDA. An IDA selective post-review of awarded contracts below the thresholds would be done for
about 1 in 4 contracts.
4.1 7        Procurement actions have overall been performed satisfactorily under the First Project
and experience and knowledge of IDA procurement procedures already exists at the project central
level. The Federation's Technical Secretariat (TS) would be in charge of carrying out project
procurement. Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows: (a) prompt
reporting of contract award information by the TS; and (b) comprehensive quarterly and annual reports
to IDA by the TS, indicating: (a) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project;
(b) revised timing of procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract award, and
completion time for individual contracts; and (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods
of procurement.

5.    Accounts, Audits and Reportina Reauirements
4.18         CLCAMs, URCLCAMs and the Federation Technical Secretariat would be required to
maintain records of their operations and of use of funds under the project, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. CLCAMs, URCLCAMs and Federation Technical Secretariat would
have their annual accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and submit to IDA the
reports of these annual audits not later than six months after the end of each financial year (para 6.02
(k)). The auditors would also be required to provide certification that (a) the SOE disbursements under
the IDA credit were adequately documented and concerned costs incurred for the purpose of the
project; and (b) the Special Account was used exclusively for the project. The scope of audits would
also be extended to the verification of compliance with the Network's Statement of Operating Policies
and Statutes. The auditors' terms of reference are presented in Annex 10. The Technical Secretariat
would have simplified versions of annual accounts prepared and distributed to CLCAM members each
year. The Federation's Technical Secretariat would also prepare annual work programs (AWP) and
budgets as well as semi-annual progress reports to be submitted to project's cofinanciers. In addition,
by June 30 of each year, the Technical Secretariat would furnish to IDA for approval, a draft AWP for
the subsequent year and the budget for such a program. The AWP would include details of the training
program, key monitorable indicators for the project, commitments and expected disbursements and
discussion of major issues regarding project implementation. By September 30 of each year the
Federation's Technical Secretariat would submit a final AWP and a budget acceptable to IDA. Finally,
within six months of the Credit closing date, the Technical Secretariat would prepare a Project
Completion Report (PCR) for submission to IDA. Assurances were obtained at Neaotiations concerning
these reporting requirements (para 6.02 (j)).
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Implementation
5.01         The project would be implemented by the various levels/units of the S&L Cooperative
Network under the monitoring of the "Comite de Concertation". The Committee would meet at least
twice a year to review project implementation, provide guidance and monitor Network's activities and
financial situation.
5.02         Establishment of the National Federation. It had been agreed that, by the end of the
First Project, the Network would review options with regard to the institutional structure of the
movement (from a loosely coordinated club of fully autonomous primary level units to a centralized
system where an apex institution would have considerable policy making and regulatory powers).
After a series of external consultancies, the 'College of CLCAM Presidents' held a seminar in October
1 992 to review alternative institutional arrangements. It decided to establish a three-tiered federative
structure with (a) CLCAMs undertaking all banking activities and retaining considerable operational and
managerial autonomy; (b) six regional service units (URCLCAMs) providing CLCAMs with training and
technical backstopping; and (c) a National Federation operating as a policy making and supervisory
body, composed of elected CLCAM representatives and assisted by a Technical Secretariat responsible
for supervising the Regional Units, controlling the financial practices of CLCAMs and managing their
excess liquidity. The "College des Presidents' met again in February/March 1993 to adopt the
organizational structure and draft Statutes of the Federation. The draft organizational structure and
Statutes have been submitted to IDA and found acceptable. The actual establishment of the Federation
would however require that its Board be formally elected. Assurances were obtained at Neaotiations
that the Federation would be effectively established, with a democratically elected Board, before
December 31, 1993 (para 6.02 (I)).

5.03         Statement of Operational Policies. The basic operational policies underlying the present
operations of the Network have evolved through the implementation of the First Project. Fundamental
principles such as the freedom of CLCAMs to fix interest rates, have been clearly spelt out from the
outset in CLCAMs statutes. Others such as the 100% recovery rule have been proposed by the CPU
and adopted by the 'College des Presidents' to respond to specific needs or problems. The Network's
policies have now been consolidated into a comprehensive "Statement of Operational Policies' (SOP)
clearly spelling out the Network's policies in the area of deposit mobilization, provision of credit,
prudential ratios, internal management controls, mechanisms to finance the regional and apex
structures (including adequate cost containment measures), the opening of new CLCAMs or the closing
of unprofitable ones, etc. Through a series of seminars organized by consultants, representatives of
the network, staff of the CRCAMs and CPU have met about three times to discuss various aspects of
the SOP and a draft has been prepared at their last meeting in February/March 1993. This was
discussed at negotiations before formal adoption by the 'College des Presidents".
5.04         Manaaement of the Federation's Technical Secretariat. The 'College des Pr6sidents'
has recruited a Beninese national to be Executive Secretary of the Federation's Technical Secretariat,
under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. In addition, the Network has recruited an expatriate
Financial Controller to design and set up the proposed computerized accounting system and internal
control procedures for the entire network. The Financial Controller would work closely with his
(existing) Beninese counterpart. Assurances were obtained at neaotiations that the performance of
the Financial Controller and the national Executive Secretary would be reviewed by the Board of the
Federation at the end of the first year of project implementation (September 30, 1994), which would
then decide whether to renew their appointment. The recommendations on the appointments
acceptable to IDA would be implemented within three months (para 6.02 (m)). If the Financial
Controller's performance is satisfactory and he has completed setting up the accounting system, he
would assume the function of Deputy Executive Secretary in charge of finance and his counterpart
would take over as Financial Controller.
5.05         Overall Guidance and Supervision. The cooperative movement will need to rely on
external financial assistance beyond the end of the proposed project. The Government has therefore
a legitimate interest in closely following the Network's management and development. Implementation
of the First Project was supervised by a 'Comit6 d'Orientation' chaired by the Coordinator of the IDA-
financed Project for Assistance to Public Enterprises in the Ministry of Planning. These arrangements
have worked well. Under the proposed project, a "Comite de Concertation" including representatives
of the Federation, the Government and donors would be established no later than December 31, 1993
and maintained to monitor project implementation. Assurances to this effect were obtained at
Neaotiations (para 6.02 (n)).
5.06         For the moment, there is a regulatory vacuum in the countries of the Union Monetaire
de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (UMOA) with regard to the supervision of grass-root financial cooperatives , as
these institutions do not fall under the purview of the BCEAO. Under the First Project, control over
the Network's operations have been carried-out by the CPU and through annual external audits. These
arrangement have worked well and would be continued by the Federation's Technical Secretariat, with
financial policies and prudential ratios clearly spelt out in the Network's Statement of Operational
Policies and strengthened internal controls. However, the Technical Secretariat's controls remain a
form of internal control and external supervision will eventually be necessary. BCEAO has recently
launched a study to establish a regional regulatory framework for financial cooperatives in the UMOA.
Once adopted, this framework would be applied to the Network's operations.

5.07          Proiect Mid-Term Review.  A detailed mid-term  review of the project would be
undertaken before September 30, 1996. This mid-term review would assess the Network's progress
towards achieving financial viability, the adequacy of its operational policies and the suitability of its
institutional structure and management. Assurances to this effect were obtained at Negotiations (para
6.02 (o)).
B.    Environmental Imoact
5.08          The project would not entail any potential environmental risk. By improving financial
services in rural areas, a considerable contribution to the overall performance of the rural sector is
expected, hence setting the basis for sustainable growth and poverty alleviation in rural areas, which
admittedly contribute to a better environment. The environmental category of this project is C.
C.    Benefits and Risks
5.09          The main benefit of the project would be the establishment of a private, decentralized
and cost-effective financial intermediation system in the rural areas of Benin. In turn, this effective
financial intermediation will foster wide-based economic and social development in rural areas.
Restoration of financial health into the rural financial sector and recovering farmers' confidence has
a great potential to disseminate the savings spirit in the rural areas and thus mobilize large amounts
of rural savings. A broad spectrum of rural and smallholder families would benefit from the cooperative
savings and loan system to meet their seasonal credit needs especially during the lean season.
Moreover, a viable and sustainable institutional framework can also better serve the needs of private
entrepreneurs in the rural areas, given the very limited development of the commercial banking system
outside from Cotonou.
5.10          The risks that could threaten the viability of the Network are (a) external interferences
leading to bad lending practices and poor repayment disciplines; (b) poor internal management with
heavy overheads; and (c) lower than anticipated deposit mobilization and earning capacity. The risk
of external pressures has been greatly reduced under the First Project by the Government's
commitment not to interfere with the operations of what is officially acknowledged as a purely private
institution. Measures have also been taken under the proposed Project to limit risks linked to the use
by CLCAMs of external lines of credit. The soundness of CLCAMs' management and the cost
effectiveness of their operations would be ensured by clear guidelines and safeguards spelt out in the
Network's Statement of Operational Policies and continued strong monitoring by the Federation's Board
and Technical Secretariat.
5.11          The main risk, however, is that the mobilization of the deposits by the Network be
slower than anticipated and therefore that it take longer for the entire institutional structure to become
financially self-sustaining. Deposit potential in rural areas critically depends on production and income.
In this respect, cotton production and prices will have a determining impact on populations' income
and savings capacity. Recent experience indicates however that, in spite of a decline in cotton
producer prices, CLCAMs have on average been able to increase deposits at more than 15% a year.
This trend is expected to continue. In addition, it is expected that CLCAMs will be able to maintain
a large spread between deposits and lending rates. Finally, the very decentralized nature of the
Network and the large operational and financial autonomy of the CLCAMs would ensure the overall
robustness and financial viability of the global system through risk diversification.

SECOND RURAi SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVE REHABILITATION PROJECT
Proiection of the Network's Financial Viabilitv
1.           Tables 7(a) and 7(b) present the evolution of the financial situation of the Network:
Table 7(a) presents the projected net operating income of each of the existing
CLCAMs, as well as (i) the aggregated annual profits of the profitable CLCAMs
and lii) the aggregated annual loans of the loss-making ones, for each of the
country's six regions.
Table 7(b) presents the estimated operating costs of URCLs and of the
Technical Secretariat of the Federation, as well as (i) the contribution of
CLCAMs to the financing of these cost; and (ii) the financing gap' to be
financed on external funds.
2.           These projections are based on the following assumptions:
-     Growth in deposits: 10% to 15% p.a. depending on area potential.
-     Interest paid on savings deposits: 3% p.a. (current rate).
-     Annual lending: from 35% of deposits in FY93 to 45% in FY95 and beyond
(calculated on 9 months only).
-     Interest earned: 24% on lending; 5% p.a. on liquid funds.
-     Operating costs of CLCAMs increasing at 7%  p.a., those of URCLs and
Technical Secretariat (excluding technical assistance) at 5% p.a.
-     Provisions for bad loans: 4% of annual lending.
-     CLCAMs liquid funds are invested in financial assets yielding 8.5%  p.a.;
Technical Secretariat retains a 1.5% margin, and URCLs, 2%.
-     CLCAMs contribute 30% of their net annual profits to the financing of URCLs
and the Technical Secretariat.
3.           The projections indicates that:
except for a few CLCAMs located in the poorest areas of the country (Atacora,
Zou), most should become financially viable before the end of the project. For
the CLCAMs not yet reaching break-even, additional efforts will be needed to
increase deposits faster than projected (10%) and to reduce costs if they are
to avoid closing down. Allowing CLCAMs to lend more than 45% of their
savings would improve their profitability, if there was no deterioration of their
portfolio.

Annex 7
Page 2 of 23
at the end of the project, CLCAMs will finance 75% of URCLs operating costs,
21 % of the costs of the Technical Secretariat and 45% of the URCLlTechnical
Secretariat combined costs. Faster than anticipated deposit mobilization and
cost containment measures would increase CLCAMs profitability and funding
abilities.
CLCAMs would be able to fully cover URCLs operating costs by FY2001 (3
years beyond the project) when total deposits reach about CFAF 11.0 billion
(they are expected to reach CFAF 7.1 billion by the end of the project) and the
combined URCLlTS's operating costs by FY2007, when total deposits reach
around CFAF 22.0 billion.

REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVE REHABILITATION PROJECT
AUDITOR'S TERMS OF REFERENCE
General
1.           Annual audits would be carried out for the operations and accounts of the Network of
Rural Savings and Loan Cooperatives comprising 50 primary level cooperatives (Caisses Locales de
Credit Agricole Mutuel - CLCAM), six regional Unions of CLCAMs and their Federation and Technical
Secretariat.
2.           Auditors would be invited to submit proposals and work programs based on the
proposed Terms of Reference.
Auditor's opinion and reports
3.           The auditors would express and opinion on the Network's operations and accounts
including:
a) the statements of expenditures (SOEs) and their reliability as to justify disbursements effected on
the basis of said SOEs;
b) the Special Account, and
c) the Financial Statements. The auditors would also express and opinion on the Network's financial
condition with regard to its liquidity and security of deposits.
4.          In addition, the auditors would deliver an opinion on administrative, accounting and
internal procedures of the Network, and on compliance with the Network's Statement of Operating
Policies (SOP) and Statutes.
5.           The following reports would be issued by the auditors:
a) short form reports summarizing their opinion on the SOEs, the Special Account, the Financial
Statement and the SOP and Statutes above;
b) long form reports on the operations, accounts and internal controls of the Network; and
c) a management letter on auditors' recommendations.
Scope of Audit
6.          In addition to the audit of the operations and accounts, the auditors should determine
whether (a) the goods and services financed under the project are delivered and used for the intended
purposes, and (b) expenditures financed are eligible under the Development Credit Agreement.



- 68 -
Annex 10
(page 2 of 2)
7.           The auditors should comment on and confirm the extent to which generally accepted
accounting principles have been and are being consistently applied. They should indicate any material
differences from international accounting standards, and where relevant, their effect on the annual
financial statements.
8.           The auditors should also:
a) ensure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and properly;
b) ascertain that all assets and liabilities are properly recorded;
c) verify asset and inventory accounts by physical inspections;
d) appraise the adequacy of the provisions for bad loans and losses and the status of arrears;
e) review the accounting and data processing systems to ensure accuracy, efficiency and proper
controls;
f) verify the correctness of the transactions of the Special Account including the reconciliation with
IDA credit disbursements and ensure such transactions are in compliance with the Development Credit

Annex 1 1
(page 1 of 2)
BENIN
SECOND RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
COST REDUCTION MEASURES AND KEY MONITORABLE INDICATORS
1.           The table in Annex 12 summarizes key monitorable indicators which have been
developed and agreed upon with the Savings and Loan Network, in order to establish criteria toward
financial discipline and sustainability. They include: (a) loan recovery rates; (b) loan to deposits ratio;
(c) credit interests to interests on savings ratio; (d) administrative costs to profits ratio; (e) personnel
costs to administrative costs ratio; (f) increase in savings deposits; (g) increase in membership; and
(h) average deposit per member.
2.           To achieve the above objectives, the following policies would be implemented with
regard to:
a)    Lending and Loan Recovery. The objective of loan recovery would be maintained at the
present rate of about 98% during the project execution. The existing rigorous discipline
in credit recovery which is largely in-built in the mutualistic approach through group
guarantees would be maintained and reinforced. Total authorized outstanding loans
would not exceed 50% of savings deposits, which remains a fairly conservative
prudential ratio given the relatively stable nature of savings deposits with the Network.
b)    Financial Autonomy. The Network's financial autonomy would be pursued through: {i)
a deposits growth rate of 1 5% per year and an increased effort to improve quality and
delivery of services to clients; {ii) the search for the best possible placements for the
Network's excess liquidity by the Technical Secretariat; (iii) limiting the use of existing
lines of credit to a maximum of 30% of the CLCAMs' total deposits and obtaining prior
agreement of the "Comite de Concertation" before any new line of credit is accepted;
(iv) the CLCAMs' contribution to the financing of the Network in a progressive way
through 30% of the CLCAMs' profits; and (v) a yearly evaluation of the Network's
costs with the objective of setting targets to be used as a basis for charging the cost
of services and possibly purchase these services on the market at a cheaper price.
c}    Opening and Closing of CLCAMs. Opening of any new CLCAM can only be authorized
by the Board of the Federation based on a feasibility study including a market study
and an analysis of the projected income statements. Loss-making CLCAMs would be
supported by the Central Support Fund for a period not to exceed two years. A
CLCAM generating losses for three consecutive years would be excluded from the
Network.
d)    Socioeconomic Investments. Great precaution would be used in that respect as
expressed in Article 62 of Statutes specifying priorities in the appropriation process of
profits which would compensate for past losses, make allocations to legal and
statutory reserves, and therefore leave only an insignificant share available for possible
socioeconomic investments.

Annex 11
(page 2 of 2)
e)    Staff Productivity. A particular focus will be directed at increasing staff productivity
through containing the Network's administrative costs within CLCAMs' profits and
expanding the membership base. CLCAMs' staff remuneration would be contained on
the basis of limited profitability.
3.           The following measures would also be implemented
a)    reduction of 1 5 to 25 percent of URCLCAMs total losses to be covered by Project
Year 5;
b)    increase in the profit to administrative cost ratio for the different levels of the Network
as follows:
. CLCAM, from 127% in 1993 to 387% in 1998
. URCLAM, from 140% in 1993 to 320% in 1998
. Federation, from 147% in 1993 to 335% in 1998
. Network, from 53% in 1993 to 124% in 1998 and
c)}   review of the regional and federal services' cost structure during project mid-term
review in September 1996 with a view to streamlining such services and further
reducing costs.
