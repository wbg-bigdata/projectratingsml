INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
CHAMBAL COMMAND AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (RAJASTHAN)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Government of India for the equivalent of US$52 million to help
finance a project for command area development in the Chambal region of
Rajasthan. The loan would have a term of 30 years, including 7 years of
grace, with interest at 7.25% per annum. The proceeds of the loan - except
for part of the on-farm development (US$6.5 million), fertilizer (US$6.1 mil-
lion), and interest during construction (US$11 million) - would be channelled
to the Government of Rajasthan in accordance with the Government of India's
standard terms and arrangements for the financing of State development proj-
ects. For on-farm development, the Government of India would relend the
proceeds of the loan to the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) for
9 to 15 years at 6.25% and 6.75% annual interest, respectively. ARC would
in turn on-lend the funds to the Rajasthan State Cooperative Land Development
Bank (LDB) and to participating commercial banks in the project area at not
less than 7% annual interest. LDB and the commercial banks would relend the
funds to farmers at an interest rate of not less than 9-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the
Government. Governing a country divided into more than 20 States with a
population of some 580 million and over 60 major languages is an extra-
ordinary responsibility. The country's poverty and poor natural resource
endowment, supplemented by a net transfer of external resources averaging
in recent years well below US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp
limitations on the rate of growth. Any judgment of India's economic per-
formance must take these underlying circumstances into account. So, also,
must account be taken of two massive uncertainties which overhang India.
The first is the availability of water. A bad monsoon, which is inevitable
from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy and
wipes out the results-of years of effort. The second tncertainty is the
availability of external assistance. The vast majority of bilateral aid



is comnaitted annually, usually several months after the start of the fiscal
year, and with considerable uncertainties about the level of commitments
and disbursements of particular donors. Any delay in IDA replenishment
has an enormous impact on aid flows. Together, these considerations severely
complicate planting and force a high degree of caution in foreign exchange
management.
4.        In this perspective, the performance of the economy has been
far from bad. In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly
4% per annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth
rate of less than 1% during the preceding 50 years. Population has also
grown faster in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income
has nevertheless risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first
half of this century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year
since independence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial and
agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others
have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below
full capacity; in some regions of the country growth and structural change
have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many other parts
of the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly
even decline. Despite these improvements and although the distribution
of income in India is relatively even by comparison with many other
countries, there has been little impact upon the living standards of the
vast masses of the urban and rural population.  The Government has become
increasingly concerned about the plight of the lower income strata which,
conservatively measured, consist of some 200 million people with incomes
of less than US$60 per head per year, and has initiated in recent years a
variety of programs specifically designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42%
of national product in the early 1970. compared with around 49% twenty
years previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector
has increased only slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the composi-
tion of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods
now contributing about one-third each compared with an overwhelming prepon-
derance of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        One of India's most impressive achievements since the mid-1960s
has been the doubling of the average gratath rate of productivity in foodgrain
production. This has been achieved primarily through the introduction of
new, high-yielding seed varieties and through complementary improvements in
farming practices. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to consolidate the



production growth in the wheat belt and to extend it both to other areas
and to other foodgrain crops, most particularly rice. Other crops have,
in most cases, shown a slow but fairly constant rate of productivity in-
crease. Irrigation has played a major part in agricultural growth and, by
reducing dependence on the monsoon, has reduced variability in performance.
For instance, the drought-induced decline in foodgrain output in 1972/73
was only some 6Z, compared with a fall of almost 20% due to the drought in
the mid-1960s. At present only about half of the potentially irrigable areas
has been developed. Better utilization of the existing irrigation system
and the extension of the irrigated a&reas are, therefore, matters of the
highest priority in order to meet India's rising food needs and to protect
the economy against the vagaries of the weather. Land which cannot be
irrigated accounts for about 50% of the cultivable area; output from non-
irrigated land will thus remain important and substantial benefits remain
to be realized through technical change and investment.
8.        Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and to
some extent disappointing. Industrial growth averaged about 7% a year in
the 1950s, rose to 9% in the first half of the 1960s, but declined to some
5% through 1972 and in the past three years has been negligible. The slow
growth since the mid-1960s is especially worrying. To some extent it was
precipitated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the accompanying
general recession. But it has also been the result of many other factors:
the relatively limited opportunities for fur:her import substitution which
had from the outset been at the center of the industrialization strategy;
the recurring and at times acute bottlenecks in the production of a number
of key intermediate goods such as power, steel, and cement; shortages of
imported raw materials; and cumbersome administrative procedures. In the
past year, the Government has made a number of important changes in the
regulations and administration of the industrial licensing system, and in
the recent budget for 1974/75 has made several tax concessions in order to
stimulate the private sector. There are one or two promising signs that
these measures may be having some effect, but it is too early to form a
balanced overall judgment.
9.        The gross domestic savings rate has been in the region of 14%
for the past decade. While this compares favorably with other countries
having similarly low income levels, it has fallen far short of India's
resource needs. And although external assistance has been substantial in
absolute terms, in relation to national income it has been small, so that
the gross investment rate has reached as high as 17% in only a few years.
More recently, at a time of generally sluggish economic activity and also
because of a decline in foreign assistance, the gross investment rate has
been only about 14-15%.
10.       The economy has been passing through an unusually difficult
period in the past two years. On top of the stagnation of the industrial
sector, agricultural production was severely set back by the drought in
1972/73. Foodstocks have been. depleted and there have been severe food
shortages in many parts of the country. Prices have risen to very high
levels and there has been considerable political unrest. Despite the



favorable monsoon in 1973 and the consequently good autumn harvest, as well
as large imports in 1973/74, the food position has remained tight. The
situation has been greatly aggravated by the vithholding of grain from the
market for speculative and insurance reasons, reduced by the prevailing
climate of inflation and shortage, and by the growing realization that the
1974 spring harvest would fall short of earlier expectations. The crop
shortfall has been the result of acute shortages of fertilizer and of
electric power and diesel -or irrigation pumping as well as poor winiter
rains.  All these difficulLies have meant that performance in the Fourth
Plan (1969/70-1973/74) has turned out well below the targets: an aggregate
growth rate of 3% per amnum compared with the aim of 5.7%, with capacity
and production achievements in all the major sectors falling far short of
the original goals. The growth rate of 5.5% in 1973/74 represented no more
than a recovery from the negative growth the previous year.
11.       Shortfalls in agricultural production, both of food crops and
crops used for industrial raw materials, have been a prime cause of the
inflation which has beset the country for the past two years. Prices have
gone up as a direct result of the imbalance between supply and demand, and
also indirectly because of the massive budgetary outlays, and consequent
deficit financing, needed for drought relief, food subsidies, and crash
production programs. The acute shortages of many intermediate and industrial
commodities and, more recently, the surge in import prices have also contri-
buted to the inflationary situation. Inflation is now running at an annual
rate of around 25%, compared with only 4-5% a few years previously. The
Government has made several attempts to reduce the rate of inflation, so far
with little success.
12.       The domestic economic difficulties together with the recent surge
in world commodity prices have severely upset the development program. The
Fifth Plan, which was published in draft last December and was due for im-
plementation starting in 1974/75, is currently under revision, and in the
interim the Government is proceeding with a substantially scaled-down pro-
gram. Capital expenditure is being held down to a level which in real terms
is likely to be below that of last year. The thrust of the investment pro-
gram is on the key sectors whose output is in critically short supply: coal,
electric power, oil, non-ferrous metals, fertilizer, steel, and transport.
Within the tight budget, allocations to the social sectors, most particularly
education, have been cut below previous levels. In line with the Government's
aim to relieve the pervasive commodity shortages and to stimulate industrial
production, the 1974/75 budget has also made a number of tax and other con-
cessions to private industry. But the budget has also introduced additional
taxation as well as increases in rates on transport and other public serv-
ices, in order to hold down the budget deficit,
13.       Ever since the balance of payments crisis of the late 1950s, a
shortage of foreign exchange has constituted one of the most critical con-
straints on development of the economy. The recent increases in world
commodity prices have added to these problems, at a time when the economy
is singularly ill-placed to deal with them. Petroleum has become a very



- 5 -
prominent item in the import bill. In 1972/73 imports of crude oil and
petroleum products amounted to US$265 million, equivalent to 10% of merchan-
dise imports; estimates of the corresponding figures for 1973/74 are US$625
million and 18% and for 1974/75, depending on the availability of external
financing and other factors, US$1,300 and 26%. In the Draft Fifth Plan the
Goverament had already set out ambitious program of indigenous energy devel-
opmenl: in order to reduce dependence on imported oil, but these have had to
be supplemented by a variety of other measures. The short-term focus is on
reduced consumption, by increasing the prices of petroleum products and, more
important, by converting oil-burning equipment to coal wherever possible.
But there are only limited opportunities for immediately reducing petroleum
consumption, and some cutback in supplies appears inevitable. Since the
bulk of petroleum consumption is concentrated in such vital sectors as agri-
culture (as feedstock for fertilizer production, and as fuel for irrigation
pumping and mechanised farming), goods transport, and industry, with final
private consumption accounting for no more than 10% of total consumption,
reduced oil supplies are bound to depress overall economic production.
Another emphasis of short-term policy is to remove the immediate bottlenecks
on coal production and transport. For the longer term, programs are already
under way to raise the efficiency of oil utilization and to step up the pace
of development of coal-based fertilizer technology, of oil exploration, and
of exploitation of the considerable hydroelectric resources. None of these
energy adjustment measures will be easy or quick of attainment and it will
be several years before results of appreciable quantitative significance will
be realized.
14.       The increase in oil prices is only one element in a large widening
of the trade deficit. The need for large imports of food and fertilizers,
at the exceptionally high prices of the past year, and the price increases
in oil, steel, non-ferrous metals, and other vital imports increased the
import bill by 37% in 1973/74. This increase was partly offset by a 14%
increase in exports, several export items benefiting from the commodities
boom, but the estimated trade gap was about US$650 million compared with
about US$50 million the year before. The outlook for 1974/75 is bleak, as
the full effect of the deterioration in the terms of trade comes to be felt.
Even with a severe compression of food, fertilizer, and petroleum imports
and a probable decline in general maintenance imports in real terms, the
total import bill could rise by a further 40% if prices continue at their
present level. Exports promise to continue doing well, which should reduce
the impact of the enlarged import bill. Nevertheless, there is a critical
need for external assistance at a much higher level than the US$1,300 mil-
lion estimated for 1973/74, which was itself US$400 million (or 45%) higher
than the previous year. The Government secured two million tons of food aid
from the USSR last year, half of which remains to be disbursed this year,
and has negotiated credits from several oil-producing countries. The Gov-
ernment has also drawn its gold tranche and first credit tranche from the
IMF. In addition, the Consortium is discussing what action is possible to
help India overcome its difficulties, and several members have already
announced large increases in their aid programs for 1974/75.



-6-
15.       As a result of substan-.ial past borrowings, India's external public
debt (diAbursed only) stood at US$9.9 billion on March 31, 1973. Debt serv-
ice in 19O73/74 is estimated at US$700 million, equivalent to around 24% of
export receipts. This compares with a level of debt service of about US$200
million in the mid-1960s. In order to mitigate the negative effects on growth
of such a high burden of external debt and to forestall any danger of a for-
eign exchange crisis, from 1968/69 onwards the Consortium has extended debt
relief to India. In 1973/74, the most recent year in which this action was
taken, the amount of debt relief was about US$185 million. On the assumption
that India can obtain its large, new financing requirements on appropriately
soft terms, debt servLce is expected to grow more slowly over the rest of
this decade than it did in the 1960s and should be equivalent to around 20%
of export receipts by 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 41 loans and 60 development
credits to India totalling US$1,177 million and US$2,723 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$627 milliou has been
repaid, and US$959 million was still undisbursed as of April 30, 1974,
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of April 30, 1974,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$6.8 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$21.6 million, US$14.6 mil-
lion represents loans and US$7.0 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of April 30, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the
importance of industrialization for India's future development, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and also, through its sizeable assistance to development finance ins-
titutions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-
scale enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components
for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better
capacity utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and related
urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remiais highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been furt'her enhanced



-7-
in the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit and on7farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes,'and seed production Form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next year. Specia:' emphasis will be given to projects bene-
fiting small farmers and landless laborers. Lending in support of infrastruc-
ture and industrial investments will focus on energy-related projects. Re-
peater credits for power and railways have high priority in this context, and
disicussions are under way with the Government in an effort to identify and
prepare projects specifically designed to facilitate coal production and coal
transport. Lending for fertilizer projects, which has been an important fea-
ture in recent years, is expected to occupy an even more praminent place in
the future program; the use of coal-based technology will receive particular
attention.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for
readily usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time
when output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different
price situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial
raw materials and components continues to be an essential element within
the overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance
for projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
21.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as such
as possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on
concessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India is appropriate. As of March 31, 1974, the loans to India held by
the Bank totalled US$559 million, of which US$97 million reamined to be
disbursed, leaving a net amount outstanding of US$462 million.
22.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion
contributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the
Bank Group accounted for 34Z of total commitments, 13% of gross disburse-
ments, and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28%
and 42%, respectively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group
is expected to continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1973, the Bank Group
share of India's outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is
likely to account for almost 30%. Because Bank Group assistance to India
is predominantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group
will rise slowly. In 1972/73 about 13% of India's total debt service pay-
ments were to the Bank Group.

PART III - AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION IN INDIA
General
22,       Agriculture is the most important sector in India; it engages 70%
of the labor force, contributes presently about 45% of GNP, and accounts
for a major share of exports. Consequently, investments in agriculture have
been given priority, especially since the mid-1960s, and deserve continued
emphasis over the next five years.
23.       Since independence, the overall growth rate of agricultural pro-
duction has averaged about 3% per annum. This low overall rate of growth in
the agriculture sector obscures considerable variations over shorter periods
of time, between crops, and between regions. The overall rate has been very
much affected by the serious droughts in 1965 and 1966 and again in 1972.
At the same time, the success of high yielding varieties of wheat produced
increases in wheat production of about 20% p.a. between 1967 and 1971. Other
foodgrain crops, notably rice, have not enjoyed anything like the same suc-
cess, as the introduction of high yielding varieties has encountered diffi-
culties arising from local climatic and ecological conditions. The effects
of the green revolution, which primarily affected wheat, have been concen-
trated in north western India, very largely on account of the advanced state
of agriculture in that area and the availability of irrigation.
24.       Despite the progress made in many aspects of food production,
India's agriculture remains heavily dependent upon the vagaries of thte
weather. A major factor in reducing this dependence will be the expansion
of irrigation and the more effective use of existing investment in irriga-
tion facilities. The Government is also placing emphasis on thie improved
supply of inp-uts such as seeds and fertilizer, agricultural credit, anf
extension services.
Irrigation
25.       Over the first half of the twentieth century, the area under
irrigation in India increased by only about 1% p.a. to reach, s*lghtly
more than 20 million hectares in 1950/51, or about one fifth of ln6iars
cultivated land.  Out of these 20 million hectares, about half was
by major and medium irrigation works.
26.       Irrigation development has appropriately received incrersetl
attention since independence, and substantial resources were devoeet.
it throughout the four Five Year Plans.  Outlays for irrigatiorn     Lon
ment during the first tnree Plans and during the three Annual. Plan  '4-A-9
totalled Rs 26.8 billion, and the fourth Plan allocated Rs 16 billion to
irrigation. While minor irrigation increased only slightly from 6.4 tm4l
lion ha to 7.5 million ha, tele area covered by major and medium svwte-s bad
more than doubled to 21.4 million hectares compared with an estimated n1t-.
mate potential for irrigation of 57 million hectares. But of the uewv ad.di-
tional acreage of about 10 million ha, only 80% was being utilixed, *sd much
of that inefficiently.



- 9 -
27.       The Second Irrigation Commission and the National Commission on
Agriculture found that the under-utilization of irrigation potential was
attributable to the lack of integrated development in the irrigated areas,
insufficient farmer training and extension service, and lack of administrative
coordinatioh. -It has been unofficially estimated that the major part of
recently completed irrigation projects require additional investments of
between US$:'00 and US$500 per ha before they can become fully productive.
Accordingly, for the Fifth Plan period (1974-1979) various measures have
been designed to improve utilization, and a Command Area Development Depart-
ment has been set up in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to coordinate
work on a list of high priority projects including the proposed project.
28.       In view of the substantial investment that has already been made
in major irrigation works, the economic return on invest-ent which facili-
tates the most effective use of the water provided can be very high. Con-
sequently, command area development has been given high priority under the
Fifth Plani proposals, and just under 10% of public sector investment in
irrigation has been allocated for this purpose. Further funds, doubling
this allocation, will be made available from institutional sources for
credit. In addition, major institutional changes have been proposed
affecting the coordination of services in commaand areas and the administration
of credit. These proposals are incorporated in the framework of this project,
which will be the Bank Group's first project of this kind in India.
29.       Several IDA agricultural credit projects presently include,
as one component, financing of land leveling through cooperative and
commercial credit institutions. Responsibility for carrying out the
works under these projects rests with the farmers, who, with few exceptions,
have been unable to organize themselves to construct and maintain the neces-
sary works. As a result, the implementation rate of on-farm works under
these and other major irrigation projects in India has been slow. In addi-
tion, these schemes make no provision for the concurrent improvement and
expansion of the irrigation, drainage and road networks, which is essential
for the efficient use of available water. An acceleration in the rate of
implementation of on-farm works will require a transfer of responsibility
for their execution to a project authority. It will also require legisla-
tion, under which on-farm works can be associated with minor realignments
of farm boundaries and with the compulsory execution of the work.
Agriculture in Rajasthan
30.       Rajasthan is the second-largest state in India, with an area of
34 million ha; but it has one of the smaller populations, about 27 million,
of whom 80% are rural. The northwestern part of the state is arid and
drains towards the Indus River. The southeastern part is semi-arid and
drains mostly to the Chambal River and thence to the Ganges system.
31.       About 37% (13 million ha) of the state is desert and is largely
uncultivated. However, several large irrigation schemes, notably the
Rajasthan Canal Project, are opening up desert lands for cultivation, using



- 10 -
water from the upper Indus basin. About 2.1 million ha are irrigated, 55%
from dug vells, 35% from public canal systems, and 10% from tanks. Irri-
gated crops intlude cotton, wheat, paddy, sugarcane, millet, pulses, oil-
seeds, fruit, and vegetables.
32.       The Fifth Plan has been designed to achieve an overall annual growth
rate of 5% in the state domestic product, including a growth rate of 4.4%
in the agricultural sector. Public investment of Rs 6,350 million is en-
visaged, of which 40% would go to irrigation projects and a further 10% to
other agricultural projects. Major projects in the agricultural sector to
be financed under the Plan include the Chambal and Rajasthan Canal Command
Area Development Projects, and the Drought Prone Areas Program (all of which
are proposed for Bank Group assistance).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       In November 1972, a Bank Group Irrigation Reconnaissance Mission
visited India at the request of the Government of India. It identified
several command area development projects, of which two, the Chambal Command
Area Development Project (Rajasthan) and the Rajasthan Canal Command Area
Development Project, were appraised together in November 1973 after pre-
paratory work by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. A loan and project
summary is given in Annex III. A report entitled "Appraisal of Chambal
Command Area Development Project (Rajasthan)" Report No. 430-IN dated
May 29, 1974, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations of this project were held in Washington in May 1974. The Bor-
rower was represented by Mr. G. Veukataramena, Deputy Secretary, Ministry
of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, and by Mr. Hit Prakash, Deputy
Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture. The Government of Rajasthan was repre-
sented by Mr. S.L. Ihurana, Chief Secretary, Mr. V.C. Pande, Secretary, Water
Utilization and Command Area Development Department, and Mr. Hari Siagh
Chowdhry, Chairman, Rajasthan Canal Board.  The Agricultural Refinance Cor-
poration was represented by Nr. M.A. Chidembaram, Managing Director.
The Project
34.       The proposed project is the development of the command area of
the existing Chambal Irrigation Project in Rajasthan. The major works of
the Chambal Irrigation Project were essentially completed in 1960. These
works include a reservoir and a canal system, designed to serve an irrigable
area of 229,000 hectares in the Kota and Bundi districts of Rajasthan, and
a similar area in the neighboring State of Madhya Pradesh. -About 60,000
farm families live in the project area. The average farm size is about four
hectares and the median size two hectares. About 55% of the farmers in the
project area are within the lowest 40% on India's national income scale.
The present cropping intensity in the project area is 87%, with only 22%
occurring in the short wet season. The principal wet season crops are paddy
and sorghum, while whest is grown in the dry season, partly on stored soil

moisture. The other major crops are sugarcane, oilseeds and pulses. Agri-
cultural production in the project area has not met earlier expectations due
to a lack of drainage and on-farm development, inadequate roads, unsatis-
factory maintenance, and ineffective supporting services.
35.       The proposed project would be the first step in a program to
correct these deficiencies and would include: drainage over 167,000 hectares;
lining of 14 kilometers of canal, where seepage is excessive; increasing the
capacity of 850 kilometers of canals and building or improving 160 control
structures and about 4,000 tertiary outlets; on-farm development over 50,000
hectares, including irrigation, drainage ditches, and access to individual
farms, boundary realignment and land shaping; construction or improvement of
250 kilometers of roads; afforestat:ion and erosion control on 1,000 hectares;
provision of 15,000 nutrient tons cf fertilizer; the strengthening of agri-
cultural extension, research, and cooperatives; construction of miscellaneous
small works and the purchase of equipment for project administration, sup-
porting services, and force accounts portion of the works. The project in-
cludes special studies of hydrology, reservoir system operation, water use,
drainage design, survey and construction methods for on-farm development, and
aquatic weed control. A feasibility study for a second phase project in the
Chambal area would also be undertaken.
Project Implementation
36.       The proposed project is expected to serve as a prototype in India
for command area development. Consequently, particular care has been given
to the institutional and organizational aspects of the implementation. To
ensure full cooperation between all the departments concerned with command
area development, the Government of Rajasthan (GOR) has set up a Command
Area Development and Water Utilization Department at state level and is es-
tablishing a Chambal Command Area Authority (CAM). The CM would be responsi-
ble for water utilization and integrated area development in the irrigation
command, including modernization of the distribution system, provision of
drainage, and maintenance and operation of bosh the distribution and the
drainage systems. It would be in charge of implementing and managing the
project. Its Board would be headed by an Area Development Commissioner, who
would also be the CAA's administrator. The CAA would have four departments:
irrigation and land development, agriculture, revenue, and cooperatives.
The Commissioner would have authority to coordinate all project related
activities. The establishment of the CAA, with organization, board member-
ship and powers satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effective-
ness for the proposed loan. 1/
37.       On-farm development within the project area would be compulsory
to ensure efficient project execution and optimal use of the available land
and irrigation facilities. To assist in this objective, the Rajasthan Land
Development Corporation (RLDC) would be set up as a statutory corporation
by GOR with an authorized share capital of Rs 100 million and a 50% equity
participation by the Government of India (GOI). Its Board of Directors
would be chaired by the Secretary of the Command Area Development and
Water Utilization Department and would comprise representatives of GOI and
1/ See Section 6.01(e) of the draft Loan Agreement.



- 12 -
the CAA. RLDC's establishment, with capitalization, board membership and
powers satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness for
the proposed lean. 1/ RLDC's functions would be to act as a financial
intermediary for on-farm development in the State. It would channel all
land development funds to the CAA in line with the progress of on-farm
works. RLDC would prepare applications for land development loans on behalf
of those farmers who - because of their credit standing - are eligible for
such loans from the Rajasthan State Coo?erative Land Development Bank (LDB)
or from commercial banks. Other farmers would receive special loans from
RLDC, using GOI funds. Subsidies would be available for several categories
of disadvantaged farmers under the existing GOI program for small farmer
development.
38.       The extension service in the project area would be reorganized
and would make use of progressive farmers as part-time extension workers.
Provision has been made in the project for technical assistance and in-
service training, including the engaging of a land development expert. A
special group will be created to monitor the progress of the project. GOI
is also considering the formation of a national unit to interpret satellite
photography which could assist in monitoring the reduction of salinity and
waterlogging.
39.       On-farm development, in particular land shaping, would disturb
the soil profile and result in a temporary loss of fertility. Under the
present conditions of fertilizer shortage, GOI allocations are likely to
fall short of requirements. In order to ensure the availability of fer-
tilizer needed to restore the fertility of disturbed soil, the project
provides for the import of 15,000 nutrient tons of fertilizer which would
supply the difference between present allocations and recommended levels
over a three-year period. Proposed arrangements for the distribution of this
fertilizer to the farmers affected by land development are satisfactory.
Project Costs and Financing
40.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$91.5 million equiv-
alent, including US$35.0 million in foreign exchange. The principal cost
components net of contingencies are irrigation and drainage works, road
construction and afforestation (US$22.8 million), on-farm development
($10.5 million), fertilizer (US$6.4 million), and project administration
including the cost of training and technical assistance (US$12.3 million).
The balance is made up by physical and price contingencies (US$28.5 mil-
lion), and interest during construction (US$11 million).
41.       The proposed loan would cover 57% of total project cost.   COR
would finance 30%, GOI 4%, and the Government of Madhya Pradesh, which will
derive some benefits from the project, 6% of the total cost. The balance
would be contributed by the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) and by
1/ See Section 6.01(d) of the draft Loan Agreement.



- 13 -
the participating commercial banks and LDB. Of the proceeds of the loan,
GOI would use US$6.1 million for the procurement of fertilizer and US$11.0
million for interest during construction, US$28.4 million would be on-lent
by the Borrower to GOR on the normal terms on which development funds are
being provided to state governments by the center. The remaining US$6.5
million would be passed on to ARC with 9 and 15 years maturity at 6.25% and
6.75% anmual interest respectively. 1/ ARC in turn would refinance about 80%
of the land development loans extended to farmers by participating commercial
banks and LDB at not less than 7%, repayable in accordance with the terms of
the loans to farmers.  Farmers would repay a commercial bank or LDB loan
over a period of not more than 15 years, including not more than two years
of grace, with interest at the rate of not less than 9-1/2%. Farm loans
would be secured by mortgages. The exchange risk associated with the pro-
posed Bank loan would be borne by the Borrower.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be used to finance:   equip-
ment and materials (US$10.5 million), civil works, including on-farm devel-
opment (US$26.6 million), technical assistance (US$0.1 million), interest
during construction (US$11 million), and contingencies (US$3.8 million).
43.       The estimated cost of vehicles and equipment for project manage-
ment, force account construction and for hire to contractors, is US$8.0 mil-
lion. Out of this total, US$5.4 million would be subject to international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference
limited to 15% of the cif price of imported goods, or the prevailing customs
duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of
bids. About US$1.0 million worth of equipment and vehicles, consisting of
categories of items costing less than US$100,000 each, which for reasons of
efficiency are not suitable for international tendering, would be purchased
through normal GOR procurement procedures, which are satisfactory. The
balance of US$1.6 million would be reserved for local procurement and would
not be eligible for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the Loan. Fertil-
izer (US$6.4 million, 'includin& local handling and transportation) would be
procured by the Government of India for reasons of economy and efficiency
as part of the regular bulk purchases in the world market. Fertilizer
procurement by GOI is based on international competition. However, because
of the tight supply situation in the world market and the limited number
of suppliers, formal advertisement would not lead to an adequate response.
Instead, the Government seeks price quotations from potential suppliers
followed by price negotiations to obtain the lowest price. This procedure
is in accordance with international practice now common in the fertilizer
trade and would be acceptable to the Bank, provided at least three quotations
are invited.
1/ This amount of US$6.5 million on-lent to ARC beomes part of the overall
funding provided to ARC by GOI at the terms mentioned in the text.
Consequently, it cannot be defined which of the terms mentioned apply
to the funds stemming from the proposed loan.



- 14 -
44.       The civil works included in the project are individually small,
scattered over the entire project area, and scheduled for construction over
a five-year period. Much of the construction work and on-farm development
would be carried out intermittently as determined by seasonal weather con-
ditions and by the ongoing agricultural activities in the project area. In
these circumstances it would not be feasible or economic to combine any of
the categories of civil works into contracts sufficiently large to attract
international competition. It. is therefore proposed that the civil works
be carried out by local contractors, which are mostly small labor contractors,
following local tendering, or, where the use of machinery is required, through
force account.
45.       The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost
of imported equipment or against the ex-factory price of equipment manufactured
locally, and at the rate of 70% for imported equipment procured locally. Dis-
bursements for civil works and on-farm development expenditures would be on a
percentage basis. Loan disbursements for technical assistance would cover
the full cost of internationally recruited consultants. Disbursements for
fertilizer would be made against c.i.f. cost. GOI intends to procure fertil-
izer for the Project as part of its bulk import orders to meet national
requirements. GOI plans to purchase the fertilizer financed from the loan in
the first year of Project implementation. Since distribution of this quantity
of fertilizer will be made by GOI to Rajasthan and by Rajasthan to Project
farmers only over the period of the Project, most of the fertilizer would
initially be devoted to India's general requirements, but the GOI would be
obligated to replace it in later years in order to meet the specific Project
needs. These arrangements would in effect introduce a small program loan ele-
ment into this operation, but this is considered to be justified by India's acute
need for foreign exchange for fertilizer imports following the increase in the
oil price last fall (see paragraph 14 above). As indicated in paragraph 39,
proposed arrangements for distribution of this fertilizer are satisfactory.
The loan would be fully disbursed by June 30, 1981, about one year after
Project completion.
Benefits and Economic Justification
46.       The average cropping intensity in the project area would rise
from 87% at present to 111% at full development. In the areas receiving
on-farm development, the ultimate cropping intensity would be 150%, of
which 135% would be irrigated. The production of foodgrain would increase
from 140,000 tons at present to 350,000 tons at full development. Market
prospects for all the crops are good. Processing, storage, and marketing
facilities are generally satisfactory for the present levels of production
and GOR has investment plans which should be adequate to meet requirements
at full project development.
47.       Farm incomes would increase from an average of Rs 1,800 to between
Rs 2,600 and Rs 10,000, depending on farm location and size, over an eight-
year period. Irrigation and drainage charges would be raised to cover the
full cost of operating and maintaining the project works. These charges,
including the service of farm credit, would still leave the farmer with a
substantial increase in net income to provide adequate incentives for



- 15 -
participating in the project. For capital cost, a committee to be estub-
lished by GOR would recommend appropriate recovery arrangements, also taking
into account the farmer's incentive and capacity to pay. 1/
48.       The project would provide the equivalent of 20,000 additional
jobs over the next decade and would lead to an increase in the net value
of production from the project area of Rs 102 million (US$13 million) per
year at full development in eight years' time. The economic rate of return
on the project investment is estimated at 19% assuming a 30-year life for
the project, shadow prices for farm labor at about 75% of the wage for hired
labor in peak periods, and treating as sunk cost the investment in the exist-
ing Chambal irrigation scheme. The rate of return is very sensitive to var-
iations in the pace of agricultural development, a factor which the provi-
sion of improved extension services is designed to overcome.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between India and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and the State of Rajasthan, the draft
ARC Agreement between the Bank and the Agriculture Refinance Corporation,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(III) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Points of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 37 and
47. The Loan Agreement specifies among additional conditions of effective-
ness that a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government of India and
the Agricultural Refinance Corporation shall have been executed and ratified,
that the Command Area Authority for the Project has been established by the
Government of Rajasthan, and that the Rajasthan Land Development Corporation
has been established (see Section 6.01(a), (d) and (e)).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The closing date of December 31,

processing plant is in progress, and tenders for a new plant are under
preparation. Large scale land-leveling demonstrations have stimulated
demand for such work and orders are to be placed shortly by contractors
for imported machinery.
Cr No. 176   Kadana Irrigation;  US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will ,inance in part the construction of Kadana Dam on
the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the darm. The project
also includes field channel construction, land l1velling, drainage works and roads
and a program to support agricultural developmen;. The project will be completed
about two years behind schedule because of delays on dam construction. The agri-
cultural components of the project are also behind schedule. Some of the delays
in implementation have occurred at the start of the project, before major invest-
ments have been made. These will not affect the economic justification of the
project. Further delays have occurred as a result of material shortages in the
present construction season, and the need for additional spillway construction.
If material shortages are not relieved and the additional spillway construction
is not started forthwith, the resulting delays could affect the economic justi-
fication of the project.
Cr No. 191   Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit

The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment only,
all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long and medium-term
credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments
as imported tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling.   Disbursement
of these credits started slowly.   So far as the minor irrigation components
were concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional require-
ments, in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and
lending terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing
groundwater availability.   These constraints have now been overcome and dis-
bursements are accelerating, reflecting high demand for minor irrigation
investments spurred by the experience of the   1972   drought,   Tractor pro-
curement has been delayed following the substantial change in both the supply
and demand situations since the projects were originally appraised.    The
credits have recently been amended to permit the financing of irndigenously
manufactured tractors as well as imported tractors and to reallocate some
funds earmarked for tractors to minor irrigation components.
Cr No 230 Aro Aviation;    US$6.0 million credit of Januar 28, 1971;
Closing Date~: December 31, 1974.
The project is designed to improve facilities for aerial spraying
of pesticides as part of India's plant protection program.    So far no dis-
bursements have taken place.   There were initially difficulties over air-
craft procurement specifications which have     been resolved.    More recentl.y,
however, issues have arisen concerning the training program for agricultural
pilots and maintenance engineers, the implementation of which is a prerequisite
for disbursing against importation of aircraft.    These difficulties are under
discussion with G0I.
Cr No. 267   Wheat Storage;  US$5.0 million credit of Augst 23, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons caDacity) and 10
silos (200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study. Warehouse
construction is about 75 percent complete and preparations for silo construction
are progressing. The Government Food Ministry intends to select a local research
institute in the near future to conduct the study.
Cr No. 456   Himachal Pradesh Apples Processing and Marketing;   US$13 million
credit of January 22, 974i C osing Date:    December 3     97
This project has been designed to promote the development of apple
production in Himachal Pradesh and comprises, roads, cold storage, juice
processing, and marketing. The conditions of effectiveness have to be ful-
filled by July 23, 1974.

Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Both projects are continuations of Telecommunications III. Tele-
communications IV has beuzn designed to support the telecommunications expan-
sion program over the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement
action for delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.
Production problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 inonths. Hfowever, production has now picked up and disbursement, have
accelerated. Full disbursement is expected by the closing date of December
1974. Teleconmmunications V was declared effective on July 30., 1973.
Cr No. 242   Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
Cr No. 377   Power Transmission III Project;  US$85.O million credit of May 9,
15973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project financed
by Loan 416-IN, has been designed to assist in financing the purchase of equip-
ment and m-aterials required to develop a power transmission programn in nine
States under the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Initial delays occurred because of
problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international
bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but contract
awards have now been conmpleted. Disbursements started in June 1973 and should
be completed by the closing date of September 30, 1975. Power Transmission
III became effective on October 10, 1973.
Cr No. 268   Pochampad Irrigation; US$9.0 million credit of AuLst L23,
1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a conicrete-
lined main carnal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with
construction and Credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acuate
shortage of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal
excavation, has since hampered progress. As a result, construtction of t'ht
main canals is now likely to fall more than one year behind schedu:Le.
Land development is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind umter
availability in the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of *he
credit operation for land development and has requested IDA finanici 3 for a
Command Area Development Project (GAD), to be inmlemented by a Central Authority
for all fanrers in need of land development. The project will include tthe
setting up of a well-coordinated technical and administrative oralxizatioz
backed by suitable legal measures0 Project preparation is underway and ppraisal

US$1.0 million, not suitable for international
tendering, would be procured through nornal
GOR procurement procedures. The balance of
US$1.6 million would be reserved for local
procurement and would not be financed from
the loan. Civil works for irrigation valued
at US$10.2 million, for drainage valued at
US$6.2 million, and for on-farm development
valued at US$10.5 million would be contracted
locally or executed by force account, as none
of the works, mainly because of their nature
and because of the conditions in the project
area, could be grouped into contracts large
enough to be of interest to foreign contractors.
Fertilizer (US$6.4 million) would be procured
in bulk by the India Tender Board through
international shopping, which includes seeking
price quotations from at least three possible
suppliers, followed by negotiations with bidders
to obtain the lowest possible price.
Consultants and
Technical Assistance:       A land development expert would be recruited for
a period of two years to advise on the planning,
design and construction of on-farm development.
Rate of Return:               19% economic rate of return.
