I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Although telecommunications services in Ethiopia have improved
over the years, partly as a result of World Bank involvement, they are
still very inadequate. The scarcity and low quality of the services
outside the biggest cities and the quasi-absence of installations in most
of the vast areas designated for special agricultural and rural development
efforts create big problems for the administration of the areas and for
development and transportation enterprises. Further efficiency
improvements and further investments in the sector are required, especially
in view of its prime importance for improved production, transportation,
distribution and marketing of agricultural and industrial goods; this
importance is emphasized by the large geographic size of Ethiopia's
economy.
1.02      The proposed sixth telecommunications project aims at upgrading
the quality of public telecommunications services in Ethiopia; at expanding
the international, long distance and rural networks and augmenting their
traffic handling capacity; and at increasing the very low telephone density
in the country. The project will also facilitate increasing the efficiency
of the beneficiary's administration and operations and making its customer
relations more businesslike.
1.03      The project is identical with the Ethiopian Telecommunications
Authority's (ETA) 1984-88 investment program which has been approved by the
Government. The Government assigned a high priority to the project in its
development plan and requested an IDA credit to support the foreign
exchange costs of the project. The total cost of the project is about
US$151.8 million, of which US$103.4 million is in foreign currency. The
proposed IDA credit would cover US$40.0 million, and bilateral and
commercial co-financing the remainder of the foreign currency costs. Cash
generated by the beneficiary's operations will cover all local project
costs, US$48.4 million equivalent. The beneficiary is expected to remit to
the Government about US$107 million during the project implementation
period (1984-88), in corporate profits tax, customs duties on the import of
project equipment and on interest on funds relent to it by the Government.
1.04      The rate of return on ETA's revalued net fixed assets in opera-
tion is projected to vary during the 1984-88 project period between 11 and
13%. The internal financial rate of return on project investments is
estimated at 13% while the economic rate of return is estimated to be a
minimum of 34%.
1.05      Beginning in 1951, the Bank has made four loans and two credits
for Ethiopian telecommunications. The two IDA credits supported the fifth
project, the implementation of which was significantly delayed due to the
civil strifes between 1974 and 1980. The composition of the proposed sixth

project and the project agreements and covenants take into account the
beneficiary's current institutional situation and needed improvements, and
the progress achieved in the implementation of the fourth and fifth
projects.
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background and Organization
2.01       Public telecommunications services in Ethiopia are provided by
the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority (ETA) which is a share company,
fully owned by the Government and established by proclamation. The
Government nominates ETA's Board of Directors; the Minister of Transport
and Communications (MOTC) is ex-officio chairman of the Board.  Authorized
share capital is Br 40 million. In June 1982, the retained earnings were
about Br 81 million and the net value of ETA's installations was about
Br 142 million.
2.02       The ETA:  (a) plans and coordinates all civil communications
within the country and coordinates with military authorities for their
facilities; (b) issues licenses to other users; and (c) represents Ethiopia
in its dealings with the International Telecoinmunication Union (ITU),
Geneva, Switzerland and other international telecommunications
organizations.
2.03       The ETA handles all aspects of the provision of and charging for
public telecommunications services1/ (except broadcasting services)2/ to
all categories of clients. Thus, it provides national and international
telephone, telegraph and telex, as well as various special services, and it
also leases circuits for specific non-public usage. No telecommunications
manufacturing industry of any significance exists in the country.
B. Access to Service
2.04       As of June 30, 1982 Ethiopia's telephone density was 0.25 DELs
per 100 population. This was below the 0.42 average for developing
countries in Africa, below neighboring Kenya (0.5), but roughly the same as
Sudan (0.24) and Somalia (0.20). Annex 1 sets out international telephone
statistics as of January 1, 1981. Existing telephone service in Ethiopia
is concentrated in Addis Ababa, where the telephone density was as of
June 30, 1982, 3.08 DELs per 100 population, and in the capital towns of
1/ According to its charter (Annex 2), one of the ETA's purposes is "to
rehabilitate, extend, repair and maintain the telecommunications
facilities of Ethiopia and to engage in the business of
telecommunications for profit."
2/ Radio broadcasting and television is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Information and National Guidance, which obtains licence for its
transmissions from ETA.

the other 13 administrative regions where it was at an average of 2.74 per
100 population. Telephone density in the rest of the country is a low 0.05
DELs per 100 population (Annex 3). As of June 30, 1982 there were 76,270
main telephone lines in Ethiopia distributed as follows:

2.05      For administrative purposes, Ethiopia is divided into 14 regions,
102 provinces and 589 districts. All capital towns of the 14 regions, 101
of the provincial main centers, and 285 of the district centers are
provided with at least some telephone service. Below the district centers,
service is extended to only 147 other towns. The capital towns of the
regions, with the exception of only three, are linked with microwave or UHF
circuits, and seven of these towns have automatic telephone services with
STD facilities.
2.06      Thirty-nine percent of the telephone subscribers in Ethiopia are
estimated to be business firms or government and public service agencies.
As can be seen in the following table, the proportion of business and
government subscribers is higher in the smaller towns. It is believed,
however, that a high proportion of the telephones listed as residential are
in fact used largely for business purposes.

2.07      To provide some indication of the use to which telephones are put
in the few smaller towns in Ethiopia which have some access to service,
subscribers in a sample of four small manual exchange service towns were
polled and categorized by primary economic activity. A~s the following
table shows 69% of all subscribers in these towns were directly
identifiable as being business, government, or public serv4.ce
establishments.

2.08      In areas of the country in which telephone service currently
exists, applications for telephone connections are registered on an inquiry
form, which is used by planners to ascertain the availability of subscriber
lines. If lines are available the applicants finalize subscription
agreements after which the connections are installed. When there are
shortages in the subscriber cable network, or in exchange capacity, the
applicants are entered on a waiting list which is used as a basis for
future connections as and when lines are made available. As of June 30,
1982 the total waiting list in Ethiopia contained about 23,000 applicants.
Addis Ababa accounts for about 14,000 of these with the rest being
scattered in those of the remaining towns in the country that currently
have at least some access to switched service (in other towns applications
are not recorded).

C. Telephone Service Usage
2.09      In automatic exchange areas, traffic generated by business and
government subscribers, which account for ornly 35% of the automatic
exchange lines, makes up 63% of total traffic. Since business, government
and residential connections used for business purposes generate most of the
traffic during the peak calling hours, they are, in fact, the primary
determinants of system capacity costs. The importance of large business
and government users is also illustrated by the fact that over 60% of ETA's
metered telephone revenue is generated by identified business and
government subscriber lines, and 74% of ETA's revenue is generated by only
20% of the lines. Annex 4 sets out the revenue distribution. The average
revenue per main telephone line in Ethiopia in 1982 was US$368, which is
about the world average. The annual revenue per telephone is the highest
in Assab, the main port town on the Red Sea coast, followed by Dire Dawa, a
commercial and industrial center in the eastern part of the country (Map
IBRD 17108).
2.10      In a recent sample, telephone subscribers and public coin box and
call office users from the three medium size towns of Nazret  Awasa! and
Shashemane were given a list of reasons for using telephones5/  and asked
to choose the most frequent reasons for their telephone contact.  As can be
seen from the table below, urgent business ranked first, soliciting for
business ranked second, and placing or receiving orders ranked third.
3/ The list was originally derived from a sample of telephone subscribers
and users in Kenya.

2.11      The pattern of long distance traffic in Ethiopia reflects the
fact that Addis Ababa has the preponderance of telephone connections and is
the center of government. Of the operator assisted interurban calls
throughout the country over 30 are directed to Addis Ababa. It is
estimated that a much higher proportion of automatic interurban calls
terminate in Addis Ababa. The following table which shows the results of a
sample of interurban calls made or received in the small manual exchange
town of Zway illustrates three typical characteristics of long distance
usage outside of the main centers: residential telephones have the lowest
interurban calling rates; small town public call offices are intensively
used by the general population; and a very high proportion of calls are
ultimately cancelled mostly because of long waiting times for booked calls

D. Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
2.12      The telephone service provided in Addis Ababa and the 15 other
cities with automatic exchanges is inadequate giving the large unsatisfied
traffic demand and excess demand for the connection of new lines at most of
these places (see Section E). The automatic exchange installations in
these 16 cities allow 24-hour subscriber dialed local and interurban
service.
2.13      Depending on several factors including the number of subscribers
connected and the amount of traffic revenue produced, service at the 370
manually operated telephone exchanges in other towns is available on either
a 24 hour, 12 hour, or office hours only (0800-1200 and 1300-1600) basis.
Local service quality is in general adequate. However, at practically all
of the places with manual exchanges there is a large unsatisfied demand for
both additional connections and for more interurban circuits.
2.14      Reliable statistics on the time delay in establishing operator
assisted long distance calls are available from 25 samples taken at the
Addis Ababa exchange during the period June through November 1982. The



- 9 -
following figures are averages for all samples and for all circuits (faulty
circuits, 16% in average, are eliminated from the statistics):
at 1030 hours              84 minutes delay
at 1430 hours              37 minutes delay
at 2000 hours               8 minutes delay
No apparent trend was noticed during the six-month study period. While
some routes had no delay (about 20% of the routes at 10.30, 40% at 14.30
and 70% at 20.00), others showed delays from several hours to more than a
day. The percent of faulty circuits is very high.
2.15      During the period July through December 1982 the average rate of
cancellations of operator-assisted long-distance calls booked at the Addis
Ababa interurban exchange was 32% of the total number booked. The figure
varied only slightly from month to month. The following reasons for the
cancellations were noted:
(a) Wrong booking or called subscriber not
available when communication established                  8.4%
(b) Circuits out of order and delay time for
restoration long or not known                             9.2%
(c) Long delay, due to circuit congestion, and
similar reasons                                         14.3%
Total                                           31.9%
An unquantified portion of the cancellations in (a) should appropriately be
referred to (c) as with very long waiting times (para 2.19) it is to be
expected that, when the call is finally established, the called party will
in many cases not be available. Some samples were also prepared on booking
cancellations at provincial offices. Although these samples are rather
sporadic, the available figures are similar to the Addis Ababa ones.
Interviews conducted by the IDA appraisal mission showed that waiting times
from several hours to more than a day are common, especially at smaller
offices not directly connected to a regional switching center. Many
potential telephone users, for example bus and truck drivers and other
passers-by, cannot accept such delays and simply do without the calls.
Thus the official statistics grossly underestimate the demand for
long-distance calls.
2.16      For subscriber dialed communications, samples of test calls at
various switching offices in Addis Ababa during January and February 1983,
gave the following call completion rates:



- 10 -
local call, busy hour                 65% to 85%
local call, slack hour                80% to 100 %
long-distance call, busy hour         50%
long-distance call, slack hour        65%
This relatively poor service quality is in the first hand caused by a large
excess demand, which congests the circuits and prevents call completion due
to insufficient capacity of the present installations. Some operational
rearrangements will be made that will give minor improvements, but a
significant change of the situation can only be expected after additional
investments, planned within the sixth program.
2.17      As in most other countries, the volume of telegraph service is
stabilizing, while telex traffic is increasing. In Ethiopia, the quality
and reliability of both these services is adequate. Telegraph service is
available at about 460 places. However, due to lack of capital for
investments the telex service outside of Addis Ababa is very limited. A
list of basic data for ETA's existing installations and services is at
Annex 5.
E. Demand for Service
2.18      The Government is devoting increasing efforts to the country's
economic progress, and in line with this development the following types of
demand for telecommunications services are growing:
(a)  demand for new services, data transmission in particular;
(b)  demand for expansion of present services over the whole
country, especially to unserved administrative centers
and other economically important centers;
(c) demand for shorter waiting times for long distance
communications; and demand for new subscriber
connections.
In preparation for its sixth program, ETA ana:Lyzed the various kinds of
demand for services, but the situation has changed so rapidly since 1980
that the analyses have had to be updated and the assumptions changed; this
is particularly true for the growth in demand for improved and expanded
facilities for long-distance telephone traffic. Past traffic growth rates
are shown below (see also Annex 7):

a/ 1966-1972
Source: ETA
2.19      The recent upturn in telephone traffic reflect both increased
national economic activity and the ETA's increased ability to satisfy in
part the suppressed demand at the completion of the fifth project, by
bringing into service new local and toll exchanges, microwave links, and in
late 1979, an earth station for international communications via
satellite. The temporary decline in the growth of telex traffic (1972-80)
is normal in this situation, in which a drastically improved telephone
service takes over a portion of the potential telex traffic. The fact that
a high unsatisfied demand for telephone communications exists, is indicated
by, among other factors, the following:
(a) the long delay in the establishment of operator-assisted
calls (para 2.14);
(b) the high cancellation rate of such calls (para 2.15); and
(c) the low rate of completion of subscriber dialed calls
(para 2.16).
2.20      The official waiting list for connection of new subscribers
contained about 23,000 applicants as at June 30, 1982. About 60% of the
listed applicants are in the Addis Ababa area. In addition there is a
hidden demand for new lines, which ETA estimates to have been at least
14,000 lines for the whole country on June 30, 1982. This hidden demand
becomes real demand as installation work proceeds and potential subscribers
perceive an opportunity of getting connected without exorbitant waiting
time. The hidden demand is made up of (a) potential customers which are
discouraged from registering due to the uncertainty about the length of the
waiting time; (b) potential customers at places where no switching service
exists, as ETA does not register applicants at such places; and
(c) potential customers at places where the service (for example the
possibility of long distance communications) is poor. ETA has
conservatively estimated that the total demand for telephone connections
will grow by 8.4% per year and that the number of connected lines (DELs)
can be increased by about 9% per year, taking into account the programmed



- 12 -
network expansions and ETA's resources. The forecast development of demand
satisfaction is given at Annex 6.
F. Sector Goals
2.21      In the country's development objectives, the telecommunications
sector has been assigned two objectives, namely:
(a) to support national economic development by providing
required services to agriculture, industry, trade,
tourism, and other sectors; and
(b) to assist in implementing national social goals,
particularly in the fields of health and education.
2.22      While the annual growth target for most parts of the economy is
still being discussed, the management of some enterprises providing
physical infrastructure, among them the telecommunications services, have,
on instruction from the Government, been planning for an annual growth rate
of 10%. This higher growth rate for the telecommunications sector was
fixed to enable a rapid expansion of the network over the whole national
territory, so that all important administrative centers in the country and
important centers for agricultural and industrial development could
communicate with Addis Ababa and with regional and district centers.
2.23      To meet the above national objectives, and also the corporate
goals stated in its charter (Annex 2), ETA has formulated a series of
service objectives to which the Government has consented. They are in
summary as follows:
(a) to raise service quality to an acceptable level in
accordance with ITU recommendations and to maintain it at
that level;
(b) to provide adequate services between Ethiopia and other
countries, and to take part in the international work on
standardization of equipment data and performance and on
agreements for operation of the installations;
(c) to improve the methods of demand forecasting and of
estimating the technical, operational, financial and
economic viability of planned facilities;
(d) to ensure that revenues cover operating expenditures and
provide a reasonable contribution to the financing of new
investments;
(e) to improve the means of running ETA as a forward looking
business organization, based on sound technical judgement
and on responsiveness to clients' demand and to policy
directives; and
(f) to develop staff rel.ations and staff attitudes and to
provide adequate staff training.



- 13 -
2.24      These service objectives have in turn been translated into
specific objectives for the ETA's sixth development program. They are the
following:
(a) to overhaul and upgrade existing plant as needed for
adequate service level and optimum usefulness;
(b) to expand the national network with particular emphasis
on traffic handling capacity and on support of rural
development;
(c) to improve international links;
(d) to automatize the services at, and between, all 14
regional capitals and about 10 of the economically most
important of the other cities;
(e) to use modern technology in its new installations;
(f) to draw the technical and cost advantages of
international competitive bidding in its procurement;
(g) to expand the application of its in-house computer for
management and administration;
(h) to further development and training of staff, with
emphasis on existing staff; and
(i) to institutionalize measures for service grade
improvements and for studies to evaluate cost-saving
features.
2.25      For implementation of the above objectives, ETA proposes to carry
out a FY84-88 development program which, as indicated in the table below,
is larger than what was achieved under previous plans. Bank staff consider
this program feasible and appropriate in context of government development
priorities (para 2.21).

G. Sector Constraints
2.27      The most important constraints for sector development have been
consequences of the revolution in 1974, among which the following could be
noted:



- 15 -
(a) changed priorities and, during the initial years,
uncertainty as to how specific sector objectives could be
made commensurate with national objectives;
(b) a loss for the ETA of a large portion of senior and
highly qualified staff; and
(c) a decline in traffic or in traffic growth during the
years 1975-1978 (Annex 8).
A further constraint, which is still prevailing, is the country's general
shortage of foreign exchange. This has very much limited the procurement
of equipment and material, necessary for expansion and maintenance.
Ethiopia has no telecommunications manufacturing industry and it must rely
on imports for its expansion program as well as for spare parts, etc., to
maintain the serviceability of installations in operation.
2.28      Thanks to a comprehensive training program throughout the years,
since ETA's establishment in 1952, and to an autonomous organizational
set-up and good staff policy, much of the staff difficulties ETA has been
facing since the revolution are being overcome. However, it still needs
specialist assistance for its training center and consultancy services for
efficiency improvements in maintenance of installations and in subscriber
relations. ETA also needs assistance to make its management information
system more systematic and more useful as a management tool. These various
items of assistance required are included in the proposed project, apart
from some of the training, which is provided as a grant from UNDP
(para 4.12).
H. IDA's Role
2.29      When the Bank appraised the first telecommunications loan for
Ethiopia in 1951, no suitable institution existed and there were no
sufficiently experienced nationals to set one up and run it effectively.
Under an informal agreement, the Swedish telecommunications administration
made available some of its staff to ETA4/. The management posts,
initially all occupied by the Swedes, were gradually transferred to
Ethiopians who had shown steadily growing skill and ability; similar
progress took place in a number of the higher technical positions. When
the second loan was appraised in 1962, there were only 12 Swedes in a total
ETA staff of about 1,700; of these 12 only 2 occupied top administrative
positions (the General Manager and the Chief of the Technical Division).
Only one Swede remained in 1969, and none in 1976. The sucessful
institutional development was related to a combination of several
interdependent factors, four of which played key roles: (i) the agreement
between the Government and the Bank to set up ETA from the start as a
sufficiently autonomous organization; (ii) the establishment of an
effective and long lasting (even if informal) working relationship with the
4/ The name of the institution has changed from the Imperial
Board of Ethiopia (BTE), to Telecommunications Service
of Ethiopia (TSE) to ETA. The acronym ETA is used
throughout this report to denote the institution.



- 16 -
Swedish telecommunications administration, and the caliber of the personnel
thus made available to ETA; (iii) the availability of a number of good high
school graduates for recruitment, in spite of the modest overall
educational situation of the country; and (iv) the early establishment of
an effective national telecommunications training organization and program
supplemented by foreign training, higher education through national and
foreign universities, and rapid promotion within ETA. However, over the
last decade, ETA has had to face a number of new problems resulting from
changes of government and the associated reorientation of the country's
economy and administration. Some of those problems affected ETA's
operations, but, due to the solid institution which had been established
over the years, ETA continued to function well. Paras 2.30-2.34 summarize
the main achievement of each of the five Bank/IDA supported
telecommunications projects in Ethiopia; Annex 9 lists all previous loans
and credits to Ethiopia; and para 2.35 outlines the role of IDA during the
sixth project period.
2.30      The first loan (Ln 42-ET) of US$1.5 million was signed in
February 1951 and declared effective in 1954. The Borrower was the
Government and the loan covered the foreign exchange portion of the first
project (1954-1956). The local cost was financed by Government
appropriations and by funds generated In the operations. The project made
significant achievements, such as:
- the establishment of an efficient telecommunications entity,
with full responsibility for investments and operations and
with autonomy in financial matters, staff matters and rate
setting;
- the establishment (with UN assistance) of a permanent,
comprehensive and efficient training institution;
- the rehabilitation of an inadequate and dilapidated network
and the creation of a basis for future service improvement
and;
- the creation of an awareness among the clients, private and
Government, of the commercial nature of ETA's operations.
2.31      The second loan (LN 314-ET) of US$2.9 million was extended to ETA
with the Government as guarantor. It was signed in May 1962 and declared
effective in December 1962. It financed the foreign exchange cost of the
second project, (1961-1965). The main achievements were:
- improvements in the organization and the administration of the
ETA, particularly in the establishment of a firm program for
the phasing out of expatriate staff and in the regulations for
staff and for procurement. The latter gave
ETA the advantage of lower equipment prices than those
offered in many other African countries;



- 17 -
- an emerging modern telecommunications network, by
which ETA was able to provide new and improved services; and
- improved ETA/client relations.
2.32      The third loan (LN 441-ET), of US$ 4.8 million, was again
extended to ETA with the Government as guarantor. It was signed in
December 1965 and declared effective in May 1966. The proceeds of the loan
financed the foreign exchange cost of the third project, (1966-1969). The
main achievement was a continued modernisation and expansion of the
physical network.
2.33      The fourth loan (LN 605-ET) of US$4.5 million was to ETA with the
Government as guarantor. It was signed in June 1969. Jointly with a
bilateral credit of the same amount it financed the foreign exchange cost
of the fourth project (1969-1974). The project contributed to some
improvements in ETA's planning function but on the whole the institutional
impact was limited; this was mainly due to effects of the political changes
in the country. On the other hand, the in-country long-distance services
were significantly improved through the implementation of the project.
2.34      The first credit (CR453-ET, of US$17.4 million, signed in January
1974) and the second credit (CR554-ET, of US$16.0 million, signed in June
1975), were both extended to the Government and relent to ETA. Together
with a loan from a Government owned bank, they financed the foreign
exchange cost of the two consecutive tranches of the fifth project
(1974-1978). For reasons beyond ETA's control, the project completion
slipped by about four years. The credits were closed in 1981 and 1983,
respectively, and a completion report, covering both tranches of the
project, is under preparation. Because of the effects of the Ethiopian
revolution in 1974 and of the subsequent unrest particularly in the Eastern
and Northern parts of the country, the impact of the project on ETA's
institutional development was less than envisaged at appraisal. In spite
of the project implementation slippage, both ETA and the country have
benefitted significantly from the credits. Through the credits, Ethiopia
was able to improve the reliability and coverage of the telecommunications
network (telephone and telex) that is benefitting most sectors of the
economy. IDA's continued involvement in the sector is important (para
2.35).
2.35      For the sixth project, and particularly in view of the
constraints described in paras 2.27 and 2.28, IDA has an important role to
play in, among others, the following aspects:
(a)  ensure, by collaboration between Bank staff and ETA
officials, that the project planning remains sound, with
a proper balance between urban and rural facilities and
between city installations that give early profit, and
rural installations that are needed for the country's
economic development but are slower in the generation of
large financial returns;



- 18 -
(b) provide a portion of the foreign exchange needed for the
sixth project and act as a catalyst for attracting
co-financing. This co-financing is expected from
bilateral and supplier sources; their utilization with
IDA credit would also procure technically sound and
suitable equipment at reasonable prices. Both foreign
governmental and some commercial sources have shown
hesitation in extending financing without the proposed
IDA credit as a base;
(c) support ETA's sound procurement procedures, with a
substantive share of the equipment to be purchased on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB);
(d)  support ETA's institutional development in regard to its
managerial and operational efficiency and autonomy, its
business approach in the serving of actual and potential
subscribers, and its staff development; and
(e) ensure that ETA plays its part in contributing financial
resources to the public treasury while retaining its
operating autonomy and funds from its internal cash
generation required for the local costs of the investment
program.
Without a relatively significant IDA contribution, the risk persists that
ETA would not be able to achieve the above and perhaps even lose some of
its existing autonomy and operating efficiency developed among previous
projects.
2.36      The ETA suffered heavy set-backs during the revolution, both in
regard to its staffing and to its technological development and operational
efficiency. Thus, a significant number of its senior staff left the
organization.  Although, thanks to its training institute, ETA has been
able to fill most of the vacated posts in a reasonable manner, it will
still take another five to six years before its previous staffing
capabilities are restored. Furthermore, the implementation of the present
investment program (1984-88) is about five years late; the entity should
really by now have been preparing its next program. The enormously rapid
development in the world of the telecommunications technology and service
diversification has therefore to some extent left ETA behind. From these
aspects, and as far as can be foreseen at this stage, it would be desirable
for the Bank to continue its involvement in the! telecommunications sector
after the completion of the present project, both to support the sectoral
strengthening and the institutional development and to help coordinate the
technical and economic planning of the network and the procurement of
equipment. The latter aspects will be particularly important should the
country's current foreign exchange constraints continue to prevail.

III.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Program
3.01       ETA prepared the sixth telecommunications development program
for the period 1981/82-1985/86 (referred to as the sixth program) in 1980.
It was designed to meet the sector objectives outlined in paras 2.21-2.26.
The sixth program was examined in detail and approved in March 1981 by the
Government. In its approval the Government assigned the program high
priority and insisted that it be implemented as presented. ETA was
instructed to start implementation of the program in FY82 and the Minister
of Finance was instructed to seek a credit from IDA for the foreign
currency portion of the cost. He sent the credit application to IDA on
June 30, 1981, attaching a copy of the sixth program as approved by the
Government.
3.02       For various reasons, IDA was not at the time in a position to
respond favorably to the application. In view of IDA's noninvolvement,
other "traditional" sources of financing were also reluctant, and the start
of program implementation had to be deferred.
3.03       In anticipation of project appraisal by IDA, ETA updated the
sixth program during January 1983, by revising demand and capital cost
estimates (para 3.08). This updating led to only minor changes in the
program and the implementation period was fixed as FY84 through FY88. The
resulting program and the design and contents correspond well to what is
required for meeting the sector objectives (paras 2.21-2.26). The size and
cost of the program is reasonable and ETA's management and staff is capable
of implementing it, with the assistance to be provided under the project.
B. Project Concept
3.04       The proposed sixth telecommunications project is identical with
the capital investment part of the updated version of the sixth program.
Some urban exchange facilities originally proposed for early installation
have been deferred in favor of facilities for improved long-distance
service to centers in outlying areas; this modification has improved the
project's response to the national development objectives (para 2.21).

C. Project Description
3.05      Details of the composition of the project investments are given
in Annex 11.  It will provide for the following:
(a)  extension of the national telecommunications network,
with regular services, to about 100 places, not served at
present, as well as the connection of about 40 new remote
places with radio call5/ service;
(b)  construction of about 14 new broadband long-distance
transmission links and increasing the capacity of the
existing ones;
(a)  adding about 62,000 automatic and 5,000 manual switching
lines and about 5,300 inter-office junctions;
(d)  expansion of the local cable networks by about 180,000
pair km and connection of about 45,000 new telephone
subscribers and 250 new telex subscribers;
(e)  expansion of international services by installing a
standard B earth satellite station for direct links with
countries served by the Indian Ocean region satellite,
increasing satellite circuits on the existing standard A
earth satellite station and installation of a 600 line
international digital SPC exchange with toll ticketing
facilities;
(f) adding various auxiliaries for improved operation and
mainatenance of existing and new installations; and
(g)  provision of consultancy services for institutional
development and of staff training in managerial,
operational, administrative and engineering subjects.
D.  Project Costs, Contingencies
3.06      The estimated total cost of the project is Br 314.2 million
(US$151.8 million) equivalent, with a foreigr currency component of
Br 214.0 million (US$103.4 million) equivalert. The costs are summarized
in the following table; details are in Annex 11.
5/ A high frequency radio service, for remote places, working with a lower
grade of service on a channel-sharing basis; each connected station is
normally open for about one-half to one hour per day only.

Source: ETA
3.07      ETA is liable to pay customs duties on imported project goods,
and the costs estimated on the basis of actual customs tariffs are included
in the local costs of the respective items.  They average at 21% on the CIF
costs.
3.08      All the cost figures reflect mid-1983 price estimates based on
information obtained by ETA on the results of recent ICB based procurements
in other countries in Eastern Africa, and on budgetary quotations received
by ETA itself from several suppliers of project-type equipment. The price
estimates are reasonable.
3.09      Physical cottingencies have been computed at the average rate of
8% of the project cost in 1983 prices.  Price contingencies for local costs
have been conservatively estimated on the basis of an assumed rate of local
inflation of 10% per annum.  For foreign curreney costs the price
contingencies are based on the following rates:
for 1984                     7.5%0i
1985                    7.0%
1986 and thereafter    6.0%
They are considered adequate, account being taken of the decline in real
world market prices for telecommunications equipment, due to the rapid



- 22 -
technological advancement in electronics. I'he aggregate price
contingencies are about 27% for local currency costs and about 23% for
foreign currency costs, in both cases calculated on base costs plus
physical contingencies.
E. Project Financing
3.10      The project is proposed to be financed as follows:
Proposed Financing of the Sixth Project
US$ million       % of Total
Source                         equivalent       Project Cost
IDA credit                                             40.0             26.3
Italy                                                  25.0             16.5

AfDB                                                   26.4             17.4
ETA's internal cash generation                         48.4             31.9
Total                                           151.8             100.0
3.11      ETA will be able to generate in its operations the funds needed
to cover the local costs of the project (in addition to debt service
payments and taxes). The co-financing of foreign currency costs will be in
the form of parallel financing. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has
recently concluded negotiations with the Goveernment on its proposed
participation in the sixth development program. Letters of intention from
the cofinanciers (AfDB, the Government of Itatly and the Government of
Sweden) have been received and conditions for effectiveness of agreements
with cofinanciers will be fulfilled prior to effectiveness of the proposed
IDA credit [para. 7.01(b)]. It is estimated that the average terms of
external financing would be 12% interest per annum and 15 years of
repayment period including three years of grace. (These figures are
conservative; they are chosen for computation purposes.)
3.12      An IDA credit of SDR 38.7 million (US$40.0 million equivalent) to
the Government of Ethiopia on standard IDA credit terms is proposed. The
proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be onlent to ETA at an annual
interest rate of 12.0% and with repayment over a 20 year period, which
includes five years of grace. ETA will cover the foreign exchange risk. The
rate would be positive when viewed in the context of inflation rates and
costs of resources internationally. These terms were discussed and agreed
during negotiations. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and ETA, acceptable to IDA and reflecting the above
conditions, would be a condition of credit effectiveness [para 7.01(a)].
Potential co-financiers have insisted on a close cooperation and
consultation with



- 23 -
IDA for this project, in regard to the review of project planning and
execution, to the availability and use of local and foreign currencies, and
to the service of loans/credits.
F. Procurement and Disbursements
3.13      For the procurement of equipment and material financed by
Italian, Swedish and AfDB loans (parallel financing), the regulations of
these governments and financing institutions will apply. Engagement of
consultants to be financed by proceeds of the proposed IDA credit will
follow the Bank's guidelines. Procurement of equipment and materials
financed by the proposed credits will be based on international competitive
bidding (ICB), except for the following:
(a)  equipment for expansion of existing installations may be
procured on the basis of negotiated contracts with
suppliers who previously supplied the equipment provided
that:
(i) in IDA's judgment such procurement is technically
necessary;
(ii) the prices compare reasonably with prices obtained
for similar installations after competitive bidding;
and
(iii) draft contracts and relevant documents are submitted
to IDA for approval before award of contract.
Total procurement under such procedures is not expected
to exceed $4.5 million; and
(b)  procurement of items each costing less than US$50,000,
with a maximum aggregate value of US$1,000,000, shall be
purchased in accordance with ETA's procurement
regulations, which are satisfactory.
For ICB procurement, the contract cost of which is estimated to be $500 000
or more, the draft invitation to bid, the award proposal, and the draft
contract shall be reviewed by IDA, before the final version of these
documents is prepared. ETA is preparing technical specifications and other
tender documents for the procurement of equipment and material. Some calls
for bids have been released.
3.14      The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit will be allocated on the
basis of the table below:

3.15      An estimated schedule for disbursements of the proceeds of the
IDA credit is given at Annex 12.  The schedule has been prepared after a
review of the disbursement history for similar projects, worldwide, for the
region, and for the country.  It has also been assumed that disbursement of
guarantee retentions will not be completed until about 18 months after
saheduled preliminary acceptance.  Major contracts for project equipment
and services are expected to be signed before end 1985. See further the
project implementation sehedule, Annex 13.



- 25 -
G. Project Organization and Implementation
3.16      ETA will be responsible for project implementation; this is
satisfactory. The work of installation of equipment and cable network will
be performed by ETA's own staff, which is qualified and sufficient in
number for the work. For new kinds of equipment, such as digital switching
and transmission, the installation and maintenance staff will be given the
necessary training (para 4.12).  Suppliers will supervise the installation
and testing of complex equipment.
3.17      In the past, the inability of contractors to complete buildings
for equipment installation on time in locations with difficult access has
caused substantial slippage in project execution. To overcome this
constraint, ETA has set up a building construction section, which has
demonstrated a satisfactory ability in regard to timely performance and
competitive costs. The buildings that are most urgently needed as per the
project implementation schedule are available or under construction; the
others have been planned in detail. (These works are financed entirely by
ETA.) The project implementation schedule, Annex 13, was discussed during
negotiations, and the Government and the ETA confirmed that they would take
all necessary steps to adhere to the schedule.
H. Performance Indicators
3.18      Indicators, to help ETA's management and IDA monitor project
implementation and operational and financial performance, are given in
Annex 14. The performance indicators and the expected annual variations
have been chosen so as to demonstrate ETA's degree of success in
installation of equipment in rural and urban areas, in making staffing
improvements, in raising the level of quality of service, in keeping down
the level of outstanding subscriber accounts receivable, in using the
vehicle fleet rationally, and in improving its financial performance.
They were discussed during negotiations; they will be compared with actuals
in ETA's quarterly reports to IDA.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A. Legal Status and Organization
4.01      ETA is a state owned corporation.  It was established as an
autonomous body by proclamation (Annex 2) for the purposes of improving the
national public telecommunications, of engaging in the business of
telecommunications for profit, of acting as an agent for the Government in
all telecommunications matters and of establishing the training facilities
required. The corporate powers are exercised by a board of directors. The
chairman of the board is the Minister of Transport and Communications;
other members are nominated as individuals. At present, all of the board
members are nominated from within the MOTC. The chief executive is the
general manager who according to ETA's charter is not a formal member of
the board but assists at all its meetings and participates in the



- 26 -
discussions. ETA would continue to retain its corporate existence in
accordance with its charter.
4.02      ETA's organizational structure is at Annex 15.  Management is
divided into three departments: finance and supply, operations and
engineering, and one independent division for administration and
personnel. Certain functions, like planning and internal audit, report
directly to the general manager. The subscriber relations and the
maintenance and operation of installations are handled within seven
geographical regions. The regional managers report to the general manager
but the operations department coordinates regional activities. The
structure is adequate.
4.03      The board of directors is required to submit to the Government
annual reports containing ETA's audited accounts and other statements
showing the financial condition and results of operation. The accounts are
subsequently published in the official gazette. Out of the net profits of
operations, the board should reserve funds for expansion and debt
repayments (para 5.08).
B. Management and Control
4.04      A detailed description of the basic functions, duties and
responsibilities for each position in the corporation is on file.
Authority and responsibility are well delegated throughout the organization
and there are no managerial bottlenecks. The managerial structure has
changed very little during the last 15 years and a number of managers are
qualified and have the experience in their posts. Also from the board of
directors to the general manager, the delegation of authority and
responsibility is in accordance with ETA's statute.
4.05      Management control is partly exercised by means of formal reports
prepared periodically and submitted through the formal structure as part of
the management information system. The internal audit is actively pursuing
its mandate by both routine checking and by non-scheduled visits to various
offices; embezzlements are reported to the police, while administrative
offences are dealt with within ETA by a commission. For all capital works,
a works' order is issued on the basis of an approved proposal. After the
work is completed, a copy of the order is returned to the planning and
programming office filled in with details on material, labor and
transport. These elements are checked against records in the respective
sections and deviations investigated by the internal audit. For each
installation and connection of customer equipment and similar minor work, a
subordinate, so-called service order is issued, which in principle follows
the same procedure as the works' order. This system has worked smoothly
and provides for discipline and effective control.
4.06      In discussions with the Minister of Transport and Communications,
it became clear, however, that improvements were needed in increasing the
efficiency of ETA's management, particularly in regard to a more up-to-date
management information system, more efficient maintenance and other



- 27 -
customer services, and a more businesslike approach in ETA's dealing with
present and potential clients. It was agreed with the mission that
consultants should be engaged to propose appropriate measures ia concrete
terms.  The consultants should also be required to advise ETA on an
increased use of its aomputer facilities.  This understanding was confirmed
during negotiations [para 7.02(d)] and terms of reference for the
consultants were reviewed and agreed by IDA.  ETA have invited bids for
these servioes.
C.  Programming, Planning, Budgeting
4.07       The basic material for programs and budgets is prepared on a
divisional level and, after review by the chiefs of the departments, it is
reviewed by the finance division and consolidated by the planning and
programming office.  A management committee, consisting of senior
headquarters officials and the regional managers, and ahaired by the
general manager, meets annually to review the budget and to update the
program before final consolidation. The general manager presents to the
board of direators multi-year programs and annual budgets for operational
and capital expenditures.  The program is forwarded by the board of
directors to the CPSC, which has the final approval authority and takes a
particular interest in foreign currency requirements.  The integration of
ETA's program into the government's planning is facilitated by the manager
of the planning and programming office liaising with the CPSC.
4.08      ETA's adhereace to the approved program is controlled by the
planning and programming office, reporting directly to the general
manager.  This office has also the responsibility of monitoring ETA's
compliance with the capital budget, which it does by means of the works'
order system.  Each works order is signed by the general manager or, as
delegated, by the manager of the planning and programming office.  Service
orders are signed by the various heads of subscription offices.  Compliance
with the operational budget is ensured by the finance and supply
department. The budgeting and budget control system is in general
satisfactory.  A closer working level liaison between the accounts and the
engineering departments would improve control and efficiency.
D. Staff and Training
4.09      During the last 15 years, ETA has been employing nationals only.
Serious efforts have been made by the board and management to increase
staff efficieney by careful and systematic recruitment, by a comprehensive
training program and by independent staff regulation enabling appropriate
assignment of individuals and incentives for training and job efforts.
However, since the revolution in late-1974, ETA has been under pressure to
employ staff beyond its service requirements and, furthermore, part of the
incentive was removed for senior staff by government's freezing monthly
salaries of Br 450 or above. The situation is illustrated by the table
below.  (The number of staff per 1,000 main lines (DELs) gives a rough
indication of the efficieacy of the enterprise.)

1974-75                   1.1             2.8          5.2           -3.7
1975-76                   6.4           (-8.1)         7.7           -1.2

1980-81 (average)         5.0           (-0.8)         4.4           +0.6
4.10      The figure of staff per 1,000 DELs averaged at 66 in FY82.  It is
excessive, although it should be noted that ETA's permanent staff include
several categories that in most countries are either hired temporarily by
contract, such as daily laborers for cable trenching and building
construction and soldiers/guards, or are completely outside the
administration, such as workshop employees for repair of vehicles and
manufacture and repair of line material, office furniture, etc. A
reduction is planned, as indicated at Annex 14, item 4, and the staff ratio
was one of the project performance indicators discussed and agreed upon
during negotiations (para 3.18).
4.11      The personnel of ETA like all other employed persons in the
country is administered in accordance with the Labor Proclamation (No. 64
of 1975), which regulates employment and principles for pay, social
security, trade unions and collective agreements. The employees of ETA
have formed a trade union and negotiated a contract which is renewable once
a year. On promotion, disciplinary matters, labor disputes and award of
scholarships, the general manager is advised by committees consisting of
three members from management and three from the staff with a chairman
elected by these six.
4.12      Since its creation, ETA has within its own organization a
training center which is giving pre-service and in-service training to all
categories of staff. UNDP has supported this activity during extended
periods. It has assisted with the preparation of course syllabi and has
provided experts to organize and deliver courses. An ongoing UNDP project,
costing about US$1.3 million, will deliver 143 man-months of expert
services; it also includes a number of fellowships for specialized studies
abroad and a small amount of didactic material. The amount is, however,
insufficient for the requirements, which among other things include a
limited regionalization of the training. In order to cover the balance of
the costs, an amount of US$1.2 million has been included in the project.
ETA will ensure that the training center provides for staff pre-service and



- 29 -
in-service training as required during the project period; the compliance
will be monitored by performance indicators (Annex 14).
E. Accounting System
4.13       The funds generated by it are placed in its own bank account in
Ethiopia. The process for preparation of the annual budget starts about
seven months prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. After review and
approval by ETA's management, the budget is presented to the board for
approval, normally three months before the beginning of the fiscal year.
The budget process ends at the board level. However, since the revolution,
ETA has been required to obtain approval of the National Supreme Council
for all expenditures related to new investments. In addition, the
government's proclamation no. 163 of 1979 requires all public enterprises,
including ETA, to pay annual capital charges to the government at the rate
of 5% of the paid in capital plus retained earnings. The proclamation
also limits the level of retained earnings at 30% of the capital; all
surplus exceeding this level is required to be turned over to the
government. However, measures have been agreed under the Project to ensure
that this limit does not hinder ETA from smooth investment and autonomous
financial planning [paras 5.08 and 7.02(a)].
4.14       ETA's financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis.
Trial balances have been prepared and issued on a quarterly basis.
Following the partial computerization of the accounting system, ETA has
begun (effective fiscal year 1983) to prepare trial balances on a monthly
basis. There are some delays in preparing the financial statements -
mainly due to the processing of the inputs. Gradual mechanization is
planned for inventory control, recording of fixed assets, works orders,
credit subscribers (para 4.17), accounts with foreign administrations,
etc. ETA will therefore have to also gradually upgrade its IBM system 34
computer to handle all these operations. Simultaneously staff will have to
undergo further training. The extent of the computer upgrading and staff
training will be determined after the management consultancy study has been
completed (para 4.06).
4.15       Working level liaison between the engineering and finance
departments is not as cohesive as it should be. Therefore, some
discrepancies arise between budget expectations and actual results. In
order to improve the existing management information system, to institute
better financial controls and to derive maximum benefit from
computerization of the accounting system, a management consultancy study
has been included in the project (para 4.06).
F. Billing and Collection
4.16       ETA has computerized all billing for telephone, telex and
telegram. Meter readings are taken on the 25th day of the billing month
and are received by the Data Processing Branch (DPB) before the end of the
month (Annex 20). DPB takes at least two weeks to process the bills



- 30 -
because the personnel in the branah have to transpose, manually, the meter
readings (taken photographically for large exchanges and manually for small
exchanges) on to computer cards.  ETA is searching for an optical character
reader that could be used to speed up the processing of bills. Effective
1985, ETA aims at issuing the bills by the fifteenth day of the billing
month for Addis Ababa subscribers and the twenty-first day for the rest.
4.17      With regard to collection, ETA has classified its customers into
three categories:
(a)  private customers, in Addis Ababa, who are required to
settle their bills on cash-basis;
(b)  credit customers, in Addis Ababa, who include the
Government and its institutions, emlbassies and
international organizations; and
(a) all other customers in the regions.
Customers in category (a) are presented with their bills by ETA-employed
eollectors. The austomer is required to pay the full amount of the bill
directly to the collector on receipt of the bill. If the subscriber cannot
pay, the aollector issues a notice (on the spot) advising the subscriber to
settle the account within seven days.  If no payment is received within the
seven days, telephone and/or telex service to the subscriber is suspended.
If no payment is received after a further three months, the service is
eompletely disconnected, the line assigned to a waiting applicant and legal
action instituted against the non-paying subscriber.  Should the subscriber
pay within the three-month period, service is restored at a fee of Br 15.
Bills for customers in category (b) are distriLbuted by ETA-employed
messengers. The distribution period is about seven days. On average it
takes about two months (after issuing the bill) to establish whether a
customer under this category has not settled his account.  The procedures
which apply after identifying non-paying subscribers are similar to those
applicable to customers in category (a). Bills to the rest of customers
are mailed to them and subscribers are required to settle their accounts at
local telephone ceenters.
4.18      Acaounts receivable as at June 30, 1982 were Br 20.9 million,
representing about 31% of ETA's total revenues; for FY82.  ETA's performance
in collecting reeeivables has improved significantly since 1979 when such
amounts represented about 59 percent of total revenues in that year
(para 5.03). ETA has agreed to work towards reducing the amounts even
further and to include collection of accounts as one of the indicators of
its performance (Annex 14).  The proposed manaLgement information system
study (para 4.06) will review ETA's billing and collection procedures.
G. Assets, Supplies, Insurance
4.19      All assets of ETA are properly registered and accounted for.  The
aecounts are, however, based on historioal bock value and both
installations and stores need to be revalued (para 5.04).  At the same
time, obsolete or obsolescent material should be sorted out and disposed of



- 31 -
to provide storage space and reduce administrative and maintenance
expenses (para 5.05).
4.20      The storing and accounting of stock material is orderly and
maximum and minimum quantities are established for every item, although
these are sometimes difficult to apply due to the country's foreign
currency constraints.  All items have been catalogued and indexed in
preparation for computerization, which ETA has not yet been able to do,
however, for reason of insufficient aomputer capacity and lack of
programmers. This shortcoming is to be remedied within the project. ETA
has established regional stores but their activity has so far been very
restricted; in management's view, the regional stores aan be expected to
operate efficiently and economically only after the proposed
computerization.
4.21      In addition to insurance of procurements, ETA has satisfactory
insurance aoverage of its buildings, installations, material in stores,
garage, workshops and vehicles. It has, furthermore, a workman's
compensation insurance for all staff and has made satisfactory insurance
arrangements for cash-handling staff.
H. Audit
4.22      ETA has an internal audit branch with a staff of about nine
including the Chief Internal Auditor.  The branah reports directly to the
Genleral Manager.  The audit procedures were developed in the 1960s and have
remained essentially the same since then.  Some revision of these
procedures and staff training are required to cater for the increasingly
expanding organization as well as the computerization of the accounting
system. The consultants who will be engaged for the management information
system study (para 4.06) will be called upon to also examine and make
recommendations on the internal auditing procedures.
4.23      Prior to FY78, ETA's accounts were externally audited by various
private firms. Since July 1977 a publicly owned aorporation, the Audit
Serviaes Corporation (ASC), has been ETA's external auditor. As with most
parastatals in Ethiopia following their inception, ASC was plagued with
many problems of which the major one was the lack of qualified aecounting
staff.  ASC has not yet been strengthened sufficiently but expatriate
assistance is currently providing some relief.  In 1980 ETA instituted a
special recruitment and training program for accounting staff.  As a
result, ETA has made substantial progress in having its accounts prepared,
closed and audited as the following table shows:

1983                   8                      12
4.24      With the computerization of the accounting system (para 4.14),
the timing should improve further. ETA has agreed to a timetable for the
presentation of its accounts to IDA. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from ETA that it would continue to employ qualified auditors and
adhere to the following timetable with respect to forwarding reports to
IDA.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Past Financial Performance
5.01      The past financial performance of ETA has been acceptable.  The
historical income statement and balance sheet for FY78 to FY82 are given in
Annexes 16 and 17. The statements have been adjusted to reflect the fact
that ETA had claimed exemption from paying capital charges and could not
therefore deduct these charges in determining the taxable income as allowed
in the proclamation (para 4.13). A summary for these years is given below:

a/  The covenanted rate of return on revalued assets for the fifth project
(Credits 453-ET and 554-ET) was 7% before completion of the project and
8% thereafter.
The substantial difference in revenues between 1979 and 1981 was due to the
tariff increase which became effective in Marah 1980, the commissioning of
the earth satellite station, the international telephone  exchange and
microwave links in FY80, and an increase of about 8,000 subscribers.  ETA's
self-generated eash contribution, before and after debt service, averaged
95% and 50%, respectively, of the capital expansion requiremeats over the
1978-1982 period.
B. Present Financial Position
5.02      A summary of ETA's provisional balance sheet as at June 30, 1982
is given below:



- 34 -
ETA - Unaudited Balanced Sheet as at June 30, 1982

Current ratio (times)            1.5
Debt/Equity (%)                45/55
Investments consist mostly of ETA's investment in the International
Telecommuniaations Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).  Retained earnings
include grants of about Birr 13 million received from the UNDP, and the
Swedish and Japanese governments.  Long-term debt include the IBRD loans
contracted by ETA and the IDA credits relent by the Government (Loans
314-ET, 441-ET, 605-ET, and Credits 453-ET, 554-ET) and the loan ETA
obtaiaed from the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) of
Ethiopia.  The current ratio, debt/equity ratio and debt service coverage
are all aonsidered satisfactory.
C. Accounts Receivable
5.03      As of June 30, 1982 acaounts due from subscribers stood at Birr
21 million, equivalent to 31% of total revenue or 113 days of billing in
that fiscal year. The major defaulters are the government and its
agencies.  Although the figure is relatively high, it is a considerable
achievement since 1979 when accounts receivable represented 59% of total
revenue or 216 days of billing in that year. ETA has agreed to gradually
reduce the proportion of accounts receivable to a level of 20% of total
revenues or 73 days of billing by the end of the project implementation
period (1988).  Such a level is reasonable considering the constraints in
prooessing and issuing of bills (para 4.18). The performance indiaators
(para 3.17 and Annex 14) will show the levels of accounts reaeivable in
each year during the project implementation period.



- 35 -
D. Valuation of Assets
5.04      As of June 30, 1982, gross fixed assets were shown at an aaquisi-
tion (historical) cost of Br 236 million.  This figure is considered an
underestimate of the current market value of ETA's fixed assets. The
revaluation of assets has been pending for several years due to inconclu-
sive discussions between ETA and the government. The matter was discussed
during appraisal and the methodology for revaluation was agreed upon by
ETA.  In order to ensure impartiality and to benefit from experience in
other countries, ETA has agreed to engage consultants for the exercise and
has invited bids from consultants.
5.05      In the meantime ETA has appointed a technical committee charged
with the responsibility of compiling a list of all fixed assets, their
dates of aaquisition and the cost at acquisition. The same committee will
also examine the levels of inventory, currently standing high at 15% of
gross fixed assets. A part of the inventories comprises obsolete items.
The aommittee will look into this and make recommendations on writing-off
sueh items. Their book value is relatively small and their being
written-off will not significantly affect the current ratio or other
finanoial indicators.  (See also para. 4.19.)  The consultants for the
revaluation of assets exercise will be called upon to also recommend an
appropriate level of inventory.  The performance indicators (para 3.17 and
Annex 14) aim at reducing the level of inventory to 10% of gross fixed
assets by FY86.
5.06      For the purpose of projecting the rate of return on average net
revalued fixed assets in operations, the gross fixed assets as at June 30,
1983 have been tentatively revalued on a trial basis by 30% and a 6% p.a.
revaluation has been applied for the years 1984-1990. Accumulated
depreciation as of June 30, 1983 has been revalued to bring its proportion
to gross fixed assets to the same level as before the revaluation. These
tentative estimates will be adjusted following the completion of the
revaluation exercise mentioned in paragraph 5.04.
E. Future Financial Performance
5.07      Forecast financial statements for the fiscal years 1984-1990
(i.e. two years beyond the project implementation period) are given in
Annex 16 through Annex 19.  A summary of ETA's future financial performance
is given below.

ETA's projected financial performance over the project implementation
period is good. All indicators of financial performance are considered
satisfactory. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that ETA's net
cash flow in any one year will meet or exceed the local funds requirement
of the investment program in the following year [para 7.02(c)]. It was
agreed also that ETA's rate of return on net revalued assets would not be
less than 11% [para 7.02(b)].
5.08      To promote efficient and autonomous financial operation in ETA,
and to ensure that sufficient funds generated by ETA are available for
ETA's investment program (para 4.13), the government has also agreed, that
ETA shall have at its own disposal, starting at the beginning of the fourth
quarter in each fiscal year, sufficient funds to meet the local fund
requirement of ETA's approved investment prolyram for the following fiscal
year [(para 7.02(a)].
5.09      ETA's tariffs were increased by an average of about 30% in 1980
and no additional across-the-board tariff increases are currently forecast
during the project period (see para 6.09). The lowest level of the rate of
return on average revalued net fixed assets :Ln operation is projected at
11% in 1990, the last year of project implementation. The
telecommunications tariff structure in Ethiopia has remained essentially
the same since 1971. ETA has agreed to include a component in the project
to study the appropriateness of its tariff structure. The study



- 37 -
will also include the implications of the revaluation of assets (para
5.04). Invitations to bid for the studies have been issued.
F. Financing Forecast
5.10      The forecast of sources and applications of funAds is based upon
implementation of ETA's sixth program and is shown in Annex 18.  The
following is a summary of the financing plan for the period 1984 to 1988.

ETA's net internal cash generation (after debt service) would finance the
equivalent of 57% of the total program cost over the 1984-1988 period. The
average debt service coverage over the same period is forecast at 2.3.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The economic analysis relates to ETA's FY84-FY88 investment
program which is identical to the proposed IDA-assisted sixth
telecommunications project. The program has been designed to support the
Government's overall economic plan.  As outlined in paragraphs 2.18 to 2.20
there is a large unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services in
Ethiopia and ETA's proposed FY84-FY88 investment program is expected to
meet only part of this demand.



- 38 -
A. Telecommunications and Development
6.02      Reflecting the population distribution in Ethiopia, economic and
social activity is widely spread over the country where communication and
transportation are difficult and slow. Hence, production and distribution
in agriculture, industry and energy is partly dependent on
telecommunications to facilitate coordination at all levels of inputs and
outputs, production processes, sales, pricing, and the distribution of
products. Also, many business and government services involve the use of
staff with limited expertise who must periodically obtain advice or
direction from more qualified individuals at the main centers. These
business and government administration personnel have substantial
management- and market-related information requirements which in many
instances could be most efficiently met using telecommunications services
(paras 2.09 and 2.10).
6.03      With the country relying largely on imported oil supplies, the
efficient use of limited and costly transportation facilities is also a
vital necessity, and the efficient coordination of these facilities
requires adequate telecommunications services. For example, following a
recent reopening of a blocked road between the port of Assab and Addis
Ababa, a series of checkpoints linked provisionally by radio telephone were
set up along the road in an attempt to speed the flow of supplies from the
port. Progress of individual trucks was monitored and where there was a
breakdown, spare parts were ordered and brought on the next truck. The
radio telephone linked system cut the average round trip journey time in
half, and in a matter of weeks the backlog at the port of Assab was cleared
of the large stocks of goods which had accumulated there. To enable a
continuation of such coordination) the temporary radio telephones must be
replaced by regular facilities, which can serve on a permanent basis.
B. Distribution of Benefits
6.04      The distribution of benefits from the proposed telecommunications
investment program should touch all segments of the population in Ethiopia
through communication-related increases in Government and business
efficiency and the resulting lower costs for goods and services. In
particular, the program, and specifically the sixth telecommunications
project, will have a major impact on access to telecommunications service
in currently unserved smaller urban and rural communities. The Government
is opening up large, fertile, and well watered areas of the country for
agricultural and agro-industrial production and is resettling people from
drought stricken regions. These activities will benefit greatly from
telecommunications, particularly as the road network in the areas will
remain underdeveloped for many years. Also, a great number of telegraph
stations and telephone pay-stations, to be established in the areas in
question, will benefit the general population, mostly farmers, workers and
small businessmen. The number of DELs provided outside of Addis Ababa will
almost double and an additional 200 small and intermediate size towns
currently without any telephone access will be provided with small
telephone exchanges (150 towns) and public call offices (50 towns). In
Addis Ababa and the other 13 provincial capital towns an additional 566
public coin box telephones will be installed. This will be a 75% increase



- 39 -
in coin box telephone availability in Ethiopia and will provide increased
communication access to major segments of the urban population. This
increased public telephone 'access in urban and rural areas and in smaller
communities in the regions (para 2.26), together with a potential financial
cross-subsidy from urban subscribers to any rural facilities which in the
short run do not generate sufficient revenues to cover their total costs,
should ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits of
telecommunications services in Ethiopia.
6.05      ETA has a wider impact on the other sectors of the Ethiopian
economy than is apparent from telephone statistics. For example, the
transfer of funds to and from Government over the 1984-1988 period results
in a net surplus in favor of Government of about Br 221.2 million (US$106.9
million). This surplus comprises the interest received by Government from
ETA during the 1984-88 period on funds onlent to ETA, customs duties and
taxes paid by ETA on project expenditures, and corporate income taxes, as
shown in the following table.
ETA - Fiscal Implications 1984-88
Br millions      US$ millions
Customs duties              42.4            20.5
Interest                    61.5            29.7
Income tax                 117.3            56.7
Total               221.1           106.9
These funds would be available to government for investments in other
sectors.
C. Tariff Policy
6.06      Average telephone revenue per line in 1982 was about US$368 which
compares relatively well with that in many other countries. The initial
connection charge for gaining a telephone in an automatic exchange area in
Ethiopia is relatively low at US$56. Given the large excess demand for
telephones in Ethiopia (para 1.08), consideration would be given to
increasing this charge in order to use price to better ration telephone
lines, as they become available, to those who would make the most
productive use of them. The annual charge for having a subscriber
telephone in Addis Ababa is the same for business and residential
subscribers. Outside of Addis Ababa, however, subscribers registered as
business and Government are charged an annual subscriber fee roughly double
that of residential subscribers. This partly reflects what is felt to be a
lower price elasticity of demand on the part of business subscribers. A
summary of ETA's actual tariffs is at Annex 21.
6.07      Local calls are untimed.  For long distance calls, two general
charging categories are used: a standard day rate and a lower rate for



- 40 -
nights and weekends. The night and weekend rate reflects the lower
marginal cost of carrying traffic outside of the busy periods since system
capacity is dimensioned for peak hour usage. The higher daytime tariff
ensures that those subscribers (primarily business and government--para
2.09) who have the greatest demand at peak times will pay a price which
more closely reflects the actual costs which they impose on the system.
With the introduction of the new electronic switching equipment under this
project, future consideration will be given to timing and peak period
pricing for local calls and a more diversified charging of long distance
calls.
6.08       Price is also used to better ration capacity on underprovisioned
long distance circuits. Calls can be booked through operators as ordinary
calls at the regular published charge, as urgent calls at twice the
ordinary call charge, and as lightning calls at three times the ordinary
call charge. Per kilometer charges for long distance calls decrease with
distance, reflecting decreasing costs.
6.09      ETA management agrees that the tariff structure needs to be
reviewed. It also agrees that study to this effect ought to be made by
specialists/consultants working with ETA staff. Invitations to bid for the
study have been issued and the results of the study will be discussed
between ETA and IDA before September 30, 1985 [para 7.02(b)].
D. Least Cost Solution
6.10      The engineering department of ETA has planned the various
equipment installations under the project, the traffic handling capacity
needed in various points of the network, and the requirements for
optimizing operational costs and service quality. The choices are well in
line with modern practices for planning telecommunications networks, as
applied to the Ethiopian environment and requirements.
6.11      The ETA uses an up-to-date transmission plan that follows
international recommendations, setting out transmission levels in various
points of local and long distance paths. The equipment selected are:
(a)  wideband microwave equipment for high capacity links in
the backbone network;
(b) UHF equipment for medium and low capacity links;
(c) VHF for multi-access customer service systems and for
certain low capacity links; and
(d) HF for connection to radio call offices.
Multiplex equipment at the terminals will be added in stages, as justified
by demand increases. The addition of an earth station type "B", for the
satellite communications, has been justified in the report of a special
study. In the urban cable networks the choice between PCM and analog audio



- 41 -
frequency transmission is justified for each installation by an ad hoc
study.
6.12      In the field of telephone switching, the ETA, like most other
telephone administrations in both industrialized countries and developing
countries, has made the decision to introduce digital equipment at all new
major switching stations. (The smaller ones are remaining either manually
operated or having analog equipment.) In regard to capacity expansion at
existing stations, the costs and benefits have been studied case by case,
of either expanding the existing analog equipment by the same type or using
this equipment somewhere else in the network and installing a new digital
facility with the higher capacity required. These studies have resulted in
the choice of the latter option at most places within the sixth program.
ETA's management arrived at these decisions after studies over the course
of about four years; several of the senior officials have visited all major
manufacturers' offices and have participated in international seminars
where such matters were discussed. In general, the following factors,
among others, influence the choice between analog and digital switching.
The initial cost of digital equipment is still more costly, on average,
than electromechanical equipment, although the price of the former is
decreasing in real terms. Electronic equipment requires, however, much
less space (only 20-30%) than that of electro-mechanical equipment; the
same relation applies to the maintenance effort. Still more price
advantages can be obtained through simplifications in the local
distribution network, made possible with electronic digital switching.
6.13      ETA charges telephone communications by means of pulse meters
(para 4.16), both for local traffic and for subscriber-dialed long distance
traffic. On the latter, it receives many complaints, mostly from
customers who do not realize the price levels and therefore believe that
they have been overcharged. ETA would have liked to introduce individual
toll ticketing, which in the experience of other countries is likely to
eliminate many of the complaints and increase the traffic demand. However,
on the basis of a cost/benefit study, ETA has rejected the idea as long as
the major portion of the traffic is switched by analog equipment. For the
international traffic, however, which still is operator assisted (in the
direction out of Ethiopia; towards Ethiopia it is already fully automatic),
ETA considers toll ticketing a prerequisite for subscriber dialing and the
equipment needed is included in the program with the expansion of the
international switch. Traffic with small towns and rural centers will
remain operator assisted. However, ETA has already begun, during the fifth
project, and will continue during the sixth, to make available subscriber
dialing facilities for traffic with the regional capitals, the two
important Red Sea ports and a few commercially significant cities.
Automatic traffic handling is considered to be preferable despite this
solution being somewhat less labor intensive and slightly more demanding on
initial capital. This is primarily because it has distinct time,
reliability, and efficiency advantages, both for ETA and the customers.

E. Return on Investment
Financial Rate of Return
6.14      The IDA-assisted project is identical with the updated version of
the ETA's 1984-1988 investment program (the sixth program). Since costs
and benefits of all components of the program are highly interrelated, the
return is calculated on all of the investment undertaken during the period
rather than on the specific investment in the IDA-financed component. On
this basis the internal financial rate of retturn on the sixth
telecommunications project is 13%. The basis for the calculations is given
in Annex 22.
Economic Rate of Return
6.15      The financial rate of return understates the benefits which would
be derived from the investment program. It does not take into account all
indirect and external benefits (e.g. transport substitution, administrative
efficiency) received by non-users of the service. An estimate of some
portion of the consumer surplus associated with the consumption of
telecommunications services was made based on the assumption that new
consumers added over the project implementation period will be similar to
the average existing consumer and will be willing to pay for
telecommunications services prices equal in real terms to those which
existing consumers are demonstrating a willingness to pay. Based on this
assumption, adjusting for taxes and customs duties, and on the application
of a standard conversion factor of 0.80 to local costs and revenues, the
quantificable estimate of the project's economic rate of return is minimum
34% (Annex 22).
F. Risks
6.16      The project implementation has been adequately planned by ETA,
with the required inputs to various project elements determined and timed.
The requirement of staff for installation and subsequent operation has been
quantified and arrangements made for them to bes made available. Buildings
and other civil construction are either available or in an advanced stage
of preparation. Auxiliaries are to be procured within the framework of the
project and tender documents for equipment procurement are being prepared
(para 3.13). The availability of local counterpart funds is conservatively
estimated.



- 43 -
6.17      Foreign exchange rates could vary in such a direction as to
increase project costs. However, the price contingencies included in the
cost estimates should be sufficient to cover this and other possible
increases.
6.18      Consequences of any possible damage of equipment are small by the
fact that the installations are distributed over the country. The
insurance coverage is satisfactory with adequate amounts of compensation
for goods in transit and in stock, as well as for installed equipment,
buildings, vehicles and staff.
6.19      The growth rates used in projecting revenues (Annex 7) have been
discussed at length with local officials. The rates are sufficiently
conservative to be expected to be attained. It might be noted in this
connection that more than 80% of ETA's clients are non-government (para
2.06).
6.20      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out.  It indicates that a
10% increase in capital and operating costs, combined with a 10% decrease
in benefits, would reduce the internal financial rate of return from 13% to
4%, and the quantifiable economic rate of return from 34% to 28%. A
one-year delay in all benefits with no postponement of costs, which is a
highly unlikely scenario, would reduce the rates of return to 8% and to
27% respectively (Annex 22).
G. Environmental and Health Aspects
6.21      The project has no significant adverse environmental or health
aspects. The plant is mostly unseen and consumes little energy. On the
positive side, telecommunications tends to promote energy conservation and
reduce environmental pollution because of its being, to an extent, an
alternative to communications involving physical movements. It also
facilitates health delivery and emergency care.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The following would be conditions of credit effectiveness:
(a) that ETA and the Government had signed a subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to IDA, whereby the proceeds of the
IDA credit be onlent to ETA at an interest rate of 12.0%
per annum for a period of 20 years including a five-year
grace period (para 3.12); and
(b) that the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
loans from African Development Bank, Italy, and Sweden
are fulfilled (para. 3.11).
7.02      During negotiations, the following major assurances were obtained
that:
(a) ETA shall have at its own disposal, starting at the
beginning of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year,
sufficient funds to meet the local fund requirement of
ETA's approved investment program for the following
fiscal year (para 5.08);
(b) ETA discuss the implications of the results of the asset
revaluation exercise and of its tariff study (para 6.09)
with IDA not later than September :30, 1985 and thereafter
apply such measures as necessary to ensure that its
services yield an annual rate of return of not less than
11% on the average net revalued fixed assets in operation
(para 5.07);
(c) ETA's net cash flow during any given fiscal year shall be
not less than the local fund requirement of ETA's
approved investment program for the following fiscal
year (para 5.07); and
(d)  ETA engage consultants to review and make recommendations
on the general efficiency of its managerial structure,
efficiency of its maintenance efforts and of other cus-
tomer services, its approach to clients, and its optimum
use of electronic data processing (para 4.06).



- 45 -
7.03      Provided the above conditions are met, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit to the Government of SDR
38.7 million (equivalent to US$40.0 million using the rate SDR 1.00
US$ 1.03409).

ETA's Statute
1.        Proclamation No. 131 of 1952 (October 15, 1952).  This is the law
that created ETA, out of the then Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and
Telephones, as an autonomous corporation, and invested it with authority to
execute all the established purposes and functions. This authority
included among other things the fixing of tariffs and charges for services,
the approval of programs and budgets, and accounts, as well as the
establishment of reserves and declaration of dividends on shares. It fixed
the purposes "to rehabilitate, extend, repair and maintain the
telecommunication facilities of Ethiopia and to engage in the business of
telecommunication for profit and to act as agent for the Imperial Ethiopian
Government in all matters relating to the provision of telecommunication
services in Ethiopia and elsewhere, and to establish appropriate training
procedures and a Training Institute for present and future board
personnel." The authorized share capital was Br 6.75 million out of which
Br 3 million was in cash and Br 3.75 million in proceeds of the first
telecommunications loan (Annex 9).
2.        Proclamation No. 170 of 1960 (June 22, 1960).  It established the
authority of ETA to borrow funds required for operation and expansion, with
the limitation that the outstanding debt should not exceed three times the
paid up share capital, and with the proviso of government's ratification of
each loan. It also increased the capital to Br 7.71 million. The
additional Br 0.96 million was to be paid up by proceeds from a Bank loan.
3.        Proclamation 0. 246 of 1967 (June 27, 1967).  The share capital
was increased by Br 12.29 million to Br 20 million. The payment for the
additional shares was left open to negotiations between ETA and the
Government.
4.        Proclamation No. 319 of 1973 (June 27, 1974).  The share capital
was increased to Br 40 million; the new shares, Br 20 million in total,
were subscribed by the Government.

Notes and Assumptions on the Financial Forecasts 1984-1990
Income Statements
1.        Annual increases in number of working DELs are as per program
implementation schedule.
2.        Average revenue per DEL to grow at 9% per annum.  This compares
with a historical (1979-1982) growth rate of about 11% per annum.
3.        Average revenue per telex subscriber to remain constant at Birr
15,000 per annum.
4.        Telegraph revenues have been assumed to remain constant at Birr 4
million per annum.
5.        Other revenues have been assumed to remain constant at Birr 2
million per annum.
6.        Wages and salaries have been assumed to remain at the 1982
average wage per employee. This is based on the trend between 1978
and 1982.
7.        The number of staff per average 1000 DEL in operation to decline
from 66 in 1982 to 50 in 1990 (Annex 14).
8.        Maintenance and transportation costs per DEL have been assumed to
remain at the 1982 level. This is based on the trend between 1978 and
1982.
9.        Inflation rate applied to operating costs has been assumed at 10%
per annum.
10.       Depreciation has been calculated at 5% per annum of the average
gross plant in service in the year.
11.       Interest on the new credit has been assumed at 12% per annum on
the average outstanding credits.
12.       Income (corporate) tax has been calculated 50% of operating
surplus after deducting interest payments.

ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 2
Balance Sheets
13.       Increase in gross fixed assets is related to transfer from works
in progress as assets become revenue-producing. Work in progress on
average is transferred to fixed assets equally over the two succeeding
years.
14.       Accounts receivable as a percentage of gross revenues would
decline from 31% in 1982 to 20% in 1990 (Annex 14).
15.       Inventory as a percentage of gross fixed assets to decline from
15% in 1982 to 10% in 1986 and to remain at that level during the project
implementation period.
16.       Advances, prepayments and other current assets to remain at about
50% of cash operating costs excluding income taxes. This is based on the
average figure over the 1979-1982 period.
17.       Accounts payable as a portion of work in progress and cash
operating costs excluding income taxes would be 35%.
18.       Long term debt represents existing commitments and proposed
borrowings from IDA, AfDB, Sweden and Italy. Withdrawals are based on the
investment program. The repayment terms have been assumed to be 15 years
including a grace period of 3 years, and with an average interest rate of
12%.
19.       Government capital to be increased to Birr 100 million in 1984 in
order to conform--within the 1984-1990 period--to Government proclamation
No. 170 of 1960 requiring ETA not to borrow ftnds in excess of 3 (three)
times the amount of authorized and subscribed capital.
20.       For determining the rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets in operation, assets were revalued at 30% in 1983 and at 6% per
annum in each subsequent year.

SIXTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.        ETA's investment program for the period 1984-1988, of which the
IDA-financed component is an integral part, also includes ongoing and
other works. The close relationship between project and non project
investments makes any attempt at separation arbitary. Therefore, the rate
of return calculation is made on the basis of ETA's entire
telecommunications investment program, excluding preinvestments for the
seventh program.
2.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1984-2004, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
completed its useful life. Account has been taken of investments made
prior to 1984 but yielding benefits during the program period.
As from 1991 on, operating costs and revenues related to the
program are assumed to remain constant. Incremental revenues are based on
expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and on traffic brought
about by the program. Operating costs are based on addition costs
generated by the increases in costs and traffic; they are net of
depreciation and interest. Annual capital replacement costs of about Birr
10 million have been included for the period 1991-2004. No residual values
of fixed assets have been taken into account Eas the present value of these
in real terms would be minimal.
4.        A summary of the program's incremental cost and benefit streams
is given below in Birr millions. All revenues and costs have been deflated
at 10 per annum to bring them to their comparable 1984 price levels.

The internal financial rate of return for the above net benefit stream is
13%.
5.        The above calculation understates the benefits to be derived from
the sixth investment program. It does not take into account consumer
surplus and indirect and external benefits received by non users of the
telecommunications services. A portion of the consumer surplus was
estimated by assuming (a) that new consumers will be similar to the average
existing consumer and (b) that existing and new subscribers will be willing
to pay for telecommunications services the same prices in real terms as
they pay today. Based on these assumptions, adjusting for taxes and
duties, and on applying a standard conversation factor of 0.80 (to local
costs and revenues) a minimum estimate of the economic rate of return for
the program is 34%.
6.        A sensitivity analysis was made on the above financial and
economic rates of return with the following results:
