F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project objective was to build the productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain
watersheds, in ways that sustainably increase productivity and curtail degradation of fragile lands and
ecosystems.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDO was not revised.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The global environmental objective was to entail protection of globally significant mountain ecosystems
by mainstreaming sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation considerations within agricultural
and associated rural investment decisions. This integrated management approach was also to provide
replicable models for comparable areas throughout the country. The GEF objective was mainstreamed
into the overall development objective and outcomes.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The GEO was not revised.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

GDP growth, poverty, and agriculture. Tajikistan has an area of some 141,000 km2 of which some
two-thirds form the foothills and high mountains of the Pamirs. Several regional ethnicities are
represented among its population of 6.3 million. Independence, turmoil and civil war left it among the
poorest countries in the world, but the economy was developing. As of 2000 annual per capita income
was only around US$l80, and some 83% of the population was poor, but during 2000-2003, real GDP
growth ranged from 6.0% to 10.2% per year. Tajikistan is an agrarian society and agriculture is critical
to poverty reduction and economic growth. Some two-thirds of the population was directly dependent
for their living on Tajikistan's 4.6 m ha of agriculture land, of which only about 850,000 ha were arable
lands, and the remaining 3.86 m ha were pasture, fallow lands and meadows.

Highland areas and land degradation. About twenty percent of the population lived in hilly and
mountain areas where access to most government services was limited. Most of the 2.5 m ha
agricultural land they farm was pasture, only 206,000 ha were in perennial crops and orchards, and
there were few significant irrigation systems. Rural poverty, shifts in land management responsibilities,
lack of integrated land management, inappropriate agriculture, and poor access to technical support
were causing increasing land degradation. Much of the population was using steep hillsides to grow
cereal crops. In turn, land degradation contributed to further impoverishment through mudslides
(ruining villages, roads and farmland, and irrigation and water systems), soil-erosion (undermining
agricultural productivity) and silting of waterways used for drinking water and irrigation. However,
highlands had good productive potential if appropriately farmed. In addition to improving life for
people in the highlands, utilizing this potential in sustainable ways would also prevent downstream
damage and relieve pressure on the lowlands.

Mountain ecosystems. Tajikistan had globally important mountain ecosystems with diverse flora and
fauna, including many of economic importance, and under threat. Pastures, for example, hosted over
3,000 plant species, but faced threats from localized over-grazing. The wild-growing fruit plants of
Tajikistan represented a unique genetic resource for agriculture. The mountain territories of southern
and south-eastern Tajikistan were the major regions for conservation of wild-growing fruits (apples,
pears, apricots, mulberries, cherry plums and plums, among others), nuts (walnuts and almonds), grapes
and berries (currants, sea-buckthorn berries). Country’s forest areas, which covered only 3% of the
territory, decreased by about 15% between 1990 and 2000 due to the need for firewood.

Farm privatization. Officially, some 55% of all arable land had been converted into lease farms, joint
stock companies and family farms. However, in lowland cotton growing areas, farmers were still not
free to make their own management decisions, while in highlands they lacked the capital needed to
exploit productive potential. Furthermore, there were also large tracts of pasture, formerly under the
control of state farms, which were under the control of Jamoats. 1 These pastures faced problems of
inadequate maintenance as well as arbitrary and inequitable access to grazing rights and land use. For
details, see Annex 1 of Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

    The Jamoat (sub-district) is lowest official government unit, and usually comprises a number of villages.


                                                       1
Government strategy. The key elements of Tajikistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP)
emphasized accelerated growth, provision of basic social services, and targeted support for the poor and
improved governance. The governance initiatives included more local planning and management,
especially at the Jamoat level. For the agriculture sector, the Government’s strategy supported the
efficient use of, and access of the poor to land, water, financial and other resources, and eliminating
government intervention in private farm decision making. The PRSP also highlighted the regional
dimension to poverty, with the highlands facing special difficulties, especially in the south-east. For the
environment, the PRSP emphasized addressing natural disasters, water pollution, soil degradation,
deforestation and biodiversity conservation. Specific measures related to afforestation, pasture
improvements and protection, development of the institutional frameworks, and mainstreaming of
sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation in agriculture and forestry were considered
government priorities as documented in the National Strategy for Combating Desertification (2002),
and the National Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (2003). Tajikistan was an active party to the
United Nations Conventions: (a) to Combat Desertification (1997); (b) on Biodiversity Conservation
(1997); and (c) on Climate Change (1998).

Government actions. The Government was trying to delegate more authority to Jamoats within a
broader government decentralization strategy and also attempting to implement its agriculture strategy
through programs of farm privatization, irrigation and other rural infrastructure, improved technical
support services, and improved access to rural finance. However, there remained problems of past
reliance on, and vested interests in, top-down control, and lack of accountability. Furthermore, severe
fiscal constraints and a lack of familiarity with incentive frameworks (which could address
shortcomings of regulatory approaches where enforcement capacity was inadequate) limited the extent
of overall program impacts. For details, see Annex 1 of the PAD. Bank projects were directly
supporting the implementation of the Government’s programs focused on agriculture, with particular
attention to developing new, replicable approaches that address the key implementation and
sustainability constraints. Based on this experience, the Government requested the Bank to extend its
support to highland areas.

Rationale for Bank assistance

Bank experience and potential for scaling up. Bank support would build upon the experience, analysis
and relationships already established under its project and sector work, and under programs of other
donors. The Bank had extensive operational experience in local demand-driven approaches to
agricultural development. Past Bank support had also demonstrated the use of field-level pilot
experience to constructively influence crucial policy and legislation. Bank-financed projects within
Tajikistan had already established culturally-appropriate, community-managed models for: (a)
allocation of land use rights in ways which ensure transparency, with participation of the community in
the allocation of parcels, legitimacy (through involvement of traditional local institutions), conflict
management, and land tenure security; (b) management of investments in irrigation infrastructure and
their subsequent operation through Water User’s Associations; (c) establishment of efficient technology
transfer mechanisms through Farmer Information and Advisory Services; and (d) establishment of a
credit mechanism for seasonal agricultural needs through revolving funds via Non-Banking Financing
Organizations. In addition, the Bank was applying best practices and lessons developed by international
NGOs, such as the Agha Khan Foundation (AKF), Mercy Corps International (MCI), German Agro
Action (GAA), ACTED, and Care International. The Bank was also building on United Nations
Development Program’s (UNDP’s) Rural Reconstruction and Development Program (RRDP) initiatives
to strengthen governance at the Jamoat level through Jamoat Development Committees (JDCs)
comprising elected representatives from constituent villages. The Project provided an opportunity to
scale up these models in highland areas, and to strengthen linkages with local and national government.

Value of World Bank support. The Bank’s comparative advantage relative to other donors came from
its ability to work at all levels of the Government, conducting policy dialogue at all levels of
Government – top, line ministry and local officials, and implementation assistance at the line ministry,
and local level. The Bank’s ongoing support to farm privatization and the National Social Investment
Fund of Tajikistan (NSIFT) also complemented the Community Agriculture and Watershed
Management Project (CAWMP). The Bank’s value-added to CAWMP was: (a) providing capital for
productive agriculture and land management investments at a scale beyond what other donors in the
area could mobilize on their own; (b) encouraging community participation in the project design,
implementation, operation, monitoring, and evaluation, building on the experience of projects financed
by the Bank as well as other donors; (c) involving government and developing its capacity to play
appropriate roles that foster the desired outcomes; and (d) experience in implementing similar projects
in other countries (e.g., Turkey, Armenia). The Bank was able to share a wide range international
experience, e.g., business and market development relevant to rural livelihoods, micro finance,
feasibility and operation requirements for rural infrastructure, incentive structures for watershed
management, knowledge generation and dissemination, and development of community institutions.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project objective was to build the productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain
watersheds, in ways that sustainably increase productivity and curtail degradation of fragile lands and
ecosystems.

Outcome indicators. The key outcome indicators comprised:

  1. Eighty percent of farm productivity, land management, and rural infrastructure investments are
successful according to agreed economic, financial, social, and environmental standards, and are being
sustained.
  2. At least half the households where the Project is operating (i.e. 32,000) directly participate in some
part of the rural production component.
  3. Increase in proportion of Project participants who are living above the poverty line from 3% to
30%.
  4. Land and mountain ecosystem degradation trends halted (also pertains to GEF).

  Output indicators. Implementation was to be assessed mainly on the basis of output indicators
including:

  1. Total cumulative investment in agriculture production among Project participants (from initial
grant, local contributions, and reinvestment) exceeds US$3.8 million, i.e., more than the projection of
Project-financed grants and capital infusions (implying high participation, desirable social and
environmental impacts, commercial success, use and repayment of revolving funds).
  2. Land management investments cover 78,000 ha and benefit very poor at least in proportionate to
their numbers in a community (also pertains to GEF).
 3. Number of improved public facilities, disaggregated by type of investment (e.g., village drinking
water, roads, and electricity).
  4. Forty-seven JDCs overseeing rural production investments.
  5. Forty percent of farm production and land management investments apply improved technologies,
and receive good access to necessary inputs and knowledge.


                                                 3
  6. Number of indigenous crop varieties from Project area preserved as live specimens (also pertains
to GEF).
  7. Satisfactory Project administration as indicated by Bank supervision ratings and Project’s public
reputation for integrity.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The global environmental objective was to entail protection of globally significant mountain
ecosystems by mainstreaming sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation considerations within
agricultural and associated rural investment decisions. This integrated management approach was also
to provide replicable models for comparable areas throughout the country. The GEF objective was
mainstreamed into the overall development objective and outcomes.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and

The GEO was not revised. See table above for indicator changes.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries.

The primary beneficiaries were Common interest groups (CIGs), and individuals, since they were the
recipients of subproject grants for projects they identified and proposed.

                                               5
Villages, and their constituencies, also received Project budgets for each of the three types of rural
infrastructure investments.

Participants and members of the various institutional entities that facilitated decision-making, granting
and implementation of subprojects including the: Jamoat Development Committees (JDCs), Facilitators
and Specialists from the Aga Khan Foundation /Mountain Societies Development Support Programme
(AKF/MSDSP), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), Welt Hunger Hilfe (WHH), and other international NGOs, Watershed Development
Committees (WDCs), and Project Coordination Units (PCUs) in each of the four watersheds.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

    Component I: Rural Production Investments. (US$11.9 m)

A. Farm Productivity Improvement: Individuals, and groups of farming households, would invest in
productivity enhancing activities of their choice, most of which would provide immediate income.
Investments could include inputs for annual crops, horticulture, livestock, processing, distribution,
leasing, and credit facilities.

B. Land Resource Management: This subcomponent enabled local people to adopt more sustainable use
of fragile lands that are currently under the jurisdiction of the Jamoat, and provided land use certificates
after three years of maintenance, subject to continued good land use. The combination of appropriate
income-generating investments with soil conservation would enhance the organic content of soil and
create incentives for sustainable land use by better addressing interests of local people. Groups of nine
or more households working on contiguous areas would make long-term investments such as
horticulture, woodlots, or fodder, combined with soil and moisture management structures. Blended
financing from GEF would almost quadruple the land area covered beyond the level that will be
supported by the government on purely national grounds.

C. Rural Infrastructure: Investments to rehabilitate rural infrastructure would be made to community
groups. Typical investments would compliment agriculture and land resource management subprojects,
would be small scale (about $4800 on average), and could include drinking water, small irrigation,
access track rehabilitation, and small power generation.

Contribution Requirements and Budget Constraints. Beneficiaries had to contribute their own resources
in the form of labor, material and cash, for at least 20% of the total value of any investment. Investment
proposals would be prioritized within formulaic fixed budgets for villages based on population. The
share of all one-time, start-up grants to any one household would not exceed $290. Farm productivity
financing in subsequent years would be provided either through reinvestment of retained earnings or
through credit or revolving funds.4 Rural infrastructure would be restricted to productive investments
and include operations and maintenance financing arrangements. They would only be made if no
alternative funding was available from other donor programs such as the National Social Investment
Fund of Tajikistan (NSFT).

    Component II. Institutional Support and Capacity Building. (US$4.3 m)

4
 From the newly created Micro-finance Bank of Tajikistan supported by, existing interest bearing revolving funds
operated locally with donor support, or newly created member owned revolving funds building on the model
developed under the World Bank-financed Farm Privatization Support Project (FPSP).

                                                   6
A. Research and Demonstration: This subcomponent helped scientific institutions and line ministries to
provide technical services including training to communities. It would include support for seed and
seedling production, livestock breeding and animal health and husbandry improvements, and market
and enterprise analysis and development. Participating agencies included the Tajikistan Agricultural
Research System (for research and extension and including preservation of live plant specimens in
collaboration with the Consultative Group For International Agricultural Research’s (CGIAR) Central
Asia and Caucasus (CAC) unit in Tashkent). The Farmer’s Training Center, Ministry of Agriculture and
other Ministries and the State Committees such as Statistical Service, and Land Committee would also
benefit. Blended GEF financing would support the preservation of indigenous crop and other specimens.

B. Community Mobilization and Subproject Preparation: This subcomponent included training and
facilitation for Jamoat Development Committees (JDCs) as well as households and common interest
groups with support of local facilitators (contracted through international NGOs). It also included
support for small confidence building mobilization grants for each village, plus information and
experience sharing. Blended GEF financing enabled the planning and sharing associated with the
additional land resource management investments.

    Component III. Project Management: (US$3.6 m)

This component supported project coordination, procurement, disbursement, financial management,
reporting, monitoring, and evaluation, at both the national level and for each of the four Project
watershed areas. It built on project administration capacity and arrangements that already existed for
ongoing Bank-financed projects. The component also supported the secretariat services provided to the
State Level Steering Committee (SLSC) and the Watershed Development Committees (WDCs). The
component supported:

    •   National Project Management Unit,
    •   Project Coordination Units for the four watersheds, and
    •   Evaluation

1.8 Revised Components

Components were not revised; however various planned targets were modified during implementation
upon realization of on-the-ground conditions. For example, at the time of the Mid-term Review in 2008
(MTR), the Bank team concluded that, “The number of households directly benefiting from subproject
investments is likely to at least meet the original target of 32,000, even though the total number of
households living in the participating villages is likely to be 57,375 compared to the appraisal target of
62,000 because the percent of direct beneficiaries is higher than expected. The number of participating
villages is likely to be 409, compared to the appraisal target of 404, and the number of Jamoats is likely
to be 39, compared to the appraisal target of 47. The number of villages per Jamoat was higher than
anticipated and, together with higher than anticipated costs of facilitation support and of JDC/JRC
support, this has increased the unit cost of project support per Jamoat.?

1.9 Other significant changes

A few minor restructurings occurred during the Project. Changes in expenditure financing percentages
and reallocations between expenditure categories were made in the Development Financing Agreement
(DFA) and GEF Grant Agreements in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011. A Project extension closing date of
one year was approved from April 30, 2011 to April 30, 2012 for the IDA credit – to: (a) enable the

                                                 7
Project to address further requirements related to irrigation, pasture management, and market
development; and (b) complete the impact evaluation and to disseminate findings. In April 2011 several
revisions were made to ensure that past legal amendments and current updates of the cost estimates
were accurately and consistently reflected in the official financing and cost data. For example, as of
April 2011, costs were lower than expected at the MTR due in part to changes in the exchange rate and
also because some of the specific activities expanded less than expected (e.g., micro-finance,
discretionary budget for subprojects, expansion of Facilitating Organization support), or had lower unit
costs (e.g., PMU staff expenses).

Similarly, the financing plan was updated (April, 2011) to reflect previous revisions, taking into
account updated estimates of the Government counterpart expenditures, as well as fluctuations in the
US$ equivalent value of the IDA Credit and Grant. The update also corrected earlier estimates of
Government counterpart (and hence the total amount of financing) which did not correctly reflect the
Government financing requirements associated with the agreed IDA and GEF financing disbursement
percentages.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project background analysis was satisfactory. Background preparation took into account the World
Bank’s previous engagements on land management, tenure security and poverty alleviation in
Tajikistan (e.g., the Farm Privatization Support Project (FPSP), Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (RIRP), Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP), Second Poverty Alleviation Project, and also
from Turkey’s Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Program).



                                                8
The Project also drew from the experience of other donor activities and developed a new model that
took into account several important lessons:

The participatory process cannot be target driven. The design of the institutional structure and sub-
granting mechanisms clearly demonstrated a participatory approach whereby the ideas came from
individuals – and the CIGs were instrumental in bringing together people and ideas. This was in
contrast to the past where most activities focused on humanitarian aid rather than support for rural
agricultural production – which was a foreign concept for local people. Ultimately, changing this
perception and attitude became one of the more important challenges at implementation.

Design and implementation should build on existing mechanisms with suitable external TA. The Project
drew on the existing institutions – such as the JDCs built under the UNDP Rural Reconstruction and
Development Program – and reinvigorated them towards a new development goal. JDCs continued their
existing decision-making capacity, but were transformed to act as a clearinghouse for CIG and village
investments, identify new sources of funding and facilitate clearances and registrations for subprojects
(see Annex 6 in PAD for details on their role). Other NGOs were engaged as facilitators to assist
villagers in preparing proposals and JDCs in monitoring and activities.

Training should be timely and appropriate. Training as a prerequisite before investment was integral to
sustainability – since local knowledge contained gaps in more modern and environmentally-sustainable
techniques. For example, individuals participated in training of pasture management and animal
husbandry by the Institute of Husbandry Tajik Academy of Sciences and the Agrarian University of
Tajikistan.

Long-term sustainability requires community involvement early on and full awareness of the level of
operating expenses that will be required to maintain the investment. Participation by and consultation
of local communities and individuals at the outset better ensured the financial sustainability of
investments. The financial management aspect of farm and rural investments was part of the initial
training package to precede investment.

All stakeholders need to be included. Project preparation activities involved all key stakeholders:
national, raion and Jamoat level authorities; NGOs; local communities including village elders,
mahalla, farmers, livestock owners, and women. Key stakeholders who would be involved directly in
the Project include village leaders and village members, women, local government representatives,
technical staff of the line ministries located primarily at the raion level, and staff of the PIUs and
existing PMU at the central level. NGOs would provide technical assistance during the facilitation and
proposal development phase at the village level and JDCs would act as decision-makers and comprise
of elected officials from the communities.

The rationale for Bank intervention was sound. Inclusive to the rationale provided in section 1.9, the
Bank was well-positioned to undertake a bottom-up approach from its experience in local institution
building, community-driven and participatory methods and the ability of providing sufficient resources
to make an impact (scale). The World Bank sought high-level support such that Project outcomes and
recommendations could be factored into higher-level decision-making and reform. For example, this
was particularly important for the continued effort of issuing land certificates to individuals – which, at
the outset of the Project, was a slow, uncertain and cumbersome process.

Project design was generally sound. Project components were designed appropriately around the
overall objectives with an emphasis on improving rural production (retained earnings) and meeting
rural infrastructure needs at a local level. To effectively enable and sustain investments there was
sufficient allocation given to the components on institutional support and capacity building – especially

                                                 9
on research and demonstration which had been shown to be one of the most effective ways in
conveying best practice. The geographical target areas were known to be very poor and vulnerable with
relatively few income or diversification opportunities. The social assessment surveyed individuals in
the watershed areas of Zerafshan, Surkhob and Toirsu identifying opportunities and institutional
structures that could be developed to support Project objectives – while respecting the traditional
informal institutions for collective action like the hashars 5 – organized through traditional leadership
structures of the mahalla. 6 A considerable amount of thought and effort was then put into the
development of the implementation arrangements through the system of institutions and stakeholders to
ensure investments would remain locally-driven and screened by a transparent member body (JDCs)
and process (see Annex 6 of the PAD on Implementation Arrangements).

Project alternatives were rejected on sound reasoning. By focusing on highland areas the focus was on
the poorest experiencing the most severe land degradation – but complementing existing lowland area
initiatives. Rather than working solely with village-level institutions – the Project strengthened Jamoat-
level institutions to better coordinate community initiatives. This was also viewed as a more efficient
and cost-effective method than supporting every village. But in this regards, granting funds from the
bottom-up was also considered a better model than the previous top-down approaches – where the
record of such investments was uncertain.

Most risks were adequately identified and rated; mitigation measures were adequate. Risks identified
in the PAD were adequately supported by mitigation plans – however several came to fruition despite
best efforts (more on this below). Some risks are inherent in Community-Driven Development (CDD)
schemes and given the lack of experience with this form of support in Tajikistan at the time – a more
robust set of mitigation alternatives could have been developed as backup plans.

2.2 Implementation

All outcome and intermediate targets were exceeded before Project closing. This includes the key
outcome indicators of the percentage of successful and sustainable rural production investments (85%),
number of participating households (>43,000), percentage of the population above the poverty line in
Project villages (30%), and the number of participating villages (402). It also includes the area of land
under sustainable management (GEO indicator: 96,000 ha). Many of these targets had sufficient
momentum even by the MTR in 2008. The main contributing factor in realizing these outcomes were
the arrangements at the watershed level including partnerships between villages, common interest
groups, JDCs/JRCs, Project Coordination Units (PCUs), WDCs and Facilitating Organizations (FOs).
Effective coordination, although inexperienced at first, eventually took hold as demonstrations and first
entrants were observed and lessons learned.

In terms of challenges there was an initial one-year lag in activity due to a combination of reasons. First,
there was inexperience within the PMU in contracting Facilitating Organizations and unfamiliarity with
the Project’s concepts and innovative partnership arrangements. The response was to increase capacity
in financial management and procedures that were congruent with Tajikistan’s accounting methods and
to seek clarity on the roles and responsibilities of FOs. Second, there were differences of interpretation
in Project design and procedures among the output-based partnerships with the FOs (AKF/MSDSP,

 Hashars are Tajik community groups that get together to work on community projects that benefits everyone,
such as improving the roads or cutting hay that everyone can use.
6
 Traditional mahalla/jamiyat institutions are the most important organizing force in project area hamlets. The
community selects their leaders somewhat democratically, although about half the leaders typically make
decisions by themselves, while the remainders make decisions through councils or hamlet-wide discussions.

                                                  10
FAO, UNDP and WHH). Subsequent meetings orienting the FOs to the objectives and procedures
resulted in a more effective arrangement after the first year. Thirdly, there was an initial lack of
understanding at the local level of the procedures outlined in the Operational Manual for environmental
analysis, business plans and the design of rural infrastructure. This resulted in the FOs and PMUs
playing more hands on role during the first trials in each area. Ultimately, by the MTR, many of these
issues had been resolved and disbursement increased significantly.

The Project was identified as a potential problem project in the first few years because of a lagging
Component 1, but actions taken on both the World Bank and counterpart side guided the Project on
track. Minor restructurings took place – but mostly pertained to reallocations across expenditure
categories and simplifying disbursement procedures (see section 1.9).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The key outcome and intermediate performance indicators listed in section 1.2 were adequate in
tracking progress towards achieving the PDO and GEO, although indicator #4, “Land and mountain
ecosystem degradation trends halted? appeared ambitious through the rather expensive methods
suggested in the PAD (Annex 3). Revisions to the indicators were undertaken at the time of the MTR
reflecting implementation experience such as changing coverage to 39 Jamoats from 47 due to cost
considerations as well as the base number of households. These changes were reflected in amended
supplemental letter to the DFA.

Design. The M&E framework was designed to measure results at a very local scale – hence sufficient
capacity would have to be built at the Jamoat-level. Project progress and outcomes were measured
through feedback mechanisms suited to limited capacity and challenging conditions. Data collection
methods included regular progress and financial reporting by Project partners, field supervision visits
and partner workshops. Project and watershed-level assessments were also conducted, and a final
impact evaluation was planned. The PAD suggested the contracting of an M&E and financial specialist
at the JDC-level, however these functions were eventually separated with one financial and one M&E
JDC specialist. The initial design for some aspects of M&E was ambitious given the cost and local
capacity to implement them. For example the use of satellite imagery to measure land degradation
trends was beyond local IT capacity, let alone costs. Other measurable indicators through direct
observation, or field visits, were more practical and resulted in more timely monthly reports that aided
implementation.

Implementation. Monthly reporting was undertaken by all major Project partners that allowed for
Project management to aggregate data and findings. This was especially important given the scale of
interventions and scope of Project coverage. For example, the challenges posed with monitoring land
degradation (cost and capacity) resulted in the decision to change the indicator to measure the aggregate
area covered by subprojects and other project activities which directly support sustainable land
management (see section 1.4). The Project made use of central and site-based project units, along with
Project partners such as NGOs and research institutions to record, measure and verify results. A central
database of rural investments was maintained with qualitative and photographic data collected to
improve data quality and analysis as well as overall Project assessments.

Overall monitoring was assessed as satisfactory throughout most of the Project, except in a couple of
instances where environmental monitoring needed strengthening. One unfortunate circumstance, by the
time of the MTR, was the inability of the contracted socio-economic survey to generate data of
sufficient quality and quantity for a comprehensive project baseline. Poor communication with the
consultants about required tasks and significant cultural/academic differences about what constitutes
primary baseline data useful for Project monitoring and evaluation purposes contributed to the generally

                                                11
inadequate data and associated analysis. In response, an effort was made to collect sufficient secondary
information at the raion-and watershed-levels in order to establish some baselines.

Utilization. M&E data contributed to adaptive management in the Project, e.g., systematic use of the
Results Framework and careful review of its underlying assumptions led to MTR corrections. M&E
data were also used to share project concepts, results and lessons learned with government, donors and
civil society. Data utilization, and its feedback into project implementation, was crucial in measuring
progress towards the PDO and GEO. For example, by the time of the MTR it was evident that covering
47 Jamoats was basically not affordable and would stretch resources far too thin – so the decision was
made to focus on only 39. M&E was integral in tracking the outcomes from thousands of subproject
proposals, where information on successes (or failures) could be replicated (or avoided) in other areas.
It was important to identify and highlight positive demonstrations that could replicate best practice.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. The PMU was staffed by a Chief Accountant, an accounting assistant and
supported by the FM specialist. Financial management received unqualified (clean) audits throughout
the Project’s life and delivered regular reports that informed project management, but began to struggle
just before the MTR and was rated moderately satisfactory thereafter. This was due to several reasons.
First, and as mentioned above, some delays were due to the PMU’s inexperience with contracting FOs
and this led to delays in direct fund-flows to the JDCs in the earlier years. Difficulties in finding
technical assistance in this area also contributed to the delays. Subsequent training and experience with
these types of granting mechanisms eventually rectified the issue. Second, regular Financial
Management Reports (FMRs) identified deficiencies in IFR reporting, weak controls at some points or
discrepancies that were not fully explained. Thirdly, the recommended accounting software (1C) was
never fully capable of providing timely and accurate reports in the manner which was acceptable to the
Bank – which meant a lot of manual work in spreadsheets – leading to delays and some inaccuracies.
Frequent technical support was necessary and only came up to standard by the end of the Project. While
each of these issues was eventually dealt with – the chain of events kept financial management from
achieving a satisfactory rating.

Counterpart financing was lower than originally agreed also at the MTR (US$0.59 million versus
US$0.74 million) and replenishments were delayed a few times – although it did not severely
jeopardize implementation. Part of this was connected to the financial crisis (beginning in 2009) when
austerity measures led to smaller allocations being transferred. This required frequent monitoring to
ensure it was not in violation of the counterpart financing parameters in the DFA.

Procurement. According to the PAD, procurement had both centralized and decentralized roles. The
PMU had the overall responsibility for the Project, including the management and supervision of
Project procurement activities. Procurement of Component 1 activities was carried out by the common
interest groups (CIGs) and households undertaking subprojects, with community participation in
accordance with the Operational Manual (OM). The PMU, in collaboration with the PCUs and JDCs,
was responsible for providing guidance and supervision necessary to ensure that CIGs and households
procure in accordance with procedures outlined in the Operational Manual. A memorandum of
understanding (MOU) between the JDC and the subproject beneficiary was used to address
procurement aspects. The PMU was staffed with a full-time procurement specialist; however this
person was initially divided among other projects until the MTR which contributed to the lagging
procurement performance outlined below.

Due to the lack of clarity of contracting FOs in the initial stages and a lack of understanding at the CIG-
level of OM procedures, procurement experienced delays for the first two years of the Project and was

                                                12
subsequently downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory by 2006. This affected fund
flows to Component 1 subprojects and to the overall downgrading of the Project. In response, internal
capacity was quickly built up through extensive training and the FO contracting and OM issues were
resolved by consultations with FOs and the CIGs. By the MTR these major issues were no longer
present and procurement performance remained satisfactory until the end of Project. A multi-project
fiduciary review conducted in 2009 commended the community procurement of rural investment
projects under the Project.

Disbursement. Overall disbursements were ahead of original expectation by 2007, however Component
1 flows to subprojects were delayed because of the implementation issues raised above. By the time of
the MTR, this was no longer an issue and all funds were fully disbursed by project closing.

Environmental Assessment. For Environmental Assessment (EA) purposes the Project was rated
“category FI? under the World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.01, since the Project involved funds for
subprojects selected by the communities during implementation. The environmental impact of the
Project activities were expected to be largely positive and would not involve any major construction
requiring resettlement, land acquisition, or invest in the construction of dams, new canals or head works
that would allow for increased water abstraction. The EA included an assessment of the benefits and
risks of project activities and an environmental monitoring subcomponent and Pesticide Management
Plan (PMP) for compliance with OP 4.09; because activities would be supporting agricultural
production.

The Environmental Assessment was discussed in consultation (2003) with stakeholders in each of the
Project watersheds, as well as at the national level with participation of local people, representatives of
local authorities, line agencies, other government officials, and NGOs. The Project provided support for
a full-time Environmental Specialist tasked with implementing the environmental monitoring of
activities and compliance with safeguards, as well as training programs for line agency staff, subproject
proponents, other stakeholders, and equipment for simple environmental analysis and monitoring.

Compliance with OP 4.01 and OP 4.09 was rated satisfactory throughout most of Project
implementation with a few exceptions, the first in 2007 when the Environment Manual required
updating and greater attention paid to the implementation of the environmental monitoring of
subprojects. In 2008 the PMP was urgently needed to be in place because there was anecdotal evidence
of certain pesticides being recommended by advisors – which could have violated OP 4.09. In addition
a full-time Environmental Specialist was not internalized until 2009; relying on part-time consultants
before this. By 2010 environmental monitoring activities were well underway delivering important
information on the amount of land under sustainable management and compliance with safeguards. In
addition, training in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has also been completed to instill knowledge
on more environmentally-friendly techniques to pest management – than through the use of pesticides
and excessive use of fertilizers.

Social Safeguards. No social safeguards were triggered by the Project – but public participation was
rated highly satisfactory throughout the Project due to the focus of Component 1 on local communities.
A Social Assessment was undertaken for the PAD (Annex 17) including a survey among individuals in
Project watershed areas. The Project was expected to result in increased equity, community
empowerment and social inclusion – and central to this was greater gender equity in decision-making.
A core indicator on gender was added to the Results Agreement after the MTR – and although crudely
measured - showed that approximately 40 percent of subproject beneficiaries were women.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


                                                13
Sustainability. The Project’s design of inclusive community-driven development contributes to the
sustainability of rural investments. Decisions were made at the local level on what investments to
implement, who should benefit and the distribution of financial resources across Component 1
categories thus building ownership. Capacity was internalized since villagers were responsible for
financial management and procurement of investments and took into consideration economic,
environmental and social/institutional considerations. For example, they had to provide evidence of
cash flow and cost recovery arrangements for 3-10 years depending on the type of investment,
environmental conservation and mitigation measures, and the establishment of organizations such as
water user associations to support long-term operations. The beneficiary contribution requirement
(which eventually totaled US$3.4 million) also helped build ownership and contributed to the
sustainability of these investments.

Replicability. Demonstration is one of the most powerful mechanisms for learning and the Project
generated numerous examples of this. First, the CIG decision-making model itself with inclusive and
representative coordination of subprojects demonstrated that CDD investments can indeed be
undertaken, even in a social context more familiar with only humanitarian aid. Second, pilots in specific
areas resulted in knowledge of what worked and what did not. This knowledge can now be used within
the community to replicate successes that benefit the individual and the environment. Third, by
operating at a watershed and Jamoat level – cross-fertilization of ideas can spread even further than
traditional boundaries.

The Government’s commitment in sustaining and replicating the success of CAWMP is also
demonstrated through its recent consideration of the Environmental Land Management and Rural
Livelihoods Project (ELMARL) to be jointly co-financed through the Pilot Program for Climate
Resilience (PPCR) and the GEF. Modeled after CAWMP – it will include components on building rural
productive assets, including sub-components similar to those under Component 1 of CAWMP and local
knowledge management that will support rural populations in planning, implementing and managing
rural investments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project’s objectives were aligned with country-level priorities in the PRSP and World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007 at the time (see PAD, page 5-6) and remain so today.
Objectives are also consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy’s 2010-2013(recently
extended until 2014) goal of reducing constraints to a post-crisis recovery and sustained economic
growth (page 16) which includes increasing the productivity of physical assets such as land, water and
human capital. It is also aligned with the objective of agricultural reform viewed as being critical to
enhance productive capacity and reduce rural poverty (pages 17-18). Each of these falls under the
overarching CPS pillar of paving the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development (page 27).

The Project’s objectives are also aligned with strategies and policies of the Government of Tajikistan.
The National Development Strategy (2015) and Poverty Reduction Strategy III (2012) both emphasize
the need to promote economic growth, especially in rural areas, and recognize the importance of
addressing environmental issues, including land management, for the country’s development and
poverty reduction goals. The government is also working to expand agricultural capacity through
measures to improve land tenure security and independent farm management through its Freedom to
Farm policy. The National Environmental Action Plan also states that a primary challenge for the
country is land degradation, including deterioration of pasturelands, arable and irrigated lands and
forests.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

Project Development Objectives were achieved as indicated by the percentage of sustainable
subprojects (85%) and by the area of Project land now under sustainable land management (96,600 ha)
(outcome indicators #1 and #4). Indicative Component 1 investments included livestock production,
poultry farming, bee-keeping and horticulture (see Annex 2 for details). The cumulative number of

                                                    15
households in Project areas that undertook rural investments was greater than 43,000 (outcome
indicator #2) and of those 50 percent are now above the poverty line (outcome indicator #3).

The Global Environmental Objective of integrating sustainable principles into agricultural and rural
development decisions was achieved through 1) the number of hectares under sustainable land
management (96,600), 2) integration of environmental monitoring and impact assessment into rural
subprojects, and 3) through the replication of best practice to other areas of the country - over 9,000
trained (intermediate indicator #4). Another globally relevant outcome was the preservation and
documentation of live indigenous plant specimens. Several expeditions were made by the Institute of
Botany resulting in the identification of over 300 endemic and rare plant species including fruit trees.
The Institute also updated the Tajikistan Red Book with their findings.

Other specific outputs supporting each outcome indicator are detailed in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

The economic and financial analysis conducted in the PAD analyzed how farm productivity
improvements could translate into increased retained earnings and thus reducing the percentage of
people below the poverty line. With the Project, the proportion of Project participants above the poverty
line would increase to 44% by 2011. Detailed monitoring information at the farm-level of productivity
gains was not available for comparison – however improvements in income were estimated as part of
monitoring and evaluation activities. Outcome indicator #3 shows that approximately 50 percent of
Project beneficiaries are above the poverty line – suggesting that the Project was economically efficient
and effective.

A GEF incremental cost analysis (ICA) was also undertaken at the time of appraisal in order to justify
GEF funding (see PAD Annex 15). The baseline cost of the Project was US$14.4 million with an
incremental cost to be supported by the GEF of US$5.4 million. 7 The Project cost at closing was
US$11.42 million (IDA Credit, IDA Grant, and borrower) with beneficiaries contributing US$3.4
million (in-kind, but even more than projected) along with contributions from FOs 8 and other grants.9
Project targets were exceeded in all instances, thus the realized benefits were greater than initially
estimated – and at a lower overall project cost. Thus, the Project can be considered efficient. For details
see Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The PDO and GEO remain highly relevant for local rural development and global environmental
protection and in meeting the objectives of the Government of Tajikistan and the World Bank. The
PDO was achieved, and surpassed in all outcome and intermediate indicators, and the GEO was
achieved through the integration of sustainable land management practices at the local level and in rural

 It was assumed that the GEF contribution (US$4.5 million) would also leverage US$0.9 million in beneficiary
support for a total of US$5.4 million.

development decision-making. Overall Project costs were lower than anticipated, beneficiary
contributions exceeded expectations, and thus results were achieved in a cost-effective manner.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty, gender and social development were all part of the objectives of the CAWMP. Poverty, as
indicated above was reduced among Project participants. Female participation in subprojects was also a
main goal of the Project and as outcome indicator #7 suggests over 40% of project beneficiaries were
women. Social development can be defined in this context as expanding participatory methods (a la
CDD) in decision making through the CIG model. Greater social cohesion can also be claimed through
the sharing of experiences and interactions across Jamoats and watersheds.

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The model introduced under the Project was completely new for Tajikistan. It was contrary to the
humanitarian aid-type of development that rural communities and the donor community was use to. In
this regard, institutional strengthening occurred at many levels. First, at the local- and watershed-levels
through the participatory methods of the CIG model mentioned above, it built local knowledge of best
practice not only in productive asset building, but also with business plans, fiduciary requirements and
environmental impacts. Second, the Project also supported increased knowledge at the PMU and
Government levels of how bottom-up approaches can be successful. Finally, among other donors – it
demonstrated a new way of doing development in a country where a substantial proportion of the
population live in rural areas and that local empowerment can improve livelihoods - if the will is there.

       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In 2010 the CAWMP won the World Bank award for “Improving the Lives of People in the Europe and
Central Asia Region?. The Project was recognized for its achievements in improving rural livelihoods,
increasing agriculture production, improving land resource management including pasture improvement,
rural infrastructure rehabilitation, and involving the rural population.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A comprehensive survey of beneficiaries was not undertaken however interviews were conducted with
a representative sample of subprojects. These are summarized in Annex 5.

An important, and related, study on Farmer and Farm Worker Perceptions of Land Reform and
Sustainable Agriculture was undertaken in 2011 to examine farmer perceptions in Project areas 10 that
supported farmland restructuring and sustainable agricultural land management practices among rural
households. Several CAWMP areas were surveyed and it was found that farmers do indeed perceive
improvements in their livelihoods and “Freedom to Farm?. 11 The executive summary is also attached in
Annex 5.


10
  Project areas of several projects including: World Bank - Land Registration and Cadastre System for
Sustainable Agriculture Project (LRCSP); World Bank - CAWMP; USAID – Land Reform Project in Tajikistan
(LRPT); DFID – The Rural Growth Program (RGP – 2010-2012).
11
     That is, farmers feel as though they have control over the use of their land; and the farming decisions they make.

                                                       17
Numerous workshops were held over the life of the Project – on demonstration, training, methods, Bank
procedures, etc. In terms of outreach the PMU was also very active and disseminated many types of
information to the rest of the project constituency. These are summarized in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate

As outlined under sustainability and replicability the objectives of CAWMP remain a priority for the
Government and it is likely that support in these areas will continue. Many of the realized benefits at
the local-level are cost effective and likely to be sustained through self-initiative in preserving retained
earnings. The new World Bank project (ELMARL) will build on the achievements and lessons learned
under CAWMP to expand support for climate change resilience (under grant funding from the PPCR).
The Government’s commitment under the National Development Strategy (2015) and Poverty
Reduction Strategy III (2012) also targets rural areas and agriculture as a central focal point.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank identified an area of support that was and remains relevant to Tajikistan, rural livelihoods,
sustainable land management, as well as with the global commons (biodiversity conservation). Core
Project activities focused on supporting a bottom-up, participatory approach that would instill local
ownership of subproject investments and build capacity to ensure its sustainability from an economic,
social and environmental perspective. The balance of components was appropriate – giving greater
weight to subproject investments but supported through sufficient capacity building efforts in
Component 2. The scope was ambitious, at a scale that could demonstrate results and drew on lessons
elsewhere - but Tajikistan remained untested ground for CDD-type projects.

The Bank correctly identified institutional capacity issues as a significant risk at the outset of the
Project and had mitigation plans in place however it may have underestimated the extent to which this
was true (more on this under Section 6. implementation). Given the rather complex institutional
framework to implement subprojects - it might have been worthwhile to do an institutional analysis to
identify possible facilitating and contracting constraints to the CDD model.

       (b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
       Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank closely supervised Project implementation through semi-annual (or more frequent) missions
and, fiduciary reviews and also maintained a constructive dialogue between the PMU, the PCUs, JDCs,
WDCs, FOs and other stakeholders. Issues raised were addressed in a timely manner and were candidly
reported in official documentation – along with critical path milestones. 12 For example, when delays in
subproject flows appeared, an emphasis was placed on strengthening weak areas such as procurement


12
     The Aide Memoires were thoroughly detailed and noted for identifying issues and their resolution.

                                                      18
and training was initiated to support this gap. However, overemphasis on subproject fund flows led to a
lack of focus on other components such as environmental monitoring and this became an issue by time
of the MTR. 13

The Bank maintained focus on the fulfillment of Project objectives, and these were met or surpassed in
many cases, but the underestimation of local capacity was a cause for slow disbursement and
procurement issues in the beginning. Unfamiliarity with contracting FOs in this context proved to be
problematic since there was no precedent in these types of contracts and when combined with the local
unfamiliarity with the OM implementation lags were encountered. This translated into greater attention
being paid to the fund flow issues from 2005-2007. Greater guidance to the PMU on how to resolve
these issues was warranted.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Satisfactory

World Bank support to the Government of Tajikistan in preparing and implementing the Project is rated
as satisfactory largely due to its relative responsiveness to issues and adaptation to unpredictable
circumstances. Closer attention to local capacity issues – and their appropriate resolution such as an
institutional analysis may have greater impact on mitigating this risk.

5.2 Borrower Performance

       (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Satisfactory

Government was supportive of the Project and provided the necessary facilities for project management
and coordination, including field facilities. The Ministry of Agriculture, State Land Committee,
Committee on Environmental Protection and State Committee on Investments provided regular
assistance to support implementation of Project activities. The State Land Committee also provided
assistance to the Project for the issuance of Land Use Rights certificates for Project beneficiaries.
However, Government counterpart funding delays were encountered during the economic crisis (around
2009) and eventually led to a slight under-commitment according to the DFA.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PMU, as the main implementing agency, remained committed to the Project and provided
satisfactory support to the JDCs, WDCs, and CIGs on daily issues and in resolving problems. This was
evident from the many interactions with stakeholders to resolve issues such as the FO contracting issue
and the lack of understanding by CIGs on the OM. In some instances there were changes in staff or
vacant positions that led to some delays. For example the Environmental Specialist position for
environmental monitoring purposes was occupied only on a part-time basis until 2010 and at times
other specialists were divided among other projects. While the PMU was experienced in certain areas,
the country itself had little or no experience with CDD-type projects which hindered progress in the
first few years. The PMU was able to overcome most procurement and monitoring issues, but some
financial management issues persisted throughout the entire Project. Renewed efforts, momentum and


13
     Of course, it should also be understood that a lack of subprojects meant little to monitor and evaluate.

                                                        19
subproject flow after the MTR demonstrated the PMU’s significant contribution to the Project in
meeting, and exceeding, its targets.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory taking into account the PMU’s
commitment to achieving the PDO, GEO and the Government’s support of the Project. Despite the
initial two-year lag in subproject granting, actions taken by the PMU and local stakeholders led to the
achievement of the PDO and GEO. The rating is moderately satisfactory - the lower of the two
individual ratings on Government and Implementing Agency Performance ratings as per ICR
Guidelines.

6. Lessons Learned

Project design

Direct investment support to farmers through a systematic small grants program, coupled with
facilitation and training built entrepreneurial capacity through a learning-by-doing approach. Farmers
assumed responsibility for sustaining their livelihoods in financially and environmentally sound ways.
This move toward self-reliance represents a dramatic shift from the culture of dependency associated
initially with Soviet-era subsidies and then post-conflict emergency food aid.

Participatory planning along with village and household budget limits was an effective mechanism for
villagers to prioritize and assess risks of various options, as well as allocate resources. Furthermore,
open disclosure of available funds and amounts allocated to investments improved accountability. To
further disseminate this aspect, the process and results need to be documented and then shared widely
with government, donors and other implementing agencies and organizations so that similar measures
can be included in future planning processes.

A multi-stakeholder approach to project implementation was worthwhile even in the Tajik context
where limited prior experience and local conditions made management challenging. In addition to
generating expected project outcomes, this approach improved project transparency and accountability,
increased respect for partners’ strengths and provided new learning opportunities for Project
participants. New forms of collaboration between government, international agencies, NGOs, scientists,
and local community groups highlighted their respective strengths, e.g., there is greater respect for the
capacities of villagers and traditional knowledge. The learning process has been experiential with
project partners sharing good practice, e.g., site and personnel exchanges.

Right of Use of Land Certificates (RULC) is key for sustainability, especially for land-related
subprojects in CAWMP and for other similar initiatives. According the CAWMP design the RULC
should be issued after 3 years of successful using of subproject (land). However, during Project
implementation and the RULC issuance process - it was evident that the RULC should be given after 1
year after subproject startup or less. This increases the confidence of farmers to use the land as a real
user and owner, and the certificates should be issued without delay.

Although it was not in the Project objectives to address broader policy and legal issues related to
pastures and rangelands, sustainable rangeland management will require policy and legal support
informed by practical, field-based examples and experiences such as those implemented in CAWMP.
The Project reduced overgrazing pressure locally within villages’ territories through several types of

                                                20
subprojects and demonstrated activities contributed to sustainable rangeland management. Grazing
rights are a sensitive topic because it involves several types of farmers with potentially conflicting
interests (family farmer, sheep farmer, Dehkan farms, and commercial private stock breeder) and might
require new legislation and /or law enforcement.

Research and demonstration of appropriate technologies can be integrated differently at Project design.
The success of the Farmers Competition shows that agricultural innovation and good practice can be
demonstrated and shared in an efficient and effective way. While research institutes have shown limited
practical skills for small-scale, upland farms in terms of approach, new technology introduction is still a
high priority as it increases the value of subprojects even though this may be risky in terms of adoption.

New technologies / varieties can be tested first on farmer’s plots, demonstrating their value before
sharing with local authorities and other interested parties. A more practical approach is Farmer Field
Schools at the raion (Jamoat) level – reproducing actual farm conditions. The linkage is stronger
between research (NGO, institute) – demonstrations (farmer’s plot with the assistance of FO &
Hukumat) – and dissemination (demonstration by farmers and Fos). In addition, linking these activities
with government programs or priorities may help to some extent encourage Hukumat authorities to keep
engaged at the end of a project. It should be noted that these types of activities will require international
assistance of the type that was planned under CAWMP from IFAD and ICARDA.

The Project would have benefitted from greater marketing expertise (e.g., value chain development,
association formation). Some CIG products reaching commercial scale such as fruit, vegetables, honey,
etc. require knowledge on effective marketing.

Female participation can be strengthened through additional processes during planning. Women
beneficiaries were positively represented in CIGs with 40% of beneficiaries listed as female but the
approach from the beneficiaries’ point of view appeared at times to be filling ‘quotas’ than reflecting
women’s concerns. Taking into account local-cultural circumstances, it may be possible to focus on
gender specific credibility grants, gender-oriented participatory planning resulting in a more integrated
community action plan and subprojects focusing on women’s strengths.

Implementation

The scope and scale of JDC mandates is effective for delivering services to upland, and often more
remote, farmers. In CAWMP sub-district level organizations proved to be an effective component of
scaling-up strategies for SLM in a challenging physical landscape. In the Project 39 JDC’s handled
more than 3,800 CIGs and over US$7.0 mln. in fund transfers. Additionally, participatory processes
helped ensure that organizations such as JDCs worked effectively with government management units
to deliver technical and financial resources to farmers. Future efforts should maintain a focus on
strengthening sub-district level support to farmers with scaling-up strategies requiring investment in
institutional arrangements. It will be important to ensure that participatory processes, including
financial management mechanisms, are well integrated into SLM programs.

Contracting other organizations (e.g., FOs) requires clarity in procedures and Project objectives – up
front. The Project experienced wide variation amongst the FOs in terms of the conditions, level of
funding and support. Part of this was explained by the lack of a coherent and consistent mandate that
could have been resolved through comprehensive introductory workshops or seminars.

At PIU level, it would be beneficial to have an M&E specialist so as to relieve PMU monitoring efforts.
Monitoring at the PCU level was primarily of financial aspects with little attention on analyzing the
Project implementation pace, suggesting improvements or monitoring of impact. M&E and financial

                                                 21
specialists tended to be reactive to PMU M&E requirements and not proactive. At the same time, any
future M&E efforts also need to take into account the limited capacities and skills available in field
locations as well as salary scales for government jobs.

A simpler and clearer operational manual for rural investment preparation would have been more
effective. The manual was very comprehensive and relatively clear for professional staff but for
villagers, especially the less well-educated, it posed difficulties. The requirements for environmental
analysis, the business plan and the design and calculations of rural infrastructure were not well
understood at Project start-up. This resulted in JDC and FOs often preparing the proposals for those
beneficiaries, leading to delays in preparation and/or grant approval because the information provided
by CIGs was incomplete. Future guidelines must accommodate the skill levels of these beneficiaries
with clearer and simpler guidelines for environmental analysis and feasibility assessment. Similarly, the
proposal format requirements need to be simplified for future operations so that they can be done in
time and for the most part prepared by beneficiaries.

While the manual was comprehensive on certain aspects such as approval processes, FOs had
considerable flexibility in the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) process leading to the preparation of
the Community Action Plans and the choice of investments by villagers. As a result, there was variation
in the quality of some proposals and some questionable investment choices. In future, establishing a set
of minimum PRA requirements for CAP preparation should help ensure that key issues are analyzed
consistently. These would include participatory environmental analyses, training in which was provided
to Project partners part-way through the Project.

Training in community driven development procurement procedures would have been beneficial for
PMU and PCU staff as well as other Project partners. Such training would have enabled staff to be
aware of the flexibility possible in this approach and be more able to provide suitable advice to
beneficiaries, e.g., the options available regarding how many local shopping quotes are required for
local procurement.

   The number of benefiting households is reported by type of investment. It should be noted that households may
participate in more than one type of investment and therefore the total reflects some double-counting. However, it
is clear that more than 43,000 households participated in the subprojects, since there was very little, if any overlap

Project Outcomes

At least 80% of rural production investments are successful according to agreed standards and are
being maintained. Field assessments indicate that about eighty-five of ten subprojects can be
considered as successful. Reasons for unsuccessful investments include loss of assets to disease,
pests and natural events, e.g., loss of animals to floods.

All villages participate in credibility investments.
- All villages participated in credibility investments. However, the timing of implementing these
investments could have been better so that they were carried out before subproject implementation.
This overlap sometimes led to confusion among beneficiaries about what type of investment they
were participating in. Overall the purpose of these investments was achieved; beneficiaries gained
confidence in some of the project approaches and also gained experience in the pilots of possible
subprojects.

Number of participating households in at least one of the types of rural production investment is at
least 50% of total Project area population and being replicated elsewhere.
- Overall more than 50% of the total Project households (>43,500) participated in subprojects. In
the case of rural infrastructure, depending on the type of investment entire villages benefited, e.g.,
drinking water supply. This leads to some overlap in participation by households in land resource
management and farm productivity investments as well. Therefore, only the participants in these
two types of investment arecounted, but numbers for each investment are provided in the tables
above.

In communities that are participating in the Project, the proportion of people above poverty level
increases from 3% to 30%
- The proportion of people above the poverty level rose to 50% in Project communities. Estimated
income (after subtracting costs) for farm productivity and land resource management investment
varies from US$100 to US$300/HH/year. In addition, the food security effect is significant. CIGs
have a practice of sharing surplus produce with vulnerable and less-well off individuals. They also
consider such practices contribute to maintaining social cohesion and harmony in villages.
Improved livestock management is estimated at adding 5-10% value to the animals due to fattening,
improved health. In the case of land resource management investments, the effect on poverty
reduction is higher as the CIGs already benefit from intercrops even before the trees bear fruit.

At least 78,000ha covered by land resource management subprojects and other Project activities
that directly and successfully address land and ecosystem degradation (see Table A2.6 above).
- To date the total area of lands directly improved by Project beneficiaries through straight
application of new and technologically effective approaches is 15,244 hectares.

A considerable portion of lands have also been improved due to secondary direct actions which
decrease of the risks of degradation processes. These actions and results include:

Minor roads (access tracks) and trails reconstruction which enables people to use and improve
remote lands and also to route herds which in turn promotes the natural restoration of lands along
main trails of moving livestock.


                                                30
Reconstruction and repairing of small bridges has provided similar opportunities for local people.
By a preliminary expert estimation, these investments have allowed access to and opportunities to
better manage approximately 9,900 ha of agricultural lands (the same assumption as above has
been applied to assess the impact of this category of subprojects).

Construction and reconstruction of animal housing has provided opportunities to decrease the
impact on winter pastures and lands close to villages and also improved sanitary conditions in
villages.
Creation of drinking ponds provided similar and even more widespread secondary benefits as these
drinking points reduce the necessity of long droves, especially along lands adjacent to settlements
and villages.

Other activities also add to decreasing the risk of land degradation through soil erosion, and
improving soil conditions for sustainable land use:

    - bank protection with gabions and tree planting to combat gully erosion,
    - tree planting along canals and roads to prevent land degradation.
The total length of tree belts and gabions is more than 213 km. Expert assessment indicates that at
least 10,700 ha of fixed slopes and rehabilitated lands have positive impacts. The rate used for this
calculation is 50 meters width of the strip along the tree belts and\or gabions, leads to protection of
15 to 200 meters with a tendency for this area to become wider with tree growing.

The environmental impact of the Project is even larger due to additional beneficial effects of
housing livestock. The construction/reconstruction of 29 animal housing structures serves
approximately 45,000 heads of small livestock. On average in Tajikistan one sheep needs from 0.8
to 1.0 ha for sustainable grazing. It means that the construction of these sheepfolds indirectly raises
the health of sheep and they need relatively less forage while grazing on an area of more than
40,000 ha. Positive impacts are achieved through the majority of herds being managed (veterinary
service, shearing, lambing, etc.) in more remote grazing areas away from settlements. This results
in decreased pressure on large areas between villages and remote pastures, which remain free of the
high pressure of small cattle and livestock for the summer period. The use of yaks in a few
subprojects in Ayni and Jirgital raions instead of sheep and goats also adds to more sustainable
management of summer pastures as yaks are less harmful to soils and vegetative cover. Thus,
beneficial secondary impacts of subproject actions cover not less than 79,800 ha, which when
combined with the area under primary impacts results in not less than 96,000ha covered by land
resource management and other project activities.

In addition to area under Project activities, it is necessary to note other beneficial environmental
results:

•   Farmers are using biological methods for plant protection as alternatives to chemical control in
    at least 210 ha;
•   Farmers have established more than 5,300 beehives helping to revitalize an important
    economic activity as well as a critical ecological process for agricultural productivity and
    biodiversity conservation;
•   Water saving technologies in irrigation in subprojects are estimated to save at least 250 cubic
    meters a year;

                                               31
•   Power-saving technologies, such as solar heaters and driers and water mills, are estimated to
    save at least 260 thousand KW/hours per year. Additionally, 25 micro-hydro units have been
    rehabilitated or established

Intermediate indicator results

Total investments in farm productivity and land resource management have exceeded targets.
Beneficiary contributions as noted elsewhere in this report have exceeded the minimum
requirement with villagers contributing about 31% of total Project costs. The Project also assisted
in the establishment of 2 micro-loan organizations in Zarafshan. Plans for additional MLOs had to
be stopped when the national legislation on such organizations changed with an increase in the
minimum amount required for establishment. An initial capitalization of $200,000 was not
possible under the Project framework.

More than 570 small-scale rural infrastructure investments have been completed (see Table A2.4).
These have helped reduce conflict in villages over resource use, reduced the burden on women and
other households members in activities such as water collection. Improved facilities also
contributed to reduced local erosion, e.g., drinking water taps. Villagers also formed associations
to manage water resources to help ensure long-term operations.

The Project provided small grants to farmer groups to plant over 1.3 million trees on their lands,
covering about 3,000 ha. Relevant subprojects include woodlots, horticulture (fruit and nut
orchards), terracing and planting of trees, beekeeping, and plant nurseries (see Table A2.5). The
Project has also provided support to arrange for secure land use rights to the grant recipients for the
land resource management subprojects, in order to ensure an incentive framework for sustainable
land management (see Table A2.6).

At least 9,000 rural people received technical training from TAAS, FOs, or other Project partners.
Although this target was achieved it should be noted that the research and demonstration activities
implemented by the scientific institutions were not as successful as anticipated. The Project
worked with the Tajik Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Soil Institute and Crop Husbandry
Institute to strengthen their capacities to provide technical services and training to communities.
However, most scientists were more familiar with implementing Soviet-style, large-scale
demonstration strategies and technical inputs that no longer match the needs of small mountain
farmers and current production systems. Anticipated support from IFAD to build JDC/JRC
technical capacities did not materialize due to bureaucratic delays, and partnerships with CGIAR
institutions, such as ICARDA, which would have provided technical assistance in collaborative and
farmer-focused approaches. Ultimately, 30 small demonstration plots were established to assist
local farmers in improving their agricultural practices. The overall impact of these demonstration
plots and outreach to upland farmers was limited. A more effective mechanism to share
innovations was the farmer competition to highlight and reward good practices.

Preservation of live, indigenous plant specimens - several expeditions were made by the Institute of
Botany resulting in the identification of over 300 endemic and rare plant species including fruit
trees. The Institute also updated the Tajikistan Red Book with their findings.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

An incremental cost analysis (ICA) was conducted at appraisal as per GEF requirements. This
Annex reviews the ICA against Project implementation results. For details on the benefits,
assumptions, baseline and GEF Alternative – refer to Annex 15 in the PAD.

Incremental Cost Analysis

a) ICA at Appraisal

The ICA compared the baseline scenario with the GEF-Alternative scenario. The baseline included:
(a) on-going and planned activities undertaken by the Government, in order to improve livelihoods
of rural communities while reversing degradation of fragile lands and ecosystems (US$2.0
million); (b) the associated contribution by beneficiaries in proportion to their level of external
support (US$1.6 million); and (c) activities and resources being financed by IFIs and other donors
(US$10.8 million). The full baseline scenario was estimated to be US$14.4 million.

Baseline Benefits: The baseline scenario included the following benefits:

     •     Provide rural infrastructure investments;
     •     Provide support for farm productivity improvements;
     •     Provide support for land resource management covering 21,000 ha. The scale of gully and
           landslide prevention would be smaller;
     •     Support for scientific research, including support for nurseries, field trials, and line agency
           capacity building. However there would not be sufficient funding to restore Tajikistan’s
           capacity to preserve specimens of indigenous crop varieties;
     •     Facilitation and planning support necessary to mobilize communities and ensure the
           feasibility of rural production investments. Feasibility and eligibility guidelines include
           communications, group process, organizational and administrative arrangements,
           contribution requirements, budget limits, and institutional capacity, social, financial,
           commercial, technical, and environmental considerations. However training and
           dissemination efforts would be limited.

The GEF-Alternative scenario, at an incremental cost of US$19.8 million of which the GEF would
finance US$4.5 million, would support in initiatives in each of the three components:

1. Rural Production Investments (US$11.9 million; GEF financing - US$3.8 million). This
component comprised support for subprojects in farm productivity improvement, land resource
management, and rural infrastructure. Financing from GEF, blended with the IDA financing, would
accelerate and expand the land resource management subcomponent. It would address biodiversity
conservation and soil protection through vegetative cover restoration to 78,000 ha, which was
57,000 ha above the level that would have been supported by the government on purely national
grounds. It would promote biological conservation and moisture retention techniques which made
the best use of in-situ water and recharge profiles, increase vegetative cover and generally
improved soil structure and water holding capacity. In addition, because of the requirement that
beneficiaries contribute at least 20% of the subproject investment costs, GEF financing would
leverage an additional US$0.9 million in beneficiary contributions for land resource management
subprojects, which would not have been forthcoming in the absence of the additional GEF
financing.

2. Institutional Support and Capacity Building (US$4.3 million; GEF financing - US$0.6 million):
This component would strengthen scientific institutions, and included the restoration of
Tajikistan’s capacity to preserve specimens of indigenous crop varieties, in collaboration with the
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research’s Central Asia and Caucasus unit in
Tashkent. It would strengthen the capacity for seed and seedling production. It would include
training for communities, community-based organizations, and interest groups and the Jamoat and
Watershed Development Committees. It included initial confidence building mobilization grants
for each participating village. It would also include information and experience sharing on a wide
variety of institutional, technical, environmental, financial, and management topics, including
monitoring and evaluation. Blended GEF financing would enable additional funding for extra
support required to increase the extent of land resource management investments, information
sharing and awareness-raising on land degradation and biodiversity conservation topics, as well as
specimen preservation of indigenous crop varieties.

3. Project Management: (US$3.6 million; GEF financing - US$0.1 million). The Project
management component would support Project coordination and administration staff, procurement,
disbursement, financial management, reporting, monitoring, and evaluation activities, at the
national level and for each of the four Project watershed areas. The component would also support
the secretariat services to be provided to the national Steering Committee, and support the
Watershed Development Committees to enable them to appraise Jamoat proposals for financing
from rural communities in a manner consistent with good practice. Blended GEF financing would
support increased management of land resource management investments, enabled more extensive
evaluation of mountain ecosystem degradation trends, as well as exchange of experience both
within the country and with other countries, thus further strengthening replication impact.

b) ICA at Completion

Project results were exceeded in all cases with an incremental cost of US$5.39 million including
the GEF Grant of US$4.5 million. Thus from a cost-efficiency standpoint the Project can be rated
as highly satisfactory.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Experiences in subproject implementation

The Project did not have a beneficiary survey however the information below summarizes feedback
received during interviews with a representative sample of subprojects.

1. Gafforov Kurbonboy, member of the CIG “Zoti?, Rudaki Jamoat Development
Committee of Penjikent rayon, comment on their experience in animal husbandry:

At the initial stage of the Project implementation we actively participated in the training courses on
animal husbandry by using modern methods. These training sessions were done by the Institute of
Husbandry of Tajik Academy of Sciences, professors of the Agrarian University of Tajikistan
employed by the Project. During these sessions we gained theoretical knowledge of animal growth
and care. They also taught us how to identify animal illness.

Before the Project we did not have such knowledge, we did not even think of the modern methods -
we just drove our cattle out for grazing. Under the Project, we all have received instruction and
information materials, we studied them and improved our knowledge on animal husbandry and
gained experience.

After the subproject introduction, and after recommendation and support of the Jamoat
Development Committee and PCU, we procured in Jillikul rayon of Khatlon oblast 6 cows of the
Swiss breed. This breed appeared in Switzerland based on the selection of best breeds adaptable for
good fodder and keeping conditions. This breed has 2 sub-breeds – mountain and low plain types.
The live weight of this cow averages to 600-650 kg, while oxen may reach up to 1000 kg. Each of
such cows in Switzerland produces 4200-4500 kg of milk; the milk fat is up to 3.7%, proteins –
3.4%. This breed of cow is currently developing in the countries of Central Asia. In Vakhsh rayon,
as a result of interbreeding local cows of Zebumonad type with the Swiss oxen produced in the new
breed – Swissuzebu-monand, which is well adaptable to hot and dry climate of this locality. This
breed retained the productivity of the Swiss breed and adaptability to local conditions. For this new
type of cattle, we constructed new big sty for the animals to keep and feed in winter time. As was
recommended by representative of local Jamoat, we stocked the vitamin-rich fodder for the entire
year. Owing to the Project, we now have a vet office. Its specialist frequently visiting us to inspect
the cows, and we have an opportunity to timely receive any assistance required. Before that, only to
find animal medicine we spent a lot of time. Now we feed animals on schedule, we observe the
keeping conditions. In addition, we timely apply vaccination. As a result of the use of modern
technologies and sustainability methods the number of cattle heads increased several times. The
daily milk yield is 60-70 liters, part of it is consumed by families, and part is sold to neighbors and
other people.

We collect manure to prepare compost, after this we use it as organic fertilizer to introduce to soil
to increase its productivity. We feed animals, according to recommendations, in the amount of 14-
15 fodder units. The gained revenues distributed in equal shares among the CIG members. Because
of this, our welfare level is increased, and we will try to work to be even more effective in the
future. We receive visitors from the nearby villages, people learn our experience and build there the
same small farms and grow cattle by using our technologies.


                                               37
2. Experience and recommendations in the sphere of horticulture (pears and apples in the
mountains)

The orchard subproject in Tajikabad rayon; the group leader Khudoidodov Yusuf.

Considering regional climatic conditions and with Project support, we established a pilot regional
garden for tree. Using skills obtained from the training course and new technologies we learned
new ways of introducing horticulture. On 10 ha we planted a garden of which 560 quality seedlings
were brought from Ministry of Agriculture’s nursery in Dushanbe.

The garden yielded rich fruits, melons and gourds from better row-spacing and through the
prevention of soil erosion; the development of new methods of farming; and pest control as
recommended by scholars and specialists. In the course of subproject implementation we gained
rich experience in growing fruit trees in mountain areas. This experience was shared with other
fruit tree planters in mountain areas. For example, for apple trees we recommend the following: to
ensure fast seedling growth - plant them in areas of 5-65m x 2-3m, for moderate growth 4-5m х 2-
3m, and for low-growth trees plant them in 3-4m х 2-3m.

Recommended types of trees: Summer: Selected Samarkand, Borovika Tashkentia, Plodorodny;
Autumn: Golden Delicious, Goldspur, Jonored, Johnathan, Golden Winter Parmen; Winter: Ranet
Semerenko, White Rosemarine, Delicious, Starcrimson, Wellspur and Delicious Red.

Growing pear trees also taught us a lot. We learned that wild-growing varieties are a very
important base for grafting and crossing-breeding. The more popular local types of pears and
noshpoti, keep well and during transport. The Harm type of pears in regular storehouses under the
normal temperature can be kept up to 7-8 months. The tree is heat-loving, requires little water, but
cannot stand dry weather. In wet soil, with no ground water, it develops well and grows long.

The adaptable early-fruit bearing trees are: Trevi, Swallow, Klapai Aziz, Bee Zhiraf, Autumn
Forest, Williams, Bere Ligellia, Bere Bosk, Winter Kure, Harmskaya Pear, Dilafruz, Zhosefina
Makhelinsky, Der Seer. A pear tree can be crossed with the quince tree or another pear tree. The
crossed hybrids bear good fruit and can sprout well in soil lacking moisture, and still develop. To
get bushy pear trees it is necessary to cross them with the small-fruit quince seedling. The pear
trees of type Harmsky, Red Nashpoti, Red Williams and Starcrimson crossed with quince is not
recommended; since the operated place on the trunk develops weakly, breaks or dries out. Only
the Kurero type is advisable for quince crossing. For this, a cut is made on the quince trunk, a
groove is made to insert fresh twig of pear tree and one must wrap it tight with fabric. In a short
period of time the new twig will inoculate and start growing. By crossing pears this way, it is then
necessary to plant them in an interval of 6m х 6m for good results of crossing, or in the interval of
4m х 5m or 4m х 3 for satisfactory crossing results.

Pears are pollinable types of trees and many can turn out barren, so tree planting requires trees
nearby with an abundance of pollen.

In mountain areas pear seedlings can, among others, get a “pear honey? disease. This is a
persistent disease and requires protection measures.

Our pilot garden was visited by people from other villages; they also learned these modern methods

                                              38
of horticulture and introduced them in their own work.

1. Farmer Best Practices – examples of competition winners

Pasture management

With Project funds our CIG members improved pasture conditions in 2 ha. We sowed summer
cypress on land that was farmed intensively and was highly eroded. Today the shrubs grow very
well, and we hope to collect some 200 seeds and increase its sowing area. All year round (any
season) the summer cypress is used for fodder. In cases of adequate care - this shrub produces
good fodder for 25 years.

Activity benefits:
Sowing summer cypress
Cattle fodder availability, especially for small cattle
Pastures restoration
Good crops of cypress and perspective increase of sowing areas

Vanj rayon, Muminshoev, B., Chairman of the farm “Mukhamad?

To improve pastures a 3km long waterway was built and sowed alfalfa on 14 ha. Climatic
conditions allowed for 3 crops per season; with a yield of 14 centers per hectare. The activity of
Muminshoev was pasture improvement – but they were also able to stock fodder for winter from
high-quality alfalfa. Under local conditions domestic cattle only graze 6 months a year on pastures,
and another 6 months should be kept in winter enclosures. The farm members intended to increase
alfalfa sowing on pastures in future.

Activity benefits:
Water available for animals
Cost effectiveness on water supply
Pastures restoration which for years were not irrigated, and animals in search for water had to
travel big distances and they were losing weight

Modern plant protection methods

Nabotova Makhvash, leader of the farm “Mekhnat?, Jamoat Vanj

Nabotova’s experience in plant protection and cultivation methods is rather interesting and
extensive, and neighbors use this experience. On an area of 1.2 ha they planted an orchard of 0.3
ha and the remaining 0.9 ha was used for other cultivation. The Nabotova’s orchard is well
managed, and for pest control is using traditional methods (traps) with visible results. In other
areas she is growing potatoes, vegetables and other cultures for fodder. Using such a sowing
method is good for crop rotation; the harvest yield from trees and other cultures is high. She is
using modern technologies to grow cultures.

Activity benefits:
Rational and effective use of plants protection

                                              39

Receiving 2-3 harvests per season
Marketing studies

Nabotova’s area of 0.5 ha have sown various vegetables, used advanced technologies and popular
methods of plant protection. During the work - the sowing calendar was observed.

Activity benefits:
Effective use of plants protection methods
Experimenting with growing different agricultures
Organized sowing
Manpower attraction, including women to work in fields

Modern plant protection methods in the Ivan-Tojik Jamoat. Kuhistoni Maschoh district

Koziev Mullonemat, CIG leader form the Ivan-Tojik Jamoat, Niezov Niezbobo, leader of
“Dobbukov? farm, Jamoat Ivan-Tochik, and Junusov Junus, leader of “Revomtuk? farm, Jamoat
Ivan-Tochik, were introducing popular plants protection methods and received good results.

Activity benefits:
Staged use of known methods in own business
Observing sowing terms and methods and tree protection
Awareness raising and improved economy through training
Use of modern methods in the mountains

Executive summary from the World Bank

Farmer and Farm Worker Perceptions of Land Reform and Sustainable Agriculture Study

Farmer’s decisions are largely shaped by their perception of how exposed they are to different
social, economic and environmental impacts. Chief among these are limited management control
over farmland, land degradation and low levels or sources of other assets. Previous farmer
assistance in this area has focused on building capacity to cope with these factors and create
incentives for better land management. The experience from former state-directed economies
undergoing transition has shown that what works best is to create ‘incentive frameworks’ that link
land tenure (or security) and asset accumulation along with building farmer’s capacity to respond
to shocks and stresses. This increases farmer confidence or ‘resilience’ and can lead to greater
entrepreneurial behavior or even the adoption of more environmentally-friendly and sustainable
land management practices. Discovering these linkages and the underlying conditions of success
still requires further field-evidence – especially in countries under transition.

This is a summary of a report that presents the findings of a recent study in Tajikistan that
examined farmer perceptions in Project areas that supported farmland restructuring and sustainable
agricultural land management practices among rural households. The findings are expected to be
of value to government decision-makers at all levels, civil society organizations, donors and other
practitioners interested in practical recommendations for improving current and proposed projects
in land reform, agricultural production, sustainable land resource management and related fields.

                                             40
The study was a collaborative effort of the British Department of International Development
(DFID), World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and
focused primarily on sites where these agencies were supporting projects. This report also draws
on an earlier 2007 assessment by the World Bank and USAID that examined knowledge, attitudes
and practices toward land restructuring among farmers and farm workers (World Bank and
USAID, 2008).

Two thirds of Tajikistan’s population is engaged in agriculture that falls into two broad farming
systems: upland areas characterized by wheat, potatoes and certain types of horticulture along with
large tracts of rain-fed pasture; and lowland areas where irrigated cotton in rotation dominates.
Unlike other countries in the Europe and Central Asia region, Tajikistan has not completed the
reform process of allocating and registering land use rights for independent farmers so that they are
better able to manage their farmland in response to market forces. “Freedom to Farm? without
government interference is unevenly practiced in the country. At the same time environmental
degradation and unsustainable use of natural resources are important constraints to rural growth,
and as a consequence, the country’s overall agricultural productivity remains low.

Fieldwork for the study was conducted between March and July 2011, and included a quantitative
survey of 1,800 farmers in 18 raions (districts), supplemented by focus groups, in-depth interviews
and case studies in eight raions. Due to the modest sample size the study cannot claim to be
representative of all farms and farmers in the country, however for the areas covered it does
describe the results of interventions from the farmer’s viewpoint (or perception). While the
knowledge, attitudes, and real and perceived assessments are critical in shaping behavior, it should
be noted these may not accurately reflect the actual legal situation or official government data.

Changes and Results in the Process of Farmland Restructuring

Under the World Bank financed Land Registration and Cadastre System Project (LRCSP), there
has been significant acceleration in the issuance of land use rights certificates for family farms (25
or fewer shareholders), with 36,911 issued since 2009. This acceleration is an important outcome
of the 2009 Government decree. Qualitative results show that farmers acknowledge speedier, more
transparent, and no-fee processing of applications compared to the regular Land Committee
channels in which farmers might encounter delays, mistakes, and resistance to restructuring by
local officials.

The study indicates that rural people have basic knowledge about their rights, but do not fully
understand the details of the farmland restructuring process. Both the 2007 and 2011 surveys
documented that respondents are aware of having heritable rights and freedom to choose what to
plant. However, despite educational efforts by projects, few farmers know about specific
differences between farm types, and the steps needed to fully restructure farms.

Key perceived barriers to undertaking restructuring include a lack of machinery, lack of
experience managing a farm, lack of access to irrigation water, process costs, and the associated
tax and debt burden, all of which contribute to an overall lack of confidence in farming
independently. Those who work on farms yet to be restructured into units of less than 25 members
are the most concerned about these barriers. However, perceived benefits, such as the ability to
farm independently and make money are also rated as being very important incentives to
restructure.

                                              41
Freedom to Farm

The confidence of farmers that they control use of their land has increased significantly since
2007. In 2011, close to half of all respondents strongly agree that farmers can make farming
decisions, compared to slightly more than 25% in 2007. Exceptions can be found, however, in
cotton production, where only 29% of women strongly agree compared to almost half of men. In
collective farms with more than 25 members/workers, farm heads continue to be the decision-
makers. Upland farmers are more likely to say they are able to make independent farming
decisions than farmers in lowland areas where cotton predominates. Yet areas still remain, such as
Tojikobod and Konibodom, where local authorities pressure family farms to grow a fixed
percentage of key crops such as potato and cotton.

Gender Issues and Social Tax

Conservative attitudes and practices which are still maintained in some regions of the country
limit women’s access to information about restructuring and agricultural operations, even
though it is widely acknowledged that women comprise the bulk of agricultural labor. In 2011,
25% of women still report having no sources of information on restructuring. Women also are
much less likely than men to have either advanced general education or specialized agricultural
training.

The long-term rights of women are affected by their omission from certificates. Survey
respondents confirmed that women were omitted from certificates in one of every ten cases.
Cultural norms and practices attach more importance to including men’s names; however, in about
40% of the excluded cases, the social tax was cited as a somewhat important or very important
reason.

The social tax of 15 somoni (about $3) per month also results in other family members being
omitted from certificates, e.g., young adults. Other difficulties with the social tax include
payments that are due when members are not working, and having to pay twice if someone works
on two farms. The burden of the social tax and associated transaction costs can be substantial
for small, labor-intensive farms. Failure to pay the social tax can result in the farmer losing rights
to the land.

Rural Organizations

Mechanisms are needed to resolve problems and take advantage of opportunities that extend
beyond the farm and family. Examples of problems include access to irrigation and canal
maintenance, machinery, and credit. Coordinated efforts necessary for watershed management and
other activities to sustain and protect the environment and resources should also be included. A
mix of approaches are being used and tested, including Mahalla Councils, hashars and other
traditional practices, commercial services by private vendors, and non-governmental and donor
organization activities. The Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project
(CAWMP), which used farmer common interest groups, is an example of donor-sponsored
activities. With the exception of Vanj, where the Aga Khan Foundation/Mountain Societies
Development Support Programme has set up village organization activities as a regular practice,



                                              42
mechanisms to resolve these problems are often either lacking or unable to successfully address
issues.

Agricultural Operations, Livelihood Outcomes and Aspects of Vulnerability

Compared to 10-15 years ago, more than half of men and 44% of women say they are better off.
When asked about conditions 10-15 years ago, only about 10% of men and women say they are
worse off, with the rest saying they are the same. Qualitative results indicate that migrant
remittances played a key role in the improved status of many households. Comparing the results
between the 2007 and 2011 surveys, farmers indicated a 10% decline in the number of households
where farming was the only source of income, and a 10% increase in the number of households
where agriculture was no longer a significant source of income.

For farmers in both lowland and upland areas, financial concerns such as access to credit,
access to markets, and farm debt are key sources of risk and problems in agriculture and rank in
the top five out of 20 problems. Pasture access and rotation also rank in the top five for both
regions. In the uplands, the major problem was bad roads, bridges and infrastructure, whereas for
lowlands, landslides/mudslides were one of the top five natural resource-related problems.
Generally, lowland respondents and those on family farms expressed more concern about
environmental issues. Water conservation, integrated pest management and erosion control
practices had the lowest adoption rates and levels of knowledge among farmers, with intercropping
and windbreaks the highest.

To examine the sensitivity of households as a factor in rural vulnerability, four variables were
assessed to indicate the susceptibility of livelihoods to risks. Upland farming could be considered
more sensitive overall than lowland farming, due to higher numbers of respondents growing only
one crop, and reporting lower income and education levels. However, more lowland farmers
reported agriculture as their sole source of income. Farmers on restructured family farms with 25 or
fewer members are more likely to have only one crop and limited educational levels, but slightly
more income sources. Women tend to have less income and education, but show more crop
diversity and income sources.

To examine the potential to adapt to risks and problems, a number of variables were assessed
across types of farmers. Results indicate that lowland farm households are more likely to receive
migrant remittances and some cash savings. Upland households are more likely to invest in
livestock and slightly more likely to adopt sustainable environmental practices. Family farms with
25 or fewer members are more likely to invest in livestock, make investments in farm
improvements, and have two or more income sources. Family farms, while being more sensitive
in some aspects than collective farms to economic and environmental stresses, do show more
potential to adapt. These farms made more investments, adopted more environmental
management practices and between 2007 and 2011 grew a greater diversity of crops. Women are
less likely to report investments in livestock, but slightly more likely to report income from migrant
remittances.

The findings indicate that a combination of farmland restructuring and freedom to farm, although
necessary for the incentive framework for agriculture and economic transition, is not sufficient.
The experience of other transition economies highlights a package of key reforms: (a) creating
macroeconomic stability; (b) reforming property rights; (c) hardening budget constraints on


                                              43
collective and similar farms; and (d) creating institutions that facilitate exchange and develop an
environment within which contracts can be enforced and new firms can enter. Family farms need
support through this transition in building livelihood assets that help reduce vulnerability.

Recommendations

Strengthen and expand farmland restructuring in order to increase beneficial livelihood
outcomes and potential to adapt. In addition to providing donor support, efforts should
incorporate as much as possible the Land Registration and Cadastre System for Sustainable
Agriculture Project (LRCSP) “good practice? on certificate issuance into other government
programs. Although it may not be feasible for the regular government program to adopt the no-fee
arrangement or the spatial technology in the short term, ways to address these factors should be
considered in the development of the longer-term government strategy. Continued commitment to
the issuance of family land use rights certificates is imperative. Future legislation, including
proposed amendments to the Land Code, would create conditions for marketable land rights, and
those without legal rights are likely to be particularly vulnerable to land grabs, etc.

Although there has been progress in Freedom to Farm, government interference in agriculture
needs to be further reduced. Freedom to farm independently and without interference does,
however, need to take into account the constraints of the country’s resource base and
environmental fragility. Family farms will need continued support and guidance to manage land
resources responsibly through efforts similar to those, such as CAWMP, LRCSP and others that
supported the environmental management of agriculture and other measures that can reduce
sensitivity and increase adaptive capacity.

Improve awareness raising and training activities on farmland restructuring, and give more
attention to gender inclusion. Local mass media, seminars, etc. should be used to increase
awareness of possibilities and the benefits of acting independently. Efforts should focus on new
project areas and test to ensure that people are learning and making informed decisions. The
curriculum should include realistic case studies illustrating the consequences of land restructuring
in each local area and be gender-inclusive. Education efforts should raise key issues such as land
debt and taxes, the social tax and the consequences of not being listed on certificates, and
alternative planting strategies. Activities should also focus on building skills to solve common
problems rather than just trying to increase knowledge about laws.

The burden and implications of the social tax on farm members, especially on family farms, is a
serious issue, and warrant immediate attention and further investigation. Study findings
indicate that the current social tax policies appear to discourage the inclusion of women and other
adult family members other than the household head from being listed as shareholders on family
farm certificates. Qualitative findings indicate that the social tax can even discourage poor
households from seeking family farm rights altogether. However, a full analysis of the social tax
was beyond the scope of this study. Analysis is now required to explore alternative approaches to
social protection. For example, good practice from elsewhere uses policies of income-based
taxation rather than a flat rate per head. Any analysis should consider not only issues of social tax
policy but also of implementation. In Tajikistan, for example, are there differences between
various groups (including family farms versus larger farms versus various forms of non-
agricultural enterprises) in social tax collection rates (e.g., enforcement, compliance) and actual
access to and flows of social protection benefits.

Strengthen farmer-to-farmer learning about agriculture and access to resources and markets.
Informal farmer networks are effective in promoting innovation and replication and help build
farmer confidence in operating independently. Conventional methods of communication and
learning (e.g., advice through fee-for-service, Jamoat Development Committees) should be
complemented with farmer field schools, competitions that highlight good practice, innovation and
early initiators, and farmer exchanges.

Support local empowerment through associations and groups. Promoting informal and formal
groups, examples of which are already active (e.g., Water User Associations, machinery or pasture
user groups) can help farmers access and maintain machinery, infrastructure, pasture, credit and
other inputs. Producer associations and groups provide similar opportunities for farmers to access
markets and obtain fairer prices for their products.

Several types of publications and directories, magazines, leaflets, informational posters were
published and distributed to PCUs, CIGs, JDCs, and WDCs. These materials contained information
about environmental protection, rational use of natural resources, better crop production
technologies, effective usage of water resources and other information which promote advanced
knowledge to improve the capacity of local residents to enhance their income.

Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.Context at appraisal

Tajikistan has an area over 143,000 km² of which more than 93% are located in mountainous
regions. In the period 2000-2003, barely a decade after independence and during a period of
stabilisation after the civil war, Tajikistan moved its development efforts from humanitarian aid
and reconstruction to more long term development activities. During that period poverty decreased
substantially from over 85% to 60% in 2004 with still over 20% of the population considered as
very poor (1.18$/day/person). Government of Tajikistan action was guided by the PRSP and the
national development strategy which emphasize growth, provision of basic services, supporting the
poor and improving governance. Within this context and as a follow-up to the successful farm
privatisation project, GOT, World Bank and GEF designed in 2004/2005 a project focussing on
both poverty and environment in mountainous regions where 20% of the population lives and
where poverty and land degradation are highest.

The Community Agriculture Watershed Management Project (CAWMP) is addressing 2 major
challenges in Tajikistan: poverty reduction through agricultural development and income
generation, and environmental degradation through integrating sustainable land management
practices. Both issues are closely linked, in particular in mountainous areas where inadequate land
management practices due to lack of investment and/or knowledge lead to serious environmental
degradation such as mudslides, soil erosion, silting of rivers. Still, highlands in Tajikistan have
good agricultural and livestock potential if only managed appropriately. In addition, mountainous
ecosystems, some of which are under threat like pastures and forests, constitute a unique pool of
genetic diversity of wild-growing plants which is worth conserving. In Tajikistan the breakdown
of the Soviet agricultural system after 1990 and the production decline pointed to the need for land
reform. The first legal acts on land reform and farm restructuring in Tajikistan were issued in 1992,
but land reform began actively only in 1995, with a presidential decree allocating additional land to
household plots – always a highly productive sector in all of the former Soviet Union. In the
uplands, farmers lacked capital to exploit the productive potential of their lands.

At the time of Project design, in rural areas a lot of development aid was focussed on humanitarian
responses rather than activities to support rural agricultural production. This Project was a
departure with its focus on agricultural production and sustainable natural resource management
plus its community driven decision-making on the types of investments to be made by villagers.

1.2.Project Development

   Objectives (PDO) and Outcomes

The Project objectives are twofold, reflecting WB and GEF contributions:




                                             48
    -   Build the productive assets of rural communities in selected mountain watersheds, in ways
        that sustainably increase productivity and curtail degradation of fragile lands and
        ecosystems.
    -   GEF Objective: Protect globally important ecosystems by mainstreaming sustainable land
        use and biodiversity conservation considerations within agriculture and associated rural
        development decisions, providing replicable models for comparable areas throughout the
        country.

At the time of Project Appraisal, the performance indicators for the Project outcomes were:

At outcome level:
    -   At least eighty percent of rural production investments are successful according to agreed
        economic, financial, social, and environmental standards, and are being sustained;
    -   Number of participating households in at least one of the types of rural production
        investment is at least 50% of total Project area population and being replicated elsewhere;
    -   In communities that are participating in the Project, proportion of people above poverty
        level increased from 3% to 30%;
    -   Negative trends of land and mountain ecosystem degradation trends halted in Project area
        Jamoats.

At intermediate results level:
    -   The total cumulative investment in agriculture production among Project participants (from
        initial grant, local contributions, and reinvestment) exceeds US$3.8 million, i.e. more than
        the projection of Project-financed grants and capital infusions (implying high participation,
        desirable social and environmental impacts, commercial success, use and repayment of
        revolving funds);
    -   Land management investments cover 78,000 ha and benefit very poor at least in proportion
        to their numbers in a community;
    -   Number of improved public facilities, disaggregated by type of investment (e.g., village
        drinking water, roads and electricity);
    -   47 JDCs overseeing rural production investments;
    -   40% of farm production and land management investments apply improved technologies,
        and receive good access to necessary inputs and knowledge;
    -   Number of indigenous crop varieties from Project area preserved as live specimens;
    -   Satisfactory Project administration as indicated by Bank supervision ratings and Project’s
        public reputation for integrity.

At the time of Project appraisal, these objectives and targets were considered relevant to conditions
in Tajikistan as mentioned in the previous section. However, achieving these targets would be
dependent on capacities among project management and partners since the Project design was
significantly different to previous projects implemented in Tajikistan.

1.3.Adjustments in Project Outcomes and Intermediate Results

By the time of and during the Mid-Term Review in May 2008, the following adjustments were
made.



                                              49
Outcomes

a)      Proportion of people above poverty level participating in the Project: The means of
verification for this outcome indicator was changed given that the baseline assessment of poverty
levels in the Project sites was unable to provide primary data of adequate quality. This outcome
was measured through analyzing qualitative data gathered from sample subproject reviews during
project assessments;

b)      Halting of negative trends of land and mountain ecosystem degradation in Project
Jamoats: This outcome indicator related to land degradation was revised, since the original
indicator, an aggregate spatial assessment of land degradation trends, could not easily capture the
impacts of the small-scale Project-financed subprojects. A replacement indicator instead measured
the number of hectares positively affected by practices, which contributed to sustainable land
management. In 2009 monitoring formats were developed for subprojects that have served as the
basis for assessing sustainable land management benefits.

Intermediate Results

c)      Credibility investments: An outcome indicator was added to measure participation in
credibility investments since these served important functions of building interest in the Project and
awareness of new concepts such as natural resource management. This indicator also provided
useful information for the initial period of Project implementation, when other results could not yet
be measured;

d)     Percentage of Project-financed investments having access to and applying improved
technologies: This result indicator for the component on technical dissemination was replaced with
the number of persons trained, which was more practical and easier to measure than adoption rates;

e)      Number of Jamoats: At inception, the Project planned to cover 47 Jamoats, but by Year 2 it
was clear that this target needed to be reduced. Beginning with the first FO contract in 2005, it was
evident that the unit costs per Jamoat and village for facilitation assistance, even with co-financing
from the FOs, had been significantly underestimated during Project design. Experience also
showed that it was necessary to provide additional resources to support JDC/JRC establishment and
operations and ensure that they could play the critical facilitation and financial roles envisaged in
the Project. Corrections also needed to be made to the base number of households in the Project
Jamoats since these had also changed since appraisal. At the MTR, the following adjustments were
therefore made based on more accurate data and available resources:

    •   The Project will cover 9 raions containing 39 Jamoats and 402 villages; and
    •   The base number of households would be 57,375 of which at least 50% would be Project
        beneficiaries.

f)     Bank supervision ratings: A small modification was made in the indicator for Project
management to a more logical measure based on implementation timeliness rather than Bank
supervision ratings.

g)     Project reputation for integrity: This indicator was dropped since there was inadequate in-
country capacity to conduct and analyze the necessary surveys. The Project’s implementation and

                                              50

At the time of Project completion the objectives and outcome indicators are still considered to be
relevant. The GOT continues to recognize the importance of addressing land degradation (see
reference to UN Assembly September 2011) in the country. Project objectives are relevant to
current GOT programmes in food security, poverty reduction, horticulture development,
sustainable pasture management and adaptation to climate change. Emerging challenges to the
objectives including employment generation include market development, the need to continue
building the rural knowledge base and advisory services to support production, processing and land
management.

1.4.Project Components

The Project was funded through a GEF grant, IDA credit and grant, GOT counterpart financing and
beneficiary contributions investments estimated costing 19.8M$ at PAD stage. At the time of the
MTR, this figure was revised to 18.77M$ that took into account exchange rate changes, as well as
changes in GOT counterpart financing levels and estimates of co-financing by facilitation
organisations.

Component 1: Rural production investments

These investments were to benefit the population through access to small grants
   A. Farm productivity improvement: individuals or groups of households invested in specific
       activities providing income on a short term basis (within 1-3 years). These included
       provision of inputs for cropping systems, horticulture, livestock, processing, leasing, etc.
   B. Land Resource Management (environment): this subcomponent enabled local people to
       adopt more sustainable use of fragile lands and provided Right of Use of Land Certificates
       after three years of maintenance, subject to continued good land use (this provision was
       changed during Project implementation to issuance of certificates according to the schedule
       of issuances in the Land Registration and Cadastral Survey Project for the CAWMP
       locations). Most activities combined long term income-generating investments (3-4 years
       and on) in order to enhance sustainable land use. Activities included horticulture, woodlots,
       pasture management, soil and water conservation measures, etc.
   C. Rural Infrastructure: these investments rehabilitated small-scale rural infrastructure
       intended to benefit community groups and complement the above subcomponents.
       Activities included drinking water, small irrigation, minor transportation rehabilitation,
       small power generation, etc.

Beneficiaries organized as Common Interest Groups (CIGs) accessed grant money by providing a
20% minimum contribution for the total subproject costs. Their proposals had to follow fixed
budgets based on village population as long as any household does not exceed US$290 grant
money while group members applying for a rural infrastructure grant cannot excess US$50/HH.

Component 2: Institutional Support and Capacity Building

   A. Research and Demonstration: scientific institutions and line ministries provided technical
      services including training to communities in the following areas: seed and seedling
      production, livestock breeding and animal health and husbandry improvements, and market
      and enterprise analysis and development. Activities were financed to support the
      preservation of indigenous crop and other specimens.
   B. Community Mobilization and Subproject Preparation: including training and facilitation
      for Jamoat Development Committees (JDCs) as well as households and common interest
      groups with support of facilitating organizations. It also included support for small
      confidence building mobilization grants ($1,000) for each village.

Component 3: Project Management

This component supported all functions related to project management (project coordination,
procurement, disbursement, financial management, reporting, monitoring, and evaluation) and
supports the secretariat services provided to the State Level Steering Committee (SLSC) and the
Watershed Development Committees (WDCs) which are to approve the grants.

There were no significant changes made to the Project components. Some changes were made to
strengthen Project activities in sustainable rangeland management through additional technical
assistance including a dedicated PMU specialist, and a decreased emphasis on rural infrastructure.
Indicators and the Project cost estimates were adjusted during the Mid-term Review in 2008.

1.5.Project Implementation

The Project followed the concept of community-linked development, a participatory process which
involves communities in identifying their needs, and provides for their direct involvement in
resource allocation, decision making, implementation, and monitoring at the local level, with
Jamoat Development Committees (JDCs) playing a key role. Villages allocated resources within
fixed budget constraints among the subprojects sponsored by common interest groups or
households, through a process a participatory analysis facilitated by Project-contracted NGOs (such
as Aga Khan Foundation, WeltHungerHilfe, FAO and UNDP which were NGOs and agencies
already active in Tajikistan) and JDC representatives. The subproject investments in any one
village would take place over a three year period. Specialists from Government line agencies and
NGOs assisted common interest groups in developing feasible and eligible proposals. Guidelines
include communications, group process, organizational and administrative arrangements,
contribution requirements, budget limits, and institutional capacity, social, financial, commercial,
technical, and environmental considerations. After the review and approval process, JDCs provide
resources directly to the common interest groups undertaking subprojects. The common interest
groups had ownership of completed installations, and responsibility for their subsequent operation
and maintenance. To avoid misuse of grants or misunderstandings of Project’s objectives, each FO
had to present at the start of their contract, a limited number of subprojects directly to PMU (and
the donor) whatever the amount for approval, after which the Project’s procedure could be
followed: this was an efficient procedure and enabled PMU to rectify FO and JDC support to CIG
whenever necessary in terms of subprojects funding criteria.

Given little prior experience of working together and the project’s innovative and complex
processes and mechanisms, e.g., household and village budget limits and the community-driven
approach, these partnerships have been effective in community mobilization, in designing,
supporting, appraising and monitoring subprojects and in providing related training and technical
assistance. The partnerships with international organizations (AKF/MSDSP, FAO, UNDP and
WHH) generated both benefits and challenges for the project; while different approaches and
competencies have resulted in some opportunities to learn from a range of good practices,
somewhat independent watershed approaches did initially result in inconsistent (and sometimes
incorrect) interpretations of project design and procedures.

1.6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design and Implementation

M&E design: A monitoring and evaluation manual was prepared for the project in 2004 and
revised in 2008.

M&E implementation: Most monitoring activities were focused on results: it culminated in the
design of a comprehensive project database for all project grants after swaps of various databases
designs produced by both PMU and each FO.




                                              56
The PAD suggested the contracting of an M&E and financial specialist at JDC level. These
functions were separated: financial monitoring of results was effectively carried out by the
financial and M&E JDC specialist.

In the context of the overall monitoring and evaluation approach, assessing and reporting on
outputs has, as expected, been easier and more effective than similar activities regarding outcomes.
A number of the activities planned to assist in evaluating outcomes have not been possible or
practical, e.g., analysis of satellite imagery due to lack of in-country capacity while for others such
as baseline socio-economic surveys in-country capacities were not fully developed for project
purposes. The Results Framework has been revised to reflect implementation experience. On the
other hand, the planned monitoring of outputs using reports, simple databases and field visits has
been effective and more suited to Tajik conditions where communications can be difficult, IT
facilities were limited and project sites are scattered and remote. Monthly reporting by all major
project partners allowed project management to aggregate data and findings.

M&E was carried out by all stakeholders with site-specific approaches. By project’s end some
efforts had been made in order provide continued monitoring; in particular, the relationship
between the project partners and hukumat authorities could have been strengthened both for on-
going support and monitoring. FO follow-up has resulted in additional support through new
interventions– replication of similar types of subprojects or entire approach with grants (e.g., Aga
Khan in Vanj) and/or additional support for increased impact (e.g., WHH in Zarafshon).

Two phases of assessing environmental impacts of rural investments have been undertaken that
provided possibilities to assess primary and secondary environmental benefits (refer to table with
details of environmental impacts in Annex 2).

3. Financial Management and Procurement

3.1. Overview:

There was a one-year delay in project start-up. Facilitation support proved to be difficult to procure.
UNDP was the first FO contracted but there was a misunderstanding about the project concept with
the result that implementation was delayed as operational guidelines were clarified and agreed.
UNDP was also the only FO to transfer funds to JDCs rather than the PMU. This was not an ideal
arrangement and subsequent transfers in other project sites were made by the PMU. Thereafter the
phased introduction of watersheds proceeded as mostly as planned and disbursement rates to
subprojects were at the time of the completion of this component were at target values.

The primary reasons for the initial delays included inexperience within the PMU and in the WB in
contracting facilitating organizations and within the PMU unfamiliarity with the project’s concepts
and implementation arrangements. The PMU was not familiar with managing output-based
contracts with FOs and faced challenges in reconciling these arrangements with Tajikistan’s
accounting methods, as well as with direct fund-flow mechanisms to Jamoats. But the growth in
PMU capacity to manage these aspects of the project has been a significant achievement.
Arrangements were worked out with FOs on financial reporting that would meet GOT
requirements. The project’s fund flow arrangements required building capacity especially for the

PMU and JDCs who played critical roles in financial management. Initially, it was difficult to find
technical assistance in this area and this delayed implementation, but once this was found, financial
management staff and systems were put in place to disburse and report on subproject funds in a
timely and transparent manner. A fiduciary field visit conducted in May 2008 which checked
financial management and procurement on a random sample at the local level in Vanj, Toirsu and
Surkhob found no problems in fund flow to beneficiaries and JDCs, nor in local procurement.

Regular annual national and international audits raised no significant concerns. Similarly a review
of the project by a Commission of the Presidential Administration of Tajikistan conducted in early
2008 raised no major issues regarding project management. A detailed review of financial
management arrangements of the project was carried out by the World Bank team under Tajikistan
Portfolio Fiduciary Review during April 28- May 10, 2008. No major concerns were raised and all
issues were addressed.

3.2. Some Key Challenges:

Requiring the use of financial management software (1C) meant that frequent technical support
was needed in order to meet Bank reporting requirements. The project only finally met Bank
requirements at the end of the project.
Difficulties were experienced in fund transfer from the PMU for JDC operations. Payment of the
JDCs through the PCUs was not efficient and it would have been better to have deposited funds
directly into JDC bank accounts.

3.3. Beneficiary contributions:

At the time of completion of Component 1 implementation, it was estimated that beneficiary co-
financing had on an average exceeded the minimum requirement of 20% of the total value of the
rural production investment to 31% (i.e., 45% match for project financing). In numerous cases,
beneficiaries absorbed increases in costs that have occurred since subproject preparation due in
some part to delays in transferring funds to JDCs/JRCs as well inflation. Although almost all of
this contribution is usually as labor, materials, etc., the level of contribution demonstrates strong
ownership and commitment, and thus a critical contribution to subproject sustainability. As of
September 2011, the value of beneficiary contributions was approximately US$3.4 m.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

4.1. Bank Performance

Bank performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:
At the time of project start-up, the roles of the various project partners was not fully explained and
understood, especially by those at the local level. The Operational Manual for Community
Mobilization and Rural Production Investments was complicated and not very clear including the
guidelines for subproject proposal preparation. This lack of clearness created difficulties,
particularly at the local level. Initially there was a lack of experience in the Bank and the PMU on
how to contract the FOs and the type of contract proposed – output based – was one that the PMU
had not previously managed. Project partners did not also fully understand the concept of the GEF
alternative.



                                              60
Quality of Supervision:

In comparison with other donors, the supervision of the WB has been effective. For example,
efforts were made to explain and clarify GEF alternative and FO roles and contracts. Generally,
within the overall framework of the project, and in comparison with other donors the WB was
flexible in assisting project partners to implement activities given the constraints and possible
opportunities, e.g., reducing the number of subprojects for prior approval from 10 to 3 per
investment category thus saving time, adjusting staffing in PMU to accommodate important issues
such as rangeland management, market development. While the number of missions per year was
adequate, the timing could have been better coordinated with peak periods of rural activities in
project sites. Overall the working relationship with the Bank team was collegial.

4.2. Borrower Performance

Government performance:

The GOT provided the necessary facilities for project management and coordination, including
field facilities. The estimated counterpart funding at completion is US$591,000. Government
bodies continue to pay attention to the project and its outcomes. The Ministry of Agriculture, State
Land Committee, State Committee on Environmental Protection and State Committee on
Investments provided regular assistance to support the implementation of project activities. The
State Land Committee provided assistance to the project for the issuance of Land Use Rights
certificates for project beneficiaries. The project also collaborated closely with the Land
Registration and Cadastral Survey Project on this issue as well.

5. CAWMP Actions to Help Ensure Sustainability and Replicability of Project
   Outcomes

5.1. Sustainability of rural production investments

The overall concept and process of community-driven development contributes to the sustainability
of rural investments. Villagers made decisions on what investments to implement, who should
benefit and the distribution of financial resources across the three categories thus building
ownership and contributing to the sustainability of these activities. Villagers were also responsible
for financial management and procurement for investments. Proposals for these investments
required villages to consider economic, environmental and social/institutional sustainability, e.g.,
cash flows and cost recovery arrangements for 3-10 years depending on the type of investment,
environmental conservation and mitigation measures, and establishing organizations such as water
user associations to support long-term operations. Furthermore, the requirement of beneficiary
contributions (including cash contributions for rural infrastructure) helped build ownership and also
contribute to the sustainability of these investments.

Other key actions that contributed to sustainability are given in section 2.5 of the PAD’s main text.

6. Additional Activities

When the project was extended in spring of 2011 until April 2012 it allowed for additional
activities in project pilot districts. Project activities included the following areas: “Creation of

                                              61
gravity irrigation in small watersheds?, “Sustainable pasture management at the Jamoat level? and
“Assistance in market development and fruit processing?:

6.1. “Creation of gravity irrigation in small watersheds?.

The overall objective of this component was to assist in the implementation of initiatives related to
water resources management in areas where gravity irrigation is used; as well as farmers’
awareness raising living in the upper and lower reaches of rivers; rational use of water resources
and operation of water systems. Project activities were carried out in the Mogien watershed in the
Zarafshan valley in four Jamoats of Panjakent district. Seven Water User Associations (WUAs)
were covered by project activities as well as other water and land users living upstream of the river.
To achieve these objectives the following was carried out: (a) identification of effective
applications of perspective water saving technologies on the ground; conducting training and
workshops; study tours based on the examples of the best local achievement with the involvement
of trainers among farmers; and (b) organizing and conducting tenders for small works of advanced
water-saving technologies between water users. As a result of these activities recommendations
were developed on the establishment of a multilateral cooperation between the WUAs and other
water users in small watersheds, including the evaluation of existing and potential opportunities,
risks and conflicts, standard diagnostic methods, dissemination of positive practices of water and
soil conservation technologies with a description of typical efficient water saving technologies.
A model project implemented in small watershed of Mogien river of Panjakent district achieved the
following results:
     - Recommendations and offers were described on improving the relationship between water
        users of the upper and lower reaches of Mogien River with regard to use and water
        resources management;
     -
     - Activity water users associations gained the necessary additional knowledge in the field of
        water saving technologies and rational use of land resources;
     -
     - Through tendering support was rendered to the best farmers and attention was paid to the
        following key aspects of water saving techniques: effective use of innovative and
        traditional water saving technologies, economic efficiency through water saving, the
        increase of the crop yield and efficient use of water resources;
     -
     - Environmental aspects of effective regulation of water supply were identified in small
        watersheds along with their associated economic efficiency.
     -
6.2. “Sustainable pasture management at the level of Jamoat?.

The overall objective of this activity was to assist in the development of a pasture management
plan for pilot Jamoats. For this purpose, Dar-Dar Jamoat was selected, which is located in Aini
district in the Zarafshan Valley. Despite the fact that the project always focused on the importance
of grazing issues in Tajikistan, active work on pasture issues only started in the second half of the
project period. The project held a series of interventions to stimulate offers for organizing pasture
subprojects; the study of mountain pastures and their management system; training of rural
residents in rational methods of pasture use; and breeding and maintaining livestock. To achieve
these goals, circumstances and the experience gained by the project were taken into account during



                                              62
model project organization on integrated pasture management in Dar-Dar Jamoat (Ayni district).
The model project stipulated the following economic, environmental and institutional aspects:

   -   key acting persons and partners were identified;
   -   social, economic and natural resources (sufficiency-deficiency) were defined both at the
       level of individual villages and at the Jamoat as a whole;
   -   prospects and potential of grazing development were assessed at the village and Jamoat
       level and the sustainability of current methods of pasture management;
   -   main environmental, social and environmental risks of grazing were assessed currently and
       in the future at the village and Jamoat level;
   -   potential and existing conflicts were identified as well as social, environmental and
       landscape issues and the extent of the impact on grazing development;
   -   modules of the pasture system were described (watering, pasture rotation, access to roads,
       shelter for livestock, veterinary services, preparation of fodder for the winter and etc);
   -   preparation of action plans with indication of executors, sources of funding and timing;
   -   cartographic materials were prepared (pasture rotation schemes, the location of the main
       modules, etc.) for management purposes;
   -   guidance on pasture management at the Jamoat level were prepared comprising:
       identification of the need and possible preparation plans, risk assessment, issues and
       resources, ways of conflict resolution, and the organization of planning and monitoring to
       ensure sustainability;
   -   training modules were developed to improve knowledge and skills of beneficiaries at the
       village and Jamoat level;
   -   Execution of works to allow for successful use of approaches developed by the model area
       in other similar conditions in Tajikistan.

Project implementation identified key aspects related to pasture degradation (the causes, extent and
rate of degradation); outline main directions for pasture improvement and the reduction of pasture
use by specific organizational, economic, and agricultural, animal husbandry, veterinary measures
and methods as well as educational technology and public awareness raising. An action plan was
developed on pasture improvement and conditions created for pasture user associations at the
Jamoat level.

6.3. “Assistance in local market development and fruit (drying) processing?.

Within the framework of this component marketing plans were developed that stipulated the
demonstration of technologies for processing of agricultural products, such as a tunnel dryer and
improved trays for drying of agricultural products, establishing business contacts with potential
buyers, as well as creating conditions for possible assistance from other projects in the future and
initiatives upon complention of CAWMP implementation. Dissemination activities, organization of
training and provision of technical materials facilitated a large number of Community Interest
Groups in understanding the key aspects of marketing.



                                             63
A work plan was also developed which included: (a) assessment of existing and future levels of
agricultural production in project villages where the emphasis is on production of certain
agricultural products, including mainly apricots and apples, and (b) the organization of training on
the wide range of issues (including the value chain, quality of products and quality standards,
processing technology (including the use of trays for drying and tunnel dryers) and preparation of
business plans) as well as development of appropriate work plans by farm production groups, and
(c) the establishment of business relations between farmers groups of the project, local experts,
local enterprises on products processing and the projects funded by donor organizations.

The main work was carried out in two Jamoats, namely Shirinchashma (Tojikobad district) and
Urmetan (Aini district), including additional project activities at district level - in seven districts of
project area with the view to cover a wider target audience.

In addition the Project concluded a contract with NGO, which would provide the necessary
assistance and close cooperation with other projects in agricultural marketing, such as USAID /
PRO-APT, GIZ - Rural Development Programme and the Helvetas - Local Market Development
Project.

7. Lessons Learned and Recommendations

The project has successfully achieved considerable results responding to the needs of beneficiaries.
CAWMP is a success because it has changed the way farmers grasp their potential for income
generation and their relationship with environment. An important impact of the project is that the
numerous small grants to groups of farmers at the village level has resulted in these beneficiaries
being exposed to a large number of potential agriculture and environment related activities; as
interviews for the final evaluation showed, the beneficiaries are far more open minded now thanks
to this project: they exchange views and ideas on new income generating activities, discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of subprojects, their technicalities or consider replicating similar
small-scale initiatives.

Project design:

    - Participatory planning along with village and household budget limits was an effective
mechanism for villagers to prioritize and assess risks of various options, as well as allocate
resources. Furthermore, open disclosure of available funds and amounts allocated to investments
improved accountability. To further disseminate this aspect, the process and results need to be
documented (some documentation already underway) and then share widely with government,
donors and other implementing agencies and organizations so that similar measures can be
included in future planning processes.

     - Right of Use of Land Certificates (RULC) are key for sustainability, especially for
land related subprojects in CAWMP and for other similar initiatives. According to the
CAWMP design the RULC should be issued after 3 years of successful using of subproject (land).
However, during the project implementation and RULC issuance process it was learnt that it would
be better if the RULC is given after 1 year of starting of subproject, even a half year is acceptable.
It increases the confidence of farmers to use the land as a real user and owner, and the certificates
should be issued without delays.



                                                64
     - Although it was not in the project objectives to address broader policy and legal issues
related to pastures and rangelands, sustainable rangeland management will require policy
and legal support informed by practical, field-based examples and experiences such as those
implemented in CAWMP. The project has reduced overgrazing pressure locally within villages’
territories through several types of subprojects and demonstrated activities that contribute to
sustainable rangeland management. Grazing rights are a sensitive topic because it involves several
types of farmers with potentially conflicting interests (family farmer, sheep farmer, Dekhan farms,
and commercial private stock breeder) and might require new legislation and /or law enforcement.

    - Research and demonstration of appropriate technologies can be integrated differently
at project design. The success of the Farmers Competition shows that agricultural innovation and
good practice can be demonstrated and shared in an efficient and effective way. While research
institutes have shown limited practical skills for small-scale applications, new technologies in
upland farms remains a high priority as it increases the value of subprojects even though this may
be risky in terms of adoption.

New technologies / varieties can be tested first on farmer’s plots, their added value demonstrated
before sharing with local authorities and other interested parties. A more practical approach and
different from the focus on research institutes can be considered at raion (Jamoat) level through
Farmer Field Schools - reproducing farming real conditions. In that case, a strong linkage should be
established between the Research (NGO, institute) – Demonstration (farmer’s plot with the
assistance of FO & Hukumat) – Dissemination (FFS 32) (demonstration by farmers and FO).Linking
these activities with government programs or priorities may help to some extent to encourage
Hukumat authorities to keep engaged at the end of a project. It should be noted that these types of
activities will require international assistance of the type that was planned under CAWMP from
IFAD and ICARDA but which unfortunately did not materialize.

A similar approach can be adopted when considering preservation of rare endemic species
(inventory –demonstration (preservation / conservation garden) – dissemination (of species of
interest): a new role for demonstration farmers might also be devised in preserving rare / endemic
species (which would on-site strengthen farmer’s awareness on environment degradation through
FFS).

    - An additional project component (e.g., value chain development, association
formation) to serve successful beneficiaries would have been beneficial to support market
development for subproject products. This would be of benefit when production levels for
certain items such as fruit, vegetables, honey, etc., are enough to sell more commercially. Not all
CIGs have the capacity to understand marketing opportunities and how these might be exploited.

     - Female participation can be strengthened through additional processes during
planning. Women beneficiaries were positively represented in CIGs with 40% of beneficiaries
listed as female but the approach from the beneficiaries’ point of view seemed at times to be more
like filling ‘quotas’ than reflecting women’s concerns. Taking into account local cultural
circumstances, it may be possible to focus on gender specific credibility grants, gender oriented
participatory planning resulting in a more integrated community action plan and subprojects
focusing on women’s strengths.

Implementation:

    - Scale and scope of JDC mandates is effective for delivering services to upland, and
often remote, farmers. In CAWMP sub-district level organizations proved to be an effective
component of scaling-up strategies for SLM in a challenging physical landscape. In the project 39
JDC’s handled more than 3,800 CIGs and over US$7.0m in fund transfers. Additionally,
participatory processes helped ensure that organizations such as JDCs worked effectively with
government management units to deliver technical and financial resources to farmers. Future
efforts should maintain a focus on strengthening sub-district level support to farmers with scaling-
up strategies requiring investment in institutional arrangements. It will be important to ensure that
participatory processes, including financial management mechanisms, are well integrated into SLM
programs.

    - The TOR for FOs should be clearer so as to help ensure financial proposals with a
consistent amount of CIG follow-up. The quantity and quality of the FO’s support has been wide
ranging; some FOs were to support CIGs with less funds but 5 or 6 times more subprojects than
other FOs. In this context, trainings, follow-up of CIGs, monitoring cannot be of the same intensity
between FOs. Contracting also needs to take into account the existing presence and resources that
FOs have in the geographical area of operation.

    - Upon contracting FOs, a comprehensive introduction, e.g., workshops, seminars,
would have been beneficial to explain the objectives and rationale behind the project so that
expectations and roles of all parties were better understood. A lack of orientation from PMU at the
start of the project, itself due in part to lack of steering by the project design team resulted in PMU,
PCU and FO’s using different approaches and independently. This resulted in some cases in
confusing messages for project beneficiaries and difficult relationships between the implementing
agency (at PCU level – to a lesser extend at PMU level) and the FOs.

    - At PCU level, it would be beneficial to have an M&E specialist so as to relieve PMU
monitoring efforts. Monitoring at the PCU level was primarily of financial aspects with little
attention on analyzing the project implementation pace, suggesting improvements or monitoring of
impact. M&E and financial specialists tended to be reactive to PMU M&E requirements and not
proactive. At the same time, any future M&E efforts also need to take into account the limited
capacities and skills available in field locations as well as salary scales for government jobs.

    - A simpler and clearer operational manual for rural investment preparation would
have been more effective. The manual is very comprehensive and relatively clear for professional
staff but for villagers, especially the less well educated, it posed difficulties. The requirements for
environmental analysis, the business plan and the design and calculations of rural infrastructure
were not well understood at project start-up. This resulted in JDC and FOs often preparing the
proposals for those beneficiaries, leading to delays in preparation and/or grants approval because
the information provided by CIGs was incomplete. Future guidelines must accommodate the skill
levels of these beneficiaries with clearer and simpler guidelines for environmental analysis and
feasibility assessment. Similarly, the proposal format requirements need to be simplified for future
operations so that they can be done in time and for the most part prepared by beneficiaries.




                                               66
While the manual was comprehensive on certain aspects such as approval processes, FOs had
considerable flexibility in the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) process leading to the preparation
of the Community Action Plans and the choice of investments by villagers. As a result, there was
variation in the quality of some proposals and some questionable investment choices. In future,
establishing a set of minimum PRA requirements for CAP preparation should help ensure that key
issues are analyzed consistently. These would include participatory environmental analyses,
training in which was provided to project partners part-way through the project.

    - Training in community driven development procurement procedures would have been
beneficial for PMU and PCU staff as well as other project partners. Such training would have
enabled staff to be aware of the flexibility possible in this approach and be more able to provide
suitable advice to beneficiaries, e.g., the options available regarding how many local shopping
quotes are needed for local procurement.

To: Mrs. Marsha Olive
World Bank Country Manager for Tajikistan



Dear Mrs. Olive,

First of all, let me thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft Implementation
Completion Report prepared by the World Bank for Community Agriculture and Watershed
Management Project (CAWMP). The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is interested in
obtaining an objective independent assessment on the results of projects implementation, in order
to learn lessons from the experience of implemented projects.

The Community Agriculture and Watershed Management Project (CAWMP) was one of the first
projects in Tajikistan aimed at the implementation of measures to encourage further development
of agricultural production, rather than merely provision of humanitarian aid. This project was a
starting point and had a great impact, because in addition to being designed to ensure growth of
agricultural production and sustainable management of natural resources, it also provided
opportunities for collective decision-making by the community residents with regards to various
investments to be made. The project was aimed at addressing two major problems in Tajikistan:
reducing poverty through agricultural development and accumulation of income and prevention of
environmental degradation through application of sustainable land management methods and
practices. The project implementation objectives corresponded to the content of government
programs and priorities which include food security, poverty reduction, horticulture development,
sustainable pasture management and improving climate change resilience. Difficulties associated
with the achievement of goals, as well as creation of new jobs, include the need for market
expansion, further improvement of the knowledge base in agriculture and establishment of advisory
services to assist in the development of agricultural production, product processing, and land
management. In addition, the priority for the Government is also to protect mountain ecosystems
that are at risk, such as grasslands and forests that make up the unique collection of the genetic
diversity of wild plants.

The project achieved significant results, given the adjustments that were made in the course of its
implementation in the design and its development concept by working closely with the
communities that were to determine their needs, and also provided for direct participation of rural
people in the allocation of funds, decision-making, implementation and monitoring of activities at

                                             68
the local level, where Jamoat Development Committees played a key role. This initiative is fairly
new for the country, and its successful implementation required additional effort on the part of the
implementation agency and other organizations involved in the implementation. 40% of
investments aimed at improving agricultural production and land management, have been used for
the application of advanced technology and gaining wide access to necessary materials and
knowledge.

The fact that some activities also contributed to the reduction of risks associated with land
degradation due to soil erosion, as well as the improvement of soil resources needed for sustainable
land use, was very important. At least 10,700 hectares of reinforced slopes and reclaimed land
demonstrated positive outcomes. In addition, in line with beekeeping development program,
farmers created more than 5,300 hives that contribute to the revival of a very important economic
activity, as well as an ecological process, which is vital for agricultural production and
conservation of biological diversity. Also, small grants were provided to farmers groups to plant
more than 1.3 million trees on their land covering a total area of approximately 3,000 hectares.

Unfortunately, the project failed to establish a mechanism for the post-project sustainability and
saving the results. This is primarily due to the fact that the project was not integrated into the
system of the Ministry of Agriculture and not aligned with the policy in the agricultural sector. It
would be desirable to establish the project implementation mechanism that would ensure clear
division and understanding of the roles among the different project partners, especially those who
have worked in the field. In addition, cooperation was not established in the course of project
implementation with the Tajik Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Soil Science and the
Institute of Farming Agriculture in order to develop and strengthen the capacity of professionals to
provide advisory services and training for communities. Only a certain support was provided to the
Institute of Botanics in the arrangement of several scientific expeditions to identify more than 300
endemic and rare species of plants, including fruit trees.

We agree with the assessment made by the World Bank with regards to the project and in general
and are grateful for the assistance in the development of the agriculture sector.


Sincerely                                                             J.Piriev
