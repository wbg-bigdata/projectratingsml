THAILAND
I. ENERGY SECTOR
ENERGY CONTEXT
1.01      Thailand is almost completely dependent on imported crude oil to
meet its petroleum requirements. Consumption of oil products is currently
about 184,000 barrels/day and accounts for almost 70 percent of Thailand's
total primary energy requirements. Oil price movements during this decade
have had severe repercussions on the Thai economy. Thailand's net energy
import bill increased from Baht 2,800 million (US$140 million) in 1972 to an
estimated Baht 19,500 million (US$950 million) in 1977, forming 22 percent
of imports and taking 29% of export earnings, almost twice the 1971 proportion.
The 1979 increases will make this position much worse.
1.02      An important element of the Government's energy strategy in the past
decade has been to encourage foreign oil companies to step up their exploration
activity for indigenous oil and gas resources. The first fruit of this effort
has been two sizable gas finds in the Gulf of Thailand by Union Oil and Texas
Pacific, both US oil companies. Union Oil is also testing a smaller structure
nearer to shore. Development of these natural gas finds is estimated to be
capable of providing 20% of Thailand's energy requirements by 1985, providing
the major part of fuel needs for power and industry, and will help stem the
rapid rise in Thailand's net import bill. The proposed Bank loan (US$107.0
million) would part finance the development of a natural gas pipeline system
to take the gas from the offshore platforms to the major consumers.
ENERGY RESOURCES
1.03      Thailand's main indigenous sources of energy have been fuelwood/
charcoal, hydroelectricity, bagasse, lignite and paddy husks, which, in 1977
supplied 17%, 7%, 6%, 2% and 0.3%, respectively, of total energy consump-
tion. Of these, there are minor exports of fuel wood/charcoal and minor
imports of hydro and coal. Petroleum accounted for the remaining 68% of
total energy consumption. Except for a very minor oil field there is no
domestic production of either crude oil or natural gas. Thailand's current
petroleum requirements are met by imported crudes--which are refined in
Thailand--as well as by an increasing proportion of imported petroleum
products.
Non-Hydrocarbon Resources
1.04      Total hydro potential on Thailand's own rivers is about 9300 MW of
which two-thirds appear to be economic. Of this 910 MW 1/ are now in
operation and a further 2200 MW will be constructed during the 1980's. The
potential on the international rivers at 20,000 MW is unlikely to be exploited
until agreement is reached with Burma (Salween) or Laos (Mekong). The lignite
prospects also represent a major potential energy source for Thailand and
economically recoverable reserves at Mae Moh may be as much as 650 million
1/   Excluding the Nam Ngum hydro station in Laos.



tons and may ultimately be capable of supporting 2000 MW of electricity
generating capacity. The Krabi and Li lignite mines have 10 and 14 million
tons of proven recoverable reserves respectively, and Krabi has a potential of
a further 90 million tons not yet proven. Charcoal and fuelwood are used by
the domestic market, but there is little prospect for significant increased
use because of problems of deforestation. Prospecting for geothermal resources
and uranium is at an early stage.
Hydrocarbon Resources
1.05      The only onshore petroleum resources which have been brought into
production are located at Fang in Northern Thailand and yield less than
20,000 tons annually (less than 0.3% of total petroleum consumption). The
Mae Soon reserves at Fang are 90% depleted. Thailand has 2,500 million tons
of oil shale reserves at Mae Sot in Tak province which have been well known
for years; there are also 15 million tons in Lamphoon province. The oil
shale reserves are found in remote locations and are unlikely to be developed
in the foreseeable future because of their relatively high production costs.
1.06      The recent discovery of natural gas and further lignite deposits
will change the resource position substantially, although at this stage their
full extent cannot be known with certainty. The proven gas reserves are
located offshore in the Gulf of Thailand and are in two structures: the "iA"
Structure has been delineated by Union Oil and its gas is already under
contract to the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT); the "B" Structure is
being delineated by Texas Pacific Oil Company and a contract is currently
being negotiated. The two fields are located 425 and 595 km offshore respec-
tively. Preliminary estimates put the "A" Structure proven and probable
reserves of the Union Group (Union Oil and South East Asia Petroleum
Exploration Company) at 1.8 trillion cubic feet, with a delivery capability of
200-250 million cubic feet per day for nearly 20 years. The heat content of
the gas is good despite 15% carbon dioxide content. The proven and probable
reserves of the Texas Pacific Group (Texas Pacific, Canadian Superior and
Highland) are 5.8 trillion cubic feet, but have an inferior heat content. A
third area, the Kaphong and Platong structures, is being tested by Union Oil,
but no firm reserve estimates are yet available.
1.07      None of the structures planned for development stretch into the
offshore areas disputed with Cambodia or Vietnam.  Some of the smaller struc-
tures do cross into the disputed areas. Several other gas reserves have been
discovered in the Gulf of Thailand but have not been delineated. Oil shows
have been small. Additionally, there is a number of structures which have
not been tested but which cover a substantial area.
1.08      Overall, the drilling activity undertaken throughout the 1970's
has met with a relatively high success rate (1 to 3). Consultants' reports
indicate that there are good grounds to believe that further gas potential
remains to be detected in the Gulf of Thailand. The Government's ability
to stimulate further exploration activity will increase the probability of
further petroleum discoveries.

1.09      In the Andaman Sea 11 wells were drilled by 2 companies.  All were
dry and all concessions except one were relinquished.
1.10      Three companies presently hold on-shore concessions:  Meridien Oil
Corporation of Texas (near the Laotian border), ESSO (in the north-east) and
Shell in the central region north of Bangkok. The concessions for the latter
two companies were granted in February 1979 and involved substantial signature
bonuses. One applicant (Terra Marine) was not awarded any license.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND PATTERNS
1.11      Over the last 17 years commercial energy consumption (petroleum,
hydro and lignite) has increased on average by 14% per annum from 1.2 mil-
lion tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) 1/ in 1960 to 10.6 million TOE in 1977.
GDP increased over this period by 7-1/2% per annum, a relationship for com-
mercial energy of 1.85 to 1 which is normal for countries at this stage in
their development. The ratio has fallen substantially during the last few
years. Commercial energy use per capita increased during the 1970's at 2-1/4
times the rate of growth in per capita GDP. Some 68% of Thailand's energy
needs are met from oil products, a proportion which has been virtually constant
in recent years. Recent data is summarized below (Table 1).

112      The largest demand for petroleum is transportation (43% of all
petroleum products). Diesel oil is the major petroleum product consumed,
forming 34% of petroleum demand with 48% being consumed in transportation
and 31% in agriculture. Fuel oil is the next major petroleum product (33%)
with the power sector and manufacturing sector accounting for 54% and 43%
of demand respectively. The rates of growth for LPG and fuel oil at 17%
and 12% have been particularly marked during the 1970's. A major part of
the fuel oil growth has been for electricity, the growth rate for the other
sectors being only 6%.  Quantities of LPG consumed are small.  Detailed
demand by sector is below (Table 2).
1.13      The country's refineries have increased in capacity from 42,000
barrels/day in 1966 to 166,000 barrels/day in 1972, and operate at 100% of
nominal capacity; there have been no capacity increases since 1972. Because
of the extent of their cracking facilities, the fuel oil fractions of the TORC
and ESSO refineries are 18% and 31%, respectively, while the Summit refinery,
which like TORC is a large fully integrated operation, produces as much as 46%
fuel oil fraction; a fourth refinery is a minor operation of 1,000 bbl/day
refining indigenous crude. The proportion of products refined in Thailand has
fallen from 97% in 1972 to 85% in 1977, and will continue to fall until a
refinery expansion takes place. The principal imported products are diesel
oil and fuel oil which represented 23% and 20% respectively in 1977 of total
consumption of these products with imports of 15,000 and 12,000 barrels/day.
Production of other products is close to the national demand and imports/
exports are small.

1.14      The major fuel oil user, the state electricity undertaking (EGAT),
has had difficulty in obtaining sufficient fuel oil to meet its rapidly
growing needs. More hydro-electricity has been generated than has been
merited by hydrological conditions, with the consequence that hydroelectricity
generation in the next few years is likely to be below the longer term capacity.
Power generation has grown by 16% per annum from 4,800 GWh in 1971 to 10,950
GWh in 1977. Installed capacity at end-1977 had grown to 2,740 MW. Of this
capacity, 33% is hydro, 2% is lignite-fired and the remainder is fired by oil
products. Approximately 76% of the oil-fired capacity is at South Bangkok and
13% is at North Bangkok.
DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
1.15      The discovery of the natural gas reserves and the extensions to
the lignite deposits represent a major turning point in Thailand's energy
picture. The opportunity now exists for making a substantial reduction in
Thailand's dependence on energy imports for the duration of the 1980s.
Further substantial hydrocarbon discoveries, or development of the inter-
national hydro-electricity prospects, are essential to maintain this position
through the 1990s.
1.16      The basic projections, developed by the Bank, are as below.  They
are based on a high industrial sector growth rate slightly less than that
experienced since 1973, and assume development of the two proven gas fields
(500 MMSCFD) and the lignite resources. Indigenous energy is expected to grow
by 9 million tons over the ten years to 1990, and to grow from 32% to 43% of
total energy requirements.

1.17      It will be seen that, despite the tremendous increase in the use
of Thailand's own energy resources, the annual demand for oil products is
expected to grow by 7 million tons over the decade, equivalent to 140,000
barrels/day. Growth in demand for diesel oil and gasoline accounts for 75%
of the increase. By contrast, growth in fuel oil demand, which is strongly
affected by the development of natural gas, lignite and hydroelectricity,
averages only 2% and is only 10% of the overall growth.
1.18      These trends are compared to the output from Thailand's three
refineries should they expand as proposed by the refiners, that is, essen-
tially duplicating existing facilities plus the addition of a cracking unit at
the Summit Refinery. Output and exports/imports are summarized below on the
basis that the high industrial sector demand will be sustained. Should there
be any significant slow down in industry, the deficit of residual fuel oil
shown below would be eliminated and could readily become a surplus. This
surplus would be difficult to dispose of without taking a loss on the equiva-
lent crude oil price and consequently could inhibit the development of
indigenous energy resources.

As indicated in the above table, the proposed refinery expansions do not
achieve a good match with demand. Very substantial product imports and
exports are still necessary. Thailand needs a more balanced refinery output
which will minimize its dependency on imported distillate products, especially
diesel oil, and at the same time avoid the production of excessive amounts of
residual fuel oil. A study needs to be made of (i) the country's future
petroleum products demand in the light of the natural gas and lignite supplies
coming into the energy market; and (ii) how the refineries should be expanded
to meet this need most economically. There is also a need for a gas utili-
zation study as discussed below.
*    Production of bitumen and refinery losses amount to 11,000 barrels/day.



- 8 -
1.19      A refinery expansion study will be included in the project in
view of the close interrelationship between petroleum products and natural
gas. The refinery expansion study would comprise, inter alia:
(i)  the preparation of computer software for the analysis
of refinery economics and operations;
(ii)  the development of optimal expansion modes
for the refineries; and
(iii)  the review of pricing structures for refinery products with a view
to relating these prices to policy objectives.
1.20      Initially the electricity industry is expected to absorb 90% of the
supply at Bang Pakong and South Bankok, both of which will be able to operate
on either oil or gas.  The 125 enterprises along the pipeline route between
Sattahip and Bangkok are expected to use the remaining 10% (current use:
200,000 tons of oil per year, equivalent to 22 MMSCFD). In view of the size
of the proven and probable reserves, this use in electricity will not inter-
fere with longer term plans for possible higher value uses. Other energy
demands which could be met by gas include further supplies to power stations
and to industry around Bangkok and at Saraburi. Possibilities which do not
impact on the fuel oil position include LPG extraction, petrochemicals,
ammonia and sponge iron reduction and amount to 200 MMSCFD. The undertaking
of a gas utilization study covering the above issues will be discussed with
PTT at negotiations and agreement on the timing and terms of reference will
be reached at that time.
SECTOR ORGANIZATION
1.21      The private sector has had a predominant role in the exploration,
refining and marketing of oil products in Thailand. The only major state
enterprise in the oil and gas sector is the Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT). Except in relation to refining, the roles of the public and private
sectors have been essentially complementary, there being little competition
surrounding their respective roles in the sector. PTT has recently taken over
the functions and staff of the Natural Gas Organization of Thailand (NGOT) and
the Oil Fuel Organization (OFO).
Exploration and Production
1.22      Two overseas groups, those headed by Union Oil and Texas Pacific,
are active in the Gulf of Thailand in the search for oil and gas, and have
found substantial gas reserves. Union's reserves will be sold to PTT at its
offshore production platforms, and it is expected that the Texas Pacific
contract will be similar. Other overseas groups also have licenses offshore
and onshore.



-9-
Refining
1.23      In oil refining 99% of Thailand's 166,000 bbl/day capacity is
operated by three private enterprise companies. The Thailand Oil Refining
Company (TORC), in which Shell is a major participant along with private
Thai interests, and which has 39% of the country's capacity, is due to become
the property of the Government in 1981 under the terms of a previous expansion
permit. The Summit refinery, also 39% of total capacity, is owned by the
Government and leased to Summit Industrial Corporation, there being 12 years
of the lease remaining. Caltex has recently shown an interest in this re-
finery. The Esso refinery constitutes 21% of capacity and the remaining 1%
is operated by the Ministry of Defense. The future ownership of all of the
refineries is a major issue in the discussions on possible refinery expansion
and its financing. Preliminary reports suggest that the TORC refinery will
have substantial state participation and will be the first to be expanded, but
as yet this is unconfirmed.
Marketing
1.24      Retail oil product marketing is in the hands of essentially the
same organizations as refining, plus Caltex. Shell and Esso are the two
largest retailers, supplied by their own refineries. Summit operates on a
more limited scale, supplying also the Government's marketing outlet, (PTT)
and Caltex. A new company, Samsanpunwang, has been established recently
and primarily sells fuel oil.
Gas Transmission
1.25      The Office of Natural Gas of PTT is responsible for the trans-
mission, treatment and distribution of Thailand's natural gas resulting from
the discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand but is not exploring for petroleum
itself (see Chapter IV).
Electricity Generation and Distribution
1.26      The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is the
largest state-owned enterprise and comes under the jurisdiction of the Prime
Minister's Office. In addition to power generation through hydro, thermal
and -- potentially -- nuclear plants, EGAT is responsible for exploration
and development for lignite for use in power plants. Retail distribution
of electricity is controlled by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
Government Coordination of the Sector
1.27      At present there is no ministry currently responsible for coordi-
nating overall policy in the sector. The present organization is complex.
Important decisions having a bearing on petroleum and broader energy issues
are normally entrusted to a number of ad-hoc subcommittees. The result is a
slow decision making process, but one which works adequately in most respects.
The area particularly needing strengthening is energy planning, which will
be addressed through the energy master plan study. During negotiations the



- 10 -
Government will be asked to consult with the Bank before undertaking any
institutional reorganization of the energy sector affecting natural gas
operations.
1.28      The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) presently comes under the
jurisdiction of the ministries of Industry and Defense and becomes the sole
responsibility of the Ministry of Industry by the end of 1980. The Department
of Mineral Resources of the Ministry of Industry has responsibility for all
mineral exploitation activities including the search for oil and gas both
onshore and offshore, and the licensing of the exploration and production
activities. The industrial arm of the Ministry of Industry is directly
involved in setting ex-refinery prices and taxation policy.  The Ministry of
Commerce sets margins between ex-refinery and retail prices.  The Cabinet and
the Legislative Council also take a direct interest in the establishment of
petroleum products taxes and prices. Complementing the above Government
organization, the Ministry of Defense has its own energy activities, which are
eventually to be absorbed into PTT. The Ministry has its own energy depart-
ment, and has a small oil field and refinery at Fang.
1.29      The Prime Minister's Office, through the National Energy Adminis-
tration (NEA) has responsibility for overall energy planning. NEA has been
operational for only a few years and has initially concentrated on data col-
lection. NEA has commissioned a number of studies in the energy and related
sectors, including refinery expansion and industrial projects. It is cur-
rently discussing with the Asian Development Bank a study for an overall
energy master plan, which is scheduled to begin during 1979. The Prime
Minister's Office is also responsible for EGAT. The Ministry of the
Interior is responsible for MEA and PEA. A newly formed Ministry of Science,
Technology and Energy will be responsible for non-conventional energy.
Government Controls
1.30      The state enterprises are subject to close Government control.
The Government appoints their Boards, is responsible for their budgets, their
investment programs and their borrowings. All large capital investments have
to be approved by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB)
and all borrowings by the Treasury. Purchasing and employment procedures are
similar to the Government's own and the Government approves tariffs. The
state power companies operate satisfactorily in this environment. They are
well managed and generally are profitable. PTT is expected to function
similarly once it has streamlined its procedures. During negotiations the
Government will be requested to ensure the collaboration of its appropriate
agencies in the energy sector in formulating and implementing national energy
policies.
1.31      In the private sector controls also exist.  The Government deter-
mines prices. Investments are subject to permits issued by the Ministry of
Industry; special concessions must be issued by the Board of Investment. The
Government also takes the lion's share of refinery profits through a system by
which it receives the higher of a turnover tax (about 2-1/2%) or a 65% company
tax on profits. Exploration and production require licenses from the Ministry
of Industry.

SECTOR INVESTMENT AND FINANCING
1.32      Total capital investment in Thailand is running at about US$4.8
billion annually which is about 26% of GDP. About two-thirds of the invest-
ment is in the private sector and 1/3 public sector. The private/public
split has been constant through most of the 1970's, as has the proportion
of GDP devoted to capital investment. Of the US$1.5 billion public sector
investment, US$0.9 billion is by central and local government in areas such
as highways and agriculture and US$0.6 billion is by the state enterprises,
i.e. 12-1/2% of the national capital investment. In the last year for which
data is available (1977) the three state power organizations invested US$230
million (38% of the state enterprise total), water 18%, telephones 14%, and
30% on other activities. State investment in oil refineries and the Oil and
Fuel Organization was only US$2 million.
1.33      The investment now envisaged for energy is large in itself and
in relation to the Thai economy. The major public sector investments in
gas, lignite and hydro are expected to be substantially greater than in
the past, as is investment in thermal power plants and in distribution.
The private sector investments in developing the offshore gas fields will
also be extremely large. Latest energy sector estimates are:
$ million         Years
Onshore exploration                           180         1979 - 89
Gas field developments                        740         1978 - 84

LPG plant                                      70         1985 or later
1.34      The level of energy investment in each year will depend on the rate
of development -f txe present gas finds and future petroleum discoveries.
Based on present plans, the peak year for capital investment in energy is
likely to be 1980. Financing of the energy sector varies according to who is
making the investment. EGAT's funds are expected to be 33% from its own and
local sources, 3% suppliers credits, 52% from foreign loans and international
agencies and 12% from the Government. Hydroelectricity forms one third of the
power investment program. PTT has no earnings and consequently the pipeline
funding is likely to be almost entirely from loans (para 2.20). The financing
of the Union gas field developments are likely to be from internal sources and
the Texas Pacific development is likely to be financed through borrowings.
1.35      Preliminary assessments show that the proposed investment program is
reasonable.

SECTOR POLICIES
Resource Development
(a) Sector Legislation
1.36      Development of Thailand's petroleum resources is governed by the
Petroleum Act of 1971. A Petroleum Committee consisting mainly of repre-
sentatives of the various Government Departments advises the Minister on all
aspects of the award, amendment or renewal of concessions and related matters.
Exploration permits are limited to eight years, subject to one possible renewal.
Fifty percent of the area is to be relinquished after five years. Production
permits are for thirty years with the possibility of a ten year extension.
Transfers between licensees are possible subject to the agreement of the
Council of Ministers. Exploration permits include obligatory work programs
which are negotiated individually with each group. Only one offshore permit -
one of the Texas Pacific concession blocks containing the 'B' Structure -
gives the option of Government participation in field development.
1.37      Concessionaires are entitled to sell any crude oil at market prices.
Natural gas is to be sold at an agreed price which will give a reasonable
profit. The legislation prohibits the state from nationalizing the conces-
sionaire's property and, except in a national emergency, from restricting the
export of petroleum.
(b)  Tax Regime
1.38      Thailand is in the process of updating its petroleum tax laws to
make them compatible with the US system whilst retaining Thai policy objec-
tives. Under present 1/ legislation, companies producing oil and gas are
exempt from taxes other than petroleum income tax, royalties and fees,
where applicable. Royalties are calculated at 12-1/2% of the well-head price
and are payable in cash or kind, at the Government's discretion. Under the
revised system 50% of the royalty would be allowed as a tax credit, but cannot
be carried forward. Petroleum income taxes are levied in two parts, together
amounting to 50% of net profits. Downstream operations, in the same way as
non-petroleum businesses, are taxed under the general revenue code. Capital
allowances are detailed by royal decree. Losses may be carried forward for
up to ten years. Taxes are to be paid within five months of the end of the
company's accounting period. The implications of the tax regime on the
project are discussed in Annex 3.01.
Pricing
(a) Ex-Refinery Prices
1.39      The basis for establishing ex-refinery prices for petroleum prod-
ucts in Thailand has broadly been f.o.b. ex-refinery prices of equivalent
products in Singapore. Thai refineries are profitable with this pricing
1/   Petroleum Income Tax Act 1971.



- 13 -
basis despite the price controls and the severe tax system. The current
ex-refinery prices are as below. Singapore spot market prices are shown
alongside for comparison, although because of the volatile nature of spot
markets and the recent rapid rise in price levels such comparisons must be
treated with caution.

The overall refinery prices are adequate to ensure a minimum financial position
for the refineries. However, it is important for the prices of the various
products to bear an appropriate relationship between themselves so as to ensure
the right economic incentives for the refiners to match their output to the
national needs, in particular in relation to the refinery expansions the
incentives for producing fuel oil need to be minimized and encouragement needs
to be given to the production of more diesel.
(b) Consumer Prices
1.40      Prior to 1973, consumer prices of petroleum products were based
on ex-refinery prices which closely approximated import parity. Following
the 1973 oil price increase, domestic prices of all products were raised
on five separate occasions between July 1973 and February 1974; between
February 1974 and March 1977 domestic prices changes were minimal. Consumer
pricing policy was guided in this period by a Government strategy aimed at
shielding Thailand's economy from the potentially disruptive effects that
might be caused by an immediate adjustment to import parity following each of
the increases in international crude oil prices. Concurrently, in 1976 and
1977 consumption of refined products grew on average at a rate of 11% per
year, following two years of virtually zero growth. In March 1977 the Govern-
ment announced an across the board 10-16 percent price increase for all types
of oil products. This was followed by other price adjustments in March and
December 1978, March and July 1979. Current Thai retail prices are shown
below and are to be compared with the equivalent retail price levels in other
oil importing Asian countries as well as in Europe and the United States.
The prices quoted as comparators are prior to the surge in prices during the
current year.

U.S.A.                         0.64
1.41       Further increases will be necessary as international petroleum
prices change. In the context of increasing traffic congestion and pollution
in Bangkok, the issue of gasoline pricing is one that requires careful exam-
ination. Furthermore, the retail price of diesel oil merits special attention
in view of its key role in the economy and the probable supply difficulties in
the 1980's. To avoid subsidies in the energy sector it is important that the
price for EGAT's natural gas be closely related to international fuel oil
prices throughout the 1980's. The determination of appropriate prices between
PTT and EGAT will be agreed during negotiations (see also paragraph 5.02).
(c) Fiscal Revenues
1.42      Two taxes--an excise tax and a business/municipal tax, are levied
on petroleum products. The taxes are levied primarily on the sale of gasoline;
tax margins are lower for diesel and much lower for fuel oil, in keeping with
the Government policy of maintaining relatively lower consumer prices in the
important industrial sectors. Excise taxes on gasoline were maintained at
approximately the same level from 1973 (i.e. 1.00 Baht/liter or US$0.20/gallon)
until March 1978 when the excise tax on gasoline was increased to 1.83 Baht/
liter (or US$0.37/gallon); excise taxes on diesel, however, have been reduced
progressively by more than 50% from their level in 1973, and have almost been
eliminated for fuel oil. Total excise revenues from petroleum products
remained virtually constant in 1973, 1974 and 1975 but increased sharply
in 1976 with the increased level of consumption of petroleum products and
increased further in 1977 and 1978 to 75% above the 1974 level. In these
years they comprised approximately 30% of total excise tax revenues, down
from an average of 40% in the early 1970's.
ROLE OF THE BANK
1.43      The Bank has had a longstanding involvement in helping to develop
the power sector.  It has made nine loans to the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand totalling US$362 million, it has made an engineering
loan (US$4.9 million) for the first phase of the development of Thailand's
natural gas potential, and is planning assistance for the further development
of Thailand's lignite resources. Thailand's natural gas potential and lignite
resources are closely related to the development of a least cost solution for
meeting future electricity demand. An optimum energy development strategy
must also take into account macroeconomic considerations (with the heavy
demand of energy investments on resources), and energy pricing considerations,



- 15 -
as well as the Government's desire to maintain an adequate level of exploration
activity (in the Gulf of Thailand and in onshore areas) with the objective of
detecting crude oil. The proposed energy master plan which is scheduled to be
completed during 1981 will examine a number of these issues. The Bank will be
closely associated with this study.
1.44      The Bank has been associated with Thailand's program to exploit the
natural gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand since mid-1976. Its initial
role centered on identifying and coordinating basic studies and activities
necessary for project preparation, assisting with terms of reference for
consultants to carry out such studies, and advising the Government in setting
up a national gas entity responsible for the construction and operation of a
gas pipeline and distribution system. The principal objectives were to ensure
that: (a) a market existed for the gas and that it was economically feasible
to bring the gas to this market; (b) the Government obtained competent tech-
nical and legal advice in its negotiations with Union Oil and Texas Pacific
for the purchase of the gas; (c) adequate gas reserves were proved and
certified by an independent expert appraiser before making any construction
commitments; and (d) the necessary institutional arrangements were made to
carry on a gas transport, distribution and sales operation. Over the next
three years during the construction of the pipeline and throughout the early
years of operation, there will be a continuing need for the Bank's presence
in working with PTT on future project preparation. In addition, the Bank's
presence will help ensure better financial terms.
1.45      Over the last three years, the Bank has built up an effective work-
ing relationship with NGOT and PTT; but also with the Government ministries
and agencies responsible for the development of Thailand's indigenous energy
resources, and with the two successful oil companies. It is important that
this role be continued during the coming years.
II. THE PROJECT
BACKGROUND
2.01      By late 1977 it was apparent from drilling results and market
studies that a project to utilize the Gulf of Thailand gas would make a
major contribution to Thailand's economy and that it should be implemented
as soon as possible. In view of this, the Government requested that the
Bank consider an engineering loan to accelerate completion of the project.
The engineering project was appraised in October 1977 and a US$4.9 million
loan was negotiated during February 27 to March 2, 1978. Board presentation
was delayed until July 11, 1978 because negotiations with Union Oil went more
slowly than had been anticipated. The loan became effective on September 25,
1978 and covers project engineering and preliminary implementation services,
financial management services, reserves appraisals, advisory services and
training. NGOT selected Fluor Ocean Services, a division of the Fluor Corpora-
tion (USA) for the engineering and implementation services and Chase Manhattan
Asia Ltd. for the financial services. Training assistance and miscellaneous
advisory services were provided by retired executives in the U.S. gas industry



- 16 -
assigned to NGOT by International Executive Services.   Selected NGOT personnel
were also assigned to Fluor and to DeGolyer and MacNaughton (reservoir consul-
tants) for training. The British Gas Corporation has provided technical and
legal advice during gas contract negotiations. The US$4.9 million loan
covering the foreign exchange cost of these services is expected to be fully
disbursed by October/November 1979 and would be refinanced under the proposed
loan.
GAS RESERVES AND DELIVERIES
2.02      Union Oil's (and its partner South East Asia Petroleum Exploration
Co.) commercial discovery is located in what is known as the "A" Structure
field.  The field is an elongated cigar shaped structure about 25 km long by
5 km wide, with the long axis being in a roughly north-south direction. It is
located about 425 km south of Sattahip in the central portion of the Gulf of
Thailand where the water depth averages about 210 feet. (See Map IBRD 13476R).
Gas production along with some condensate comes from relatively thin sandstone
reservoirs lying between 5,000 and 9,000 feet feet below the Gulf.
2.03      In addition to three wells drilled before the gas contract negotia-
tions, Union Oil has drilled an additional 4 wells to delineate the productive
zone and to provide the necessary geophysical and other reservoir data to
estimate the field's gas reserves. A condition of the gas contract was that
1.0 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proved recoverable reserves must be estab-
lished and certified by an independent reservoir evaluation, the results of
which must be agreed to by both parties before the contract becomes effective.
The reserves evaluation was made by DeGolyer and MacNaughton and a report
(March 1, 1979) of their findings set recoverable proved reserves at 1.1
tcf and recoverable probable reserves at 0.4 tcf. Union Oil and PTT have
both accepted these values. The gas contract obligated Union Oil to deliver
and PTT to purchase certain quantities of gas 36 months following agreement
on the proved reserves quantity. However, PTT and Union Oil have agreed to
an earlier date and larger initial deliveries. Gas deliveries and purchases
are now expected to begin on October 1, 1981. Deliveries for the first
contract year have been set at 200 MMSCFD and 250 MMSCFD thereafter, with
provisions for yearly adjustments of the quantity as the reservoir is depleted.
The field is expected to have a production life of about 20 years.
2.04      Union Oil has subsequently drilled two additional delineation wells.
The first, on the eastern flank of the structure, missed the gas bearing zone.
However, the second, on the south end of the long axis, extended the proved
area substantially. DeGolyer and MacNaughton's certification now places
proved recoverable reserves at 1.58 tcf and probable at 0.22 tcf.
2.05      The Texas Pacific discovery is located in a concession area, shared
with Canadian Superior Oil Co. and Highland Inc., in what is known as the "B"
Structure field. It is located about 170 km southeast of the "A" Structure in
the northern portion of the Malay Basin where water depth averages about 245
feet. Natural gas deposits with little or no condensate are found in numerous
sandstone reservoirs at depths ranging between 3,200 and 8,800 feet below the
Gulf. The field is much larger than the "A" Structure. Its full areal extent
has not yet been determined from the wells drilled so far.



- 1 7 -
2.06      Texas Pacific has drilled 10 wells into the structure, and all have
been successful. DeGolyer and MacNaughton have made a reserves evaluation of
the field based on the data provided by these ten wells. The report of their
findings (March 1, 1979) estimates the proved recoverable reserves at 1.3 tcf
and the probable recoverable reserves at 4.5 tcf. Negotiations are under way
between PTT and Texas Pacific for gas delivery and purchase to begin 45 months
after the date of signing. Delivery quantities for the first and second
contract year are 150 MMSCFD, 200 MMSCFD for the third year and 250 MMSCFD
thereafter with provisions for adjusting the amount for reservoir reserves.
2.07      Union Oil is in the process of delineating and proving reserves in
two gas bearing structures (Kaphong and Platong) approximately 60 km north of
its "A" Structure field and 40 km to the east of the pipeline route. Five
wells have been drilled, and indications are that the fields contain about 0.5
tcf of recoverable reserves capable of an initial production rate of 100
MMSCFD. Negotiations for the recovery of these reserves are expected to begin
during late 1979. Depending on the time required to reach a sales agreement,
gas deliveries could start some time in 1983.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.08      The project financed by the proposed loan constitutes the initial
phase in exploiting Thailand's natural gas reserves and comprises a pipeline
system to transport and distribute gas from Union Oil's "A" Structure field
to consumers in the Bangkok area. Pipe diameters have been optimized on
the basis of a total design flow rate of 500 MMSCFD, one half coming from the
"A" Structure field and the other half from the "B" Structure field, with
the capability of expanding the capacity to beyond 700 MMSCFD. A pipeline
sized for the "A" Structure reserves alone would have been slightly smaller
and would have cost about $60 million (12%) less, but would have had to be
duplicated when the "B" Structure reserves became available. Should for
some unforeseen reason the Texas Pacific "B" Structure reserves not be con-
nected in the near future, the proposed pipeline from the "A" Structure will
be economic (para. 3.08) and be the basis for a financially sound operation.
The project (the "A" Structure Phase only) includes the items listed below
(see Map IBRD 13476R). During negotiations assurance would be sought that
consultants satisfactory to the Bank and Borrower would be engaged in carrying
out the related project activities included in the list.
Pipeline
(a) a 34" submarine buried pipeline from Union Oil's production
platform to landfall near Sattahip having a total length of
approximately 425 km and provisions for future underwater
tie-ins at two additional production sites and one inter-
mediate compressor station. Metering and scraper launching
and receiving facilities would be located on the Union Oil
platform;



- 18 -
(b) a 34" buried pipeline from landfall to a terminal
near Sattahip and a 28" buried pipeline from the
terminal to the Bang Pakong and South Bangkok power
plants covering a distance of approximately 170 km;
Infrastructure
(c) an onshore terminal consisting of facilities for:
-    scraper receiving and launching and slug catching
-    metering
-    hydrocarbon dew point control
-    condensate handling and storage
-    office and other buildings, personnel
housing and support
-    provisions for a future compressor station
and a future gas processing plant
(d)  a distribution system from the 28" trunk line by
various sized laterals to the consumers;
(e) an operations center near Bang Pakong to house
PTT's operational and maintenance functions along
with the necessary personnel housing and support
facilities;
(f) a communication system consisting of:
-    onshore voice communication between all operational
and maintenance units by VHF radio system
-    offshore voice communication by means of a single
sideband radio system
-    onshore data communication by VHF splinter frequency
radio
-    telephone circuit
-    possible future tie-in to a satellite communication
system;
(g) a supervisory control system to provide data acquisition
and display, control and safety monitoring capabilities
through a radio link with the various remote units; and
(h)  a cathodic protection system for the onshore and offshore
piping.
Consultancy Services
(a) engineering, procurement, project management, construction
supervision, start-up and commissioning services by
consultants;



- 19 -
(b)  training of PTT staff in the various skills required in
a natural gas pipeline transportation and distribution
organization and new operations and responsibilities
assumed under the PTT Act;
(c)  advisory services by outside consultants in areas of finance
and technical assistancu
(d)  consultancy services for carrying out a gas utilization and
refinery expansion study (paras 1.19 and 1.20); and
(e)  energy conservation studies including energy audit, an
investment program for energy saving, policies for energy
demand management and future investment in energy including
non-conventional source~s.
2.09      Considering Thailand's urgent energy needs, it can be expected
that the pipeline system will be extended in the near future to the "B"
Structure and also, by a lateral from the main pipeline, to the Kaphong and
Platong Structures. The timing of these system expansions will depend on the
progress made with contract negotiations. On gas becoming available, provision
has been made in the proposed loan to finance their engineering costs should
any savings result from the present allocations. For the purpose of evaluating
the financial and economic impact of the "B" Structure Phase, it has been
assumed that contract gas deliveries would begin on October 1, 1983. This
date corresponds to contract signing on January 1, 1980 and allows a three
month "running in" or debugging period similar to the "A" Structure Phase
schedule. The major "B" Structure Phase components are listed below. There
is insufficient data at this time to include the Kaphong/Platong Phase.
(a)  a 32" submarine, buried and cathodically protected
pipeline from Union Oil's platform to Texas Pacific's
having a total length of about 170 km;
(b)  scraper launching and metering facilities on the
Texas Pacific platform;
(c)  tie-in to the supervisory control system; and
(d)  a compressor station at the onshore terminal.
UNION OIL'S DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
2.10      Based on the latest reservoir study by DeGolyer and MacNaughton,
it is estimated that five platforms each containing seven dual completion
wells will be required to develop the gas production from the "A" Structure
field. The gas will be produced from an upper and a lower zone through two
tubing strings and collected through a system of flow lines at a central
platform. At the plaftform condensate will be removed from the gas, and
it will then be metered and tied into the PTT pipeline. Along with PTT's
scraper and metering facilities, the platform will contain condensate handling
and storage, corrosion and hydrate inhibitor injection and helicopter landing
facilities. Additional operating facilities will include a flare system and



- 20 -
a mooring system for a tanker or barge to collect and transport condensate to
one of the Bangkok refineries. The capital investment required for developing
the "A" Structure field was estimated to be around US$320 million in 1978.
TEXAS PACIFIC'S DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
2.11      A recent DeGolyer and MacNaughton reservoir study estimates that
to develop a production rate of 250 MMSCFD from the "B" Structure field
will require 5 platforms containing 10 wells each. Production will be from
dual completion wells similar to the "A" Structure wells except that the
reservoir will be divided into more than two producing zones. This will
require periodic recompletion of the wells, normally three times during the
life of the well, as production is shifted from zone to zone. The gas wil be
gathered by a system of flow lines to a main platform containing the required
processing and compression facilities and the tie-in to PTT's pipeline. The
main platform equipment will be similar to that on Union Oil's, and it will in
addition include dehydration, hydrocarbon dew point control, compression and
ancillary equipment along with operator housing and support facilities. There
will also be similar flaring and condensate shipping provisions. An estimated
investment of US$420 million is required for developing the "B" Structure
field.
STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION
2.12      All project preparation activities have been completed.  Decca Survey
Ltd. and Hunting Surveys and Consultants Ltd. completed a marine survey of the
offshore pipeline route in December 1977 and Thai Engineering Consultants
finished a survey of the land portion at about the same time. Pipeline Tech-
nologists supervised both surveys. Fluor has completed the optimization and
preliminary engineering studies, the findings and conclusions of which were
contained in a report issued in September 1978. Prequalification and procure-
ment documents for long delivery items have been prepared and contracts for
these items are expected to be awarded in October 1979. Chase Manhattan has
issued its report covering the economic and financial evaluation of the project
and the financing plan. Land and right-of-way acquisition is proceeding
satisfactorily.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
2.13      PTT would have overall responsibility and control over the project.
Negotiations are currently under way with Fluor, engineering consultants, for
the execution of the project through the commissioning and start-up stages.
The consultants would provide all the necessary project management services
including procurement and construction supervision. Fluor, a major inter-
national engineering and construction firm has the experience and competence
to carry out the project successfully. Appropriate PTT staff would partici-
pate in the project implementation activities as part of the training program.
2.14      The offshore and onshore pipelines would be constructed by inter-
national contractors. With the possible exception of the communication and
supervisory control system, the infrastructure construction contracts are most
likely to go to local Thai firms. Construction activities are scheduled to
begin in January 1980. Annex 2.02 shows the master program schedule for the
proj ect.



- 21 -
2.15      The Union Oil sales agreement obligates PTT to take or pay for 200
MMSCFD of gas per day (approximately $240,000 in 1978 US dollars) for the
first contract year expected to begin October 1, 1981. Much of the front
end cushion originally included in the project schedule has been used up by
various administrative delays. The project schedule is still a realistic one
which can be maintained without resorting to costly crash program measures.
However, in forthcoming months the schedule will require prompt and expedient
responses to approval requests and other input required by the project manage-
ment consultant from PTT and government agencies involved in the project.
2.16      In view of the critical importance of completing the project on
schedule, the Bank considers it essential that PTT institute a system of
progress review and an action plan to monitor and maintain the project
schedule. The chief objective should be to identify and highlight potential
delays and fix responsibility for corrective actions. The Bank has called
this to PTT's attention. During negotiations, agreement would be reached
on the format and frequency of progress reports to the Bank, and the imple-
mentation of a satisfactory project control system.
PROJECT COSTS
2.1i      The "A" Structure Phase is estimated to cost US$482 million
of which US$308 million or 64% represents the foreign exchange component.
A physical contingency of 10% was applied to all costs. The basic project
cost estimate is in 1978 US dollars. Local costs were escalated at 9% per
year over the project duration. An average price contingency of 6.5% per
year was added to the foreign cost of equipment, materials and civil works
except for the line pipe, offshore pipelaying and pipe coating and wrapping.
The cost of these items was not inflated since firm quotations and a survey
of construction costs trends indicate that their price is not expected to
increase during the period they are to be procured. Project engineering
management and construction supervision costs are based on 5,000 man months
using an average of US$7,100 per man month for expatriate personnel based at
home, US$8,600 per man month for expatriate personnel based in Thailand and
US$1,900 per man month for Thai engineering firms participating in the pro-
ject, plus a profit fee estimated at US$4.0 million.
2.18      The cost estimate is based on critical materials and service con-
tracts being placed no later than October, 1979 and that the present project
schedule will be maintained. (See paras. 2.16 and 2.17). Any delays in the
schedule affecting critical milestones would require trade-offs of money for
time and could increase costs substantially depending on the nature of the
delays. The following table gives a breakdown of the "A" Structure Phase
estimated costs.

2.19      A firm estimate of the "B" Structure Phase cannot be made until a
sales agreement is reached with Texas Pacific and details of Texas Pacific's
and PTT's responsibilities are settled. For the present, it is estimated that
the cost will be approximately US$220 million based on the assumption that
Texas Pacific will supply the offshore gas compression and treatment facili-
ties. On this basis, the total cost of the pipeline system extended to the
"B" Structure is estimated to be US$702 million of which approximately US$460
million or 66% would be in foreign costs. Including interest during construc-
tion, the total cost is US$736 million. The total investment excluding the
Kaphong/Platong Phase by the oil companies and PTT is estimated to be US$1,440
million without interest during construction.

PROJECT FINANCING PLAN
2.20      PTT's lack of previous operations results in the Government being
the only possible source of equity finance prior to operations. This creates
considerable difficulties as the Government has been trying to limit its
expenditure and cut its budgetary deficits. Diversion of resources to this
project would interfere with the overall development strategy and divert funds
from the poverty alleviation programs. Consequently, PTT will be financed
almost entirely by borrowing except for land and taxes. This is acceptable
provided the contractual risks are passed on to EGAT. Moreover, in a short
time PTT will have substantial retained earnings which can be passed on to
the Government when not required by PTT.
2.21      Funding of the project is expected to be as indicated in the
following table:

The plan is based on the Government providing equity from the national budget
to pay for land, rights of way and taxes. The US$77 million (including contin-
gencies) sum equates with the capital taxes payable on the project by PTT,
plus land and rights of way.Agreement on the Government's input will be sought
at negotiations.
2.22      The proposed Bank loan of US$107.0 million, including US$4.9 million
to cover refinancing of the engineering loan, would be made to PTT at the
current lending rate for 20 years including 5 years of grace. The loan
would be equal to 20% of the "A" Structure Phase cost and 14% with the "B"
Structure Phase included; the percentages of the respective foreign exchange
costs would be 34% and 20%. By the time the loan is signed, PTT will have
disbursed approximately US$3.0 million for project design, consultants and
training. It is proposed that expenditures incurred after the engineering
loan has been drawn down be retroactively financed from the proposed loan.
2.23      The financial plan recommended by Chase Manhattan is to take the
maximum loans possible from the international financial institutions and
the export credit agencies and to fund the balance from commercial sources
in Japan and Europe. Discussions with the export credit agencies in the
United States, Japan and Western Europe have indicated that any Thai purchases
in these countries for the project will be funded through the appropriate
export credit agencies. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that
appropriate commitments for export credits had been arranged.



- 25 -
2.24      The commercial loan market open to PTT was investigated in depth by
Chase. They found that there would be no difficulty in syndicating a yen loan
with leading Japanese banks on fixed interest terms and a floating rate
Eurodollar loan from western banks. Most of these commercial funds would be
to finance local currency costs. Commercial loans are also available to
finance foreign currency costs for those cases where export credit finance is
not available. The commercial loans and export credits would be linked to the
Bank's loan through cross-default provisions. A US$40 million revolving credit
has been arranged from a Japanese bank to finance capital payments in advance
of receiving the various tranches of the overseas loans. The revolving credit
would also provide working capital needs. The first tranche of the commercial
loan will not be needed before May 31, 1980.  The timing and amount of the
commercial loan will be agreed at negotiations.
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
2.25      The offshore and onshore pipe laying contracts to be partially
financed from proceeds of the proposed loan would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. PTT has
been instructed by its Board of Directors that all other project imports,
insofar as practical, should be procured through international competitive
bidding. This practice has been followed in all procurement activities so
far. To avoid delay in the completion of the project advance contracting is
necessary for long lead time items: line pipe (US$90 million), pipe fittings
and valves (US$8 million) and the pipe wrap and coating contract (US$56
million). These items are being procured through international competitive
bidding but are not included in the items financed by the Bank loan. Requests
for financing were included in the bid documents, and it is expected that
export credits will finance the major portion (80-85%) of the foreign exchange
costs. Commercial loans will finance the balance. Retroactive financing will
be limited to US$3 million (para. 2.22).
2.26      The proposed Bank loan would be applied to "A" Structure Phase
expenditures. It would be disbursed as indicated below. Funds have been
allocated to items normally not eligible for financing by other lending
institutions and the pipelaying contracts. Any savings from the present
allocations would be used to fund engineering services for subsequent phases
should satisfactory sales agreements be entered into in time.

2.27      The loan should be fully disbursed by the third quarter of 1983.
The closing date would be December 31, 1983. Annex 2.01 gives the estimated
disbursement schedule.
TRAINING
2.28      PTT is staffed by well educated and competent personnel, but none
of them is experienced in the operation and maintenance of a pipeline system.
Training of selected staff in areas such as gas technology, engineering,
project management and reservoir sciences has been in progress since granting
of the engineering loan. The time is approaching when training emphasis will
have to switch to the more practical aspects of pipeline operations. PTT
recognizes this need and has agreed to appoint a qualified consultant from
an operating pipeline company to set up and administrate a training program
covering all facets of operating a high pressure natural gas pipeline and
distribution system. The training would include a period of on-the-job
assignments with a natural gas pipeline company for a group of key operating
personnel.
2.29      As part of the training program, PTT should appoint a qualified
member of its own staff to work with the training consultant. The objective
would be for the PTT member eventually to assume the responsibilities of
training officer for the organization. Considering the large probable
reserves in the "B" Structure field and the good prospects for additional
discoveries, PTT's activities in gas distribution and processing can be
expected to expand over the years. An appropriate on-going training program
would be a continuing need.



- 27 -
2.30      During negotiations PTT would be requested to review its training
plans with the Bank and give assurance that a satisfactory training program
would be initiated by March 1, 1980. In order to prepare the training program
a training consultant is expected to be appointed by December 1, 1979.
ECOLOGY AND SAFETY
2.31      The proposed gas development project does not pose serious ecolo-
gical problems. PTT with the assistance of its consultants is preparing an
environmental protection program to cover construction and operation of the
pipeline. The Environmental Impact Division of the Thai National Environmental
Board has issued guidelines to PTT for the preparation of an environmental
impact statement. A draft copy of the statement has been forwarded to the
Bank for review. The Thai guidelines require PTT to have an environmental
protection staff (presently anticipated to consist of three specialists) in
its organization. It should be added that the project should improve air
quality in the South Bangkok area by making a clean burning sulfur free fuel
available in place of the sulfur bearing soot producing fuel oil now consumed.
2.32      Gas pipelines generally have a good safety record.  Both the onshore
and offshore portions will be buried to a depth providing at least three feet
of cover to minimize accidental damage. The supervisory control system will
monitor operating conditions and provide adequate warning and shutdown func-
tions during deviations from safe limits. As in all similar installations, a
main concern will be operator errors and the maintenance of critical operating
equipment and the cathodic protection system. PTT's training program will
include due emphasis on the importance of safety and preventive maintenance.
LAND AND RIGHT-OF-WAY
2.33      The pipeline traverses an area of private farmland, and the opera-
tions center and terminal are located on privately held land as well. PTT,
using its power of eminent domain, has initiated the necessary legal action
to acquire the land and rights of way needed for the project.
PROJECT RISKS
2.34      Offshore petroleum developments carry risks which can be minimized
but not entirely eliminated. The natural gas project faces geological and
operational risks; it carries risks of costly delays in completion, in the
market not being sufficient, and in the dependence placed by Thailand on a
single pipeline. The risks are discussed below; none is considered a sig-
nificant deterrent to the project.
2.35      Both concessionaries and a competent independent reservoir con-
sultant have evaluated the natural gas reserves allocated to the project.
Although these evaluations are intended to be, and normally are, conserva-
tive, there is always a chance that a field will not live up to expectations.
The project is to a large extent protected from this geological risk in that
no account has been taken in the economic assessment of the very substantial
"B" Structure probable reserves. Total proven and probable reserves are about
five times the level needed to make the project economic.



- 28 -
2.36      Offshore oil and gas development poses construction and operational
risks not encountered onshore. However, the industry has developed technics
and technology to reduce them to acceptable levels, even in severe environ-
ments like the North Sea. By comparison, the Gulf of Thailand offers rela-
tively few technical challenges by way of water depths and weather conditions.
Furthermore, PTT has appointed experienced consultants for the design and
implementation of the project, and only contractors with extensive offshore
experience will be employed for construction of all the offshore facilities.
Both Union Oil and Texas Pacific are experienced natural gas producers.
2.37      A delay in project completion is not anticipated, but there is
always a chance that unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents and abnormal
weather, will impede progress. Failure to accept contract deliveries on the
expected October 1, 1981 contract date would cost PTT about US$240,000 per
day. The risk of a cost overrun in the Union phase of the project is small
as the major contracts will be let this year on fixed price terms.
III. ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT
BACKGROUND
3.01      This chapter discusses the cash outlays and overall benefits to
Thailand from the offshore gas development, and examines the implications
on Thailand's economy. The alternative to developing the gas fields is
increased fuel oil consumption, there are no other practicable alternatives
within this time frame.
3.02      The offshore gas fields will be developed by Union Oil and Texas
Pacific, and the gas will be transported to the ultimate consumers by PTT.
The extent to which they share in the profits will depend on precisely how
they allocate the task of building certain of the facilities and on the terms
of their gas supply contracts. Union and Texas Pacific will be responsible
for development of their respective fields and for ensuring that the gas
is delivered to PTT in the right quantity, quality and pressure. PTT's
responsibility will be to take the gas at the offshore platforms and deliver
it to its customers at various points in Thailand. In relation to the Texas
Pacific gas the responsibility for offshore compression has yet to be agreed.
3.03      PTT and the Union Group signed a gas supply contract for the "A"
Structure on September 28, 1978. As a result of a contract modification in
May 1979 Union are obligated to supply, and PTT is obligated to accept or
pay for, 200 million cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas for the year
running from October 1981 to September 1982, and 250 MMSCFD for subsequent
years. At 1976 price levels the agreed price, based on 250 MMSCFD, was
US$1.045 per million Btu (i.e. per thousand cubic feet at 1000 Btu/cu ft).
Price escalation was based 40% on Singapore fuel oil prices and 30% on Thai
wholesale and 30% on US export prices, with a lag of a little over one year.
Effectiveness of the contract was dependent on two events, (1) the proving of
1 trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves - which was achieved in March
1979, and (2) approval by the US Internal Revenue Service of the eligibility



- 29 -
of Thai tax payments as credits against US taxes. This latter problem is
expected to be overcome by October 1979 and is discussed more fully in Annex
3.01. Its solution is a condition of loan effectiveness. On the assumption
that a favorable ruling is eventually received, both the purchaser and Union
will make substantial profits from this contract. As discussed subsequently,
the economic rate of return for the Kingdom of Thailand on the Union "A"
Structure part of the project is about 53%.
3.04      A gas supply contract between PTT and the Texas Pacific Group is
currently under discussion. Most issues have been resolved and the major
difference between the two sides is price, related to which is the responsi-
bility for compression and dehydration at the platform. The form of contract
would be similar to that with Union, but with a slower build up to the 250
MMSCFD production level. Provisional price escalation clauses are based
entirely on cost factors. Texas Pacific also will need IRS approval of the
eligibility of Thai taxes as foreign tax credits. The profitability of the
Texas Pacific gas development will be less than that for Union, principally
because of the lower gas quality and the lack of condensates. The extent to
which the two parties benefit will depend on the contract.
THE MARKET
3.05      The 250 MMSCFD from each of the "A" and "B" Structures can be
absorbed by the Thai energy market. The major part of the gas would be
used in the dual-fired power plants at Bang Pakong and South Bangkok. The
remainder of the gas will be to supply industry along the pipeline route.
It is not expected that the major energy demands of industrial customers in
Bangkok and to the north will be satisfied from either of these two structures.
DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATING COSTS
3.06      The capital cost of the project is US$482 million for the "A"
Structure Phase and US$220 million for the "B" Structure Phase. The economic
analysis takes account also of the EGAT costs (US$15 million) for converting
its power plants. The taxes payable by PTT on imports and on construction of
the pipeline (US$73 million) have been excluded. Annual costs will be US$105-
135 million as the net of tax gas purchase costs and US$4 million in operating
costs, taking both phases together.
VALUE OF PRODUCTION
3.07      The value of the production is taken as the value of the fuel oil
which will no longer have to be imported into Thailand. No attempt has been
made to quantify the proportion of higher-value fuels which will also be
displaced. The current market for fuel oil is strongly influenced by the
aftermath of the Iranian crisis and the political restraints placed on oil
production. The November 1978 delivered cost was $85 per tonne, equivalent
to $2.10 per thousand cubic feet of 1,000 Btu/cuft gas. By June 1979 the
delivered cost was $110 per tonne ($15.40 per barrel in Singapore, equivalent
to $2.75 per MCF delivered). The annual cost of fuel oil which would have to
be imported in the absence of this project is as follows, based on production
of 250 MMSCFD each by Union Oil and Texas Pacific.



- 30 -
Annual Import Savings
(US$ Millions)
Value of Gas per MCF                      $2.75
Union Production                           263
Texas Pacific production                   208
471
Singapore fuel oil prices are below the latest OPEC levels and further
increases in Singapore can be expected. No reduction is envisaged from the
June 1979 price and accordingly $2.75/MCF is an appropriate base price for
the economic evaluation.
PROJECT PROFITABILITY
(a) Economic Rate of Return
3.08      The economic value of the project is dependent on three major
variables, the value of the gas, the existence of a contract with Texas
Pacific, and the price payable to them. The rates of return at constant
prices are summarized below and show a minimum and maximum position for the
Texas Pacific price. The rate of return for the project with Union gas only
is shown in order to indicate the strength of the intermediate position. It
will be noticed that the rate of return is not unduly sensitive to the Texas
Pacific supplies or their cost in view of their size, their relatively late
onstream date, their slow build-up and a high rate of discount which gives
little weight to later years. The rates of return have been strongly
influenced by the recent rise in the import parity of fuel oil which has
increased the value of the gas and increased the tax payments in respect of
condensate income, whilst at the same time the purchase price of the gas has
been shielded by the price escalation clause.
Rate of Return
Value of Gas per MCF                            $2.75
Union plus Texas Pacific with
(a)  TP at Union price                            49%
(b)  TP at $1.75 per MCF                          48%
Union alone                                       53%
Marginal return from Texas Pacific                40%
The 48% overall return indicated for Texas Pacific gas costing $1.75 per MCF
and gas valued at the June 1979 price of $2.75 per MCF is considered to be
a 'worst case' position.



- 31 -
(b) Pay-Back Period
3.09      On a discounted basis at 10% the pay-back period after start-up
is 3 years which is good for a pipeline project, and the project pays for
itself 4 times during its lifetime. On an undiscounted basis the pay-back
period is 2 years.
(c) Net Present Value
3.10      The sensitivity of the project to the value of the gas is confirmed
by the net present value calculations (discount rate 10% in real terms for the
20 year life of the project). The economic advantage of contracting the Texas
Pacific gas becomes more evident from this presentation.
Net Present value at 10% (1978 base)
(US$ Millions)
Gas value                                   $2.75/MCF
Union plus Texas Pacific with
(a)  TP at Union price                         1,900
(b)  TP at $1.75/MCF                           1,800
Union alone                                    1,250
(d) Unit Cost Comparison
3.11      The capital and operating costs of the natural gas pipeline, using a
10% discount rate, approximate 43c per MCF in 1978 prices. The cost per MCF
for Union alone and the extra cost for delivering Texas Pacific gas are both
close to this figure. Using this transportation cost the purchase price of
the gas can be compared directly with the fuel oil equivalent. In relation
to the Union gas, a transportation cost of $0.43 added to a gas purchase
cost of $1.18 gives a cost of $1.61 at the offtake from PTT's pipeline,
which is about 2/3 of the fuel oil equivalent. The benefit from the Texas
Pacific gas will depend on the final agreement on prices but will give a
margin of 20 to 30%.
BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY
3.12      The natural gas project will benefit the economy in a number of
ways. The return on the investment at over 40% has already been noted. The
major benefit will be to the foreign exchange position. There will also be
advantages in security, in technology, in employment and in the environment,
as discussed below. Based on 1978 prices, the project will produce a net
foreign exchange gain of about $150 million a year. Of this, $95 million
is expected from the Union part of the project and about $55 million from
the Texas Pacific portion. These figures take account of the cost of gas,
tax payments, PTT's costs and the import savings. On mid-1979 oil price
levels the net savings would be $300 million ($200 million Union, $100 million



- 32 -
TP). The borrowing program associated with the project will ensure that the
national foreign exchange benefits each year and that all foreign exchange
requirements are met from overseas sources.
3.13      In addition to the substantial foreign exchange advantages Thailand
will gain substantially from the security of indigenous energy supplies. In
the first place, a major domestic source of energy will protect the economy
from shortages such as those experienced by Thailand in 1979, and will ensure
a reliable fuel supply for the nation's power plants.  Secondly, the country
will benefit from the price stability built into the contracts. The price
escalation in the Union contract is based only 40% on fuel oil and 60% is
related to other indices. In view of the damage which oil price increases
can cause to the economy the protection given by these clauses is substantial.
3.14      As a result of the Project, PTT is expected to generate profits
of $150 to $200 million per year in the late 1980's, which should rise further
by the end of the century. It is unlikely that PTT will require a significant
part of these funds and consequently the Government will be in receipt of
substantial income from this source. At the same time, the Government will be
receiving $200 million a year or more in income taxes and royalties from Union
and Texas Pacific.
3.15      The engineering consultancy services include a major training
program for PTT's staff, and will result in a substantial transfer of
technology to Thai nationals. The natural gas system will be operated by
Thai workpeople who had no previous knowledge of a natural gas undertaking.
A total staff complement of 270 is planned. In addition, the onshore pipe-
laying and pipewrap will provide temporary employment for local labor.
3.16      The natural gas is free of sulfur and consequently will have a
favorable impact on the atmospheric pollution in South Bangkok and in main-
taining the clean air around Bang Pakong. The lack of sulfur will reduce
EGAT's operating costs although no attempt has been made to quantify these.
IV. THE BENEFICIARY
ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES
4.01      The Bank loan will be made to PTT with the usual Government guar-
antee. PTT was established by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand Act dated
December 20, 1978 and published in the Government Gazette on December 28, 1978
when it became law. PTT has the legal status of a juristic person. Its
objective is to engage in and promote petroleum business, including all
matters concerned with or related to petroleum business. Petroleum business
is defined to encompass all activities related to the petroleum and the
petrochemical industries. The Minister of Defense and the Minister of Industry
are jointly in charge of the PTT Act for a period of two years after the date
of effectiveness (December 28, 1978). After the two year period, the Minister
of Industry assumes sole responsibility.



- 33 -
4.02      PTT's Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers.
The Board comprises a chairman and a maximum of ten directors: one each
appointed from the Ministries of Defense, Finance, Commerce, Industry, and
the Juridical Council and a maximum of five others. The Governor of PTT, who
is its chief executive officer, is the Secretary of the Board. The Board is
presently chaired by the Prime Minister, and the directors appointed so far
are the Ministers of Commerce, Communications and Industry, the Deputy Minister
of Industry and the Secretary General of the National Security Council. In
addition to the Governor there are three Deputy Governors responsible for
administration, operations, and technology and planning respectively.
4.03      On July 15, 1979 PTT took over NGOT including its staff of approx-
imately 100 employees. NGOT had been formed in 1977 to assume primary res-
ponsibility for the transmission and distribution of Thailand's natural gas
discoveries. The natural gas operations formerly assigned to NGOT will be
carried out by the Office of Natural Gas which will be an operationally
independent unit, with its own separate accounts, within PTT. The Office will
be headed by a director whose appointment will be made in consultation with
the Bank and who will report directly to the Governor of PTT. During the
construction of the pipeline system, the former NGOT project implementation
group will report to the Deputy Governor for operations. However, during 1980
it will become necessary for PTT to prepare for the operational role of the
Office of Natural Gas. Operating and maintenance personnel will have to be
recruited and training programs instituted. During negotiations PTT will be
requested to furnish a staffing plan of the Office of Natural Gas by June 30,
1980 for the Bank's review and comment.
4.04      During September PTT took over the Oil Fuel Organization and its
2,000 employees, and before the end of 1980, it will take over the Ministry of
Defense Energy Department. The latter includes the Fang oil field and refinery,
employing approximately 500 people. In addition, PTT will manage the Govern-
ment's participation in the refineries. Plans for expanding the TORC refinery
are expected to be finalized before end 1979, and the Government expects to
have a substantial interest in the expanded unit. The Esso and Summit refinery
expansions will follow later, but the timing and Government (PTT) participation
is not yet known. Esso has full ownership of the present refinery and the
Summit refinery is leased (expiring in 1989) from the Government.
4.05       As indicated above, PTT's role in the petroleum sector will undergo
a dramatic transition in scope and diversity over the next few years, and its
management problems can be expected to increase accordingly. PTT is fully
aware of this and has agreed to institute, with the assistance of consultants
as needed, appropriate management procedures and a management information
system.
ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND INSURANCE
4.06      On the advice of the International Executive Services Corps advisers,
The Office of Natural Gas's financial accounts are modelled on U.S. gas
utility principles. Accounts have been satisfactorily prepared for the first



- 34 -
two fiscal years. Separate accounts will be prepared for each of PTT's major
activities. No difficulty is envisaged in maintaining these standards. In
accordance with the standard practice in Thailand for state enterprises, the
audit will be performed by the National Audit Office. In view of the National
Audit Office's lack of previous audit experience in the gas sector, it is
recommended that one of the major international accounting firms be retained
as financial consultants to cooperate with the Audit Office and issue a
separate report on the annual accounts. Agreement will be sought during
negotiations for the audited accounts of both PTT and the Office of Natural
Gas to be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of each
financial year, and for the consultancy arrangement outlined.
4.07      PTT will carry adequate third party insurance in line with industry
practices, and will ensure that builder's risk insurance is in effect for each
contract. Fluor will advise on what other insurances should be taken out.
PTT's insurance plans will be discussed with PTT during negotiations.
V. FINANCES
OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION
5.01      PTT is a new entity with no trading experience.  Its financial
structure, policies, contracts, etc. are still being determined. Given
satisfactory resolution of these, PTT can become a sound and financially
viable organization. The principal financial requirements are:
(i) a sound project financing plan as outlined in Chapter II;
(ii)  an adequate margin between the purchase price of Texas
Pacific gas and the onward selling prices to EGAT;
(iii) a contract with EGAT for the sale of natural gas which
passes on the take-or-pay obligations and price adjust-
ments automatically; and
(iv)  adoption of sound corporate and financial policies and
appropriate investment criteria.
5.02      The most significant features of the gas purchase contract with
Union and that under negotiation with Texas Pacific are (1) that the gas
is bought on a take-or-pay basis, i.e., PTT has to pay for the gas whether
taken or not, (2) there is an automatic cost escalation clause under which
the price payable by PTT increases each year in relation to certain published
indices and (3) their price level as compared with international prices. In
view of the major influence of EGAT on the quantity contracted it is essential
that these factors (take-or-pay, automatic price adjustment and an appropriate
price level) feature in the contract between PTT and EGAT. It has already
been agreed that EGAT will take the gas on a take-or-pay basis from the first
contract date in the Union contract, although load factors and other details



- 35 -
have yet to be settled. A price of US$1.90 per MCF in 1978 price terms (90%
of the then international fuel oil price) has also been agreed, and should be
satisfactory for PTT's purposes providing there is no major cost overrun and
providing the Texas Pacific price is close to that agreed with Union.   It is
also beneficial to EGAT. The price payable by EGAT may need to be reconsidered
when agreement is reached with Texas Pacific. The remaining issue, price
adjustment, has not been agreed between PTT and EGAT. During negotiations the
Government would be asked to agree that the price to be paid by EGAT to PTT
for gas supplies would not be less than 90% of the international fuel oil
price. A mechanism would be discussed at negotiations for the implementation
of the pricing arrangements. EGAT itself should be in a satisfactory financial
position provided that it meets the financial covenants agreed earlier this
year for the Bang Pakong project (Loan No. 1690-TH). A satisfactory agreement
with EGAT covering these points will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.03      Achievement of a suitable gas supply contract with EGAT and the cash
flow management (as described subsequently) will ensure that the Office of
Natural Gas will be in a sound financial position within a few years. While
the natural gas operations are expected to have the dominant effect on PTT's
overall profits, the Oil and Fuel Organization and the prospective refinery
interests will both have a noticeable impact on turnover, cash flow and the
asset base. In view of the present position in relation to the transfer from
the Ministry of Defense and the fluid position in relation to refinery expan-
sions, it is impractical to incorporate them into any meaningful financial
forecast or conventional financial covenant. Instead, PTT will be requested
to adopt a statement of corporate and financial objectives covering the
commercial nature of the enterprise, the need for a positive real rate of
return overall, the need for adequate debt service coverage, the adoption of
separate pricing, financial and economic policies for each of its operating
arms and the preparation of corporate plans. The Bank would review these
aspects annually with PTT. At negotiations the Government will be asked to
furnish its views from time to time to the Bank regarding PTT's corporate
plans, objectives and forecasts.
REVENUE POSITION
5.04      The revenue account for the Office of Natural Gas is projected as
below, based on development of the "A" and "B" Structures. It is based on a
general annual inflation rate of 7%. The cost of gas assumes a 1978 Texas
Pacific price of US$1.50/MCF. It also takes specific account to date of the
various factors entering into the escalation for the Union Oil gas supply, and
assumes a regular price adjustment with EGAT. On a DCF basis, the rate of
return over the period to 2000 is 15% at constant prices.

Rate of return on revalued assets    -              13%           22%
The above figures are sensitive to the major assumptions on general inflation,
Texas Pacific price level, price adjustment etc. Alternative forecasts are
in the working papers. Whilst they show a wide range of results, the overall
position is satisfactory in all cases.
FINANCIAL POSITION
5.05      The projected balance sheets are based on the financing plan dis-
cussed above including the Government input of a further $77 million for the A
Structure and $28 million for the B Structure, for which assurance would be
sought during negotiations. The fixed assets have been revalued at 7% per
annum in the same way as allowed for the revenue expenses. Substantial cash
surpluses are expected after 1985, which after meeting the needs of the Office
of Natural Gas and PTT, would be available to the Government for development
projects. During negotiations PTT would be asked to agree that surplus funds
from gas operations would only be applied for other purposes after ensuring
that sufficient funds are available for meeting the Office's operational debt
service and investment requirements.

Quick ratio                                    -      9.5    22.7
The debt/equity position is expected to reach 60/40 by 1985 and to improve
each year thereafter. Nevertheless during negotiations, assurances would
be obtained from PTT that no long-term debt will be incurred in respect to the
Office of Natural Gas without prior agreement by the Bank, unless the Office's
internal cash generation for each future year would cover any future year's
maximum debt service on all debt at least 1.2 times from 1982-1985 and 1.5
times thereafter.
FUNDS FLOW
5.06      The funds flow projections, as with the revenue account and balance
sheet, reflect the debt-financing package outlined above. In the same way as
the other projections, it is particularly sensitive to the general level of
inflation and the pricing arrangements with Texas Pacific and EGAT. The
revolving credit is assumed to be replenished at the end of each fiscal
year. Lower inflation rates result in lower profits and lead to a requirement
for short-term funding.

Debt service coverage                  -          1.8           3.1
In view of the schedule expected for the first loan repayments (1983 for
the commercial loans, 1984 export credits, 1985 World Bank) the debt service
coverage is satisfactory for 1982 onwards. On the assumptions used, in no
year does debt service coverage fall below 1.5.
INTERMEDIATE POSITION WITH UNION ONLY
5.07      In view of the possibility of delay in signing with Texas Pacific,
detailed projections have been made for the Office of Natural Gas finances on
the basis of Union supplies alone. The situation shown in these projections
(Annex 4.04) is sound. Key figure for 1986, for comparison, are:
Union only          Union + Texas Pacific
Accumulated profit        $186 millions             $214 millions
Debt Equity               41/59                       43/57
Quick ratio               16.9                         9.5
Rate of return            18%                         17%
Operating ratio            0.70                        0.74
Debt service coverage    2.1                           2.1
The closeness of the two sets of figures is a direct result of the price used
for the Texas Pacific gas purchase and the margin between this and the selling
price to EGAT. Alternative assumptions on these could increase or reduce the
figures significantly.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations assurance was obtained from PTT that:
(a)  a gas utilization study, a refinery study and an energy
audit would be carried out in accordance with terms of
reference and a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank
(paras. 1.19 and 1.20);
(b)  a management information system relating to the petroleum
sector would be installed (para. 4.05);
(c)  a progress report would be forwarded to the Bank at
agreed intervals and a project control system would be
implemented (para. 2.16);
(d)  it would complete its proposals on its future organization
and staffing program for the Office of Natural Gas by
June 30, 1980 (para. 4.03);
(e)  audited accounts for both PTT and its Office of Natural Gas
would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end
of each financial year and suitable financial consultants
will be appointed (para. 4.06);
(f)  no long-term debt would be incurred by the Office of Natural
Gas without prior agreement by the Bank unless a debt service
coverage of 1.2 times would be achieved for 1982 through 1985
and 1.5 times thereafter (para. 5.05);
(g)  a satisfactory training program would be initiated by March 1,
1980 (para. 2.30);
(h)  surplus funds from gas operations would only be applied for
other purposes after ensuring sufficient funds for require-
ments of the Office of Natural Gas (para. 5.05);
(i)  consultants satisfactory to the Borrower and Bank would
be engaged in carrying out the Project (para. 2.08).
(j)  it would adopt a statement of corporate and financial
objectives (para 5.03); and
(k)  commercial loans totalling US$75 million would be arranged
by May 31, 1980 and a further US$80 million by May 31, 1981
(para. 2.24).



- 40 -
6.02      Assurance was obtained during negotiations that:
(a)  the Government would provide funds in the form of equity
to finance land purchases and taxes (para. 2.21);
(b)  the Government would from time to time give its views to
the Bank regarding PTT's corporate plans and objectives
(para. 5.03);
(c)  the Government would forward its proposal to the Bank for
review and comment before undertaking any institutional
reorganization affecting natural gas operations (para.
1.27); and
(d)  the Government would ensure collaboration between its
agencies in respect of formulating and implementing
national energy policies (para. 1.30).
6.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that:
(a)  the appropriate commitments for export credits have been
arranged (para. 2.24);
(b)  the EGAT contract has been duly executed by both PTT and
EGAT (para. 5.02); and
(c)  the Union Oil contract has come into effect without any
restrictions (para. 3.03).
6.04      With satisfactory resolution of the items outlined above, the
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$107.0 million
including retroactive financing of US$3.0 million engineering and consulting
services and refinancing of the US$4.9 million engineering loan (S-1OTH).

THAILAND
NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Gas Supply and Demand Forecasts
The proven gas reserves would support 250 MMSCFD from both the Union
and Texas Pacific structures, equivalent together to 470 MMSCFD at 1,000
Btu/cuft. This gas would supply a proportion of the EGAT demand and meet the
industrial demand along the pipeline route. Over 100 MMSCFD of EGAT demand
will be met by fuel oil.
The Texas Pacific structure should be capable of supporting an
increased output and the Union structures nearer to the shore look
promising. At this stage only rough forecasts can be made of the likely
production from an enlarged Texas Pacific structure and from new structures.
The 166 MMSCFD shown below is a conservative estimate.
Additional energy demands exist around Bangkok and at Saraburi
100 km. to the north-east of Bangkok. Satisfaction of these demands is
dependent on both the discovery of additional reserves and resolution of
the fuel oil problem. Their potential gas demand is shown below as
additional industrial demand.
Possible gas supply and demand is as below. The quantities
have been standardized at a calorific value of 1000 Btu/cuft.

The above do not take account of the non-energy uses of natural
gas. Studies have already been undertaken on the possibility of petro-
chemicals, ammonia and sponge iron reduction, together totalling 128 MMSCFD.
These together with the LPG extraction, do not affect the fuel oil issue.
The necessary study of the alternative uses of gas is to be financed as part
of the project.

Annex 3.01
THAILAND
NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Union Oil Contract and the Tax Letter
1.        Union and PTT signed a side letter relating to taxation of even
date (28 September 1978) with the gas purchase contract. The aim of this
letter was to ensure that Union's tax payments in Thailand are allowed as
credits against United States taxes.
2.        The letter provided that Union would seek a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States on the compatibility of Thai taxes and US
taxes. The gas purchase contract would be activated on receipt of a favorable
ruling and, by an amendment dated 4 May 1979, the first contract date would be
28 months after receipt of a favorable ruling and the completion by Thailand
of any necessary action (e.g., a favorable ruling on 1st October 1979 and
passing of legislation in Thailand on 1st December 1979 would lead to a
contract commencement date of 1st April 1982, six months after the date of 1st
October 1981 which would apply in the absence of the tax letter). Receipt or
expectation of an unfavorable ruling led to cancellation of the obligations
on both Union and PTT including possible cancellation of the gas supply
contract.
3.        The September 1978 letter was cancelled and superseded by a letter
dated July 20, 1979 which provided for the gas supply contract to be activated
once the Thai tax law was amended to make it compatible with US tax laws in a
form agreed between the Government and Union Oil. Union Oil would thereby
take the risk on whether Thai tax payments were creditable in the USA. At the
same time the letter sets the contract delivery date 24 months after the
changes to the Thai legislation become law. The proposed changes would have
the effect of bringing Thai law closer to that in a number of other countries
and would have no fiscal effect on Thailand.
4.        It is understood that the changes in the Thai law are likely to be
made in October 1979. PTT will then consider whether to shorten the period
for commencement of gas deliveries.
5.        Union Oil submitted the proposed changes to the US Internal Revenue
Service on September 11, 1978. It is not known when the ruling might be made,
however it is worth nothing that applications relating to other countries have
taken several years.

THAILAND
NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
General
1.   In common with other Thai state enterprises, the financial year
for PTT and the Office of Natural Gas runs from the previous
October through September.
2.   The accounts will follow the normal accounting principles of US gas
utilities.
3.   No assessment has been  made of likely transfers of surplus cash to
the Government.
Revenue Account
1.   Inflation for gas purchase costs to fiscal 1980 has been based
on contract terms for the Union gas. Gas costs are assumed to
inflate at 7% thereafter. Inflation on the sale price is
assumed to parallel that for the purchase price. Inflation of
operating costs has been estimated to be 7%.
2.   Production is based on the contract with Union and the draft
contract with Texas Pacific as discussed in paragraph 2.06 and
heat content has been taken at 1,048 Btu/cuft for Union gas and
830 Btu/cuft for Texas Pacific. No LPG extraction is allowed for.
3.   Operating costs are as estimated by Fluor.  They are on the basis
that Texas Pacific will provide compression as provided in the
draft contract.
4.   Depreciation has been based on a 20 year life.  Replacement cost
is based on 7% inflation.
5.   Interest has been based on 8% for IBRD loans, 8% for Export-Import
bank loans and 10-1/2% for commercial bank loans.
Flow of Funds
1.   Capital expenditure is based on Fluor's best estimate (50%
confidence level) of capital costs and possible price levels
for the major "A" Structure Phase contracts, plus physical
contingencies and general inflation (where appropriate)
estimated by Bank staff. "B" Structure Phase costs are
as estimated by Fluor.

ANNEX 5.01
Page 2 of 2
2.   Debt repayments are based on first repayment in 1983 for the
commercial loans, 1984 for the export credits and 1985 for
the Bank loan. Repayment periods assumed are 12 years for
the commercial loans, 12 years for export credits and 15 years
for the Bank loan. The revolving credit is assumed replenished
at 30th September each year.
3.   Working capital requirements are based on one month's sales
income and one week's cash needs less one month's cost of gas
and two month's capital payments.
