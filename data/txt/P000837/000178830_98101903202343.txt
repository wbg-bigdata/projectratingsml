FISHERIES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project comprises the construction of 40 purse seiners by the
Boatyards Division (BD) of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation - a state-
owned enterprise; technical assistance to BD; and studies of the harbor fa-
cilities needed for expansion of fisheries beyond the proposed project.
ii.       The borrower would be the Government of Ghana who would lend the
proceeds of the credit relating to construction of purse seiners to the Agri-
cultural Development Bank (ADB) at 00, interest. ADB would on-lend to
approved sub-borrowers at 9% interest.  Loans to sub-borrowers would be for
six years, including one year of grace. ADB would repay the Government as
repayments were receivable from sub-borrowers.
iii.      The proposed addition to the inshore fishing fleet would increase
fish supplies for domestic corsumption by an estimated 9,000 tons annually
with a landed value of US$1.3 million. The purse seiners would operate in
the Atlantic close to the Ghanaian coast. These vessels would fish mainly
sardinella, locally called "herring". The boats would be similar to those
at present in use in Ghana, though technically improved.
iv.       Ghana has become one of the largest producers and consumers of
marine fish in tropical West Africa; its production has increased three
times the 1961 level. The supply of animal protein to the population is
still too low and much of it is imported. Fish is a preferred source of
protein in the country. Consequently, the project would contribute to the
improvement of nutrition while saving foreign exchange.
v.        Assuming a ten-year operating life for the boats, the project
would yield a financial rate of return of about 30%.  The rate of return to
the economy would be considerably higher than this. The project cost would
be about US$2.3 million of which US$1.3 million would be in foreign exchange.
The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$1.3 million to finance such
foreign cost.

FISITFFIES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ghana has requested an IDA credit of US$1.3 mil-
lion for the construction of medium-5ized purse seine fishing vessels to
expand its inshore fishing fleet, and for harbor feasibility and cost studies.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$2.3 million of which US$1.3
million would be in foreign exchange.
1.02      The project was identified by a Bank identification mission in
October/November 1966 and prepared with the help of an FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program mission in June 1967. The Government's request for finance was re-
ceived in August 1968 and this report is based on the findings of an IDA
appraisal mission in September/October 1968 to Ghana, composed of Messrs.
M.J. Walden and F.A. Brume (of IDA), C. Beever and 0. Gulbrandsen (of FAO).
II.   BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Ghana has an area of 92,100 square miles.  In 1968, the population
Was estimated at eight million and the per capita income at US$225. The
economy is based on agriculture, principally cocoa, and between 1962 and
1967, cocoa annually averaged 64% of exports.
2.02      Although the Government has designated agriculture as the top
priority sector in its development efforts, progress is not encouragqing at
present. The Government's development plan, mid-1968/mid-1970 anticipates
no significant increment in farm output per unit of labor during that period.
The Government is not satisfied with the current performance and appreciates
the necessity for careful planning to improve it. Accordingly, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs has a resident Harvard University Advisory Group which
includes an agricultural officer. The planning group of the Ministry of
Agriculture is being strengthened by technical advisors from FAO and USAID.
Sector studies are being undertaken by a firm of consultants into agriculture,
water resources, transport and telecommunications. Those in agriculture and
water resources are designed to produce short and medium-term programs for
development and priority programs for immediate development.
2.03      The Bank undertook an agriculture sector review in depth in 1965
as part of a Bank economic mission. Resulting from this, a Bank identifi-
cation mission to Ghana in October/November 1966 identified a number of
agricultural projects. The project now proposed is the first for Bank/IDA
finance in the agriculture/fisheries sector; the Bank/IDA is, in addition,
currently assisting the Government in the preparation of an oil palm and a
cocoa project.



- 2 -
2.o4      Ghana has a low per capita consumption of animal protein, approxi-
mately 65% of that which nutritionists consider adequate 1/. Fish, both
imported and domestically produced, contributes 68% of animal protein supplies.
The Government seeks to increase the local production of animal protein and
to reduce imports which now account for 31% of total supplies. The further
development of fisheries would materially assist in achievement of these
objectives.
2.05      With its coast about 50 north of the Equator, Ghana is favorably
located in relation to Atlantic deep sea fishing grounds, particularly those
of Southwest Africa and the Canary Islands. Further, the coastal waters of
-<-^aare rich in fish, particularly sardinella, locally called "herring".
Mrost irportantly, Ghanaians are very enterprising fishermen.
Current Position of the Fishing Industry
2.6       Ghana has become one of the largest producers and consumers of marine
fish in tropical West Africa, and its 1967 production of 92,000 tons, three
times its 1961 production (Annex 1), is exceeded only by that of Senegal.
2.07      Consumption of fish has risen erratically from 78,000 tons in 1961
to 113,000 tons in 1967 2/; an overall annual growth rate of between 6% and
7%. The Government forecasts the long-run growth of demand to remain the
same. Demand could be considerably increased, however, by a wider distri-
bution of fish beyond the coastal areas to the north of the country (Annex
2). In the past, demand exceeding local production has been met by imports,
mainly from foreign fishing vessels landing their catch for direct sale on
the Ghanaian market. Such direct landings have accounted for 25-30% of total
consumption in the past, but decreased sharply to about 14% in 1967. Since
imports are subject to stringent controls they provide no reliable indication
of overall demand.
2.08      Domestic fishing operations involve a wide variety of fishing
vessels and fishing techniques and employ some 60,000 full-time and about
6,500 part-time fishermen. Operations are based on 195 village centers and
220 beaches in addition to the port of Tema. Map 1 shows the dispersal of
operations over the Ghanaian continental shelf 3/. The present composition

2/   These figures relate only to marine and not to freshwater fish;
statistics on the latter are unreliable. With the exception of Volta
Lake production, the quantities of freshwater fish are too small to be
material. All other references to fish production and consumption in
this report are similarly restricted to marine fish except where
specifically indicated otherwise.

of the fishing fleet is outlined in Annex 3. Major changes over the last
six years have been the introduction of large, long-distance trawlers, now
numbering 47, and an increasing number of smaller mechanized inshore purse
seiners, operating mostly from the fishing port of Tema. The traditional
fleet of about 10,000 dug-out canoes is still a major source of fish supplies
but, whereas in 1961 it provided almost all domestic production, in 1967 it
accounted for only 43%.
Deep Sea Fishery
2.09      Encouraged by its strategic location to the deep sea fishing
grounds off West Africa, which were being exploited internationally, Ghana
decided in 1961 to give priority to the development of a deep sea fishing
fleet. As a result of this the present fleet comprises 47 vessels between
75-300 ft. However, the expansion has been too rapid and the fleet has not
been efficiently operated. Therefore, current government policy is to hold
back on further expansion of the deep sea fleet while raising the produc-
tivity of the existing fleet. Further details of deep sea fishing vessels
are given in Annex 4.
Inshore Fishery
2.10      Some 10,000 dug-out canoes and over 200 mechanized vessels of 27
to 45 ft fish in inshore waters overlying the Ghanaian continental shelf.
Additionally, some 1,800 beach seines, and many cast nets and traps are
operated directly from the beach. The inshore catch accounted for over 66Z
of Ghana's domestic production in 1967. The canoe fleet, while not expanding,
is still ixportant, especially during good sardinella seasons. Its pro-
duction has remained relatively stable for some years and its contribution
to inshore fish production is declining in relation to that of the growing
fleet of mechanized, plank-built inshore vessels. The latter fleet has
been built up since 1953, and is comprised largely of vessels of 27-30 ft
in size. These vessels, while representing an important first stage in the
modernization of the Ghanaian fleet, have only a slightly better fishing
range than the canoes. Accordingly, over the past 5 years there has been
a growing preference for 40 and 45 ft vessels of which about 80 are now in
operation. These larger boats have a higher profitability due to their
longer range, greater capacity, and their capacity to use large modern purse
seines of much greater catching power than the nets used by the smaller
boats. Ghanaian inshore fishermen are highly skilled and have acquired
considerable proficiency in the use of this modern equipment.
2.12      The greater part of the income of the inshore fishing fleet
derives from the sardinella season, July to October. During this period
upwellings of colder water occur which attract the sardinella to the surface
where they can be caught with the gear of small vessels.



-4-
Freshwater Fisheries
2.12      Fishing is carried on in numerous rivers, dams and small ponds.
By far the largest freshwater resource is the 3,000 sq miles of artificial
lake created by construction of the Volta Dam 1/. A rapid and considerable
migration of fishermen to the lake is taking place and approximately 3,000
canoes are now operating there. The canoes are planked boats of 20/30 ft
in length which operate gill nets in the shallow fringe waters of the lake.
Bottom fishing is precluded by submerged vegetation, and so far there has
been no commercial exploitation of the much deeper water in the center of
the lake. Fish caught find a ready market in villages near the lake, and
it is estimated that 10,000 - 12,000 tons are caught annually by these simple
traditional methods. Since the lake is an entirely new body of water it is
not yet possible to determine its fisheries potential, but this is being
investigated in the Lake Volta Project (para. 2.14(b)).
Tuna Transshipment
2.13      Ghana has a well-established transshipment trade in tuna which
is landed by foreign vessels fishing off the West African coast, and sub-
sequently shipped abroad. In 1967 such transshipments amounted to nearly
8,000 tons. During the early part of 1968 this trade was running at double
the 1967 level. Hitherto, Ghana has not participated directly in tuna
fishing. However, one of the private local companies is contemplating
direct participation (para. 2.28).
Fisheries Research and Training
2.14      Three Government research programs related to fisheries have been
established, with the assistance of FAO/UNDP(SF):
(a) The Fishery Research Unit, concerned with marine stocks.
(b)  The Lake Volta Fisheries Project, concerned with the
fishery development of the Volta Lake.
(c)  The Food Research Center which is attaching high priority
to the development of the fish-based food industry.
2.15      Two simple training course, for inshore boat coxswains and
engineers respectively, are provided by the Fisheries Department at Takoradi.
These provide training in elementary navigation and pilotage, and in the
operation, maintenance and repair of small marine diesel engines. Forty-
eight engineers and 107 coxswains were trained during 1967. At present,
there is no institution in Ghana providing training for the deep sea fleet.
Until now such training has been provided abroad, and so far 153 fishermen
1/   IBRD Loan No. 310 GH



have been, or are being trained, in IVorway, the United Kingdom and the
U.S.S.R., in fish processing, engineering, navigation and radio. Under a
recent bilateral assistance agreement, Norway will help to establish special
courses at the Nautical College near Accra. These courses are expected to
start in 1969.
Fisheries Administration
2.16      Primary responsibility for fisheries is vested in the Fisheries
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Many matters directly affecting
fisheries, however, fall within the responsibility of other ministries:
foreign assistance in the fisheries sector is under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs; port and shore facilities for fishing vessels at Tema and Takoradi
come under the Ministry of Communications; the construction and sale of
fishing boats is under the Ministry of Industries; and the provision of
credit finance in the fishing industry is under the Ministry of Finance.
Fortunately, development of the inshore fishery does not appear to have
suffered as a result of this diversified responsibility.
Fishing Boat Construction in Ghana
2.17      The traditional Ghanaian fishing craft is a dug-out canoe, 25 to
40 ft long with a beam of about 4 ft. The canoe is built in the forested
hinterland and brought to the coast. In 1952, as a part of Government's
efforts to develop and modernize the fisheries industry, a Government-owned
boatyard was established in Sekondi for the construction of plank-built 27
ft length fishing boats powered with inboard diesel engines. In 1962, a
second Government boatyard was established in Tema to construct boats of 40
ft length and upwards. Both yards now construct 40 and 45 ft vessels,
although some 30 ft boats are still being constructed at Sekondi (Annex 6).
2.18      The 45 ft boat appears to be very suitable for Ghanaian inshore
fishing operations. However, the current design of this boat has several
construction disadvantages. It is complicated, time consuming and requires
the use of expensive copper nails and brass screws. Moreover, the local
hardwoods, required because of their resistance to marine borers, often
split when bent into the curves needed in the round-bottom hulls. Conse-
quently, the introduction of e. hard chine hull design 1/, requiring less
costly materials, less craftsmanship and less construction time, is desir-
able and is proposed for project vessels. The boatyards have wanted to
modernize their designs in this way for some time but have lacked the neces-
sary expertise.
1/   Descriptions of, and differences between, the round and hard chine
construction (which involve, respectively, "U"-shaped and "V'-shaped
hulls) are given in Annex 8 and in Drawing 2.



6
2.19      Until July, 1968 the boatyards were run as a statutory corporation,
the State Boatyards Corporation, and enjoyed considerable autonomy. The
State Boatyards Corporation subsequently became a division, the Boatyards
Division (BD) of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation (GIHOC). GIHOC
was formed to amalgamate State-owned manufacturing enterprises for reasons
set out in para. 4.07 and Annex 6. BD is currently the largest producer of
plank-built vessels in tropical Africa.
2.20      BD has been operating effectively and since 1965 has made net
profits on its operations despite a number of difficulties, including a
shortage of foreign exchange for import of parts, which has caused periodic
underutilization of capacity. Despite the resulting relative inefficiency,
boat costs compare favorably with those of foreign boats that could be
imported. This is largely because:
(a) timber is relatively cheap;
(b) high quality labor is cheap;
(c) apart from a nearby African country which does not have the
advantages of (a) and (b) above, foreign builders would
have to meet the high costs of freighting vessels from
Europe or Asia.
Foreign competition and prices are discussed and quantified in Annex 6. It
is unlikely that foreign yards could deliver boats to Ghanaian fishermen at
lower prices than BD.
2.21      Over the last two years, BD management has acted effectively in
overcoming its problems and delivering as many boats as possible to fishermen
at reasonable cost. There have, however, been some minor deficiencies in
BD administration, notably in the financial and cost accounting systems; but
these have not been serious and their improvement would not be difficult.
Fisheries Credit
2.22      Credit to fishermen in Ghana provides for the purchase and equipment
of fishing craft. The credit institutions involved are the Fisheries Division
of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural Development Bank and, to a
lesser extent, the National Investment Bank. Non-institutional credit is
also uvailable, although at a high cost; the principal source being the
"rmammies" who dominate the marketing and distribution of fish (para. 2.24).
2.23      In the past, the Fisheries Division played the paramount role in
fisheries credit. Currently, the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) is the
most important fisheries credit institution for the inshore fleet (Annex 7).
Since mid-1967, the Government has allocated funds to ADB for lending to
purchasers of boats from BD. Because ADB lacks experience in this type of
lending activity, and has little knowledge of the fishermer, it relies on
BD for the screening and selection of credit applicants, and for the collec-
tion of repayments.  For these services, BD receives a margin of 1½fi7 p.a. of
the unamortized credit.



-7-
Fish Marketing in Ghana
2.24      In common with many other commodities, fish is marketed and traded
by women dealers known as mamnmies. Modernization of the fishing fleet and
of port facilities has not materially changed this system, which appears to
be very efficient in the context of the Ghanaian economy. Marmies are highly
specialized, buying directly from fishermen, and operating as wholesalers,
distributors, and retailers. In many cases they contribute substantiallv to
the financing of fishing vessels and their operations.
2.25      Over half of total supplies are landed at Tema, and the Tema/
Accra area alone absorbs two-thirds of this quantity.  Even in this
relatively well developed area fish is sold directly to mammies at quayside,
or, in the case of frozen fish, ex-cold store. Along the rest of the coast
mammies provide the only means of dealing quickly with small individual
landings by large numbers of boats at many scattered landing points.
While scme fresh fish is sold locally in areas near landing points, 'the
bulk is smoke-cured by mammies for subsequent sale in retail markets.
This applies also to frozen fish, either ex-cold store, or landed by
Ghanaian and foreign long-distance trawlers. Virtually no fish is retailed
in frozen form.
2.26      Seasonality in supplies is reflected in wide price fluctuations.
Prices usually vary between N¢100 and N¢300 per ton. Frozen fish from the
deep sea fleet may be stored to await more favorable prices but this
practice has not been followed to any great extent in the case of catches
from the inshore fleet. About 12,000 tons of cold storage space is avail-
able in Tema/Accra and there are 13 small ten-ton depots in inland centers.
Additional facilities are being planned. These, together with improved
communications, should facilitate the extension of fish distribution and
should enable a more strategic use of cold storage. Further details of
fish marketing are given in Annex 2.
Fisheries Exparnsion
2.27      The first priority in the expansion of Ghana's fisheries is the
modernization of the inshore fishing fleet. This can best be achieved by
strengthening RD to enable it to produce modern, technically improved
vessels, and by providing institutionalized credit for their purchase.
However, the present capacity of the available ports is sufficient, even
when efficiently used, for only about forty additional vessels of approxi-
mately 45 ft; priority rust therefore be given to engineering, cost and
feasibility studies for the expansion of fishing ports. These aspects are
included in a first stage project proposed to the Bank for financing.
2.28      A second stage of expansion would include implementation of
these port studies and further expansion of the inshore fleet. At the
same time, however, the technical and managerial efficiency of the deep
sea fleet should be improved when allocation of Government-owned vessels is
determined (Annex 3.). INew ventures in this second stage may include:



- 8 -
(i)  Direct participation by Ghana in tuna fishing.  Recently
tuna catches in the South Atlantic have increased sharply.
The Ghanaian fleet has not to date entered the tuna
fishery, but one of the private companies has concluded an
agreement for technical cooperation with a foreign company
relating to tuna fishing. It is possible that the deep
sea tuna fishery might offer opportunities for profitable
investment by Ghana in the near future.
(ii)  Development of a shrimp fishery.  There are sporadic reports
of good shrimp catches close to the Ghanaian coast. An
investigation of West African shrimp resources is to be
undertaken shortly by the African Development Bank and FAO.
The results of this survey may indicate further project
possibilities for Ghana as a transshipment base, or for
direct participation by the Ghanaian fishing industry.
(iii) Further development of the Volta Lake arising from the
research project referred to in para. 2.14(b).
III.   THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project is the construction, equipment and operation of
forty 48 ft purse seine fishing vessels for inshore fishing off Ghana;
technical assistance to the Boatyards Division (BD) of the Ghana Industrial
Holding Corporation (GIHOC) who would construct the vessels; and harbor
studies preparatory to a second stage project for further expansion of
Ghana's fishing industry. Vessel construction and studies are expected to
take place over two years.
3.02      The proceeds of the IDA credit relating to the construction of
purse seiners would be lent by the Government to the Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank (ADB). ADB would on-lend these proceeds to individuals and
companies, who would have been evaluated on their technical and financial
suitability.
Purse Seine Fishing Vessels
3.03      The proposed purse seiners would be of approximately 48 ft overall
length and 20 tons hold capacity carrying a crew of 15 to 25. They would
be of hard chine construction and of standardized design with insulated
holds. Engines would be between 75 and 80 hr. Deck machineries would be
minimal as the purse seine net of about 1,800 ft length and 200 ft depth
would be hand-hauled. A small dinghy would be carried.



-9-
Assistance to Boatyards Division
3.04      As indicated in para 2.18 the round form of construction at present
used by BD is deficient in some respects and a new, simpler and somewhat
cheaper design would be introduced. Outline details of such a new design
are given in Annex 8 and Drawing 1. A discussion of its advantages is given
in Annex 6, and Drawing 2. A naval architect has recently been engaged as
an addition to the UNDP/SF project referred to in para. 2.14(a) and assigned
to BD in order to finalize the new design in a form suitable for use by BD,
and to initially supervise the construction and testing of new vessels. His
services would be required for a period of 12 man-months over a total period
of two years. The first six months would be spent in residence and the
latter six months on a non-resident basis.
3.05      Production inefficiencies which principally derive from a shortage
of foreign exchange leading to delays in parts procurement would be elimated
by the proposed project. However, in order to take full advantage of the
favorable opportunity of improving the overall production efficiency of BD
a production manager, experienced in the production of boats of the project
type and size, has been engaged in the same manner as the naval architect
referred to in para. 3.04. He would plan and supervise the production of
the new hard chine design and would be required for a period of two to three
years.
3.06      The engagements of the 'naval architect and the production manager
under the UNDP/SF project are for periods of six months and two years re-
spectively. The proposed IDA project would provide for any necessary ex-
tensions of these services in the event these could not be accommodated under
the UNDP/SF project. In addition, the IDA project would provide for the
purchase of hand tools and minor equipment needed by BD and spare parts for
the maintenance and repair of project vessels. With these, the maintenance
and repair facilities of BD would be sufficient for the servicing of project
vessels in addition to the existing fleet.
Reorganization of Tema Fishing Harbor
3.07      All vessels to be financed under the present project would be
expected to operate from Temna Fishing Harbor. Under present operating
conditions, this is somewhat congested and to accommodate the project
vessels, a reorganization would be necessary. The government has agreed on
this reorganization which involves negligible cost and consists of:
(a) Providing moorings within the fishing harbor, clear of
the quay.
(b) Ensuring that vessels are only alongside the quay for
purposes of landing fish and taking on supplies and move
to moorings if an extended period in harbor is required.



- 10 -
(c) Ensuring that fish trading takes place in the market
adjoining the quay and not on the quay.
Preparations for Second Stage Project
3.08      The number of project vessels has been restricted to 40 because
the reorganized facilities at Tema would be unable to accommodate more
additions to the existing fishing fleet. Consequently, a possible second
stage project for expanding the fisheries industry in Ghana would include
the expansion and development of fisheries harbors. To this end, the
present project includes preparation for a second stage project. This
would comprise engineering studies of harbors and a determination of the
type and number of additional fishing vessels required.
3.09      Tentative proposals have been considered for the expansion of
landing facilities of Tema (M4ap 2) and the development of another fishing
port towards the west of Ghana. Some of t..he future development of fisheries
ought to take place in the Western or Central Regions (Map 1) because of the
present relatively low per capita consumption of fish in these areas (Annex
1). The fishing ports of Elmina and Mumford in the Central Region have been
identified as offering possibilities of expansion.
3.10      The harbor engineering studies would comprise:
(a) detailed engineering studies at the fishing port
of Tema;
(b) comparative preliminary engineering studies at the
fishing ports of Elmina and Mumford;
(c) detailed engineering studies at either the fishing
port of Elmina or the fishing port of Mumford.
Consultants satisfactory to IDA would be employed for the harbor studies on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA and their terms of reference would
be approved by IDA. At the conclusion of the studies in (b) above, the
Government and IDA would exchange views and agree upon which port to carry
out the studies in (c) above.
Project Costs
3.11      Total project costs are estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent,
including working capital for three months' operation of the vessels. The
following table summarizes total project costs; Annex 9 shows the cost
estimates of one purse seiner.

3.12      Purse seiner construction cost estimates are based on the ex-yard
prices of vessels of similar size currently built by PD. Labor costs and
overheads should be lower for project vessels because of the improved
design and a higher and more even production flow.  Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the price to project vessels purchasers would not
exceed Nh44I,000 except as agrreed with IDA.



- 12 -
3.13      Vessel construction costs would account for about 75% of total
project costs. Foreign exchange requirements, representing engines, nets,
and other equipment, would amount to 52% of vessel construction costs.
3.14      Working capital of USt;87,800 has been included in the project
cost. This amounts to US$2,200 per vessel, required for three-months
operation based on experience with 40 ft and 45 ft vessels.

3.16      IDA would finance all foreign exchange items with the exception
of a small element included in working capital.
3.17      The Government of Ghana would be the borrower.  Proceeds of the
credit relating to the construction of purse seiners would be on-lent to
selected sub-borrowers through ADB. GIHOC and the RFailway and Ports
Administration would administer the assistance to BD and harbor studies
respectively.
3.18      Of purse seiner construction costs, 52% would be financed by IDA,
28% by the Government through ADB and the remaining 20% by sub-borrowers.
The latter would also provide their own working capital. This financial
contribution by sub-borrowers is reasonable.
Terms and Conditions of Sub-loans
3.19      The terms of sub-loans would. be different from those presently
extended to vessel purchasers (Annex 7). Sub-borrowers would make a cash
deposit of their 20% on ordering vessels and would repay ADB at interest of



- 13 -
9Z over six years, including a grace period of up to one year covering
vessel construction and initial operations. This period of sub-loan repay-
ment would allow a reasonable debt-service coverage (para. 4.02) and would
be well within the expected vessel life of 10 years. ADB would repay the
Government the capital element of sub-borrowers' repayments approximately
as these were receivable together with interest at 6½%. ADB would bear the
credit risk out of its margin of 1%, and a margin of 1½% would go to BD for
the provision of its technical services (para. 2.23). The Government would
bear the foreign exchange risk on all repayments due to IDA.
3.20      Prior approval of IDA would be required for sub-loans to any one
sub-borrower totalling in excess of US$150,000.
3.21      The proceeds of the credit relating to assistance to BD would be
lent by the Government to BD at 6½$.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.22      Component parts of the vessels financed by IDA under the project
would be obtained through international competitive bidding. These include
engines, winches and nets. Tenders would be supervised by BD and most bid
documents and proposed awards would be submitted to IDA for approval. In
the case of items costing less than US$10,000, the documents would be for-
warded to IDA after award. Full details of procurement and other procedures
involving ADB and BD are set out in Annex 12. IDA would disburse against
shipping documents in respect of imported items; disbursements are expected
to continue over a period between two and three years.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Sub-Borrowers
4.0l      The ultimate borrowers of the credit proceeds would be private
Ghanaian individuals or companies, though the former are expected to pre-
dominate. The typical borrower would be an experienced and relatively
successful fisherman. Some sub-borrowers would be business or professional
people wishing to invest in fisheries and who would employ experienced
fishermen to operate their boat or boats. Sub-borrowers or their employees
would be familiar with the fishing grounds, fellow fishermen, and the
mammies that dominate the marketing of fish.
4.02      Annex 11 shows the estimated cash flow of a sub-borrower in respect
of one purse seiner. This shows that the cost of each vessel, including
working capital, of N¢46,000 would be met by N011,000 from the sub-borrower
and an ADB loan of N¢35,000. Debt service coverage would be 1.7 over most
of the years of loan repayment.



- 14 -
4.o3      The number of sub-borrowers is expected to range from 25 to 30.
Some individuals and companies may wish to apply for credit for two or more
purse seiners. Most of the sub-borrowers, however, would probably be
eligible for credit for only one purse seiner.
The Agricultural Development Bank
4.o4      The ADB, established in April 1965, took over the functions of the
former Rural Credit Department of the Bank of Ghana. It has a board of
seven directors and a staff of 77, and is increasing in size and area of
operations.
4.05      ADB's management is competent; its financial structure is sound
(Annex 7), and it appears capable of handling its expansion in agriculture
successfully. It has, as yet, little direct contact with the fishing
industry and no staff specializing in this field since lending for boats
from BD commenced only in mid-1967. An agreement was then signed under
which BD appraises potential purchasers and arranges for debt collection
on ADB's behalf. These arrangements work well and there have been no bad
debts to date. BD has the experience and knowledge of fishing industry
necessary to perform this function satisfactorily. ADB takes the credit
risk and can refuse to accept BD's recommendations on financial grounds.
The project sub-loans would be handled similarly; full details of procedures
involving ADB and BD are contained in Annex 12. Vessels are insured to their
full replacement value, and assurances were obtained during negotiations that
this practice would be continued for all project vessels, in addition to
appropriate insurance cover during construction. ADB's expansion plans in-
clude an office in the port of Tema, appropriately staffed to handle fisheries
loan appraisal and collection functions. This change in responsibility would
be subject to IDA's approval insofar as it affected the proposed project.
4.o6      The auditors of ADB are Amorin, Agyemran, Ayew and Co., chartered
accountants with offices in Accra. IDA would receive the audited accounts
in the form in which they are produced at present, together with statement
of accounts relating to the project certified by the auditors. These
arrangements are satisfactory for the purposes of the project.
Boatyards Division
4.07      Until mid-1968, BD existed as a statutory body - the State
Boatyards Corporation - with a managing director located at the Tema yard.
It operated with great autonomy under the State Enterprises Secretariat
which was responsible for coordinating the activities of the various State-
owned corporations. As a result of the unsatisfactory performance of many
of the State-owned corporations, the State Interprises Secretariat was
dissolved and a new organization, the GMina Industrial Holding Corporation
(GIHOC), was created to amalgamate 20 separate State manufacturing corpo-
rations and, subseguently, the State Boatyards CorDoration became the self-
accounting Boatyards Division of GIHOC, headed by its former managing
director as general manager.



- 15 -
4.08      The problems confronting lrTHOC with regard to most of its other
divisions are considerable. Whether it will be able to operate successfully
overall is difficult to judge at this stage. It is unlikely however that
BD will require or receive much assistance from GII{OC management except in
accounting and administration which GIHOC proposes to irprove. GIROC has
stated that its present intentions involve no major alterations within BD.
The present general manager of BD would be satisfactory to IDA. BD would
continue to operate substantially along the same lines as at present. It
has been strengthened by the addition of the production manager and the
services of the naval architect. Further details of BD are contained in
Annex 6.
4.09      The audit of GIHOC is performed by the State Enterprises Audit
Corporation, a body responsible through the Auditor General to the govern-
ment for the audit of various state-owned industrial and commercial enter-
prises. IDA would receive the audited accounts of GIHOC and BD in the form
in which they are produced at present, together with statements of accounts
relating to the project certified by the auditors. These arrangements are
satisfactory for the purposes of the project.
4.10      During negotiations, assurances were received from GIHOC that:
(a) any future alterations to BD's functions or structure would
be in agreement with IDA;
(b)  prior to any proposed appointment of a General Manager of
BD, GIHOC would consider the views of IDA;
(c) sufficient finance would be retained within BD for it to
maintain or expand its capacity as necessary for it to
properly carry out its functions of constructing and
servicing project vessels.
V.  OPERATING ARRANGEMNTS AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
5.01      Purse seiners financed under the project would fish in the coastal
waters overlying the continental shelf of Ghana. They would make short
voyages of one or two days each, normally leaving port one day and returning
the next, and would be expected to average about 75 trips a year. It is
assumed that the pattern of operations would be similar to that of the
present purse seiner fleet and that the greater proportion of the catches
would derive from purse seining for sardinella during the period July to
October.
5.02      The vessels would be based at Tema, but might, from time to time,
land catches at other centers along the coast according to convenience and
season. Catches would be landed in fresh form and sold in the traditional
way by direct negotiations with the mammies who would thereafter transport,
process and market the fish.






- 16 -
5.03      On the basis of the last three years' operating results of the
present fleet it is estimated that each vessel would catch 225 tons per
year. The average price realized at first-sale is expected to average
N¢150 (US$147) per ton. Accordingly, the gross annual income of each
purse seiner would be NJ¢34,000 (US*33,000). Operating costs have been
based on those of the 40 and 45 ft purse seiners operating at present.  They
include insurance of the vessels to their full replacement value. Estimates
of the income of a project purse seiner, and the assumptions on which they
are based are shown in Annex 10. The cash flow estimates for one purse
seiner are shown in Annex 11.
5.04      The financial return on the total investment in a project purse
seiner over a life of ten years would be 30%.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The construction and operation of 40 purse seiners would increase
the fish available for domestic consumption by about 9,000 tons per annum
at a landed value of US$1.3 million and a retail value of approximately
US$2.6 million. It would provide a valuable addition to animal protein
supplies, substituting for imports.
6.02      The project would offer improved employment opportunities to some
800 fishermen at present engaged in the less efficient canoe fishery.
6.03      The construction program, with the technical assistance in-
corporated in the project, would enable BD to operate in a balanced and
efficient manner for a period of approximately two years. This would ensure
full utilization of BD during this period; at its termination the benefits
of improved techniques would remain with BD.
6.o4      Assuming a ten-year operating life for the purse seiners, their
financial rate of return would be 30% (para. 5.04). The economic rate of
return would be materially higher and is estimated to be about 50%. This
is, however, very approximate as costs and benefits, other than those
pertaining directly to vessel operations, are incapable of accurate
quantification.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) project vessel price to purchasers would not exceed
W4144,000 except as agreed with IDA (para. 3.12);



- 17 -
(b) any change of responsibility for sub-borrowers' appraisal
and debt collection would be approved by IDA (para. 4.05).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$1.3 miillion.

ANIMAL PROTEIN SOURCES, FISH PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS
Animal protein supplies in Ghana are derived from milk, meat
poultry, game and fish.  The FAO/UNDP (SF) Food and Development Center La
Accra has prepared estimates, based on consumption over 1964 through 1966
which indicate that fish constitutes 68% of the animal protein intake. The
following illustrates how fish compares with other products as a source of
animal protein:
Individuals' Average Percentage Sources of Protein
1964 through 1966
Fish                                          67.7 1/
Meat                                          11.4
Game                                          11.4
Milk                                           8.2

FISHERIES PROJECT
FISH MARKETING AND PROCESSING
1.        Although there have been important changes in the pattern and
types of fish production and in the establishment of shore facilities in
some places, the traditional system of marketing has remained virtually
unchanged. Under this system fish is purchased, processed, stored, trans-
ported and sold at all levels from producer to consumer by women merchants,
known locally as "mammies".
2.        The mammies operate at every fish landing point along the 270
miles of Ghanaian coast, from the numerous small beach landings to the
modern fishing harbor of Tema. In most cases, they purchase fish by direct
negotiation with the fishing vessels, including both the inshore boats and
canoes landing fresh fish and the large deep sea vessels landing frozen fish.
Where cargoes are transferred direct to cold storage, they may purchase
from the cold store. The transactions are individual and private and there
is no form of public auction.
3.        There are no records to indicate the number of mammies or the
volume and value of their transactions. In very many instances the mammies
have a direct interest in the vessels from which they purchase. They
either share in the ownership, or advance loans for the purchase of fishing
boats and equipment. Sometimes they have close family ties with the fisher-
men. They therefore represent an important source of non-institutional
credit.
4.        The pattern of distribution has been determined by the availabi-
lity of road and rail communications and is generally confined to the
southern half of Ghana in urban and village centers accessible to coastal
landing centers (Annex 1). With the exception of one or two trucks
operated by private companies, no refrigerated or insulated transport is
available. As a consequence, the distribution of fish in its fresh state
is confined to the areas close to the coast which can be reached before
spoilage occurs.  A large proportion, possibly exceeding 60V, is processed
by the traditional method of smoke-drying. This is carried on by the
mammies individually, using their own small smoke-ovens. There is no
centralized processing of fish in bulk. In this form fish is distributed
all over southern Ghana and a strong consumer preference for the product
has developed. The process is applied not only to the fresh fish landed
by the inshore fleet but also to the frozen fish landed by the domestic
and foreign deep sea vessels. The latter is simply allowed to thaw and
then sold as fresh fish or smoke-dried in the traditional manner. In some
instances it is transported to inland centers and allowed to thaw out on
the journey.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        In recent years a feature of increasing importance in the market-
ing of fish in Ghana has been the use of cold-storage facilities. While
these have not affected the traditional manner of processing and retailing
fish (as there are no significant retail sales of frozen fish) they are
becoming more important as a means of smoothing out seasonal fluctuations
of supply. Frozen fish landings are imvortant in this respect. The
present cold storage capacity in the country is 13,330 tons, and this is
planned to exnand to 17,000 tons in 1969. The location and ownership of
the cold storage and ice-making facilities are as follows:
(a)  Cold Storage                                       Tons
Ghana Cold Stores Ltd:        Tema                 5,500
Accra               1,500
Kumasi                300
Mankoadze Fisheries Ltd:      Tema                 3,000

Coast, Sunyani, Agona Svedru, Ho, Tamale and
Oda.
Totalling:            110
Total:         13,330
(b) Ice-Making Plant

Accra Brewery:                Accra                   20
Total:            100
6.        Two of the above companies, Mankoadze Fisheries Ltd. and Ocean
Fisheries Ltd. operate their cold-storage installations in conjunction with



ANNEX 2
Page 3
their own fishing fleets. Ghana Cold Storeo Ltd. is engaged exclusively in
freezing and cold storage. Until now it has been under the Joint ownership
of the Government and a private firm, Benin Gulf Enterprises Ltd. The
privately-owned shares are now to be acquired by the Ghana Fishing Corpo-
ration, which would then become a majority shareholder. The operations of
the first three companies above appear to have been successful commercially.
The Ghana Fishing Corporation has, however, not made effective use of its
inland cold storage depots. Since 1966 the Corporation has not been
engaged in marketing activities and its fonrer operations were -.succe.sful,
due mainly to inexperience, inefficiencies and arbitrary restraints on its
distribution and pricing policies.
7.        In the foreseeable future it is not envisaged that the traditional
pattern of marketing will change very significantly except through the more
effective use of cold storage and improved communications as a means of
extending the market. The Government has two proposals in respect of which
agreements were signed by the former administration with the Federal Republic
of Germany and USSR respectively, but on which action has been suspended for
the time being. Both of these are concerned with the processing of fish on
an industrial scale. The proposals include the following provisions:
(a) West German Interlocking Food Complex
(i) A wheat and corn flour mill of 63,000 tons p.a.
capacity;
(ii) A 30,000 tons p.a. pelletized animal food factory;
(iii) A 30,000 tons p.a. fish canning factory;
(iv) A can-making plant with 180 million cans p.a.
capacity;
(v) An 8,000 tons p.a. fish meal factory;
(vi) A 15,000 tons p.a. oil mill with Hydrogenization and
other oil-utilization equipment.
(b) USSR Fish Processing Complex
(i) A 20,000 cans per day fish-canning plant;
(ii) A G-tons per day fish smoking plant;
(iii) A 1-ton per day fish cooking plant;
(iv) A 30-tons (raw material) per day fish meal and oil plant.
It seems unlikely that at present levels and costs of production, the
requirements of raw material to justify these capacities could be fulfilled
and the future of these proposals is still uncertain.

COMPOSITION OF THE FISHING FLEET
A. CANOES
1.       'The latest census conducted in 1962 indicated more than 10,000
dug-out canoes in operation along the coast of Ghana. These are 25-40 feet
in length and three to four feet in breadth. Of these more than 5,000 have
been mechanized by the installation of J.8-20 h.p. outboard motors: the
remainder are propelled by paddles and sail.
B. INSHORE MOTOR FISHING VESSELS
2.        This fleet, which has been built up since 1953, consists of
wooden planked boats of 27-60 feet in lengt% powered by inboard diesel
engines. A total of 260 vessels in this range had been constructed in
Ghana up to end 1967, as follows:
Vessel Length             Built Between           Total Built
27 ft                  1953-1961                 107

Government Procedures for Sale of Vessels
4.        Committee:  A government committee has been set up to allocate
fishing vessels owned, or contracted for, by the Government to interested
purchasers.
5.        Terms of Sale:  The terms offered by the Committee on vessels
not in operation at time of handover are: 3% of price on delivery, 7% of
price within three months of delivery and the balance over seven years by
annuity at interest of 6% per annum. On vessels in operation at time of
handover the terms would be 25% of price on contract signature and the
balance over seven years by annuity at interest of 6% per annum.
6.        Price:  The Committee asks the price the Government had to pay
to suppliers. It is willing to reduce this price then shown tonvincing
evidence by purchasers that it should do so. To date, the only reductions
considered have been oh the grounds of depreciation in value caused by
vessels being tied up for an extended period.
7.        Collection of Sales Proceeds:  The Committee has no responsibility
beyond negotiation and contract. signature. After signature, contract copies
are lodged with the Accountant.General and the Auditor General. The
Accountant General will be responsible for collection but will probably
assign this work to the Fisheries Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.

DEEP SEA ?ISHING VESSELS
1.        The present fleet comprises 47 vessels in the 75-300 ft classes.
These vessels were imported under Government contracts placed d-'r5g 1506-65
with Norwegian, Japanese, U.K., U.S.S.R. and Yugoslav suppliers. The
contracts provide for the eventual delivery of between 10 and 15 more
vessels. Purchase contracts were placed without adequate technical advice.
Consequently, many vessels are unsuitable for efficient operation under
Ghanaian conditions and others are probably of unsuitable design. Further,
Ghana does not possess the fleet management and other expertise required to
successfully operate this large number of deep sea trawlers, whose methods
of operation are so much more sophisticated than those of inshore craft.
Details of the deep sea fleet are given in Annex 3.
2.        The major part of the existing deep sea fleet is owned by the
State-owned Ghana Fishing Corporation (GFC) and two private companies. Of
the 19 vessels owned by GFC, only three are fit to operate, although they
are not fishing at present. Twelve have been laid up for over two years,
while four are undergoing repairs. This situation reflects the serious
difficulties experienced by GFC in the past due to its tota. inexperience
of the management and operation of large, long-distance fishing vessels,
and its heavy reliance on foreign personnel who were suddenly withdrawn
with the change in Government in 1966. GFC has been subject to an official
inquiry into its affairs and is now in the course of reorganization. The
six Norwegian stern-trawlers under its ownership are to be operated under
a management contract with a Norwegian firm of fishing consultants. The
future of the remainder of its fleet is undecided.
3.        Deep sea vessels under private ownership and management have
operated more consistently and with much greater efficiency. The consensus
of both Government and the private sector is that it would be neither
practicable nor economic to expand the long distance fleet further at
present. In the present uncertainty concerning the operational status
of many units in the existing fleet, and the delivery of new vessels on
order, it is difficult to forecast future production capacity, but it is
highly unlikely that, even under more efficient management, the deep sea
fleet will produce more than double its present volume of 25 to 30,000 tons
per annum within 4 to 5 years.

FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION
1.        Primary responsibility for fisheries is vested in the Fisheries
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Division has a staff of
about 100, comprising graduate fishery officers and junior field staff.
Its activities include statistics, credit, training, research and the
administration of minor fishing harbors and facilities. In the past, by
far its most important activities were related to the mechanization and
modernization of the inshore fleet through credit and training. While
its training activities are continuing, its credit activities are virtually
suspended apart from the recovery of former loans. Functions with respect
to fishing and fish-marketing are mainly supervisory and regulatory,
although it has recently become much more active in marine and freshwater
research, as it has responsibility Cor counterpart personnel and services
related to USDP research projects.
2.        There are many matters of very direct concern to the fishing
industry which fall within the responsibility of other ministries. Thus,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for overall planning of the
fishery sector. The Railways and Ports Administration, under the Ministry
of Communications is reponsible for the accommodation of fishing vessels
and shore facilities in Tema and Takoradi. The Ministry of Industries is
responsible for the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation which, through
its Boatyards Division, is responsible for boat construction and sales.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the Agricultural Development
Bank which provides credit finance for the industry.
3.        Government policy aims at self-sufficiency in fish production
through increased productivity of the existing long-range trawling fleet,
and through the continued expansion and improvement of the mechanized
inshore fleet under private ownership.

BOATYARDS DIVISION, GHANA INDUSTRIAL HOLDING CORPORATION
1.        In 1952, the Government set up a boatyard ia Sekondi to construct
plank-built fishing boats of about 27 ft long povered with inboa--d diesel
engines. In 1962 a second Government boatyard was established in Tema to
construct boats of 40 ft length and upwards. These boatyards subsequently
became the State Boatyards Corporation, a statutory corporation. In June,
1968, by Government decree, the Corporation became the Boatyards Division
(BD) of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation (GIHOC).
2.        The first 27 ft vessel was launched in 1953.  By 1961, 107 such
vessels had been built at the Sekondi yard but during the year, the yard
switched to the construction of 30 ft vessels with more space for fishing
gear and catch.  In 1962, the first 40 ft vessel was launched at the Tema
yard. At present, the facilities of both yards are being directed at the
construction of fairly standardized 40 and 45 ft purse seiners using
imported engines, fittings and fishing gear although Sekondi continues to
produce a small number of 30 ft vessels.
Organization and Management
3.        Before 1968, when the Sekondi and Tema Boatyards were being run
as a statutory corporation, the Managing Director of the Corporation was
stationed at Tema. Apart from his functions as the Chief Executive of the
whole corporation, he was also directly responsible for the supervision of
operations at the Tema yard. An Administrative Manager was responsible for
the Sekondi Boatyard under the general direction of the Managing Director.
The Corporation operated with great autonomy, under the State Enterprises
Secretariat, an organization coordinating the activities of the various
State-owned corporations. The Managing Director was appointed by the
Minister of Finance upon the recommendation of the State Enterprises
Secretariat. The Corporation had a Board of Directors of five, including
the Managing Director. There were, and still are, about 240 employees at
the Tema yard and 210 at the Sekondi yard.
4.        In 1968, mainly as a consequience of the unsatisfactory results
from many of the State-owned corporations, the State Enterprises Secretariat
was dissolved and a new organization, GIHOC, was created to amalgamate
twenty State manufacturing corporations. This was aimed at centralizing the
control of the various State enterprises in order to benefit from a wider
use of scarce management expertise. In the ensuing reorganization, BD
became a division of GIHOC.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Prior to the creation of GIHOC, all of BD's management decisions
were taken virtually single-handedly by the Managing Director. BD has
operated effectively over recent years despite a number of difficulties,
generally outside its control:
(a) Inadequate supplies of imported components caused by
foreign exchange shortages. Even when components have
been available, supplies have been erratic leading to an
uneven flow of production;
(b) Insufficient credit facilities to offer suitable terms
to potential boat purchasers;
(c) Inability, due to Government regulations, to dismiss
surplus labor arising out of (a) and (b). In practice,
such dismissals might have dissipated BD's skilled crafts-
men. Nevertheless, excess labor has increased production
costs;
(d) Inadequate technical advice. Up to a year ago, BD had
expatriate technical advice available. This, hovever,
was not entirely suitable and boat designs are unsuited
to construction materials, time-consuming and require
unnecessarily high standard of craftsmanship. BD's manage-
ment recognizes the need for a new design to simplify
construction and improve the qualities of the boats, and
has obtained a naval architect and production manager
through UNDP.
6.        The Managing Director has acted efficiently and aggressively in
overcoming these problems and in making as many boats as possible available
to fishermen at reasonable costs. There have been some deficiencies in
administration, notably in the financial and cost accounting systems.
The basic framework of the accounting systems is good but it has not
been properly utilized. It has not been possible to accurately determine
the actual cost of individual boat constructions to the Corporation nor has
it been possible to determine the standard cost of construction assuming
various levels of production. Of the industries under GIHOC's control the
the Boatyards appears to have been one of the more efficient and therefore
justifies less assistance from GIHOC's management. Nevertheless, it is
believed that GIHOC can assist Boatyards in the areas of administration and
accounting and it proposes to do so.
Boat Production
7.        The table below shows the production of fishing vessels at the
two yards since 1952. It shows that the trend has been towards the con-
struction of bigger vessels and at present, the 40 and 45 ft vessels are
most preferred by boat owners. The Sekondi yard has also produce a number
of pleasure and commercial boats ranging from 8 ft dinghies to a 52 ft
research vessel.

8.        BD is the biggest producer of plank-built vessels in tropical
Africa and the quality of craftsmanship in that size and type of vessel is
as good as any in other parts of the world. Of the two yards, the Tema yard
is bigger, more modern, better laid out and better equipped with technical
facilities than the Sekondi boatyard. The following table shows the
facilities available at both yards:

45 ft.      1 circular
saw
1 planer
Whereas the Tema yard concentrates on the construction of bigger vessels
upwards of 40 ft, the Sekondi yard mainly builds the smaller size vessels.
During 1966 and 1967, the boatyards jointly produced an average of 33 boats
per annum. Their capacity is, however, higher than this; actual production
was below capacity for various reasons of which a shortage of foreign ex-
change for imported components was the major.
9.        The boats presently being built by BD have round hull steam-bent
frames. There are several disadvantages to this form of construction.
It is complicated, time-consuming, and requires the use of expensive copper
nails and brass screws. Moreover, the local tropical hardwoods which are
required because of their resistance to marine borers split when bent into
the curves required in round construction. Consequently, a new boat design
of a hard chine construction would be used in this project. The vessel
would have a hard chine hull, requiring sawn frames and cheaper galvanized
iron nails. Furthermore, it would require less craftsmanship and less con-
struction time than the round construetion. The distinction between round
and hard chine construction is shown in Drawing 2. There are no disadvan-
tages in the new design from the viewpoint of sea-worthiness or handling
characteristics. On the cont-1ary, this type of design is superior on these
counts and gives a better huli form for fishing purposes.
Boat Sales
10.       Demand for vessels constructed by BD has always tended to exceed
supply. The major factors limiting supply have been shortage of foreign
exchange for imported vessel parts and shortage of credit for potential
boat purchasers (Annex 7). BD has been closely involved with its purchasers.
It has always sold its vessels directly to fishermen without the use of
intermediate sales agents. In recent years, where it has made sales on
credit, whether using its own funds or those of ADB for this purpose, it
has aopraised the creditworthiness of fishermen and subsequently collected
their installment payments from them. Instances of bad debts have been
extremely low overall and none have resulted under the ADB program.



ANNEX 6

ll.       BD currently sells its vessels at the prices shown below:
Length of Vessel                         Selling Price
30 ft                                 NO 7,000
40 ft                                 N028,000
45 ft                                 N034,ooo
60 ft                                 N¢70,000
These do not include the costs of purse seine nets and associated gear
which, in the case of boats other than the 30 ft vessels, adds an additional
N010,000 to the selling price. A small amount of duty on some imported
items is included in this price. A direct comparison with vessel prices
in other countries is not possible as the characteristics of vessels
vary so much. However, those comparisons which have been made indicate
that it is unlikely that vessels imported would be materially cheaper
(regardless of the protective tariff of 50% on the cif cost of imported
vessels). It is anticipated that with the simpler form of construction
and higher level of production possible under the project proposed, the
present prices to vessel owners could be lower than those shown above.
Foreign Competition
12.       Without international tendering to precise specifications it is
very difficult to give precise prices at which foreign competitors might
be able to provide boats in Ghana. However, the Fishing Vessels Section
of the Fishing Vessels and Engineering Branch of FAQ has, from time to
time, invited tenders internationally in connection with procurement of
boats for various UNDP/Special Fund Fishery Research Projects administered
by FAO. Although there are major variances in size, analysis of several
of these has indicated that BD prices for boats compare favorably.
Specifically, there are two contracts detailed below which indicate
firstly that wood is cheaper than steel in the range of project vessel
sizes and, secondly, that BD's price for wooden vessels appears favorable
even without taking into account costs of transport.
Steel Boat:  47 ft, engine 144 hp, trawl winch and echo
sounder, delivered April 1966, constructed for
Nigeria.

Accounts
13.       Summarized consolidated balance sheets and profit and loss
accounts for recent years are shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. These
indicate the gradually improving performance of BD. They also demonstrate
the substantial proportion of BD's assets which are tied up in stocks and work
in progress; principally a result of the delays in production caused by
the shortage of foreign exchange for imported components.

ANNEX 7

GHANA
FISHIERIES PROJECT
FISHERIES CREDIT
1.        Fisheries credit in Ghana centers princiDally on the provision of
credit to fishermen for the purchase of fishing vessels and fishing gear.
The institutions which have been involved in the provision of credit are
as follows:
The Fisheries Division
2.        The Fisheries Division of the Ministry of Agriculture was at one
time virtually the only major source of fisheries credit in Ghana. It
operated two schemes, one the "Charter Party Scheme" for the purchase of
mechanized inshore craft built by the State Boatyards Corporation, and the
"Outboard Motor Scheme" for the provision of outboard motors for canoes.
3.        The scheme for the inshore craft was initiated in 1955 and through
it, the construction and credit sale of 172 inshore fishing vessels of the
27 ft to 40 ft class was arranged. The Outboard Motor Scheme started in
1960, and under it locally built dug-out canoes have been fitted with nearly
1,200 motors. Loan repayments have been generally poor mainly because of
the inadequate screening of loan applicants. Consequently, the Fisheries
Division has halted its lending activities and is now concerned only with
the recovery of repayments on outstanding loans.
State Boatyards
4.        With the cessation of the credit for sale of their boats from
the Fisheries Division, the State Boatyards Corporation was obliged to
finance its own sales. It accomplished this by calling for large deposits
from potential purchasers well in advance of construction of their boats.
At the same time, it extended credit, on very short terms, and for a
relatively small proportion of sale prices to its purchasers on delivery
of vessels. This practice has disadvantages in that it is unsatisfactory
for vessel owners to place substantial funds with Boatyards well in advance
of delivery of their vessels, in return for unsuitably short credit for
the balance after delivery. Nevertheless, it has been a useful expedient.
This was not its only source of funds; Annex 6, Table 1 indicates the
increase in its equity.
5.        After the entry of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) into
the fisheries credit sector (para. 6 below) Boatyards did not discontinue
its own lending. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, ADB funds have
only recently been available in large quantities and secondly, ADB has only
been willing to finance 40 and 45 ft vessels, which sizes it considers to
be optimum, while there has still been a demand for the smaller vessels
constructed by Boatyards.



ANXIEX 7
Page 2
The Agricultural Development Bank
6.        The Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) was established in April
1965. It tock over the functions of the Rural Credit Department of the
Bank of Ghana. The objective of ADB is to promote the development of
agriculture by providing credit facilities to agriculture and cottage
industries. There are seven members of the Board of Directors, the
number of employees is 56. It is rapidly increasing in size and area of
operations.
7.        ADB has an authorized capital of N030 million, 51% of which is
to be subscribed by the Government. It is intended that the remaining
49% will be made available for public subscription when ADB has been
established for a sufficient time to gain the confidence of the public.
By the end of Decenmber 1968, the subscribed capital was over NK8 million
(Table 1). At the time of its incorporation, ADB took over from the Bank
of Ghana various agricultural loans, including certain fisheries loans
outstanding and large amounts in respect of guarantees for the purchase of
trawlers acquired under Government-negotiated contracts. The majority of
these guarantees are covered by Government indemnity to ADB.
8.        The management of ADB is sound and competent and it appears it can
handle its expansion program in agriculture successfully. It has, as yet,
little direct contact with the fishing industry and no staff specializing
in this field. It commenced its present lending program to purchasers from
Boatyards in mid-1967, when an agreement was signed between Boatyards and
ADB, which provided for Boatyards to appraise potential purchasers and
arrange for debt collection on ADB's behalf. Boatyards has the necessary
expertize and knowledge of the fishing industry to perform this function.
ADB bears the credit risk and (,an refuse to accept Boatyards' recommendations.
Under this scheme, the Boatyards sells the vessels on hire-purchase to private
individuals or companies. Pri-or to the delivery of the vessels, the potential
boat owners make a deposit and the balance is repaid over a period of three
years at an interest rate of 8%. Boatyards deducts 11% from the interest
rate in order to cover their expenses. These arrangement work well and there
have been no bad debts to date. ADB's expansion plans include an office in
the Port of Tema, appropriately staffed to handle fisheries business. The
date of this is not yet decided, but when the plan is implemented, ADB will
be able to take over appraisal and collection functions.
9.        Demand for boats by technically qualified applicants greatly exceeds
supply as financing funds, both in local and foreign currencies, are limited.
In order to use these funds as effectively as possible, ADB has given pre-
ference to those owners who can make the largest deposits (some have been as
high es 50%), and has set the repayment period at three years to provide a
fast iollover. It would prefer to accept a smaller deposit and lengthen the
repayment period if more funds, and consequently more boats, were available.
ADB's present lending rate of 8% to inshore fisheries is the same as that to
agriculture. The relative profitability of inshore fisheries would justify



ANNEX 7
Page 3
a higher rate of interest; 9% is proposed under the project submitted for
IDA finance. This, combined with easier terms of deposit and repayment of
20% and five years respectively, would be more attractive to potential boat
owners.
Non-Institutional Credit
10.       A further, and most important source of credit for fishing is
the "mammytt who buys fish from one or a number of boats.  A fisherman who
requires finance for boat purchse or working capital may obtain this from
the mammy with whom he deals. The terms of such finance vary but invariably
include the obligation to supply fish at preferential prices to the manmy.
The agreements are not formalized although they are scrupulously honored
and the extent of such credit is not known. The cost is invariably high,
particularly for smaller amounts of finance where the effective interest
including preferential fish price can exceed 30% per annum.

Assumptions
General
1.        All assumptions concerning annual catch rates and gross proceeds
of sales are based on records, provided by the Fisheries Division of the
Ministry of Agriculture, of 8,165 voyages made by 40 ft and 45 ft fishing
vessels during the years 1965, 1966 and 1967.
Operations
2.        Seventy-five voyages of one to two days duration, mainly concen-
trated during the period July-October. Fully operational vessels have in
fact made up to 120 voyages in good fishing years.
Annual Catch
3.        The annual catch is estimated at 225 tons assuming 75 voyages
averaging three tons per voyage.
