1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       The Sustainable Access to Finance Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the Kingdom of Morocco
in the amount of 133.1 million EUR (US $200 million equivalent) was approved on January 26, 2010.
The DPL supported key components of Morocco‘s strategy aimed at addressing the two main challenges
in the financial sector: further expanding access to underserved sectors while preserving financial
stability. The DPL was fully consistent with the first pillar of the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) of growth, competitiveness and employment. The operation was built on the positive experience of
the Bank‘s past engagement in the financial sector, particularly the 2005 Financial Sector DPL that helped
strengthen the legal and institutional environment for financial intermediation and risk management, and
increase the private sector‘s participation in the provision of financial services . The DPL also drew
heavily on previous World Bank work including the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
and related technical notes1 as well as the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on
Insolvency and Creditor Rights (2006), and Payments and Securities Clearance and Settlement Systems
(2007).

2.       The main objective of the DPL was to support Morocco‘s reform program aimed at addressing
the dual objectives of access and stability. To this end, the DPL was structured around four pillars with
specific actions specified under each component: (i) ensure sustainable improvements in household access
to finance; (ii) ensure sustainable improvements in SME access to finance; (iii) strengthen financial
regulation and supervision; and (iv) develop further capital markets and instruments.

3.      The DPL consisted of two tranches. The first tranche (88.6 million EUR) was disbursed following
Board approval, which was conditional on the realization of specific reforms. The second tranche (44.1
million EUR) was released upon the fulfilment of a detailed set of measures described below in section 2.
At the request of the Government, this program was jointly prepared with the African Development Bank
(AfDB). The AfDB provided parallel financing (162 million EUR) in two tranches with the view to
support financial sector development. The two operations complemented each other through common
policy objectives but with different activities. The DPL has also been consistent with IFC‘s long-term
engagement in the financial sector of Morocco, particularly as regards support to the development of
SMEs and financial services to the poorer segment of the population2. Close collaboration between the
Bank and the IMF also permitted the sharing of key data, particularly on the macroeconomic
environment.

     1.1. Context at Appraisal

4.      The analysis of supporting documents for the DPL under review and outcomes of discussions
with authorities show a very high degree of convergence between the operation‘s objectives and design
on the one hand and the Government‘s program on the other. The Bank team‘s assessment of the
macroeconomic framework and sector background were well articulated and relevant to the projected
program.




1
  The Technical Note on Increasing Access to Finance (October 2008) provided a thorough analysis on access and a description of the main
financial institutions active in Morocco. The note also discussed structural and regulatory issues which have the potential to affect outreach,
assessed restrictions to access to savings, checking and payment services and proposed recommendations derived from the analysis.
2
  For example, IFC has worked with leading Moroccan banks to help them develop profitable SME banking operations. IFC also undertook
various initiatives to develop the country‘s financial and credit information infrastructure, and helped establish jointly wi th the Central Bank a
best practice private credit bureau.



                                                                          1
Macroeconomic Framework

5.       Morocco has achieved impressive macroeconomic performance over the last ten years as
indicated by higher and sustained output growth, falling unemployment, rising investment ratios, and low
inflation3. The country‘s improved performance was largely due to sound macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms. After 2005 the Government maintained very sound fiscal policies and conducted a
prudent public debt management and monetary policy. Financial sector reforms –supported by a Financial
Sector Development Policy Loan- entailed inter alia the restructuring of state banks, stronger financial
regulation and supervision, and improved financial infrastructure. At the time of the appraisal, Morocco
suffered from the effects of the global financial crisis, but managed its effects well and was able to
preserve a reasonable growth performance. Public finances also continued to be well managed.

Sector Background

6.         During the preparation of the current operation, the financial sector was characterized as follows.

7.      Banks had proven resilient to the crisis4 and continued to finance infrastructure and housing, and
had expanded financing to MFIs and SMEs as well. Moreover, the Central bank had tightened
regulations, including the increase of the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to 10 percent and issued
new regulations to ensure that banks manage effectively new risks emerging from fast credit growth;

8.      Morocco had been able to develop the insurance sector to a significant extent, but this growth had
also created risk management challenges, especially in the fast growing life insurance sector.

9.       On the microfinance front, the country had become a recognized leader in the region5, but
shortcomings in governance and internal control had led to poor management of the rapid growth of
institutions and portfolio problems (in particular NPLs) which started creating financial stress. This led to
the tightening of regulation and supervision.

10.     Lastly, the stock market had grown rapidly but was dominated by a handful of large companies,
and private fixed income instruments remained undeveloped.

11.     Despite the growth of the financial system in years leading up to this operation, there was still
substantial scope for further increasing access to financial services. Morocco was above the international
benchmark regarding financial depth. However, the country had much lower ratios of deposits and loans
per population than would have been expected given the depth indicators. This difference suggested the
potential for further and substantive gains in access. Enterprise surveys showed a similar picture.
Moroccan policy-makers faced the challenge of expanding access to finance to households and
enterprises, while also ensuring that these gains would be sustained.

     1.2. Rationale for Bank Involvement

12.     Against this background, the Bank prepared the current DPL to respond to Government‘s request
for financial and technical support to i) help meet its larger borrowing requirements resulting from the
global crisis, while avoiding excessive pressures on the domestic financial market; and ii) support an
important reform that would contribute to growth and poverty alleviation. It was well established at the
time of project preparation that access to finance helped reduce poverty and inequality and should be an

  Economic growth rates averaged 5.1 percent over the period 2001-08, almost twice as high as the average of the previous decade.
4
  Non-performing Loans (NPLs) were historically low (5.5 percent of total loans in June 2009) and well provisioned, with no signs of
deterioration due to the credit expansion of recent years.
5
  MFIs serve 1.3 million clients and their credit portfolio reached almost one percent of GDP in 2007.

                                                                       2
element of any successful economic development program, as was articulated in the program document.
The DPL was designed to contribute directly to the 2010-2013 CPS outcomes under Pillar 1 for financial
sector reform. The Bank‘s involvement in the sector through this DPL was fully consistent with the Bank
Group‘s 2007 Strategy for the Financial Sector that identified access to finance for the underserved as
one of the two areas that ―will receive special attention through well-defined initiatives‖. The DPL
provided an effective vehicle for the Bank to play a leading role in improving the country‘s financial
sector reform.

      1.3. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

13.      The objective of the proposed operation was to support the Government‘s efforts to expand
further the access of households and enterprises to finance, while ensuring the stability of the financial
system.

14.      Its outcomes were to be measured by the following eleven key indicators pertaining to each pillar
of the program:

         Pillar 1: Progress in expanding access to households: (i) Increase in number of total accounts of
          banks and Barid Al Maghrib per population, (ii) Decrease in the number of habitants per branches
          of banks and Barid Al Maghrib, and (iii) Reduction in the NPL ratio of MFIs;

         Pillar 2: Progress in expanding access to SME: (iv) Increase in the number of monthly
          consultation on individuals to the credit bureau, (v) Increase in the number of monthly
          consultations on companies to the credit bureau and (vi) Increase in the share of SMEs (as
          defined by BAM prudential regulations) in total bank lending to companies;

         Pillar 3: Progress in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework: (vii) Increase in the
          average capital adequacy ratio of the banking system, (viii) Quarterly publication of the real
          estate price index by the Central Bank starting in the first quarter 2010;

         Pillar 4: Progress in developing capital markets: (ix) Increase in the share of medium and long
          term issues in total annual government debt issues, (x) Reduction of the number of lines of
          Treasury bills and (xi) Increase in the outstanding value of private fixed income instruments to
          GDP with an initial maturity over a year (including bank issues).


      1.4. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
           Reasons/Justification

15.       No changes.

      1.5. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

16.     As indicated in the DPL, the operation was aimed at supporting the Government of Morocco
(GoM) current financial reform program. Structured in two tranches, the program contained 4 key
policy actions: (i) Ensuring Sustainable Improvements in Individuals Access to Finance, (ii) Ensuring
Sustainable Improvements in SMEs‘ access to Finance, (iii) Strengthening Financial Regulation and
Supervision and (iv) Furthering the Development of Capital Markets.

      1.6. Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

17.        No changes.

      1.7. Other significant changes

18.      There was only one change made to the program. The closing date of the DPL was extended from
June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2011, in response to a request from the Ministry of Economy and Finance
received on May 24, 2011. The extension was approved in order to allow the completion of two
outstanding conditions of second tranche release6. In a memo dated June 29, 2011, the team confirmed
that the requirements of OP/BP 13.30 (Closing Dates) relating to the extension of closing dates had been
met. Specifically, as required under the OP (paragraph 3): (i) the project objectives continued to be
achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower and other project implementing agencies were
satisfactory; and (iii) the Borrower had prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete
the project.

19.     It is also worth noting that a new Government, appointed after the Constitution was revised and
elections held in the second semester 2011, decided in early 2012 to send back all pending draft laws to
the relevant line Ministries so that they could be reviewed and, where appropriate, amended to be
consistent with the new Constitution and the Government‘s priorities. As a result, two second tranche
policy actions related respectively to the adoption by the Council of government of draft laws on (i) a new
insurance and pension supervisory authority (« Autorité de Contrôle des Assurances et de la Prévoyance
Sociale », ACAPS) and (ii) a new capital market authority (« Autorité des Marchés des Capitaux »,
AMMC) were reversed. The latter (AMMC) was again adopted by the Council of Government on April
19 2012. The former (ACAPS) had not yet been transmitted to the Council of Government for its
approval as of August 2012.

authority was adopted by the Council of Government on August 25, 2011. After the
enactment of the new constitution on July 1, 2011, and in the wake of the new free
elections that gave rise to a new Government, the decision was taken by the new Prime
Minister to re-submit all pending draft laws for a new round of internal review to ensure
consistency with the constitution as well as with the new Government‘s Program. As of

preparation of a draft covered bond law. The draft was sent by the Head of the Treasury to
the working groups for comments on June 6, 2011. The group comprises, among other
authorities, the Chairman of the banking industry association, the Head of the BAM‘s
supervisory department, the Head of the capital market supervision, the Head of the
insurance supervision.



      2.2. Major Factors Affecting Implementation

20.      Several factors have contributed to the successful implementation of the program.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

21.    The operation has been conducted as planned and in accordance with the conditions as outlined in
the Loan Agreement. The successful implementation of the DPL is attributed to several factors: (i) a clear

                                                           8
commitment to the reforms by the Moroccan government, (ii) a strong sense of ownership of the program
since its inception, (iii) a wide domestic consensus on the need to improve access to finance as a key
element for sustainable growth and (iv) the capacity of the implementing agency (both in terms of
administrative and financial management capacity) and its sound experience in dealing with prior
projects.

22.     This achievement has been made possible thanks to a combination of good practices. First, a
consultative and participatory approach has been favored by the authorities8. The government‘s use of
domestic multipartite working groups as instruments for collecting views and building consensus on
issues ascertained a large adherence to the objectives, reinforced internalization of the process, and
thereby underpinned reform ownership. All key stakeholders were involved and consulted9. Second, the
sustained political leadership demonstrated by the Moroccan MOF, particularly its Treasury department,
has supported the decision-making process and fostered a rapid engagement of the reforms. Third, the
direct and constant dialogue with development partners, especially the Bank and the AfDB has been an
important catalyst that ensured perfect alignment between reforms as targeted by the DPL and the overall
government‘s strategy.

23.   This commitment and strong ownership are best reflected through the actions and outputs that the
GoM has taken and produced and the corresponding outcomes, as presented in Section 3.2.

Soundness of Background Analysis

24.     The DPL has been designed on the basis of sound analytical work. The Financial Sector
Assessment Program Update of 2008 provided strong analytical underpinning to the design of the
operation under review. The preparation benefited from the detailed analysis and recommendations of the
FSAP on banking, insurance and capital markets, as well as on access to finance in Morocco. The
Financial Sector Stability Assessment was another useful source of information. Other diagnostic works
also contributed to the design of the operation, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSCs) on Insolvency and Creditor Rights (2006), Payments and Securities Clearance and
Settlement Systems (2007), and Investment Climate Assessment (ICA; 2007). In addition, the design was
enhanced through the collection of data and information gathered from internal and external partners (e.g.
IFC, IMF).

Assessment of the Operation’s Design

25.      The operation was well prepared, clearly articulated and fully aligned with the Government
priorities for the financial sector. The DPL was client-driven and designed following the same structure of
the GoM reform program, consisting of 4 main pillars, all geared towards expanding access to finance
while preserving stability. In particular, the Bank supported the government with a DPL for sustainable
access to finance that entailed the creation of a postal bank, a credit bureau, the establishment of
regulations for loan classification, provisioning and governance for microfinance institutions. Measures
also included improvements in bank regulation and supervision, draft laws to improve supervision of
insurance companies and capital markets as well as improvements in public debt management. Morocco‘s
2010 DPL focused on both problems in microfinance and access to finance which were, as noted by the

  For example, all draft regulations targeted by the current DPL have been prepared in consultation with all relevant agencies and partners,
including from the private sectors. This helped clarify and broaden the understanding of issues and legitimized the need for reforms.

  BAM (Bank Al Maghrib), DAPS (Direction des Assurances et de la Prévoyance Sociale), CDVM (Conseil Déontologique des Valeurs

                                                                        9
IEG10, arguably more relevant in Morocco than in any other country in the region given its large
microfinance segment which had recently experienced rapid growth.

26.     Overall, the objectives were also realistic and not too demanding for the implementing agencies
as evidenced by the final results of the program for which all targets were met. It was also a timely
intervention that came into effect at a critical moment where the financial crisis led to the emergence of
new risks, particularly for the poorest segment of the population. Furthermore, this program should not be
seen as a standalone product but as a natural continuation of what the Bank has already achieved with
success in the financial sector. By focusing more closely on access, while strengthening further the
regulatory and supervisory framework of banking, insurance, and capital markets, this DPL supports an
important package of reforms that will contribute to growth and poverty alleviation.

Relevance of Risks Identified

27.     Three types of risk were identified during preparation of the DPL, all of which proved to be
pertinent during the life of the operation and mitigations measures appeared relevant and effective:

28.      Economic risk stemming from the global economic crisis was and remains relatively high in
Morocco. To contain any possible deterioration that could jeopardize stability, the program set mitigation
measures, notably through continued sound macroeconomic management. Morocco‘s strong track records
in dealing with adverse conditions (as evidenced by its excellent macro economic performance11 achieved
over the last decade and despite the recent international financial turmoil) appeared to be relevant. Also,
the Bank has continued monitoring and maintaining dialogue with the authorities on the overall
macroeconomic context.

29.     Financial risk stemming from a deterioration of the credit portfolios of some institutions was not
negligible and concerns were expressed about further deterioration. The identification of this risk was
pertinent as expansion of access constituted one of the two key pillars of the supported program.

30.      At the time of the design of the DPL, critical implementing regulations for the new securitization
law had not yet been approved by the Council of Ministers because of the opinion issued by the Auditor
general emphasizing the negative role played by complex securitizations in the current global financial
crisis. These concerns have been actually lifted and the identified risk has been effectively addressed by
the introduction of new instruments which are simple and that can bring clear benefits to the country.

     2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.     In order to evaluate the contribution of the operation to the achievement of its long-run
objectives, the team selected a number of indicators, including some indicators measuring the
achievement of intermediate outcomes. The period of program evaluation began in mid-2009, as most
figures were available by the time of appraisal, and ended in early 2012.

32.     In the matrix of policy actions and expected outcomes, there were enough indicators to monitor
the impact. Eleven outcome indicators were established to assess impact over development objectives.
Data was collected regularly and used to monitor progress towards the expected outcomes. The indicators
were realistic, achievable and mostly quantitative. In addition, most of these monitoring indicators were
supported by targets and baselines (10 indicators out of 11).

   Economic growth rates averaged 5.1 percent over the period 2001-08, almost twice as high as the average of the previous decade.

                                                                  10
33.     Responsibility for implementing policy reforms under this DPL resided with the MOF. Bank
supervision was aligned with MoF‘s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The Government took the
lead in monitoring progress in implementation and in updating the program policy matrix as appropriate.
The Bank performed its own monitoring duties through on-site follow up missions in Morocco, constant
dialogue with the authorities as well as through desk reviews12.

34.     In conclusion, M&E and implementation arrangements were continuous and contributed to
reforms implementation and the achievement of development objectives as observed in the table below.

     2.4. Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

35.       Since the current DPL has been successful in meeting the GoM objectives and expectations, a
new financial sector DPL has been requested by the MOF and is now being prepared. This new DPL is
expected to be approved by the Board by FY 13. Its main objectives are to support a new phase of
financial modernization, building on the achievements of the current DPL. It will: (i) pursue progress in
the diversification and availability of financial services for all, with a focus on the poorest individuals and
microenterprises, (ii) promote long term domestic savings to support investment and long term growth,
(iii) foster the diversification of the financial sector beyond banking and (iv) continue strengthening the
financial stability and regulatory architecture to make it versatile and forward-looking enough to address
upcoming challenges13.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

     3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

36.      The objectives of the DPL were highly relevant throughout the course of the project and continue
to be relevant at ICR preparation:

37.      The financial sector has been an area of high priority in Morocco, even before the crisis. Besides,
the operation focused on longer-term issues of household and SME access to finance, two major areas
that also had crisis relevance, due to rising nonperforming loans in microfinance and increased real estate
exposures14.

38.      The supported reform program was also built on four long-run objectives as described above and
all these objectives were in line with the CPS of growth, competitiveness and employment. In addition,
further enhancements of corporate and bank governance are covered by the program and contribute to the
CPS goal of strengthening the governance reform agenda.

39.     Financial sector reforms are demonstrably linked to growth and poverty reduction. They are
fundamental to reforms in other sectors, including private sector development, infrastructure, housing and
social policies.

40.     The DPL aims also to build a more resilient financial system through a series of key reforms that
are legal, institutional or operational in nature. It paves the way to a new series of reforms that have
already been planned by the MOF and that will be supported by another DPL.

     3.2. Achievement of Program Development Objectives

41.      The Program‗s Achievement, in terms of compliance with the monitoring indicators is strong.
The status of compliance with actions selected as indicators is described in details below and summarized
in the following table.

Pillar 1: Increased sustained access of the population to financial services

42.    Three policy actions were identified to achieve this objective and have been effectively
completed.

(i)     A postal bank (Al Barid Bank, ABB) was granted a banking license by BAM, the Central Bank,
on July 10, 2009 to service households, with a particular focus on low income individuals.

43.     An ambitious modernization effort of postal activities was undertaken before the license was
granted. Decree no 2-10-416 authorized the transfer of postal financial services to a fully owned
subsidiary of the Post office, ABB (the transfer was completed in December 2010).

44.     ABB already has a significant impact on access to finance and complements other commercial
banks‘ growth strategies. The process of financial deepening triggered by reforms implemented in the
early 2000s continued in recent years in line with the DPL outcome indicator. 54% of Moroccans have a
bank account in 2011, compared to 43% in 2008 and 34% in 2005. ABB customers already represent over
a quarter of Moroccans with a bank account and their number is rapidly growing, especially in
underserved rural areas (the number of accounts opened daily doubled since ABB was launched and three
quarters of these new accounts are opened in rural areas). ABB is also expanding its product offer15 and
taking actions to complement gains in access with effective use of financial products. Low income
banking (LIB) strategies implemented by other commercial banks also played a significant role in overall
gains in access (LIB accounts represented 14% of total bank accounts in August 2011 compared to 6% in
2008).

45.      Improved distribution channels played a key role in improving access to finance. The number of
bank branches, including ABB, continued to increase rapidly in line with the DPL outcome indicator
(6,300 habitants per branch in 2011 compared to 7,500 in 200816). Moreover, banks explored new
distribution channels which helped make LIB strategies sustainable and attract low income customers
(e.g. partnerships with transfer agents). ABB‘s network represents a fifth of all bank branches. It is the
only bank in many locations17 and its newtork is expected to double shortly, as some 800 rural postal
branches are equipped with satelite connections allowing them to offer a broad range of financial services.

(ii)    Another policy action consisted in strengthening regulations to create a conducive environment
for the microcredit sector, an industry which usefully complements other financial institutions (e.g. larger
share of lending benefiting women and individuals in rural areas).

46.    To this end, the DPL supported two main regulatory improvements. First, an order of the Minister
of Economy and Finance nº 2338-08 dated December 31, 2008 established detailed classification and

15
   ABB expanded its range of services by offering overdrafts (end of 1st quarter 2011), new saving products including term deposits (April 2011),
mortgage loans (July 2011 (for staff) and September 2011 (for all customers) and education savings scheme (October 2011). In addition, money
transfers and payment services have been reinforced and will be further expanded through mobile banking facilities.
16
   When computing this ratio, BAM took all postal branches into account until 2008 (1762 in 2008). It adopted a more rigorous definition in 2009
and only took into account postal branches effectively offering financial services (887 in 2009). The corrected figure for 2008 is 7,500 habitants
per branch (rather than 6,300 as indicated for the baseline outcome indicator). This ratio declined to 7,100 in 2009, 6,600 in 2010 and 6,300 in
2011.
17
   ABB is the only bank in 38% of the locations where it is present

                                                                       12
provisioning requirements for microcredit loans. This helped improve financial reporting and ensure that
bad loans were adequately identified and provisioned. This measure was complemented by the directive
of the Governor of BAM nº 1/G/2009 dated Sept. 16, 2009 which introduced detailed governance
requirements for microcredit associations. After a phase of rapid growth (micro loans were multiplied by
six between 2004 and 2007), this helped address root causes of the 2008 crisis (weak risk management
systems, insufficiently trained credit officers etc.).

47.     The portfolio at risk declined significantly from the 2009 peak (12% in September 2009, 6% in
2010, 4% in 2011) in line with the DPL outcome indicator. Improvements reflect better risk management
and active loan write offs (the latter explain that the industry suffered large losses in 2009 and just broke
even in 2010). Microcredit loans have been stable since 2008 (4.6 billion MAD in 2011) while the
number of borrowers has regularly declined (788,000 in 2011 compared to a peak of 1,350,000 in 2007),
partly reflecting stricter loan origination processes and a lower number of customers borrowing from
multiple MFIs.

(iii)  A third action covered an improved partial credit guarantee (PCG) scheme supporting access to
housing finance for creditworthy low income individuals.

48.     For this purpose, the DPL supported the launch of a new housing guarantee fund called Damane
Assakane that was set up in 2009. This initiative was completed as planned and appears to be an
important reform component. Damane Assakane got increased resources18 to expand further access to
housing finance. The Fund, managed by the Caisse Centrale de Garantie -CCG19- is a state-backed
guarantee program that provides 80% coverage of the principal and interest on bank housing loans20 for
applicants with low, irregular or informal sources of income. Although eligible beneficiaries include
middle class customers, poor people are expected to remain the main beneficiaries of this scheme,
including slums households for which a specific guarantee scheme has been designed (FOGARIM-
VSB21). In recent years, the program experienced some problems like high delinquency (especially after 3
and 6 months, less afterwards) or insufficient targeting22.

49.     There was no specific outcome indicator for this particular segment of the DPL but anecdotal
evidence show that the Fund ultimately caught on and led to a significant increase in the number of
housing loans being made by banks23 to the target population with higher competition on interest rates24
and services. In effect, statistics from the MOF indicate that the cumulative number of guarantees of
Damane Assakane increased by 37 % since its launch, reaching over 74,109 beneficiaries in 2011, versus
63,065 in 2010 and 54,000 in 2009 and totalling MAD 10,8 billion in 2011 (9,1 billion in 2010 and 7.8
billion in 2009). In 2011, 97% of guarantees were related to housing purchase and only 3% to
construction. In terms of geographic distribution, FOGARIM products have been distributed across the
country, in 126 cities.


18
   thanks to the merger of previous funds, FOGARIM (600 million MAD endowment) and FOGALOGE-public (350 million MAD).
19
    a public agency under the purview of the Ministry of Finance and Privatization.
20
   The loans are given with a fixed interest rates and a maturity of 2-30 years (in practice an average of 20 years).
21
   Launched in July of 2004, the national Moroccan program Villes sans Bidonvilles (VSB, or literally, ―Cities Without Slums‖) e volves from the
wide sweeping goal of ―eradicating all slums by 2012‖ through making home ownership affordable for the urban poor.
22
   For example the use of FOGARIM-guaranteed credits for the acquisition of parcels of land, rather than for complete housing units for which
they are intended.
23
   Four banks (CIH, BMCE, Wafa Immobilier, and Banque Populaire) are providing the bulk of Fogarim loans, with CIH alone representing 44%
of the total amount.
24
   Interest rates applicable FOGARIM loans have decreased from 7,1% en 2004 to 5,3% in 2010 and went up again in 2011 and 2012 (around
6%) due to pressure on mortgage loans.




                                                                      13
Pillar 2: Ensuring sustainable improvement in access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises
(SME)

50.     Two policy actions were targeted under this second pillar of the DPL.

(i)    The first policy action was designed to increase outreach, reduce risk and cost in lending to
SMEs, as well as individuals, through improvements in the credit information infrastructure.

51.     To this end, the program supported the launch of a new Credit bureau collecting data from a
broad range of financial institutions, including some MFIs, followed by an expansion of the coverage of
MFIs. The first Moroccan Credit bureau, a subsidiary of Experian, a leading global information services
company, started operating on October 26, 2009 by delegation from BAM.

52.      The rapid pick up of the Credit bureau has been facilitated by the fact that BAM required all
credit institutions to report and consult it. Such requirements aim to promote further sound gains in access
to finance by ensuring credit institutions can and do access relevant information to identify creditworthy
borrowers, monitor the quality of their portfolio and take prompt action when a borrower‘s risk profile
deteriorates. Circular 02/G/2010 issued on April 5, 2010 makes it compulsory for credit institutions (i.e.
banks, leasing and factoring companies primarily) to report all credit exposures to the Credit bureau
(positive and negative information, including guarantees received, irrespective of their amount). Circular
01/G/2010 also makes it compulsory for credit institutions to consult a solvency report, which includes all
information received by the Credit bureau, before granting any new credit. This same circular includes
consumer protection provisions and makes it possible for customers to request the correction of their
solvency reports when it is inaccurate. All credit institutions comply with reporting and consultation
requirements.

53.      A few large MFIs started reporting to the credit bureau in 2009; others joined after the credit
bureau agreed to offer them a reduced pricing in 2011. All MFIs signed contracts in 2011 with the credit
bureau which reflect this reduced pricing and committed to report information. At the end of 2011, all
MFIs are reporting to the credit bureau. Almost 90% of microloans (by value) appear in the credit bureau
database, which exceeds by far the 50% target set in the DPL. Moreover, four large MFIs with a
combined market share of 92% are consulting the credit bureau as of February 2012 (with more expected
to join in 2012). The credit bureau already played a positive role in helping MFIs reduce their portfolio at
risk and limiting the number of clients who unduly borrow from different MFIs. It is expected to provide
increasingly relevant risk management information going forward.

54.      Monthly consultations to the credit bureau have been trending upward and far exceed the DPL
baseline indicators. Monthly consultations on individuals reached 76,086 in June 2011 and 73,082 in
December 2011, exceeding the DPL baseline (1,217 in November 2009). Monthly consultations on
companies reached 6,436 in June 2011 and 5,357 in December 2011, exceeding the DPL baseline (371 in
November 2009). Declines observed between June and December 2011 primarily reflects seasonal
factors.

(ii)    The second policy action covered a reform of the SME Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) scheme to
strengthen its sustainability and efficiency.

55.      It included new guarantee products focused on SMEs and designed to better match their financial
needs according to their life cycle (investment loans, working capital and restructuring primarily). The
parameters of the guarantee products have been adjusted in line with international best practices (equity
allocations to cover expected losses, fees, simplification and harmonization of eligibility criteria, claims


                                                    14
payment etc.). This helped streamline and strenghten the national PCG scheme, which was previously too
complex and fragmented.

56.      The new PCG scheme proved attractive enough for banks to have a positive impact while
remaining targeted. It is now guaranteeing about 2 billion worth of credit each year which benefits to over
a throusand companies. It remains targeted as only a small share of SME loans benefit from such a
guarantee (total SME loans reached 79 billion MAD in December 2011). It proved flexible enough to
provide an effective countercyclical tool when banks became more reluctant to provide working capital to
exporters in 2009, due to impact of the global economic crisis. A new guarantee product addressing this
constraint was promptly launched and actively taken up by banks. The flexibility of the scheme was again
illustrated when a new product (―Damane Express‖) was launched in May 2012 to target loans to
microenterprises, an underserved segment which banks want to better address.

57.      Available information point to a positive impact of the PCG scheme on making credit available to
creditworthy borrowers who would otherwise be credit constrained. The preliminary results of an impact
study undertaken by a Consultancy show that almost three quarters of loans with a CCG guarantee would
not have otherwise been granted and that collateral generally covers less than 50 % of the value of the
loans it guarantees (compared to average collateral requirements for SMEs closer to 150%). The
relatively high share of female entrepreneurs in the loan portfolio guaranteed by the CCG also tends to
confirm additionality (30% of SMEs with a credit guaranteed by the CCG are owned by women,
compared to an estimated 12% of all companies owned by women).

58.      As contemplated by a DPL policy measure, Bank Al Maghrib carried out in 2011 an on-site
inspection of the CCG, which did not identify major weaknesses. BAM focused on the governance,
internal control and risk management frameworks and made several recommendations to strengthen them
further, which the CCG intends to implement. The low default rate experienced so far across the different
guarantee products launched in 2009 also point to a prudent management of risks.

59.      In a challenging economic environment, the share of SME loans in bank corporate loans slightly
declined from 22% in June 2009 to 20% in June 2010 and remained stable since. It is worth observing
that this 20-22% share remains high compared to other MENA or emerging countries (e.g. 13% in non
GCC MENA countries, including Morocco, in 2009). As a share of GDP, SME loans declined from 9.8%
in 2009 to 9.2% in 2010 before recovering to 9.8% in 2011. Available information do not make it possible
to differentiate between lower demand from SMEs and reduced willingness by banks to lend to them to
explain these trends. New initiatives have been taken recently to support SME finance (e.g. new partial
credit products targeting microenterprises and working capital, new refinancing scheme targeting SME
finance launched by BAM etc.).

Pillar 3: Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory architecture

60.       Four policy actions were contemplated under this objective:

(i)      The first action consisted in strengthening the coordination among financial sector authorities and
the effectiveness of crises response mechanisms.

61.     The authorities, with the assistance of the World Bank, undertook and completed a crisis
simulation/crisis management exercise involving all financial sector authorities (the Treasury, BAM, as
well as the insurance and capital market regulators). In the wake of this exercise25, a Memorandum of


25
  Morocco was the first MENA country to carry out a crisis preparedness and crisis management exercise in April 2009. This is a recognized
best practice in the field of financial stability.

                                                                     15
Understanding26 was elaborated involving the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the relevant
financial sector supervisors (BAM, CDVM and DAPS) establishing procedures and exchange of
information in the event of a financial crisis. This agreement was signed on June 21, 2012.

(ii)       The second action consisted of a comprehensive review of bank corporate governance.

62.     The review aimed at assessing banks‘ internal capacity to manage their risks, following rapid
gains in bank intermediation and a diversification of their risk profiles. This review looked at system wide
issues and did not assess banks individually. It was carried out by a World Bank team in 2010 and its key
conclusions were discussed in June 2010 during a workshop organized by BAM with banks and other
stakeholders. The review identified areas where further progress would be welcome (e.g. elevation of the
role of the Board, including by setting up specific committees to support its work and ensuring the
presence of independent directors, further strengthening of the risk management and internal control
functions, specific attention to financial conglomerates etc.). In line with the DPL policy matrix, BAM
prepared proposals to implement key recommendations of the bank governance reviews through
amendments of the banking law (which as of July 2012 were being finalized at a technical level with the
Ministry of Finance).

63.      Moreover, BAM strengthened its capacity to oversee real estate risks, which represent about a
third of banks‘ assets (mortgage and developers‘ loans). A real estate price index was launched in 2010
and published quarterly since, in line with a DPL outcome indicator. Since 2010, it has been broadened,
with further improvements contemplated. The index dramatically improves transparency on this major
asset class. It has been used by BAM in its supervisory activities. Most recently, it helped calibrate new
stress testing requirements which banks have to perform to assess their resiliency and report to BAM27.

64.     Overall, better risk management capacity and more thorough internal capital adequacy assessment
processes at banks, coupled with enhanced supervision by BAM, were expected to lead to the pursuit of
the observed trend towards higher capital buffers system wide. The baseline average capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) on an individual basis at June 2009 was 11.7%28 (significantly above the international
minimum CAR of 8% and Moroccan minimum CAR of 10%). Further progress was observed at the end
of 2009 (11.8%) and 2010 (12.3%), with most of the capital remaining in the form of Tier 1 capital
(average Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.7% in 2010). 2011 figures show a slight decrease of the average in a
more difficult environment. The CAR stands at 11.7% in December 2011, back to the level observed in
June 2009. BAM issued new regulations (circulaires 5/G/12, 6/G/12 and 7/G/12) on April 19, 2012 which
require all credit institutions to meet a minimum CAR of 12% by June 2013 (and a minimum Tier 1 ratio
of 9% by the same date).

(iii)   The third action intended to strengthen the independence and capacity of the insurance and
pension supervisor.

65.      It aims at ensuring a sound development of the insurance and pension sectors through the
establishment of a new independent Insurance and Pension Supervisory Authority (« Autorité de
Contrôle des Assurances et de la Prévoyance Sociale », ACAPS) taking over the current department of
the MOF responsible for such regulation and supervision (DAPS). A draft law was submitted to the

26
   A copy of the MOU has been shared with the ICR team.
27
   A guidance note issued by BAM in April 2012 (notice technique 1/DSB/2012) sets parameters banks have to use to carry out stress tests
mandated by BAM Directive 2/G/2010 (i.e. types of parameters and minimum stress to be applied). Stress tests are undertaken at solo and
consolidated levels. A specific real estate stress tests needs to be performed with the following assumptions: 15% of high risks loans to real estate
developers (e.g. those with a low internal rating) become non-performing, 15% of high risks mortgage loans (e.g. those with a high debt to
income ratios) become non performing, collateral value declines by 10% and interest rates increase by 100 basis points.
28
   Average consolidated CAR were 12% in 2009, 12.7% respectively in 2010 and 12.4% in 2011.



                                                                        16
General Secretariat of Government (SGG) on 29 July 2009. Following comments received as part of an
active consultative process involving all stakeholders and taking account of a new context (including the
appointment of a new Head of DAPS who suggested improvements to the initial draft law), the draft law
was revised to strengthen further the governance of the contemplated authority and broaden its
responsibilities (pension sector in particular). This draft law was adopted by the Council of Government
on 25 August 2011.

66.     The new Government appointed after the Constitution was revised and elections were held in the
second semester 2011 decided in early 2012 to send back all pending draft laws to the relevant Ministries
so that they could be reviewed and, where appropriate, amended to be consistent with the new
Constitution and the Government‘s priorities. The team was informed in August 2012 that no material
inconsistency was identified and that the revised draft law was with the SGG which is responsible for
putting it on the agenda of the Council of Government. No date for the review of the draft law by the
Council of Government has yet been set.

(iv)    The fourth policy action intends to strengthen the independence and enforcement powers of the
capital markets supervisor in order to ensure sound capital market development.

67.    A draft law to set up a new capital market authority (―Autorité Marocaine des Marchés de
Capitaux‖, AMMC) was submitted to the SGG on November 12, 2009 and adopted by the Council of
Government on August 25, 2011. As for the ACAPS draft law, the AMMC draft law was sent back for
review by the MOF in early 2012. It has since been transmitted back to the SGG and approved again by
the Council of Government on April 19, 2012.

68.     The DPL also planned the strengthening of the governance structure of the Casablanca stock
exchange which was made possible with the amendment of its by-laws dated 3 April 2009 authorizing the
set up of a Board of Directors and General Management (« Direction Générale »).

Pillar 4: Further strengthening the development of capital markets

69.     The development of capital markets as foreseen under this pillar has been achieved through three
policy actions:

70.       (i)The first action intended to strengthen public debt management to help establish a liquid and
reliable yield curve and the creation of conditions for effective pricing and sound development of fixed
income instruments. To achieve this goal, several initiatives have been carried out. A Memorandum of
Understanding dated July 28, 2009 was signed between the Treasury and BAM for a more active
Treasury cash management. On July 1, 2009, an electronic auction system for government securities was
set up that reduces operational risk and price uncertainty for all participants. In addition, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance issued an order changing the reference rate of floating rate credits from Treasury
bills to a reference rate linked to short term instruments, fostering better public debt management.

71.     (ii) Further development and development of private fixed income instruments is another policy
action under objective 4. It has been completed through the enactment of the Decree implementing the
amendments to securitization law nº 33-08 approved in November 2008. A bank securitized part of its
mortgage portfolio in 2012 and other financial and non financial corporations are preparing similar
operations. The Ministry of Economy and Finance also submitted for comments to relevant stakeholders a
draft law creating covered bonds. Following further consultations, the technical preparation of this draft
law is now almost complete.




                                                     17
72.     (iii) Lastly, the legal conditions for the set up of a sound and liquid future market to enable
effective risk management is included as a third action under this pillar. A draft law on the future market
was adopted on 9 July 2009 by the Council of Government.

    3.3. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

73.     The overall outcome rating for this DPL is ―satisfactory‖. It reflects the high relevance of the
development objectives and the achievement of the program. Planned reforms were implemented
according to the timeline and are achieving their key objectives of expanding access to households and
SMEs, strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework and making progress in developing
capital markets. Significant institutional reforms have been conducted under the present DPL. While the
government is pursuing its reform agenda, the impact of the measures taken under this DPL is noticeable:

74.     On the inclusion front, the percentage of Moroccans with a bank account reached 54% in 2011,
which is a major step forward in comparison to the situation prevailing before (34%). SMEs are also
getting better access to credit as evidenced by the number of consultations on companies in the new credit
bureau and the stabilization of the share of SME loans in credits to companies despite a more challenging
environment. Improvements in the quality of portfolios in the microfinance sector have also observed
with a drop in NPLs over the last years.

75.     The supervisory and regulatory framework is getting more robust than it was before the reforms
were launched. New laws and regulations are being introduced that will improve oversight of banks,
insurance and capital markets and make banks more resilient in case of crisis. Active operational
preparation for the set up of the new capital market and insurance and pension authorities expected to
foster a swift implementation of the two related laws once they are adopted (after some delays as
explained in section 3.2). Lastly, thanks to a series of initiatives, the country has started to make its stock
market more appealing to investors with the view to turn Morocco into a regional player.

    3.4. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

76.      Although the DPL did not have a specific poverty focus, in the medium to long term, the program
supported measures that will enhance competitiveness and growth, access to finance, and financial
stability, all of which contribute to positive social outcomes. Indeed, this operation, by strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions is expected to favor
poverty reduction in the medium-term through:

77.      Helping household and SMEs to better access financial services at lower rates and providing
banks with more information through the credit bureau, thus preventing over indebtedness. Better risk
management techniques, reduced name lending and an over reliance on real estate collateral are expected
to foster access to finance for underserved creditworthy borrowers (e.g. among women and young people
or in rural areas);

78.      Increasing the capacity of the financial authorities to anticipate risks in the banking sector and
limit future systemic crisis that could be very costly to depositors;

79.     Enhancing the capacity of the financial authorities to deal with major financial crisis and thus
help preserve taxpayers‘ money.


                                                      18
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.      The set up of a new postal bank, an improved partial credit guarantee scheme, a new credit
bureau, enhanced crisis management arrangements with new coordination mechanisms and a new
framework for securitization are significant institutional changes. They are expected to foster sound gains
in access to finance for individuals and crporates. Going forward, when passed by Parliament, the draft
laws establishing a new and independent insurance and pension supervisory authority as well as a Capital
Market Authority are also expected to bring significant improvements to the financial sector‘s
institutional environment.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

81.      No unintended outcomes and impacts were identified.

      3.5. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

82.      Not applicable.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

83.      The four risks identified during the DPL preparation remain moderate:

(i)      Timing and speed of the recovery from the global crisis.

84.      As observed in 2009 at the time of the preparation of the DPL, Morocco weathered the effects of
the 2008 global financial crisis from a position of relative economic strength having improved its public
finance and fostered growth over the past decade. Because of a weak integration into
international financial markets, Morocco‘s financial sector has been immune from the worst immediate
effects of the financial contagion and was therefore able to help smooth the adverse effects of the
economic slowdown.

85.       It should be noted that the Euro zone crisis that emerged in 2010 and the Arab Spring that swept
through the region in 2011 created new risks and challenges. Government faced significant pressure to
respond to popular demands and absorb new shocks. In addition to the implementing a public wage rise
in early 2011, the government increased subsidy expenditures due to high world prices for food and fuel
(between 2010 and 2011 they increased by 80 percent). Public finances deteriorated sharply while exports
suffered from the economic slowdown in Europe as well as from a lack of competitiveness. Although
Government took steps in 2012 to reign in subsidies, receipts from foreign direct investments, remittances
and tourism did not recover fully and, most recently, even declined. As a result, foreign exchange reserves
fell at a rapid pace in 2012.

86.     BAM recently stepped up its efforts to inject liquidity in the banking system to avoid any
financial retrenchment. This has so far helped avoid any marked deterioration in the access to finance for
individuals and MSMEs or threats to financial stability. Going forward, a continued deterioration of the
macroeconomic situation would compromise the achievements of the Program. It would in particular
further strain Morocco's financial sector capacities and deteriorate the creditworthiness of households
and MSMEs.



                                                    19
(ii)   A deterioration of the credit portfolios of some institutions could jeopardize expected
improvements in access.

87.     The March 2012 ICR on-site mission was provided with data showing improvements in NPLs in
the microcredit industry (as discussed above) but further deterioration cannot be ruled out. However, the
Government has shown strong commitment to handle the situation and has taken measures to strengthen
the capacity of the microcredit institutions to grow in a sustainable way. In this respect, BAM closely
monitors the micro-finance sector. The Moroccan Government has been very active in fostering the
microfinance industry through key initiatives, in particular with the financial support of the United States.
The Agency of Partnership for Progress (Agence du Partenariat pour le Progrès)—under the umbrella of
the Prime Minister—was especially set up for that purpose and was granted a budget of 46.2 Million USD
for 5 years to promote new financial products (e.g. Islamic finance, micro-insurance products, micro-
saving services) for low-income households via AMCs29. Likewise, the slowdown of non-agriculture
output may put some stress in bank portfolios, but BAM has also taken measures to strengthen the banks‘
solvency –by increasing the CAR- and their capacity to manage new risks, in particular in the real estate
sector.

(iii)    The resumption of long-term Treasury bill issues may imply some increase in the reference rate
for existing mortgage holders.

88.    Existing mortgage holders may experience some increase in mortgage payments as long-term
Treasury bill issues resume, but the impact is likely to be moderate30.

(iv)       The Government may experience difficulties in having specific capital market reforms approved.

89.     At the time of the DPL preparation, critical implementing regulations for the new securitization
law had not yet been approved by the Council of Ministers because of the opinion issued by the Auditor
general (―Cour des comptes‖) emphasizing the negative role played by complex securitizations in the
current global financial crisis. Since then, the country passed a law on securitization along with
implementing regulations and one operation of securitization has been launched by a domestic bank.
Efforts are been initiated to ensure risks linked to such operations are adequately assessed, calibrated and
disclosed and that roper incentives for a sound development of securitization are in place.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

       5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

90.      The project team performance during identification, preparation and appraisal is rated highly
satisfactory. The Financial Sector DPL‘s strategic relevance was based on the Moroccan Government‘s
priorities for the financial sector. The design of the DPL also profited from ongoing financial sector
dialogue between the government and the Bank as well as wide consultations with the Moroccan
authorities and third parties, including, but not limited to, banks, AMCs and other non-bank financial
29
   This project called ―financial services‖ also intends to reinforce AMCs by promoting internal control systems, risks manageme nt and debt
collection mechanisms.

   First, floating mortgages account for less than half of total mortgages. Second, long-term rates have declined significantly relative to crisis
levels. Third, the average ratio of debt service to income is moderate. Finally, low income mortgage holders have benefitted from fixed rate
mortgages covered by the housing subsidy scheme (floating rate mortgages are not eligible to this scheme).

                                                                         20
institutions. The Loan identification and design were consistent with the FY 10-13 CPS. Findings from
the FSAP update (2008) and related ROSCs were very useful in project preparation as well as a close
coordination with the IMF and the country office. Importantly, the Bank closely coordinated with the
AfDB, which also supported financial sector reforms in Morocco, during project preparation. Key risks
that could derail implementation were adequately identified. The team also set clear indicators that helped
to follow and measure program‘s implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(Including M&E arrangements)

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The Bank regularly visited the country throughout a two-year period, focusing on progress made
in the implementation of the reforms and also organized regular conference calls to monitor progress. A
detailed memorandum was drafted in 2010 confirming that all prior actions required for the release of the
second tranche of the program had been met by the borrower as outlined in the Loan Agreement.
Compliance with all prior actions was verified by the Bank supervision missions. The Memorandum was
supplemented by all supporting documents. The DPL team also prepared and delivered two detailed ISR
in 2011 and 2012. However, the first ISR was not field immediately after Board approval and there was a
19 month lapse between the filing of the two ISR. ss part of its supervisory duties, the DPL team
maintained a close dialogue with the Moroccan authorities (mostly with the MOF and BAM) as well as
with the country management unit and country office in Rabat.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

92.      The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The DPL adequately supported the
Government‘s priorities to further modernise the financial sector to provide better access to both
individuals and MSMEs while preserving financial stability to ensure such gains are sustainable. As a
result the financial sector played a welcome countercyclical role in a more challenging environment and
played a key role in supporting investment and access to housing. Moreover, the DPL provided welcome
budget support which helped preserve macroeconomic stability. This DPL helped to (i) accelerate the
pace of reforms, (ii) create more convergence between the authorities and the other partners and (iii)
support Governments strategy vis-à-vis the financial sector. Close supervision helped oversee the timely
implementation of the reform agenda and ensure a dialogue could promptly take place when delays were
observed. This proved useful for two key measures for which significant delays occurred.

   93. In light of the above, the overall Bank performance should be rated satisfactory.

    5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

94.     The GoM provided strong support to the program. The authorities were actively engaged in the
design of the operation and in its implementation. It is noteworthy that this DPL was actually initiated by
the authorities themselves. Morocco was extremely pro-active and committed to its successful
implementation. Ownership of government was from the start a pre-condition to the success and has
remained unconditional till the end.

                                                    21
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

95.     Several agencies, under the leadership of the MOF were engaged since the inception of the
program and remained involved in the dialogue. They demonstrated drive for results as evidenced by the
completion of the objectives. The Ministry of Finance together with BAM are the two agencies
responsible for the design and overall implementation of the operation. As discussed above in this report,
the Treasury along with the Central bank (BAM) were the driving force for this operation. Constant
dialogue was maintained between these two agencies on the one hand and between these agencies and the
DPL team on the other.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

96.    Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on ratings for Government
Performance and Implementing Agencies‘ performance as described above.


6. Lessons Learned

97.      Consultation with the stakeholders was a recipe for success. Indeed, as explained above, reforms
have been undertaken after a process of close and continuous consultation with all stakeholders. This
ensured a clear understanding of the multiple issues at stake from all parties involved (including
representatives of civil society31) and also an adherence to the overarching goals of the DPL. Ultimately,
it helped mitigate scepticism or even opposition to certain reforms. The reforms engaged in the financial
sector through this program would not have been achieved without support from all stakeholders.

98.     Clear objectives and realistic development indicators are also critical to success. The DPL
contained achievable policy actions that were very focused and easy to measure. Also, choosing only
actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement proved to be pertinent. The policy
actions were maintained at a modest number but with sufficient critical mass, focusing on those that are
considered crucial in improving household and SME access, strengthening financial stability
arrangements and developing capital markets.

99.     Stronger coordination among government ministries could have been useful to help move the
reform process forward more quickly given the multi-sector nature of the program. For any future
Financial Sector DPL, given the multifaceted nature of the reform program, it would be useful to set up a
steering committee to oversee the program from design to completion. Such a committee could be led by
the MOF and comprise representatives from the different agencies and convene on a regular basis to
monitor status of implementation, address any difficulty that may arise and give further guidance to the
implementing agencies.

100.    The implementation of two key measures related to the setup of new supervisory authorities for
the capital market and insurance sectors required more time than initially expected. The initial adoption
by the Council of Government of these two draft laws took longer than expected and required a six month
postponement of the closing date of the DPL. This was largely due to a demanding consultation process
involving all key stakeholders. The fact such measures were included as second tranche measures played

31
     E.g. microcredit associations, associations representing customers, young entrepreneurs etc.

                                                                          22
a positive role by helping maintain the momentum for their adoption. Going forward, a more conservative
timeframe could be adopted for the most ambitious reforms, which are technically challenging and
involve multiple stakeholders. As mentioned earlier, additional delays occurred in 2012 as a newly
elected government requested that all pending draft laws be revisited by line Ministries before being re-
examined by the Council of Government. This is to a large extent a unique situation related to the
democratic transition Morocco is experiencing. Such risk should nonetheless inform the preparation of
future operations.

101.     Technical assistance needs to accompany the DPL program to strengthen capacity. Eventually,
the Bank did provide significant technical assistance for some of the most challenging components of the
reform agenda32 but this should be considered in a more structured and deliberate way at the outset of any
future DPL. This would ensure that the country benefits from outside expertise with the view to
accompany the reforms in a more coherent way to ensure sustainability. This was clearly expressed by the
authorities during the ICR mission.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

102.    The Moroccan Government praised the Bank‘s operation in supporting the government in
implementing its ambitious financial sector reform program. Regarding borrower‘s performance, the
operation witnessed a series of reform measures that aimed at further developing a sound financial sector.
The Government also acclaimed the team‘s remarkable deal of diligence and technical support throughout
the operation, in addition to the close coordination and dialogue.

(b) Donors and Cofinanciers

103.    The operation was prepared through joint missions between the AfDB and the World Bank. The
two institutions consulted on the contemplated reform agenda and supported through two distinct
operations consistent and largely common reform measures. Supervision was undertaken through some
joint missions and information collected as well mission outcomes were regularly shared to ensure
effective coordination.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

104.       Not applicable.

  E.g. bank governance review, crisis simulation exercise, preparation of a draft covered bond law and support to prepare a strategy and develop
instruments to establish a benchmark yield curve.

Mr Director,

Following your letter mentioned above, I am pleased to share with you herewith our assessment of the
reform program supported by the loan referred to above.

       Context of the project, development objective and conception:

The Kingdom of Morocco resolutely engaged over the past two decades in a process of modernization of
its financial sector with a view to accompany and support the economic and social program of the
Government. The latter aims at deepening the macroeconomic and sector reforms with aim at boosting
economic growth and strengthening the resilience to external shocks of the economy.

When it requested the support of the World Bank with the loan referred above, the Government expressed
its strong commitment to maintain its efforts to modernize and develop the financial sector and to reach a
new stage in the process of development of this sector by taking into account the recommendations of the
report dated October 14, 2008 jointly prepared by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program.

It is in this context that the development program for the financial sector of the Kingdom of Morocco was
prepared. It is built around the following main pillars:

       Sustainable improvement in access to financial services for individuals,

       Sustainable improvement in access to finance for small and medium enterprises,

       Strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory architecture,

       Further strengthening of capital market development.

       Main factors affecting the execution of the program

The conception, the elaboration, the implementation and the assessment of the financial sector
development support program took place in good conditions. All missions undertaken by the World Bank
were well-prepared and delivered expected achievements. Such outcome was achieved thanks to a close
collaboration between the Moroccan authorities and the World Bank team responsible for this program.

The Moroccan authorities paid particular interest to this program and got involved to ensure its success by
different means including:

       The determination and firm willingness to further the reform process of the financial reform
       already initiated,

       The commitment of all stakeholders of the Moroccan financial sector to develop this industry,
       which plays a key role for the financing of the domestic economy,

       The consistent conception of the program and a clear identification of the objectives,

       The expertise of the World Bank team and its good knowledge of the Moroccan financial system.


                                                    30
This program is clearly linked to previous financial sector reforms which the Government intends to
continue in the coming years to develop and modernize all components of the domestic financial system.
The support of the Bank in the implementation of these reforms are highly appreciated.

       Outcomes of the financial sector development support program.

The goal of this program is to create the necessary conditions for an inclusive and job creating growth
through financial sector development. The ultimate beneficiary is the entire Moroccan population. Its
specific goal is to strengthen and deepen the governance of the financial sector through improved access
to financial services for individuals and companies as well as the diversification of financial instruments.
The overall expected outcomes following the implementation of this program are: (i) a sustainable
improvement in access to financial services for individuals, (ii) a sustainable improvement in access to
financial services for small and medium enterprises, (iii) the strengthening of the regulatory and
supervisory architecture, and (iv) further development of capital markets.

       Sustainable improvement in access to financial services for individuals

The modernization and professionalization of the financial services of Barid Al Maghrib through the set
up of a postal bank allowed giving access to basic financial services to a broader population including
people with a low income, which led to an increase in the share of the population with a bank account
from 30% in 2009 to 50% in 2010.

Besides, the adoption and implementation by the monetary authorities of a regulatory framework related
to the classification and provisioning of non-performing loans of microcredit associations, as well as the
risk management and internal control of these associations, led to improved governance and risk
management within these associations. As a result, the non-performing loan ratio declined and loans
delinquent for more than 30 days declined to about 7% in 2010 compared to 9% in 2009.

The set up of a guarantee fund for mortgage loans (Damane Assakane) made it possible to increase the
availability of real estate financing instruments and eased the financing of real estate for low income
households.

       Sustainable improvement in access to financial services for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)

Access to financing for companies improved substantially thanks to the reforms supported by this
financial sector development program.

Indeed, the program led to improvements in the inclusion of SMEs as well a reduction of risks and costs
of loans to these companies by improving credit information thanks to the set up of a credit bureau. This
credit bureau provides financial institutions with the necessary information and tools to more effectively
assess borrowers and manage their risks. As a result, non-performing loans as a share of total bank credit
declined from 6% in 2008 to 4.8% in 2010.

Moreover, the financial sector development program fostered the reform of the partial credit guarantee
scheme for SMEs already initiated by the Government. This reform improved the overall sustainability
and efficiency of the guarantee scheme. The amount of guarantees given by the CCG doubled from 2008
to 2010 increasing from 680 million MAD to 1,271 million MAD.

       Strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory architecture



                                                    31
With this program, the Government continued its efforts to strengthen the financial stability framework in
line with international best practices.

In order to assess banks‘ ability to manage the risks they face, an independent bank governance review
was undertaken with the support of the Bank. Moreover, in order to better assess the evolution of banking
risks, Bank Al Maghrib published a new real estate index prepared in coordination with the relevant
stakeholders.

The Government implemented a deep reform of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to capital
market and insurance supervisory authorities. Its goal is to establish independent supervisory authorities
in line with the requirements of an effective regulation and in line with international best practices.

This reform will also allow a better cooperation and coordination between supervisory authorities and will
foster increased macro-prudential stability.

The program also allowed a strengthening of the governance of the stock exchange thanks to the opening
of its capital to new shareholders beyond stock brokers. This opening allows for an increased participation
of the main stakeholders in the definition of the development strategy of this institution.

       Further development of capital markets

In order to foster capital market development, the Government strengthened its efforts to build a more
liquid and reliable Treasury bonds yield curve.

Besides, the Government intends to broaden the instruments available to Moroccan institutions to
diversify their funding sources and better manage their risks. A draft law on covered bonds was prepared
and transmitted to the stakeholders concerned by this financial instrument.

With the same purpose, the Government adopted the draft law on the future market. This draft laws aims
at strengthening the efficiency of this market by allowing economic agents, on the one hand, to hedge
against the risks of price fluctuations of the assets they hold and, on the other hand, to have a
comprehensive information on the prices of financial assets which allows an optimal allocation of their
financial resources.

The implementation of the conditionalities of the program is largely satisfactory. The only condition
which has not been fully implemented is related to the adoption by the Council of Government of the
draft law on the insurance and pension supervisory authority. This adoption should take place within five
to six weeks.

       Justification of the risk classification n terms of development outcomes

       As this program is part of a long term reform process which has been initiated by the Government
       for many years and as it has been designed in a consistent and inclusive manner, the achievement
       of its outcomes did not face any risk.

       Assessment of the performance of the Bank and the borrower

The World Bank: The Bank has always been a preferred partner of the Government. It provides constant
support to the efforts in terms of social and economic development of the country thanks to the financing
of investment projects and of structural and sector reforms including that of the financial sector.


                                                    32
Concerning the preparation and design of this program, it took place in good conditions and in perfect
coordination between the team responsible for the program and the Moroccan authorities.
Concerning supervision, it took place throughout the implementation of the program in an atmosphere of
dialogue between the Ministry of Economy and Finance, in charge of this program, and the World Bank
team. This made it possible to achieve the goals initially established for the program and to facilitate its
implementation.

The Borrower: The past decade was characterized by a long deep and structural reform process of the
financial sector. The Moroccan Government is committed to continue this process so as to respond to the
financing needs of an economy experiencing major changes.

In this regard, the financial sector development program undertaken by the Bank has been an opportunity
to speed up the development process and take advantage of the expertise and technical assistance of the
Bank.

The Moroccan authorities and other institutions involved in this program also made big efforts ad made
available all necessary resources to complete and achieve the financial sector development program.

       Lessons learnt from the financial sector development program

Each program is an opportunity to learn and share experiences. Such experience contributes to a better
preparation and implementation of programs which can be contemplated in the near future.
