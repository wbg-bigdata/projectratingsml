MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Uruguay
Third Highway Project (Loan 2238-UR)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Uruguay - Third Highway Project
(Loan 2238-UR)", prepared by tne Latin American and Caribbean Regional Office. The report has
no Part II, as the Borrower did not provide it, but it makes use of other Borrower supplied
information.
The project's basic objective was to consolidate the momentum achieved under the
Bank's first two highway projects.  Specific tasks were road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance and, importantly for this repeater project, the institutional strengthening of the Ministry
of Transport and Public Works (MTOP).
Implementation took three and one-half years longer than planned because of a
variety of factors, including: changes in government, sector priorities and composition of physical
works; and slow contract management. Actual project costs were about 75% of estimated costs due
to national currency devaluations and strong contractor competition.
The project's physical achievements were good, with an ex-post economic rate of
return (ERR) of 20% overall, as compared to an ex-ante ERR of 26%. Essential studies were
carried out, but institutional development was limited. Discontinuity in Bank staff assigned to the
Uruguay road sector had a negative impact on implementation and ultimate results.
Project outcome was marginally satisfactory. Institutional development was modest.
Sustainability is uncertain as the prospects for adequate road maintenance are mixed and the
institutional achievements have not been firmly implanted in MTOP. PCR quality is satisfactory. No
performance audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2238-UR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Highway
Project in Uruguay for which Loan 2238-UR in the amount of US$45.00
million was approved on February 15, 1983. The loan closed on December
31, 1990 three years behind schedule with US$41.97 million disbursed.
US$3.03 million (7%) was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and Caribbean, Department IV. The
Borrower sent tabulated data and a brief overview of the project in June 1993
which have been used in the preparation of Parts I and III of this report. The
Borrower sent a letter on October 25, 1993 that noted the receipt and the
review of Parts I and III of the PCR but offered no substantive comments or
text to be included in Part II. Thus, this PCR was completed without
Borrower contributions to Part II. This omission is permitted under Bank
guidelines for PCRs more than two years old.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on: (a) the Staff Appraisal Report;
(b) Loan and Guarantee Agreements; (c) supervision reports; (d) corre-
spondence between the Bank and the Borrower; (e) interviews with Bank
staff; and (f) data from the Borrower.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2238-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Project Objectives
1.1   The main objective of this project was to consolidate the momentum
achieved under the first two highway projects by the financing of a
comprehensive investment program, covering the national and feeder road
networks and a roads and bridges reconstruction program. This objective
was achieved. A second objective was to provide technical assistance for
strengthening the planning and executing capability of the MTOP (Ministry
of Transportation and Public Works) and Vialidad (National Highway
Directorate). This objective was only partially achieved.
2.    Project Implementation and Results
2.1   There were substantial delays in the implementation of the project due
to a late start caused by changes in the government, changes in sector
priorities, project restructuring, decreases in budget allocations, and further
changes in the government resulting in delayed decisions on contracts and
payments and a lack of continuity. As a result, the loan closing date was
extended twice for a total of three years.
2.2   Changes in the country's monetary policies and the resulting currency
devaluation-only partially compensated for by price increases-helped lower
project costs (para. 5.6). Highly competitive bidding for the civil works
resulted in further savings and a significantly lower total project cost
(para. 5.7). Combined, the two resulted in the elimination of the cofinancing
element in the financing plan for the project. The lower costs, along with
the dropping of Route 1 reconstruction, enabled some additional works to be
included, principally in the Feeder Roads Program and traffic safety (para.
5.4). Delays, however, in calling for bids and budget restrictions slowed
civil works execution in 1989 and 1990 and led to a number of contracts
remaining uncompleted at the time of loan closing. Thus, US$3.03 million
of the US$45.00 million loan was cancelled. Financing for these
uncompleted contracts was eventually provided under the follow-on Transport
I Project (Ln. 3021-UR).
2.3   The physical improvement of the highway network as a result of this
project was substantial. The institutional strengthening of the MTOP and



- iii -
Vialidad was not as effective as anticipated largely because of several
changes in the government and the management of the entities during the
project period (para. 6.1).
2.4   The overall cost of the project at US$101.8 million was 74% of the
appraisal estimates of US$137.0 million. Economic re-evaluation was
performed for items covering more than 94% of the actual project costs and
yielded an overall economic rate of return (ERR) of 19.6% for the Civil
Works (Category I), with individual sub-projects ranging from 13% to 55%.
In the ex post evaluation of the Feeder Roads Program, the average ERR was
13.1% (para. 6.3).
3.    Sustainability
3.1   Provided that scheduled maintenance is carried out, the likelihood of
sustainability for the Civil Works component is high. Recent supervision
reports from the Transport I Project indicate that road maintenance is
progressing wel in many provinces but poorly in a few due to a system of
fixed, per kilometer payments for maintenance that does not adequately cover
the costs of transporting materials to remote sites (para. 7.1).
3.2   The likelihood of sustainability for sector institutional development is
low. Since the project closed, there have been more changes in the
management of MTOP as well as high staff turnover due to low wages.
Further, a new government will be elected in 1994, which historically has
meant sector management changes. However, some of the institutional gains
such as the MTOP's annual investment planning system were still in place as
of early-1994 (para. 7.2).
4.    Lessons Learned
4.1   The costs of this project as wel as that of its predecessor, the Second
Highway Project, were off by 26% and 14% respectively-in both projects,
primarily due to changes in the exchange rate is-a-vis inflation. Thus, the
first lesson learned is that greater attention needs to be given to the macro
economic environment in Uruguay and its affect on project costs. The
project costs should have been reassessed during a supervision mission, and
if warranted, a portion of the loan cancelled. For this project, the lack of
any reassessment resulted in project cost estimates that were too high. So
although overall costs dropped, the Bank financed a greater share of the total
project costs than originally approved, and the Borrower paid commitment
fees on a portion of the loan that was never used (para. 8.3).
4.2   The second lesson learned comes from the benefit of hindsight. When
the Route 1 civil works (42% of the loan) were removed from the project, it
would have been prudent to reduce the scope of the project accordingly.
Instead, the project became a catch-all for the road sector with various small
scale works added or expanded to use the funds originally slated for Route 1



- iv -
with little analysis of the work's economic merit. This caused delays and
extensions and perhaps worse, further taxed the limited budget allocations
and institutional capacity of the implementing agencies (para. 8.4).
4.3   The third lesson learned is that a lack of continuity in Bank
supervision staff has a negative impact of the quality of Bank portfolio
management. With at least six different Task Managers/Project Officers,
four different Division Chiefs, and three reorganizations of the Managing
Division, the lack of continuity in supervising this project was excessive.
Consequently, during critical decisions affecting project implementation the
Bank was ill prepared to take an active role (paras. 8.1 & 8.5). In the
context of projects in Uruguay, this continuity is all the more important in
order to compensate for frequent turnover among Borrower staff.

Loan Amount:            US$45.0 million

.3ector:                Transport
Sub-Secto               Highways (Roads)
2.    Background
2.1 Uruguay's transport infrastructure comprises 62,000 km of roads
(15% are paved), 3000 km of railway track, one deep-water port and a
number of smaller ports, an offshore tanker-mooring station, pipelines for
petroleum imports and 25 commercial airports. Montevideo, the capital and
Uruguay's commercial and population center, is the hub of the transport
system.
2.2   At the time of project appraisal (1982), roads carried 85% of the total
freight, railways carried 12%, and river transport 3%. Since the 1960s, the
road's share has been gradually increasing at the expense of rail and river
transport. Much of the existing transport system in Uruguay, however, is
antiquated. The last major investments in railroad lines and port facilities
were in the 1920s, and there has been little roadway maintenance since the
1950s when most of the road networks (feeder and national) were completed.
The principal problem of the road sub-sector is the age and deteriorated
condition of the national network, notably the international connections.
2.3   Sector Objectives. To define key development issues in the transport
sector, a comprehensive survey of the national transport system was
undertaken by the Bank, with UNDP assistance, in 1976-78. This survey
established a general framework for transport investment and identified four
high-priority needs: (a) to strengthen national transport planning; (b) to
improve road rehabilitation and reconstruction; (c) to reduce the railroad
deficit, network and operations; and (d) to modernize the ports.



- 2 -
2.4   Following the framework of the National Transport Survey, this
project grew out of a need to strengthen the road sub-sector, a need to
further rationalize the railway system, and a need to improve transport
planning in general. The first project brief (July 1981) highlighted the main
transport problems of Uruguay, noting the high transport costs arising from
poor infrastructure and equipment conditions, the poor sector organization,
and the inadequate maintenance over the past twenty years.
2.5   Bank Sector Lending Experience. Overall, Bank experience in the
sector has been mixed. The first Bank loan to the sector was signed in 1962
(Ln. 324-UR) for the amount of US$18.5 million. This First Highway
Project closed in 1972 with significant delays and cost overruns. The project
did, however, finance the equipment and studies necessary to establish a
regular highway maintenance operation. The Second Highway Project (Ln.
1689) was signed in June 1979 for US$26.5 million and provided consulting
services for the preparation of a roads and bridges reconstruction program,
and provided technical assistance to the TPU (Transport Planning Unit), as
well as helped finance the reconstruction of the main international highway
between Montevideo and the Brazilian border (Route 8). The Second
Highway Project performance was rated as satisfactory and sustainability as
likely, but institutional development was only partial. The project closed two
years behind schedule in June 1986, and US$1.9 million (7%) of the loan
was cancelled.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Objectives. The Third Highway Project was originally slated to: (a)
help finance the MTOP's (Ministry of Transportation and Public Works)
Five-Year Highway Investment Program; (b) consolidate and strengthen the
planning, programming and executing capability of MTOP and Vialidad
(National Highway Directorate); (c) strengthen the role of Montevideo as the
center for transit traffic by reconstruction of key road corridors to Argentina
and Brazil; and (d) finance studies on intermodal transport.
3.2   Description. The appraised project description consisted of the seven
components.
(a)   Road and Bridge Reconstruction: civil works comprising
reconstruction of 115 km of road sections on international links
with Argentina and Brazil, and the construction of three new
bridges-two to replace existing bridges on the rivers
Caballada and Bellaco, and the third one, a new bridge on
Route 10 near Punta del Este.
(b)   Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation on National Highways:
civil works to rehabilitate five road sections (185 km), and
some additional roads for which the evaluation would be
submitted by the borrower during the execution of the project.



- 3 -
(c)   Feeder Roads: rehabilitation/reconstruction of 3000 kn within
the Feeder Road Program.
(d)   Traffic Safety: horizontal and vertical signalization on about
250 km of road sections.
(e)   Strengthening of MTOP's institutional capabilities for transport
planning, programming and investment, covering:
(i)   annual updating of the Five-Year Investment Program
based on traffic counts, a balanced assessment of the
needs of maintenance, bridge rehabilitation,
construction and reconstruction of national highways,
and the investment requirements of the National Feeder
Roads Program;
(ii)   preparation of plans of action for strengthening and
restructuring the MTOP, including its training
requirements; and
(iii)  enhancement of the MTOP's capabilities, by using
short-term consultant services and training MTOP
personnel in the fields of organization, management,
optimization of maintenance, rehabilitation,
reconstruction and construction expenditures, road
safety and research work.
(f)   Studies on intermodal transport, including:
(i)   review of Borrower policies and regulations with the
objective of recommending measures aimed at
increasing domestic and international intermodal
transport; and
(ii)  economic, financial and technical justification for the
establishment of a intermodal freight consolidation
center, and, if needed, preparation of preliminary
engineering and regulatory, institutional and financial
framework for the operation of the center.
(g)   Preparation and adoption by AFE (State Railroad
Administration) of a cost accounting system.
3.3   The total estimated cost of the project at the time of appraisal was
US$137 million. The foreign exchange component was approximately
US$70 million, of which US$45 million was to be financed by the Bank
loan, and the balance, US$25 million, by cofinancing (para. 5.7). The



- 4 -
government and the Intendencias (the municipal administrations in each
district) were to cover the entire local costs of US$67 million.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project was designed to continue and consolidate the work
initiated in the first two highway projects and to strengthen and reorganize
the MTOP's capabilities. The overall execution of the project was the
responsibility of the MTOP. DNT (National Transportation Directorate) was
the executing agency for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the national
roads, the Intendencias for the feeder roads, TPU for the intermodal studies,
and AFE for the establishment of accounting system. MTOP was also to
handle the technical assistance funds.
4.2   As the Intendencias owned their own equipment, the execution of
works on the Feeder Roads (US$40 million) was to be by force account, with
subcontracting of various tasks, and assistance of the land owners. A Special
Account in Uruguay, subject to annual audit, was made available for
financing the Bank's share of the project costs.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   Loan Effectiveness. The project was appraised in February 1982,
negotiated in December 1982, and approved by the Board on February 15,
1983. The Loan Agreement was signed on March 25, 1983. It became
effective more than six months later on October 4, 1983. The delay was
caused by a change of government and an overhaul of the project
management teams in the MTOP and DNT.
5.2   Changes in Project Scope. The were significant changes during
project implementation as evidenced by the five loan amendments. The
reason for the changes was that the project suffered from changes in
administrations and changes in priorities. The national government changed
three times during implementation. The overall executing agency, MTOP,
was reorganized twice and changed its sector priorities twice. The first
change in priorities came in 1985 and resulted in the government shifting all
road sector resources to IDB-funded road projects at the expense of other
works. The Bank mission in October 1985 noted that this would result in a
two year delay in implementation. A formal, two year extension of the loan
closing date was subsequently granted.
5.3   The second change in priorities came in 1988. The Uruguayan
Government, with the help of the IMF, began a macro economic
restructuring program. Government transfers to the transport sector
decreased significantly. This risk was correctly identified at appraisal but
was discounted because of the belief that the MTOP has sufficient reserves to
cushion any reduction in transfers. This was not the case, and payments due
to contractors lagged, in some cases, more than a year. The result was that



contractors slowed down or stopped work. The lag in transfer of funds
caused the second extension of the loan closing to the actual closing date of
December 31, 1990.
5.4   There were also changes due to design problems. The Bank mission
in October 1985 noted that there were serious problems with the proposed
reconstruction of Route 1-the most frequently used road in Uruguay. The
road was designed in the 1940s to contemporary standards. However,
current standards for line-of-sight, corner radii, etc. made the existing
roadbed obsolete and a serious safety hazard. It is worth noting that during
project appraisal, the Bank failed to adequately analyze the Route 1
engineering proposal, and it was only when it was to be implemented that the
reconstruction proposal was found to be inadequate. The reconstruction of
Route 1 was put on hold until a design study of the alternatives was
completed. The delay of Route 1 resulted in a restructuring of the project.
Funds originally slated for Route 1 reconstruction (US$17.7 million in Jan.
1983) were reallocated to Feeder Roads, traffic safety and design studies for
railroad and port improvements. Route 1 reconstruction was moved to the
follow-on project, Transport I (Ln. 3021-UR) signed in 1989. During the
reallocation, the AFE accounting system component was dropped since AFE
was to be reorganized. Unfortunately, no economic analysis was done during
the project restructuring on the effect of dropping Route 1 and adding or
expanding other sub-components.
5.5   Further delays in calling for bids, combined with existing budget
restrictions, slowed civil works execution in 1989 and 1990 and led to a
number of contracts remaining uncompleted at the time of loan closing.
Thus, US$3.03 million of the US$45.00 million loan was cancelled.
Financing for these uncompleted contracts was eventually provided under the
follow-on Transport I Project.
5.6   Project Costs. The actual cost of the project was US$101.8 million
against the estimated cost at appraisal of US$137.0 million (see Table 3 for
details). One of the primary reasons for the lower project costs was that the
repeated devaluations of the Np. (New Uruguayan Peso) were not wholly
counteracted by price increases. At the time of appraisal (February 1982),
the Np. was at 12.73 to the US dollar. When the project closed (December
1990), the Np. was at 1,594 to the US dollar, a 12,522% increase.
Consumer prices over the same period increased 11,430%. This meant local
project costs, in US dollar terms, became cheaper.
5.7   A second reason the project cost dropped was the highly competitive
bid process. There was significant excess capacity in the road construction
industry of Uruguay. Competition among contractors fostered aggressive
bids, resulting in substantial reductions in costs. As a result of the decrease
in project costs, it was no longer necessary to seek cofinancing. An
amendment to the Loan Agreement in May 1984 deleted the cofinancing
requirement. Because of the low bids and the restructuring of the project



- 6 -
(para. 5.4), substantial savings were achieved in the Civil Works, which at a
cost of US$37.2 million were completed at 56% of the originally estimated
US$65.9 million. On the other hand, the Feeder Roads cost US$59.4
million, 49% over the estimated cost of US$40.0 million due to the
substantial increase in the Feeder Roads Program. The net result of the
changes in costs and project scope was that the final project cost was
US$101.8 million, 74% of the appraised US$137.0 million.
5.8 Disbursements. The loan disbursement began slowly. In the first
year, only US$0.7 million was disbursed against US$5.0 million forecast (see
Table 4 for details). By the original loan closing date of December 31,
1987, only US$18.9 million (42%) had been disbursed. There were
significant lags in disbursements because of the delays in contract approval,
delays in payments to contractors, and delays in government funds (para.
5.5). When the loan closed three years later in December 1990, US$41.97
million (93%) of the US$45.00 million loan had been disbursed. The
remaining US$3.03 million was cancelled.
5.9 Environment. Although the environmental impact was not addressed
in the Staff Appraisal Report since the project was appraised in 1982, the
follow-on project's Staff Appraisal Report from 1988 (Ln. 3021-UR) noted
that there were no adverse environmental effects from the road sector works.
The general nature of the project's civil works was upgrading existing
infrastructure rather than creating new infrastructure; thus, the environmental
changes were by nature limited.
6.    Project Results
6.1 Overview. The essential component of the civil works program were
comprised of: (a) road and bridge reconstruction works; (b) rehabilitation
works on the national highway network; (c) traffic safety works; and (d)
Feeder Roads Program. All were completed (except for Route 1), albeit with
lengthy delays, and at a total cost significantly lower than the appraised
estimate. The overall result of the program to strengthen sectoral planning as
well as the MTOP's and Vialidad's institutional capabilities is more difficult
to assess. The specific results were: (a) a railway study of restructuring
AFE and the subsequent reduction of operations; (b) port studies on how best
to strengthening the ports sub-sector, which became part of the Transport I
Project (Ln. 3021-UR); and (c) the MTOP established an annual investment
planning system for the transport sector. While some improvements have
taken place in the capabilities of the Government for sectoral planning and in
the MTOP's capacity for planning and investment, institutional development
was only partial due to the frequent changes in the sector priorities and in the
MTOP.
6.2 Economic Rate of Return. Economic evaluation was done for a little
over 94% of the actual project costs. This covered Category 1 Civil Works
and Category 3 Feeder Roads. The remaining project covering minor traffic



- 7 -
safety and technical assistance amounted to US$6.0 million and have
characteristics that do not lend themselves to economic evaluation. For this
same reason they were not evaluated in the Staff Appraisal Report. The
methodology used for the ex post evaluation of the project was the
application of HDM - m (Highway Development Model), calibrated to
Uruguayan conditions.
6.3  In the ex post analysis, Civil Works components gave an overall
economic rate of return (ERR) of 19.6%, which is higher than the 12%
commonly assumed to be the opportunity cost of capital in Uruguay. Table 5
details the overall results of the economic evaluation of Category I, and
Table 6 lists general characteristics of some typical roads. The individual
sub-projects were all economically feasible with ERRs ranging from 13% to
55 %. In the ex post evaluation of Feeder Roads (Table 7), the average ERR
was 13.1%. A note of caution, however; the ERRs are predicated on the
execution of satisfactory periodic maintenance, in particular resealing work,
which will need to be continually monitored in the coming years in order for
the benefits to be attained. The Transport Project I (Ln. 3021-UR) currently
under way should help ensure this supervision.
6.4   Impact. The overall impact of the project was medium to high. For
Civil Works there was a high impact; there were tangible improvements in
feeder roads, national bridges and roads (with the exception of Route 1), and
traffic safety. The Civil Works improved vehicle operating conditions and
thus reduced vehicle operating costs. High vehicle operating costs were
singled-out in the Staff Appraisal Report as a major problem of the transport
sector. Economically, the geographical spread of the Civil Works helped
strengthen local construction industries. For strengthening sector planning
and the MTOP's and Walidad's institutional capacities there was a medium
impact; essential studies were completed and a planning system for sector
investment was implemented but frequent changes in governments, personnel,
and sector priorities hampered institutional development.
7.    Sustainability
7.1   Provided that scheduled maintenance is carried out, the likelihood of
sustainability for the Civil Works component is high. At the least, the
structural improvements (e.g., bridges, illumination, road reconstruction) in
the feeder and national road networks will have long-term benefits. Recent
supervision reports from the Transport I Project indicate that road
maintenance is progressing well in many provinces but poorly in a few due a
system of fixed, per kilometer payments for maintenance that does not
adequately cover the costs of transporting materials to remote sites.
7.2   The likelihood of sustainability for sector institutional development is
low. Since the project closed, there have been more changes in the
management of MTOP as well as high staff turnover due to low wages.
Further, a new government will be elected in 1994, which historically has



- 8 -
meant sector management changes. However, some of the institutional gains
such as the MTOP's annual investment planning system were still in place as
of early-1994.
8.    Bank's Performance
8.1   Bank performance was less than adequate. In general, the Bank's role
in problem-solving was reactive rather than proactive. The Bank treated
project-delaying changes in priorities as faits accomplis, when in fact, the
documentation shows the Bank was given advanced notice that priorities were
being reevaluated and presumably could have had a greater role in
determining the outcome. The Bank's reactive role in implementation was
not from a lack of supervision. There were 13 supervision missions and 59
supervision staff weeks on the project. The problem with the supervision,
and perhaps the reason for the reactive role of the Bank, can be found in the
lack of staff continuity. During project implementation, there were no fewer
than six different Task Managers/Project Officers, four different Division
Chiefs and three restructuring of the Managing Division. This lack of staff
continuity no doubt affected the quality of Bank supervision.
8.2   The Staff Appraisal Report correctly identified the potential risks.
However, the report's conclusions that the risks were minimal-especially
regarding government transfers to the transport sector-proved incorrect.
The initial costs of the project were overestimated, which led to the
cancellation of cofinancing, and eventually to the financing of over 41 % of
the project cost from the Bank loan instead of 34% as foreseen at appraisal.
The original and actual financing plan of the project (in US$ millions) are
indicated below.
Bank      Cofinancing   MTOP   Intendencia    Total
Original     $45.0         $25.0      $47.0       $20.0      $137.0
Actual        $41.9         $0.0      $30.2       $29.7      $101.8
8.3   Lessons Learned. The first lesson learned is that greater attention
needs to be given to the macro economic environment in Uruguay as it
affects project costs. The cost estimates of this project and that of its
predecessor, the Second Highway Project, were off by 26% and 14%
respectively-in both cases, primarily due to changes in the exchange rate
vWs-a-vis inflation. It would appear that staff did not apply the lessons from
the Second Highway Project in preparing and appraising the Third Highway
Project. The result in both projects was that although overall costs dropped,
the Bank financed a greater share of the total project costs than originally
approved, and the Borrower paid commitment fees on a portion of the loan
that was never used. The experience gained from this project and its
predecessor suggest that in future projects in Uruguay, supervision missions
should periodically reassessing project costs, and if needed, cancel a portion



of the loan if there have been significant cost savings. This would be
beneficial for both the Bank and the Borrower.
8.4   The second lesson learned regards the restructuring of the project
after Route 1 was moved to the follow-on project (para. 5.4). Route 1
comprised 42% of the Bank loan. It would have been prudent to reduce the
scope of the project when Route 1 was removed from the loan. Instead, the
project became a catch-all for the road sector with various small scale works
added or expanded to use the funds originally slated for Route 1 with little
analysis of the work's economic merit. These changes caused delays and
extensions and perhaps worse, further taxed the already strained budget
allocations and institutional capacity of the Government.
8.5   The third lesson learned is that a lack of continuity in Bank
supervision staff has a negative impact of the quality of Bank supervision.
The staff turnover on this project was excessive and consequently the Bank
missed opportunities to provide input at several critical junctures (para. 8.1).
In the context of projects in Uruguay, this continuity is all the more
important in order to compensate for frequent turnover among Borrower
staff.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.1   Borrower's performance was substantially and adversely affected by
frequent changes in government, followed almost invariably by changes in
senior management and priorities and by a lack of fiscal resources due to
macro economic restructuring. The result was delayed decision-making,
inadequate funds, and a lack of continuity in the execution of the project.
10.   Bank-Borrower Relationship
10.1 Bank relationships with the government and the various agencies were
satisfactory. Even with the high turnover of staff in both the Bank and the
Borrower, relations remained cordial and open. It was largely on the
strength of the relationship that the project was as successful as it was,
notwithstanding Bank staff turnover and shifts in sector priorities. Had the
relationship been strained, support for the project on both sided would in all
likelihood have eroded.
11.   Consulting Services and Procurement of Goods
11.1  Technical assistance was provided primarily for strengthening the
MTOP's capabilities and included the training of key MTOP personnel.
Bank-approved procedures were used in hiring all consultants. Overall, the
consultants performed well, although absorption of technology transfer was
limited by the lack of continuity among Borrower staff. Supervision
consultants performed satisfactorily but could do little to avoid delays caused
by payment lags and bureaucratic changes.



- 10 -
11.2 Procurement of goods was limited and uneventful. As for civil
works, although Bank-approved procedures were used, there were often
delays in bid evaluation and in the negotiation of contracts.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1 The Staff Appraisal Report and the Legal Agreement provided the
framework for the supervision of the project. Quarterly progress reports
from the Borrower were received regularly, albeit with delays. The project
went through several changes of which a faithful record was found in the
supervision reports and the project files. However, neither the Bank's
supervision reports nor the Borrower's quarterly reports contained reliable
cost data. After completion of the project, the Borrower sent in June 1993 a
'Final Report' containing a brief overview of the project and cost data. The
data were the basis of the cost tables included in this report.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S
PERSPECTIVE
A copy of the PCR's Parts I and HI was sent to the Borrower. The
Borrower sent a letter on October 25, 1993 that noted the receipt and the
review of Parts I and HI of the PCR but offered no substantive comments or
text to be included in Part II. The Borrower did, however, send a "Final
Report" in June 1993 containing a brief overview and some cost data-but no
critique-on the project. The data were incorporated into Part III of the
PCR.
Given the number of changes in the government and executing
agencies during implementation, and given the number of intervening years,
a meaningful review of the project from the Borrower's perspective was
unlikely. Thus, the PCR was prepared without the Borrower contributing
Part II. This omission is permitted under Bank guidelines for PCRs more
than two years old.

(-) Note: Not available
(*) Note: The original SAR assumptions concerning the economic evaluation of these
sub-projects are not available. The actual costs resulted in smaller values than
originally estimated (Bridge Caballada, 62% of original SAR cost; Bridge Bellaco,
41%; and Bridge Potrero, 56%). Consequently, the real ERRs under the same
assumptions in the SAR would result in values even greater than the already
acceptable values in the SAR, which were, respectively, 25%, 25% and 16%.
