I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested the Bank to help finance
the first phase of a Rationalization and Modernization Program (RMP) for the
cotton textile manufacturing operations of Sumerbank (SB), which is one of the
most important State Economic Enterprises (SEE) in the country and which is
also active in the manufacture of wool textiles, leather, chemicals, ceramics,
in the marketing of its products, and in banking. SB, with total employment
of over 40,000 (in its wholly owned entities alone) and annual net sales of
about TL 30 billion, consists of 30 wholly owned and seven majority owned
(over 80%) companies and holds numerous minority interests in different
branches of industries.
1.02      SB owns all public sector cotton textile operations in Turkey,
consisting of 13 fully and 6 majority owned plants, located throughout the
country (Maps IBRD 14576/7). SB's cotton textile operations contribute
about 60% of SB's sales, account for between 15% and 20% of the Turkish
cotton teltile industry's production capacity, and produce annually about 200
million m of cotton fabric (mostly dyed or printed, mass-produced fabrics
consumed in rural areas and by the urban poor).
1.03      Capacity utilization, productivity and product quality in SB's cotton
textile operations has been declining over the past years, resulting in poor
profitability. To a large extent these growing problems have been caused
by the well-known deficiencies inherent in the Turkish SEE system. Therefore,
to rehabilitate its operations, and to make them again viable, SB will under-
take, in addition to the physical rehabilitation of plants, action programs
that are to implement reorganization, reorient its operational and marketing
philosophy, and improve staffing and management systems.
1.04      A feasibility study, executed by GHERZI Textile Organization (GHERZI)
of Switzerland, in close cooperation with SB and the Bank, recommended the RMP
which would increase SB's effective production capacity of cotton fabric from
the present 207 million m  (1979) to about 300 million m  by 1986.  The pro-
posed Sumerbank Cotton Textile Rationalization Project (the Project) will cover
the first phase of the investments under the RMP to 1983 2and will increase SB's
effective cotton textile capacity to about 250 million m . This will be
achieved through (i) overdue rehabilitation measures (provision of spare parts
and machine assemblies); (ii) replacement or modernization of obsolete machin-
ery and equipment; (iii) addition of a garment plant (employment generation
and export potential); and (iv) organizational, operational and managerial
improvements to be supported through the provision of technical assistance.
1.05      The Project is to help modernize, rationalize and rehabilitate, in a
comprehensive and well controlled way, the entire public sector cotton textile
industry to restore production levels already achieved in the early 1970s, and
to make it competitive domestically as well as internationally. It is in line
with Turkey's attempts to reorganize and rehabilitate the State Economic
Enterprise System along sound business principles as spelled out under the
fourth Five Year Plan (1979 to 1983) and the Economic Policy Package of
January 25, 1980.



1.06      Total financing required for the Project, including working capital
and financial charges during construction are estimated at US$150.5 million,
of which US$104.0 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed IBRD
loan of US$83 million 1/ will cover 94% of the estimated foreign exchange
requirements for fixed assets, including technical assistance but excluding
US$2.3 million local taxes, and represents 56% of the Project's total finan-
cing needs including additional working capital requirements for existing
operations. Foreign exchange requirements for working capital and interest
during construction (US$18.0 million equivalent or 12% of total financing)
will be met by SB's own export receipts. The local costs (US$44.5 million) 2/
are proposed to be met 40% by equity, and 60% through internal cash generation.
1.07      The Bank has previously been involved in the Turkish cotton textile
subsector in various ways. In the public sector this included two SB projects
(Erzincan and Karaman Maras) costing together US$24 million equivalent,
partly financed from the proceeds of a loan (1024-TU of 6/28/1974) to Devlet
Yatirim Bankasi O.A. (DYB). To date these two projects have only shown a
limited success. The second loan to DYB (1379-TU of 3/23/1977) is financing
two SB cotton textile projects (Izmir Printing and Izmir Garments) costing
about US$15 million; these two projects have been modified recently within the
framework of the RMP preparation and will benefit from technical assistance
under the proposed Project. In the private sector, loans to Turkiye Sinai
Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) have contributed about US$30 million since 1971.
Under loans 1734/55-TU of 9/17/1979 the Bank extended creditlines of US$80
million to TSKB and Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi A.O. (SYKB) to modernize
the private textile sector through provision of technical assistance, training,
institution building, modernization of existing and addition of new capacity.
Finally, IFC has contributed about US$11 million to the textile sector and has
recently approved another project (MENSUCAT Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.).
1.08      Missions consisting of Messrs. Duvigneau (Chief), Sandig, Suzuki,
de Bruyn Kops of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. Makowitzki
(Consultant) visited Turkey in September and November/December 1979 to
appraise the Project. A post-appraisal mission visited Turkey in March 1980
to confirm with SB's new management various understandings previously reached.
II. THE TURKISH TEXTILE INDUSTRY
A.   Economic Background
2.01      Over the last decade (1967-78), the Turkish economy has grown
at 6% per year, and has undergone marked transformation. As a result of
1/   Including US$1.0 million from Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
Funds (P-013/018-TU).
2/   Including US$19.8 million equivalent for working capital for existing
operations.

strong Government incentives, supplemented by protection against competition
from imports, the share of industry in GDP increased from 14% in 1962 to 23%
in 1978, while the share of agriculture declined from 34% to 21%. Reflecting
a gradual structural change, the share of consumer goods in industrial output
declined from 57% to 42% during 1967-78, with that of intermediates and
capital goods rising from 43% to 58%. However, the economic progress has
been punctuated (in 1958, 1970 and 1977) by severe balance of payments crises,
mainly because of the country's over-emphasis on import substitution, and an
inability to develop a strong export base.
2.02      The Government has generally been involved in basic industries where
private capital has hesitated to enter because of long gestation periods,
heavy capital requirements, or high risks. While the primary purpose of
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) is production, they have also been charged
with social goals, such as the development of backward regions, provision of
employment and maintenance of price stability, which all have contributed to
their generally poor financial performance. Low salaries, political pressures
and otherwise limited autonomy, and overstaffing have affected the quality
of their management and operating efficiency. The private sector has invested
mainly in profitable consumer goods and durables, and has only recently
entered into intermediate and capital goods production. It carried out 57%
of industrial investment during the last decade and now accounts for about
50% of value added in manufacturing. However, as a result of the recent eco-
nomic crisis, private manufacturing investment stagnated from 1974 to 1977
and fell 11% in real terms in 1978.
2.03      Industry in Turkey faces several problems.  The immediate ones
are low capacity utilization, low productivity, and the low level and rate
of growth of manufactured exports. SEEs have deliberately been oriented
towards the domestic market. Export incentives have not been sufficient to
outweigh the advantages of effective industrial protection which, in a climate
of growing domestic demand, have made domestic sales more profitable than
exports. Therefore, also the private sector has been concentrating on the
local market. In 1977, exports accounted for only 7% of the gross output of
the manufacturing sector, and about 75% of these exports were concentrated in
textiles, leather products and processed goods.
2.04      The immediate objective in the industrial sector must be to improve
the utilization of existing capacity. Over the longer term, substantial
improvements in structure, efficiency and international competitiveness will
be needed in many of the existing industries, particularly in the SEEs, to
enable them to use resources effectively and compete successfully at home,
as well as provide some of the thrust for increased exports. The proposed
Project fits well into this strategy as it aims at increasing capacity
utilization, efficiency, productivity and product quality of SB's cotton
textile operations through a program of rationalization, modernization and
technical assistance.
B.   The Textile Industry
2.05      Turkey, as the sixth largest producer and the third largest exporter
of cotton in the world, has a good raw material base for expansion of its
textile industry. At present, it produces about 500,000 tons of cotton per



- 4 -
year, of which almost 60% is locally processed into textiles. However,
Turkey's production of other fibers has been lagging behind demand and it
presently imports annually 10% (10,000 tons) of its artificial and synthetic
fiber requirements and 9% (5,400 tons) of its woolen consumption.
2.06      After food processing, textiles is the largest manufacturing in-
dustry in Turkey. The organized textile industry's 1/ value of production,
employment, investment, exports and its respective shares in manufacturing
industry are shown below.

Investment in the organized sector, fueled by generous incentives (certifi-
cates of encouragement) and growing domestic and export markets, reached
a peak of TL 19.0 billion in 1974 (1978 prices), when it accounted for 28%
of total manufacturing investment. It has since tapered off because of
excess capacity in spinning and adverse economic developments in the country.
Capital intensity also increased dramatically, reflecting the heavy investment
in modern equipment, particularly in spinning. One of the most striking
developments in the textile industry has been the rapid growth of exports
(US$321.6 million in 1978), from only 4% of manufacturing exports in 1967 to
52% in 1978 (para 2.17).
2.07      The industry's growth has been realized through an increasing
number of large, fully integrated units. Large enterprises (here defined as
employing 200 or more workers), while representing 13% of the number of firms,
1/   Defined as establishments employing 10 or more workers.



-5-
account for 73% of employment in the organized sector. The nature and degree
of integration (spinning, weaving and finishing) of production units vary
widely. The number of large and fully integrated units, which account for
an estimated 20-25% of employment in the textile sector, are increasing.
The organized garment sector has also been growing fast, from 25 registered
establishments in 1963 to about 600 at the present time, although large firms
in the garment industry are very few and their total employment does not
exceed 5,000. About one half of the textile enterprises in the organized
sector are located in the Istanbul area.
2.08      In the unorganized textile sector there are an estimated 8,000 small
establishments, employing about 100,000 persons, of which 60% are engaged in
garment making and knitting activities. The balance (40%) consists mostly of
small weavers with obsolete equipment.
2.09      The cotton textile industry accounts for the bulk of textile produc-
tion, with about 83% of total volume output. In the organized cotton segment,
an estimated 155,000 workers are employed in spinning, weaving and finishing,
and about 25,000 in the garments/making-up and knitting segments. The output
of the cotton segment, mainly geared towards the domestic market, has been
growing at an average of 5% per year during 1970-78. Knitting output has been
growing at an even faster rate, estimated at around 17% per year. The woolen
segment, including carpets, accounts for 17% of production and employs an
estimated 20,000 workers. Although the Turkish consumption of wool has been
relatively stagnant, the wool sector has been growing at 6-7% a year, using an
increasing percentage of man-made fibers to meet the highly income-elastic
demand for worsted fabrics.
2.10      Although the public sector, under SB's management, pioneered -
starting in the early 1930's - the large integrated production units in the
Turkish textile industry, its role has gradually diminished and about 80% of
the industry is now in private hands. SB, in the late 1970s, accounts for 19%
of investment in the textile sector, 14% of production, 17% of value added and
13% of employment. Unlike the private sector counterparts, SB sells most of
its textile production through its own retail network to low income groups in
urban and rural areas. Consequently, enhanced by the present situation of
undersupply of textiles in Turkey (para 3.01), there is little competition
between SB and the private sector. The organization and performance of SB
cotton textile operations are further described in Chapter IV.
C.   Textile Consumption
2.11      Textile consumption in Turkey, at 7.7 kg per capita in 1978, is
considerably higher than in countries with a comparable per capita income
while much lower than in industrialized countries (Annex 2-1 and Project File,
Item K).  The relatively high consumption is mostly due to the existence of
a sizeable domestic textile industry based on local cotton and a climate
with a considerable temperature range.  The consumption of cotton fibers
is 59% of total fiber requirements, while synthetic fibers account for 30%,
and wool and cellulosic fibers for the remaining 11%.  But while cotton and
wool consumption grew by 4% and 2% per year in the 1970's, the annual increase



-6-
for synthetics was 25%. However, the increase for synthetics consumption
is expected to slow down because of import tariffs and high domestic prices
produced by a protected local industry of limited capacity.
D.   The Cotton Textile Industry
2.12      The rapid expansion of the private organized cotton sector since
1970 has been accompanied by increases in labor productivity of about 14% per
year. This is higher than for manufacturing as a whole and reflects a heavy
program of investment in modern textile equipment, particularly in spinning.
Individual segments of the industry (spinning, weaving, finishing) differ
greatly in structure and degree of sophistication and efficiency, and are
discussed in some detail below.
2.13      In Spinning, the industry recently underwent a program of rapid
expansion and modernization in which the number of spindles more than doubled
from 1.3 to 3.0 million, between 1972 and 1977 when capacity stabilized (Annex
2-2). But actual yarn production in 1978 amounted to only about 288,000 tons,
of which 81,000 tons were exported, as compared with an available capacity
of about 427,000 tons, reflecting a low capacity utilization rate of 67%.
Capacity utilization has been constrained by: (i) the limited domestic
weaving capacity, which can only absorb about 60% of yarn output at full
capacity; (ii) import restrictions imposed by the EEC, to which about 90% of
Turkish yarn exports go; (iii) poor planning and control of production; and
more recently (iv) power shortages which may have accounted for 10-20% of
underutilization in 1979. Despite its modern vintage, labor productivity in
spinning in Turkey ranges from 42% to 64% of European standards. A large
portion of this difference could be corrected without additional investments
through improved maintenance, job scheduling, working methods and load assign-
ments, with the result of increased yarn output estimated at 10-15%.
2.14      Turkey's cotton weaving capacity is concentrated in 40-50, mostly
integrated, mills. Available capacity is now largely being utilized and
most of tye fabrics output is consumed locally.  C pacity increased from 960
million m in 1972 to an estimated 1,190 million m in 1979, mainly because
of the replacement of narrow looms by wider and faster automatic looms (Annex
2-2). Still more new looms are required to replace worn-out equipment (esti-
mated to be 12-18% of capacity) to narrow the present imbalance with available
spinning capacity in the country and to meet the growth of demand (para 3.03).
Labor productivity in Turkish weaving plants ranges from only 35% to 57% of
their European counterparts. A large portion of this difference would be
correctible without additional investment through improved operations with
the result of increased weaving output of about 20%.
2.15      Despite excess capacity for the dyeing, printing and finishing seg-
ment as a whole, there are regional shortages of capacity for certain types
of fabrics. This segment is dominated by the private organized sector which
operates nearly 85% of installed capacity, mostly as a service industry that
finishes fabrics on commission basis. In 1976, production of this segment was
about 910 million linear meters, at a capacity utilization of 70% (Annex 2-2).
It is estimated that about 25-30% of existing dyeing equipment and possibly
70% of printing equipment are obsolete.



- 7 -
2.16      The garment/making-up industry has mostly modern equipment, but its
labor productivity is only some 40% of European standards (except for a few
firms with technical assistance from foreign marketing partners). This is
mostly due to uneconomically short production runs, unsuitably cramped premises,
poor plant layout, organization and work methods. Cost control is practically
nonexistent and there is, therefore, scope for considerable improvement in
performance in areas of industrial engineering and production management.
E.   Exports
2.17      Production and marketing of Turkish textiles, with the recent
exception of yarn, has traditionally been geared to the local market, which
consumes about 92% of total production. This domestic orientation is caused
by: (i) a relatively inefficient textile industry (largely prompted by the
severe restrictions of textile imports); (ii) trade restrictions imposed by
the EEC, the main trading partner for Turkish textiles; and (iii) a domestic
market which is partly undersupplied, but at the same time of sufficient size
to sustain a sizeable local textile industry. Until recently, only yarn
exports were marginally profitable since production tax on yarn (35% of
production cost) is not levied on exported yarn; that exemption is not applic-
able to exported fabrics or garments. Yarn exports (valued at US$180 million
in 1978) have increased four-fold since 1970, and as noted before, in 1978,
81,000 tons, representing about 28% of yarn production, were exported. This
growth pattern is not expected to continue, largely on account of import
restriction imposed by the EEC.
2.18      The export of cotton woven fabrics, 2,700 tons in 1978, of which
about one-third were grey fabrics, have been fluctuating in the 1970's at low
levels. In 1978 only 1.5% of total Turkish fabric production was exported.
Exports of woven and knitted garments and made-up goods on the other hand,
have been developing quickly and grew from a very small base in the early
1970's to 5,800 tons in 1978, or US$58 million. This represents about 15% of
the Turkish garment output and about 18% of the textile sector's export value.
About 80% of total Turkish textile exports go to the EEC where the share of
imports from Turkey ranges from 22% for yarn to about 1% for fabrics and
garments, the remaining 20% being distributed widely. Turkey's share of the
neighboring Middle Eastern textile markets is small because of competitive
local industry. The capability to export garments has been constrained by
inadequate styling, marketing, a lack of accessories and a limited range and
quality of local fabrics of acceptable prices, administrative difficulties in
Turkey in importing foreign fabrics for re-export, and high prices for fabrics
using non-cotton fibers.

F.   Development Strategy for the Textile Sector
2.19      The Fourth Five Year Plan (1979-83) (Project File, Item J) emphasizes
renewal and rehabilitation of existing facilities and expansion of capacity,
mainly to debottleneck and balance the various segments in the industry. For
SB the need for modernization, reorganization and specialization of production
of its textile operations is stressed; the proposed Project meets these
objectives. Investment in spinning in both the public and private sectors
aiming at further capacity expansion will be discouraged, until the sector
approaches full capacity utilization. On the other hand, investment in
intermediate goods and auxiliary materials used as inputs in garments and
knitting, now in short supply, will be fostered. Local production of textile
equipment (mostly spare parts) will also be promoted. Finally, exports of
finished goods, such as made-up articles, woven and knitted goods, carpets,
will be supported. Though the quantitative targets are high, the Plan's
objectives are reasonable and point in the right direction.
2.20      Sector performance can be improved through:  (a) modernization in
selected segments (especially dyeing, printing and finishing where there is
substantial obsolete equipment), and through (b) increased efficiency of the
productive facilities which can be furthered by the extension of technical
assistance and training. The industry's major objectives should be (i) to
continue to expand exports because of the foreign exchange earned, the stimu-
lating effect in communicating export standards of price and quality to the
rest of the industry, and because the most promising exporting sector (gar-
ments) will expand urban employment; and (ii) to meet growing domestic
demand.
III. THE MARKET AND MARKETING OF COTTON TEXTILES IN TURKEY
A.   Past Supply and Consumption of Cotton Textiles
3.01      Since 1970, domestic consumption of cotton fabrics including cotton
blends, has been rising it an average annual rate of 4.5%, or 2% on a per
capita basis from 21.3 m in 1970 to 23.4 m in 1978. This implies an income
demand elasticity of 0.5 1/ as per capita income grew by 4.1% per year. Com-
paring the growth of per capita income in Turkey with the actual textile con-
sumption, it appears that in recent years the growth of textile demand has
been faster than increases in production (Annex 3-1). The stagnating domestic
supply of cotton fabrics is the result of a slowdown of expansion in weaving
capacity and the import restrictions on textiles in Turkey. Therefore, based
on recent consumption trends, it is estimated thit, in 1978, unsatisfied demand
exceeded supply of fabrics by about 60 million m or 6% of domestic demand
(para 3.02). Production, exports and consumption for cotton yarn and woven
fabrics are shown below:
1/   0.6 for 1970-77:  due to supply constraints, 1978 figure is lower.

Little information is available on garment and made up goods production

(Project File, Item L).

/a   Including requirements for weaving of fabric and for knitting.
/b   Including fabric requirements for garment exports (annual growth rate
7%); direct woven fabric export to grow at only 3% annually.
3.03      Demand for cotton woven fabrics is estimated to increase by 3.3%
per year until 1985, and it is expected that the situation of undersupply of
textiles in Turkey will continue through the forecast period. Domestic demand
projections are based on an average per capita income growth of 2% per year
(Bank estimates), a population growth rate of 2.5% per year, and an income
elasticity of 0.5. This is lower than the average 0.7 for all developing
countries, but justified as Turkish consumption level is higher. The produc-
tion estimates for fabrics are based on the assumption that existing large
private weaving mills will operate at about 80% of capacity during 1979-81 due
to power shortages and thereafter at a rate of 95%. For 1981-85, production
is expected to increase by an additional 1% per year as a result of increases



- 11 -
in labor productivity. It is further assumed that no expansion of capacity
will occur during 1980-81 due to foreign exchange constraints and adverse
economic conditions, and that only investment for replacement of obsolete
machinery will take place.  Thereafter weaving capacity2in the organized
private sector is projected to increase by 40 million m per year. Production
from the proposed Project is included in the estimates. The projections show
that, unless a significant further investment in weaving occurs, by 1985   2
demand for cotton fabrics will exceed domestic supply by about 76 million m
or 6% of domestic demand.
3.04      Domestic demand for yarn, including cotton blends, is expected to
increase by 4.3% per year, as a function of yarn requirements for weaving and
knitting. Knitting is expected to increase its share in yarn consumption from
10% in 1978 to 16% in 1985, as a result of a continued high demand for knitted
goods. This demand would absorb expected increases in yarn production result-
ing from improved efficiency and capacity utilization (increase to 391,000
tons in 1985 without corresponding spinning capacity expansion, assuming that
capacity utilization will increase to 92% by 1985). Present spinning capacity
should, therefore, be sufficient to meet the yarn requirements for the domestic
market during 1980-85. There is need, however, for additional capacity in
combed yarns, double yarns and sewing thread.
3.05      The projections of textile exports for the near future are dominated
on the one hand by trade restrictions in Turkey's principal market area (EEC),
especially for yarn and to a lesser extent for garments and made up goods, and
on the other hand by the growing domestic demand, particularly for woven
fabrics. Furthermore, Turkish textile producers need to upgrade efficiency
and quality to become competitive with other major textile exporters. Given
these constraints it seems, therefore, that the expectations embodied in the
Fourth Five Year Plan (1979-83), that textile exports can nearly be tripled by
1983, are unrealistic.
3.06      Garment production in the organized sector is expected to grow by
10% per year on account of economies of scale, relatively small investment
requirements and favorable export prospects. As a result the organized sector
penetration of the domestic garment market is expected to increase from presently
11% (para. 3.01) to about 16% in 1985. Garments and made up goods hold out
the main promise for increasing exports, since Turkey's lower wages give it a
clear advantage over developed countries, as its production technology is
relatively labor intensive and provided that productivity can be improved.
Furthermore, Turkey's proximity to Europe allows transit times of only 2-3
days and at 5-10% of total production costs. A Government sanctioned Exporters
Union has been established recently to assist garment manufacturers in quality
control, production management and export marketing. Greater availability of
a wider selection of fabrics and accessory inputs would further facilitate
export expansion. On the basis of these expectations, cotton garments (woven
and knitted) and made up goods are estimated to grow by 7.2% per year during
1978-85 (Project File, Item M), i.e. to about 9,200 tons by 1985. In recogni-
tion of continuing import restrictions in the EEC and a limited potential for
trade-expansion in other export markets it is estimated that yarn exports



- 12 -
would only grow by 2.5% annually. Fabric production will remain geared to the
local market to fulfill as far as possible domestic demand, and only a 3%
annual export growth rate has been assumed for direct woven fabric exports
despite the low base.
3.07      Under the proposed rationalization and modernization Project,
SB's share in Turkish cotton textile production is expected to remain stable,
i.e. at 16% for spinning and 19% for weaving.   No significant increase in
SB's spinning and weaving capacity will take place under the Project. However,
due to an improvement in the utilization of existing capacities from about 50%
to 70% and an increase in labor productivity by about 35%, yarn production
will rise from 41,000 tons in 1979 to 52,000 tons in 1984.2 Likewise, production
of cotton woven fabric will rise from 207 to 250 million m in the same period.
Given the general Turkish textile supply deficit and SB's improved product
quality to be attained under the Project, SB should have little difficulty to
market this increase in production at a level already substantially reached in
the early 1970s.
C.   Supply of Raw Cotton
3.08      Turkish supply of raw cotton should be more than sufficient to meet
the requirements of the domestic textile industry. Cotton production, which
grew annually by 3.5% on average since the early 1960's, is expected to grow
by 3% per year from 495,000 tons in 1978 to 609,000 tons in 1985. This, after
the requirements for cotton textile production have been met, would leave an
estimated export surplus of 220,000 tons of cotton in 1985. Such production
increase should be achievable as already in 1975 a cotton production of
598,000 tons was realized. Also, international price developments for cotton
appear to be attractive for domestic growers to increase production. Further-
more, the Turkish Government seems determined to use its raw cotton for domes-
tic manufacturing rather than export. Domestic use of cotton is encouraged
through an export levy on cotton ranging from TL 36 to TL 41 per kg. The
domestic supply of man-made fibers is expected to be constrained for the next
few years by a high priced domestic industry of limited capacity and import
restrictions on raw materials and finished fibers.
D.   Marketing of Cotton Textiles
3.09      Fabrics produced by private sector firms generally move from the
factory to the market through large wholesalers and small regional wholesalers.
Some 20-25 large wholesalers, located in Istanbul, function as first line
intermediates and keep in close contact with the design and production planning
units of the mills, thereby effectively performing the marketing function for
the manufacturer. Furthermore, the large wholesalers are in a strong financial
position and finance the working capital needs of the manufacturer. The large
wholesalers sell the fabrics to small regional wholesalers, with an average
markup of 12%, which in turn apply the same level of mark-up. The mark-up at
the retail level is about 20-25%, indicating an overall mark-up of over 40%,
as compared to one of 10-15% for SB's products. Exports of yarn are usually
handled by agents and only in a few instances do Turkish textile firms have
their own office or representative in the different EEC countries.



- 13 -
3.10      Textile sales are concentrated in the urban areas, and even more so
for the more expensive fabrics produced by the private sector. Three large
cities -- Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, with 20% of the population -- account
for 36% of total textile sales, and there are indications that the concentra-
tion is increasing. As part of the proposed Project, SB, initially assisted
by consultants (para 5.11), will closely monitor evolving market trends to
assess these buying patterns and to respond with an appropriate product mix as
a basis for rationalization of SB's cotton textile production.
E.   Pricing
3.11      There are no price controls on textiles produced by the private
sector nor, at least in theory, on products of the public sector. But,
until recently, prices for SB textile products were subject to survey and
unofficial control by the Ministry of Industry and Technology, and there was
strong political pressure on SB not to raise its prices above levels 10-15%
below private sector prices. In a recent major policy shift, however, the
Turkish Government has decided that in future the Board of Directors of
the SEE's, including SB, will set their own prices depending on market condi-
tions, so as to generate enough profit, not only to cover their production
costs, but also help contribute to their investment expenditures. Export
prices for yarn are determined by Export Unions, according to European market
prices. Exports are encouraged through a set of export incentives, including
export tax rebates, as a percentage varying with export earnings. At present,
given the attractiveness of the local market and supply constraints, the most
important incentive is an export retention scheme by which 50% of foreign
exchange earnings by the exporting mill are retained to meet their operational
import requirements.
IV. THE COMPANY
A.   Sumerbank - Holding Company (The Beneficiary)
1.   History, Objectives and Role of Sumerbank
4.01      SB was founded in 1933 as one of the first SEEs in Turkey comprising
banking, industrial manufacturing and the marketing of its products. SB's
main emphasis has always focused on textile manufacture, cotton as well as wool.
Today textiles account for about 80% of SB's total sales revenues and for
about 15% to 20% of total Turkish textile production. SB's cotton textile
operations are discussed in detail in Section B of this chapter.
4.02      The other manufacturing operations of SB (Map IBRD 14576)--leather,
leather products; building materials (cement, bricks, tiles, and hardboard);
ceramics, refractories; chemicals (dye stuff, tanning products); vegetable oil--
have had less impact on the Turkish economy. Likewise, banking (36 branches
throughout Turkey) is comparatively small in the national context and serves
essentially to provide (i) banking facilities to SB personnel and the



- 14 -
population in low density rural areas and (ii) low costs credits to SB manufac-
turing facilities. SB's sales division Alim ve Satim Muessesse (ASM), with
23 warehouses and about 430 retail shops throughout Turkey (Map IBRD 14577),
was established to sell SB's consumer products but is now also intended to
include retailing of consumer goods purchased from outside firms.
4.03      SB has to satisfy a number of sometimes conflicting objectives
(paras 2.02 and 2.10). In addition to profit-maximization, it is called upon
to (i) provide mass-consumption fabrics to the rural and urban poor throughout
Turkey; (ii) stabilize prices in the domestic market; (iii) generate employment,
particularly in less-developed regions; and (iv) train textile industry
personnel beyond its own requirements. These conflicting objectives have
tended to exacerbate management problems of this diversified industrial
concern and have made performance more difficult to assess.
2.   Organization and Management
4.04      SB, a 100% government owned public sector enterprise, operates under
the control of the Ministry of Industry and is subject to laws and regulations
applicable to SEEs. SB's activities and financial position are reviewed and
audited by the High Control Board which reports directly to parliament.
SB's investment plans and activities are approved annually by the Ministry of
Industry and the State Planning Organization (SPO) in consultation with the
State Planning Council (representatives of various government agencies and
Ministries of Finance and Industry) in accordance with the Government's budget
constraints, development priorities, and other policies.
4.05      SB is headed by a six-member Board of Directors comprising the
General Director, two Deputy Directors and representatives of the Ministry of
Industry, the Ministry of Finance and labor. The Board has limited policy
making functions; it essentially is the operational decision making organ of
SB, meeting weekly. Through its headquarter's organization (Annex 4-1) in
Ankara, the Board controls operational units throughout Turkey. Manufacturing
entities, as well as ASM, are legal entities called establishments. Annex 4-2
shows the organization of a typical cotton textile plant and Annex 4-3 that of
ASM.
4.06      SB management, both at headquarters and in the plants, was changed
in December 1979. The new General Director of SB is Mr. Suku Akgungor,
a capable administrator with a financial background, and formerly the General
Manager of DYB. The new management fully supports the Project and its con-
cepts and strives to provide continuity in finalizing Project preparation and
in early Project implementation.
4.07      The performance of SEEs including SB has increasingly suffered from
a number of deficiencies inherent in the Turkish SEE system; the most important
of which are: (i) frequent top management changes and their disruptive
effects on operations and investments (para 4.22); (ii) inadequate management
compensation and incentives systems in comparison with the private sector
(paras 4.23 to 4.25); (iii) overstaffing coupled with relatively generous
wages and lack of adequate incentive systems (paras 4.24, 4.25); (iv) an



- 15 -
overly centralized organization and a lack of clearcut definitions of respon-
sibility and authority (para 4.18); (v) Government's deliberate policy of
keeping prices low (paras 4.39 and 4.40); and (vi) a rigid, cumbersome and
time-consuming annual investment approval system (Project File, Item N), as
well as misallocations of scarce financial resources and delays in execution
of investments.
4.08      The new Government, which has been considering a number of ways
to correct these problems, has recently decided, as a first step, that SEEs
will be freed from Government intervention in pricing decisions. At the same
time, they will also gradually lose their privileged access to the Treasury
or the Central Bank for funding of their investment programs or for covering
their deficits. It is hoped that these new policies will eventually also lead
to increased autonomy of SEEs in investment and employment policies, as well
as personnel compensation and incentive systems. The Bank will continue to
monitor the developments of SEE reforms.
3.   Financial Structure and Performance

company is given in Annex 4-4, and key financial data is summarized in the

owning more than 80% of outstanding shares of these companies.
/b   Due to the inadequate consolidation practices of financial statements
and resulting double counting of intercompany accounts, sales figures are
considerably overstated. The net sales are estimated to be approximately
60% of these amounts. The majority of intercompany transfers occurs
between individual plants and ASM.
/c   Including interest expenses incurred.

4.10       Sumerbank's sales in value terms have increased by about 5.7 times
between 1973-79. This increase, however, is largely on account of rising
prices, since production has been stagnant despite the substantial additions
to production capacities. As a result, net profit as % of sales has decreased
from 2.6% in 1973 to zero in 1976, but has since recovered to 3.5% in 1979.
Similarly, cash generation was barely sufficient to service debt in 1975 and
1976 on account of deteriorations in the Company's financial performance and
structure. Sumerbank's debt/equity ratio has changed from 25/75 in 1973 to
52/48 in 1978, mainly due to increasing long-term liabilities vis-a-vis the
Treasury and the Central Bank. At the same time, the current ratio has
fallen from 1.7 to 1.1, since a large portion of SB's investments were
financed by short-term debt.
4.11      To partly correct this situation and to improve Sumerbank's finan-
cial structure, the Government has, in December 1979, increased the nominal
capital of SB from TL 2.25 billion to TL 8.0 billion. Moreover the Treasury
has converted approximately TL 4.6 billion of outstanding SB debt to the
Treasury into paid-up capital as of December 31, 1979. This has resulted in
a marked improvement of current ratio, debt/equity ratio and debt service
coverage. Of this amount, SB has allocated TL 2.49 billion in the aggregate
to its cotton textile plants which already held TL 1.2 billion of paid-up
capital (para 4.45).
4.12      A grouping of SB's net profit between 1973-78 for its different
operations is shown in the table below, with detailed background in Annex 4-5:

4.13      With the exception of Woolen Textiles, all of SB's operations
have incurred losses occasionally during the past seven years. However, the
cotton textile operations (both, fully owned plants and joint stock companies)
have been the primary cause of SB's declining profitability; the major reasons
are explored in Section B of this chapter and appropriate measures are to be
taken under the Project to improve their profitability and cash generation.
4.14      While the Banking Division has shown substantial improvements in
its profitability over the last five years, it cannot, on its own be consid-
ered a significant source of local funds for the proposed Project. In the
financial sense it acts as a holding company, channeling the short-and long-
term debt from the Government to SB's establishments, mostly in the form of
intercompany receivables. Only 12% of its funding sources are customer
deposits; less than 10% of its assets are outside SB with other Bank customers.
4.15      Profitability and cash generation from SB's other non-cotton opera-
tions (with the exception of woolen textile operations) has been erratic.
To determine SB's operational prospects and future cash-flow situation,
financial projections were prepared for SB's non-cotton operations (Annex 4-5;
key assumptions in Project File, Item 0). Throughout the 1980-83 period, the
implementation period of the proposed Project, the net cash flow of the
non-cotton operations is expected to improve on account of the recent price
increases for SB products and an assumed future policy of regular price
adjustments in line with market- and production cost developments. However,
due to large increases in working capital needs during the highly inflationary
period, that cash generation would only satisfy the financing requirements of
non-cotton operations; thus it is not expected that SB non-cotton operations
could contribute significantly to the financial requirements of the proposed
Project.
4.16      In the past, any unforeseen cash shortfall or sudden replacement
investment could be financed through SB's easy access to low-interest Govern-
ment funds. Under the new economic policy towards SEEs, SB cannot count in
future on Government financing other than equity. Unless, therefore, equity
were to be forthcoming in a timely fashion to meet SB's additional financing
needs, SB investment projects presently planned or under execution might be
delayed for want of funds, including the proposed Project. Assurances were,
therefore, obtained that (i) the Government will meet the early cash equity
requirement of the Project according to an agreed timetable and (ii) SB will
not, during project execution, transfer profits, generated within cotton
textile operations, to SB non-cotton investments, unless the requirements of
the Project have been met. Provision by the Government of an initial portion
of cash equity (TL 400 million) is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
loan (para. 6.08).
4.17      A major recurring cost item for SB is the payment of retirement
severance benefits. Based on Turkish tax laws, only payments during a current
year are considered tax deductible; no reserves are being established for
subsequent years. However, due to substantial increases of the retirement
benefits during the last few years, future payments to beneficiaries will have
a substantial impact on the evolving financial situation of SB. The actual
payment in 1978 amounted to TL 292 million, while accumulated future payments
would amount to TL 3.3 billion as of December 31, 1978. To show the importance
of this item, SB will indicate in its financial statements, actual and pro-
jected payments for a rolling five year period.

B.   Sumerbank Cotton Textile Operations
1.   Organization and Reorganizational Concept
4.18      Sumerbank's cotton textile operations, 1/ consist of 13 fully owned
plants (establishments) and six joint-stock companies (JSCs) under SB manage-
ment (MAP IBRD 14575), and are controlled by SB headquarters, whose organiza-
tion chart is shown in Annex 4-1. Cotton textile operations have suffered
from the typical public sector problems (para 4.07) particularly given their
size, complexity and the fact that coordination and control functions at SB
headquarters are scattered throughout the headquarters organization. Moreover,
although on paper the production units are supposed to be quasi-autonomous
profit centers, they have to refer even minor issues to the headquarters for
decision, with resulting delays. Therefore, individual plant managements have
come to concern themselves almost exclusively with day-to-day operations and
hesitate to take responsibilities or initiatives for medium or long-term
improvement of operations.
4.19      To provide a more cohesive organization with better coordination
between units and a clearer understanding of responsibility and function,
consultants (provided under the project preparation facility--para 4.47)
recommended consolidating and reorganizing all the functions related to cotton
textile operations under a single organization. Initially, consideration was
given to forming a separate company under a separate law to take over textile
operations. However, this would have required lengthy legislative changes and
was moreover inconsistent with the general reforms being considered for the
state sector which envision creating sectoral holding companies. SB, there-
fore, decided to form a division within the company, to be responsible for
cotton textile operations, which would provide the needed consolidation but
not preclude later, more radical reorganization. This solution is a major
step towards improving the situation. The new Cotton Textile Division (CTD)
will have a structure comparable to the already existing Banking Division and
will bring under one umbrella all necessary functions and activities concerned
with cotton textile activities including certain marketing functions, finan-
cial planning and control as well as general administration. Under this setup,
CTD which will maintain separate accounts and will consolidate financial
statements of its 19 plants, will perform the centralized functions with
respect to investment planning, project implementation, production planning,
financial planning and control, marketing, centralized purchases, personnel
management and administration for SB's cotton textile operations. SB will
delegate to CTD all autonomy and authority necessary to carry out these
functions effectively under SB's governing laws and regulations. CTD, in
turn, will delegate to individual plants the powers necessary to permit them
to achieve planned production targets, reduce operating costs and improve
quality and mix of products in line with market demands. An outline of the
agreed organizational framework and CTD's and the plants' powers and
1/   The cotton textile operations are not a legal entity (establishment),
rather the individual cotton textile plants are.



- 19 -
responsibilities are given in Annex 4-6. Agreements were obtained that as
part of the technical assistance provided under the Project (para. 5.11)
details of CTD's and the plants' functions and powers satisfactory to the Bank
will be determined prior to December 31, 1980.
4.20      The new CTD which will control and direct all of SB's cotton textile
operations and will perform functions as described above was established at
SB headquarters in Ankara by resolution of SB's Board of Directors on March
14, 1980. The Managing Director of the new CTD is Mr. Fazli Emanetoglu, an
experienced textile engineer, who knows the plants of CTD well. He recently
participated as a member on SB's negotiation team. The Managing Director
reports directly to the General Director of SB; he will assure that the core
staff (marketing, financial and supervisory operational) will be recruited
for CTD under a scheme of contractual positions (para 4.24) and that such
staff will obtain initial training in a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
(para 5.15).
4.21      Individual Plants of CTD will retain their present legal status
as independent establishments (Muessesse) or JSCs. Through the proposed
reorganization they will become cost and profit centers. Their operational
autonomy will be strengthened sufficiently within the limits of the law to
include an enlarged freedom of staffing, improved incentive systems for
management and labor, more ready access to outside short-term financing, and
increased freedom in the purchasing of inputs. Plants will take initiative in
proposing production targets, pricing of their products, as well as investment
plans for replacement or expansion which CTD would coordinate. An improved
information system within plants and between them will permit faster manage-
ment decisions by CTD and ASM. Appropriate technical assistance (paras 5.11
to 5.14) combined with certain action programs will help bring about these
changes.
2.   Management and Labor
4.22      On occasion of Government changes in Turkey, top managements of
most SEEs are being replaced which in turn tend to change middle management
in Ankara and in the plants. For SB this has meant disruption of ongoing
operations and delays in investment projects under preparation and execution.
While such changes cannot fully be avoidable, Sumerbank and CTD have agreed
to appoint qualified and experienced personnel and maintain personnel employ-
ment policies as shall increase and promote CTD's labor productivity, which
should compensate for this problem.
4.23      One root of the recent management problem in SEEs is, that manage-
ment's compensation is not competitive with the private sector. Since a
change of the laws governing salaries in the public sector is, however, only
a distant possibility, for the purpose of the proposed Project, agreement
was reached with SB and the Government that the provision of 55 contractual
positions (which can pay substantially higher salaries) to SB's cotton textile
operations would be an acceptable short term solution to overcome the most
serious staffing problems during Project execution. Authority for 55 con-
tractual positions has been provided by the Government to SB for CTD. Assur-
ances were obtained that these positions will be maintained until Project



- 20 -
completion. This will allow CTD to attract and recruit qualified staff on a
contractual basis with adequate compensation throughout Project implementation.
If improvements in staff compensation are not coming about soon, a further 40
such contractual positions might be required during 1981 and 1982 (para 5.15).
Agreement was obtained from SB, that CTD will establish the staffing require-
ments for the Project implementation and CTD prior to April 30, 1981 in order
to determine whether and, if so, what type of additional positions will be
required.
4.24      However, apart from the above temporary solution, real long-term
improvements in staff compensation and particularly in management incentives
are also required. SB and CTD will have to discuss with the new Government
realistic incentives for the achievement of production, profit and export tar-
gets. For 1979 an export incentive existed for SB but was set unrealistically
high. Also the Government should expedite the intended reform of the State
Personnel Law to provide SEE managements with increased flexibility in staff
compensation matters.
4.25      Incentive schemes for workers will be reviewed by CTD and consultants
before December 31, 1980 (para 5.12). The review is expected to result in
recommendations to SB and Government for specific improvements. SB and CTD
agreed to prepare those recommendations prior to April 30, 1981 for review and
discussion with the Bank and will introduce steps for improvements. However,
implementtion of such schemes will depend on the acceptance by SB's labor
unions, which may take some time.
4.26      The entire personnel strength of SB's cotton textile operations was
about 25,600 in 1979. During the same year, total staff at SB Headquarters
was 1,000, and in ASM about 4,100. In fact, SB's cotton textile plants and
administration are overstaffed. Labor wages are low compared to European
countries but high compared to the private textile sector in Turkey. Because
of the low productivity the wage bill per unit of production is sometimes even
above European levels. Reasons for inefficiencies and overstaffing are: (i)
difficulties in reducing the labor force other than by attrition; and (ii)
labor compensation systems providing little motivation through incentives.
Under the Project, increased capacity utilization will absorb a significant
number of presently redundant personnel. Moreover staffing and training
requirements will be reviewed on a regular basis (para 5.18 to 5.20). Agree-
ments were obtained that CTD will prepare as part of recurring action programs
annual staffing and training requirements for CTD (paras 5.18 and 5.20) and
submit to the Bank the first Program prior to April 30, 1981.
3.   Production Facilities, Technology and Operations
4.27      CTD controls 18 cotton textile plants, and one cotton ginnery in
Adana (Map IBRD 14575). 11 plants are fully integrated (spinning, weaving and
finishing), three are partly integrated (spinning and weaving) and four are
spinning plants only. Three of the integrated plants also include printing
and another four also have garment operations (Annex 4-7). The following
table provides a summary of installed equipment and capacity utilization in
1977.

La   Technical efficiency x capacity utilization.
4.28      In Spinning, plant sizes range from 10,000 to 55,000 spindles.
Except for three relatively new plants (established in the early 1970's and
located in Adana, Diyarbakir and Karaman) technology in spinning mills
is conventional, labor intensive, relatively slow and simple to operate.
About 65% of equipment is more than 10 years old and about 38% is more than
20 years old. Use of man-made fibers is less than 5%, and airconditioning
required for technical reasons is practically non existent in most plants.
The widespread use of old slow cards and worn out drawframes and ringframes is
an important cause of low productivity, poor quality and excessive power
consumption. Moreover, in the three above mentioned new mills, some faulty
equipment has never been commissioned and requires replacement (Prolect File,
Item P). As a result, overall efficiency in all spinning mills is only about
50%. Inadequate rationalization of production, poor production scheduling and
operating techniques and lately frequent powercuts are also contributing to
low efficiency and capacity utilization. Moreover, poor yarn quality, result-
ing from the above deficiencies, causes further problems in downstream depart-
ments.
4.29      In Weaving, plant sizes range from 240 to 1,000 looms per plant.
Technology is conventional with automatic shuttle looms of mostly narrow width
(90 cm). Only 28% of the looms are less than 15 years old, and about 22% are
more than 40 years old. Moreover, haphazard and piecemeal expansions within
plants have led to a large variety of looms within a given mill. Thus, there
is room for standardization through appropriate transfers of equipment between
mills. A lack of spare parts and poor maintenance, combined with poor yarn
quality, inadequate production scheduling, inappropriate product mix and a
lack of quality control have contributed to low efficiency, capacity utiliza-
tion and low labor productivity. Consequently the fabric quality is poor with
as many as one major fault per meter as compared to five faults per 100 meters
as the maximum acceptable rate in export markets.
4.30      In the Finishing sections old equipment requiring slow batch process-
ing is still predominant. Certain obsolete processes and equipment (prepara-
tion in rope form using kiers for caustic scoring and pits for desizing and
hypoclorite bleaching) require replacement. Fixing and steaming facilities



- 22 -
for printed fabrics are old and energy intensive. Only 3% of equipment is
less than five years old, and about 50% more than 14 years old. Given the
degree of obsolescence, it is not surprising that efficiency is low. Tradi-
tionally the finishing sections permit to cover up many of the spinning and
weaving faults, but inspection of finished goods for quality control and
grading of the product is inadequate and provides little feedback to operating
departments.
4.31      Garment production, is carried out in new plants with acceptable
technology and equipment, but often lacks styling, acceptable job scheduling
and quality control. Incentive systems are inadequate and qualification of
management and supervisory personnel also needs improvement.
4.32      The increasing magnitude of operational problems is being brought
into focus by the declining trend of production, as shown below:

/a   Estimate.
The deterioration of capacity utilization and productivity (except for garment
plants) (para 4.29) which is inherent in these figures is even more pronounced
given the fact that additional capacity as well as labor were added during the
1970s.
4.33      From the above discussions it is evident that there is need to
(i) replace obsolete machinery; (ii) modernize equipment through provision
of spares and machine assemblies; (iii) transfer equipment within and
among plants for purposes of increased standardization; and (iv) debottleneck
facilities through provision of equipment to balance operational capacities.
Given the size and condition of existing facilities, the task of bringing
production facilities to a more reasonable standard, compared to Turkish
private industry or, e.g. West European standards, is a long-term task, for
which the Project can provide only a good beginning. However, investment in
improvements of plant facilities must be accompanied by action programs to
improve product mix, production planning and control, operational procedures,
quality control, maintenance programs as well as training, incentive systems
and management compensation.
4.   Marketing and Reorganization
4.34      As shown in the table below, between 65% and 75% of SB's cotton
fabric production (Product Mix in Annex 4-8) is sold to ASM, an additional



- 23 -
15% is sold directly to governmental institutions, and the rest is either sold
directly to the public (5%), exported (5%) or used in own garment production
(5% to 10%).

/a   Public customers include institutions such as military, postal
service, hospitals, etc.
/b   Mostly second quality - sold to wholesalers.
Yarn is mostly used internally and the remainder is exported or sold directly
by the plant to the private sector. Up to 50% of garments is exported and the
remainder is sold through ASM stores.
4.35      ASM, headquartered in Istanbul, sells SB products on a consignment
basis. Although ASM's large retail network should constitute a major advantage
over the private sector, given its reach and its possibility to make use of
economies of scale in warehousing and distribution, the system has been costly
and inflexible due to a lack of planning and control of shipments and inven-
tories, an inadequate market information system, and a lack of sales promotion
at the retail store level. Little feedback of market trends from the store
arrives at ASM Istanbul or even less at plant level and in either case is
late. This has led to a decline in SB's cotton weaving market share from 30%
in 1970 to 20% in 1978, 1/ as well as to relatively high inventory levels, low
turnover rates, misshipments and increasing costs of distribution and retail.
4.36      Sales to institutional customers, private wholesalers and other SB
plants, as well as, though to a lesser extent, export sales of yarn and grey
cloth are centrally coordinated by a marketing manager at SB Ankara, who also
deals with exports of other consumer products of SB as well as with sales of
intermediate products.
1/   SB's share in Turkey's cotton spinning fell from 30% to 13% during the
same period.

4.37      Exports of yarn, fabrics and garments have been limited and erratic
as is shown in the table below:

/a   Preliminary
Exports have declined from the 1973 levels, although due to exchange rate
adjustments results for 1979 have improved considerably over previous years.
Export of finished cloth and garments have typically been the result of
initiative of individual plants which established their own relationship with
customers abroad. These plants have enjoyed relative freedom in pricing and
sales of exports within certain constraints set by SB, but practically no
intensive efforts for export are being made. In addition, no central export
promotion has been provided by SB nor has any use been made of export agents
or export promotion offices in export markets.
4.38      Under the Project, sales planning, domestic and export sales (except
domestic retailing which would remain in ASM), pricing, market research
and product development will be vested in CTD to improve coordination between
production and marketing. CTD production planning and control will be based
on annual sales plans to be reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis to
respond flexibly to changing market conditions. Sales, including those to
ASM, will be based on contracts that will cover critical conditions of sales
such as quantity, quality, price, terms and timing of delivery. ASM will
remain a major channel of distribution and a priority customer of CTD but,
contrary to present practice, sales to ASM will be on an arms-length basis.
Sales to institutional customers will remain under the plants' responsibility
with CTD in a coordinating role. Sales to private wholesalers, coordinated
by CTD, will be emphasized in order to permit CTD and individual plants a
more direct feedback on new market trends in the private sector. Execution
of export sales x'i 11 remain under the responsibility of individual plants.
However, apart from the direct contacts between plant and customer, export
sales promotion will be provided by CTD through active participation in
trade fairs, regular canvassing of export markets, use of export promotion
facilities provided under the Private Sector Textile Project (Loans 1734/55-TU),
and, if required, through an export promotion office in an EEC country. An
understanding has been reached with SB on these major principles, based on
which marketing of cotton textiles will be carried out. Agreement was further
obtained that CTD, supported by technical assistance will develop details of
implementation of marketing principles prior to December 31, 1980, for review
and discussion with the Bank, and subsequent implementation.

5.   Pricing
4.39      As noted previously, while, according to the SEE Law, SB is free to
set its price, in actual fact its prices have been subject to indirect Govern-
ment control until January 1980. At that time SEEs were once more given the
freedom to adjust their prices in accordance with production costs and market
conditions. Domestic prices are normally proposed by ASM and agreed by SB
management and government. Export prices on yarn and grey cloth are agreed
with Export Associations according to export market conditions and the SB
marketing manager has to abide by them with a maximum deviation of +10%.
Exports of finished cloth and garments are priced either by individual plants
or the SB marketing manager, depending on the degree of autonomy each export-
ing plant enjoys. The following table shows past domestic and export price
developments for SB's cotton textile products.

Garments (TL/piece)                       32.9    43.0    58.8    84.5   139.0
Avg. Exchange Rate used:
(US$1 = TL)                               14.5    16.0    17.7    25.0    36.0
Although not strictly comparable in all categories due to some differences in
product mix, above comparison of domestic and export prices illustrates the
attractiveness of the domestic market. This has partly been due to a high
textile price level in Turkey, as compared to other countries (protected
market), and partly to overvalued local currency which depressed export
earnings. The new exchange rate of TL 70.0 = US$1 established in January
1980 and the subsequent periodic adjustment has corrected the latter factor.
4.40      Although domestic SB cotton textile prices were adjusted from
time to time they lagged behind inflation, and have remained about 10-20%
below private sector prices. This was particularly pronounced from May 1979
until February 1980 when SB prices were only about 40-50% of those in the
private sector. At that time SB raised its cotton textile prices by about
100%. In order to avoid such large jumps at long time intervals and to
secure an adequate cash generation, the SB and CTD agreed to review and adjust
CTD's prices frequently as needed to meet changing cost and market conditions
and to earn a reasonable return on capital. The Government, on the other



- 26 -
hand, assured that it would assist SB and CTD to meet this requirement. An
understanding was reached that CTD will be permited a minimum margin of 20%
above and below approved prices to provide CTD with flexibility in pricing
to respond quickly to changing market conditions.
6.   Past Financial Performance and Future Prospects
4.41      Summaries of historical sales revenue, net income on a plant-by-plant
basis and financial statements for the whole of cotton textile operations are

/a   As of December 31, 1979, equity has been increased in the aggregate
by the 1.39 billion through conversion of current accounts.
/b   Including interest expenses incurred.
/c   Debt service coverage ratios cannot be established because there are no
definite repayment schedules for debts owed by individual plants to SB.
4.42      Since SB's cotton textile plants (fully owned and JSC's) are legal
entities each plant prepares financial statements and budgets for its own
operations. Consolidated statement including all 19 plants are not nor-
mally prepared and, therefore, were specifically made by Bank staff from
information supplied by SB's accounting department. Under the Project, the
reorganized CTD will prepare consolidated statements and will establish and
maintain financial planning, budgeting and control systems as a matter of
regular routine.
4.43      In addition to low capacity utilization, increased cost for the
pension scheme, and generally low production efficiency, another factor which
depressed profits was the fact that the tax burden of profitable plants could
not be offset with losses of others, since each plant is an independent
establishment. Both in 1976 and 1977, cotton textile operations as a whole
had an income tax burden of TL 1.5 million while its combined income statement
indicated before tax losses of TL 0.8 million. This also holds true for
cotton textile operations/ASM tax payments. While the former incurred a
TL 128 million loss, ASM achieved TL 101 million net profit after income taxes
of TL 85 million.



- 27 -
4.44      At present CTD barely generates sufficient cash to service its
debt and, therefore, is unable to cover growing requirements for incremental
working capital and renewal investments. Despite this constraint, SB has
invested in new plant which has been financed by external debt (DYB, Central
Bank, Treasury) mostly of short-term nature. Most of these projects were
imposed by the Government to serve as employment generators in central and
eastern Anatolia (Map IBRD 14576). These investments were carried out
in place of renewal and maintenance investments earmarked for existing plants
which, as a consequence, showed deteriorating operations and declining
production. The new CTD will, therefore, be requested to limit non-Project
investments to US$3.0 million per year during execution of the proposed
Project and to maintain adequate financial ratios during the life of the
proposed loan (para 7.06).
4.45      The debt/equity ratio rose from 2/98 in 1973 to 50/50 in 1978.
Because of the massive infusion of short-term loans, the current ratio
decreased from 1.80 in 1973 to an unsatisfactory 0.9 in 1978. Moreover,
interest expenses as a percentage of sales revenue tripled from 1.3% in 1973
to 4.0% in 1978 despite subsidized interest rates. It is difficult to estab-
lish a debt service coverage ratio since repayment schedules for a large
proportion of government debt have not been established. However, even under
the assumption that this debt would be provided on a long-term basis (Annex
4-5), the internal cash generation was barely enough to cover debt service
requirements. Because of the increase in capital by TL 1.39 billion (para
4.41) as of December 31, 1979, current ratio, debt/equity ratio and debt
service coverage have improved. Moreover SB confirmed that it increased CTD's
paid up capital in the aggregate to TL 3.75 billion and will set CTD's aggre-
gate nominal capital at TL 5.0 billion, prior to December 31, 1981. These
improvements by themselves will, however, not be enough to restore the finan-
cial viability for CTD unless they are accompanied by provision of technical
assistance and by rehabilitation of existing facilities included under the
Project.
4.46      Financial projections for CTD "without the Project" are shown
in Annex 4-10. They are expressed in US dollars (para 7.01), and do include
the increase in paid-up capital mentioned above, as well as the recent price
increase of about 100% on all products. Projections show that without the
Project CTD's profit after-tax are at best marginal even throughout the
forecast period (until 1987). These projections are based on the assumption
of continued price adjustments in line with inflation and allow for two recent
DYB financed new projects which are expected to start-up in 1981 and would
slightly improve CTD's profitability. However, the projected cash flow would
be insufficient to meet rapidly growing working capital needs, and debt
service requirements let alone cover needs for plant rehabilitation. This
unsatisfactory financial future of CTD clearly indicates the urgency of a
comprehensive rehabilitation program.
7.   Rationalization and Modernization Program (RMP)
4.47      SB management had realized that rationalization and modernization
of SB's plants was overdue, and had, therefore, established a physical rehab-
ilitation program for textile operations under the heading of the "MACROPLAN,"



- 28 -
(Project File, Item A) a technical project report prepared in 1976. In 1977,
a Bank mission reviewed this document with SB as well as consultants and
recommended that such modernization program should address not only the
physical rehabilitation aspects of SB's textile plants but also related ins-
titutional aspects of the Company to make it a success. GHERZI of Switzerland
was appointed as the consultant to carry out an appropriate feasibility study
(Project File, Items B and C) which was partly financed by the Bank through
the Project Preparation Facility (PPF--PO13-TU). A comprehensive Rationaliza-
tion and Modernization Program (Project File, Items D to G) was completed in
June 1979 and is summarized in para 5.01.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives
5.01      The Rationalization and Modernization Program (RMP) is to be imple-
mented over the period from 1980 to 1986. It is designed to (i) increase
efficiency and capacity utilization of existing plant facilities; (ii) reduce
production costs; (iii) improve product quality; and (iv) improve the institu-
tional and management framework of SB's cotton textile operations. The RMP
will cover almost CTD's entire investment needs 1/ up to the end of 1986 and
will increase CTD's production from presently about 41,000 metric t 2ns per
year (tpy) to2about 62,000 tpy of yarn and from about 207 million m  to about
300 million m per year of fabric. This will be achieved without engaging in
any real expansion of capacity, but rather through more economic use and
modernization of existing facilities through provision of spare parts and
modern machine assemblies. Obsolete machinery will be replaced. Through
appropriate transfer of equipment among different plants, standardization in
certain plants will be increased, allowing better use of economies of scale
and spares. Maintenance will be restored to a reasonable level through
provision of spare parts and training of maintenance personnel. In addition,
a technical assistance program to improve institutional efficiency and manage-
ment effectiveness will include (i) reorganization of cotton textile operations
into a functional, "quasi autonomous" division (CTD) (paras 4.19 to 4.21);
(ii) improvements in incentive and recruitment systems for management and
labor (paras 4.23 to 4.25); (iii) improvements in operations, quality control,
financial planning and control (paras 5.11 to 5.14); and (iv) strengthening
of marketing and pricing functions (paras 4.38 and 4.40).
5.02      The RMP will be grouped into two phases, the first of which consti-
tutes the proposed Project, with base cost investments of US$77 million for
Phase I, and US$115 million (1979 terms) for Phase II. Phase I is a self-
contained project that addresses the immediate needs of modernization while
Phase II addresses some of the longer term structural changes required,
notably in finishing and garments.
1/   Excluding certain DYB financed projects in Izmir.



- 29 -
B.   Scope and Location
5.03      Phase I of the RMP--the Project--is to be implemented between 1980
and 1983, and encompasses the rationalization and modernization of existing
machinery with special emphasis on certain plants (Map IBRD 14575) as well
as all the institutional improvements of CTD described in para 5.01 above.
In addition to the physical rehabilitation of certain plants the Project will
specifically concentrate on the reorganization of SB's cotton textile opera-
tions, the reorientation of marketing, as well as technical assistance for
operations, training, and management systems. This will provide a good base
for Phase II of RMP (from 1984 to 1986) designed to conclude the modernization
of the remaining facilities.
5.04      In view of the severe domestic and foreign financial constraints in
Turkey, the project has been scaled-down to the essentials needed to achieve
its objectives of balancing existing capacity to achieve the highest return.
The Project is designed to optimize the output of existing spinning facilities
through relatively inexpensive modernization and rehabilitation, and to
utilize practically all the yarn thus spun to manufacture fabrics (80% of
which will then be finished). The production of garments will be increased,
in view of the higher marketability and profitability of these products as
compared with yarn. As a result of the envisaged improvements of CTD under
the Project, production efficiency and capacity utilization in the various
departments of CTD's plants are expected to increase significantly. A com-
parison of production projections for 1984 "with" and "without" the Project
is given in Annex 5-1 and summarized below:

5.05      In Spinning, production of yarn is expected to increase from pres-
ently 41,000 tpy 1/ to 52,000 tpy and will provide for significantly upgraded
quality and proportions of cotton blend yarns and combed yarns (from 1,200
tons to 4,600 tons, and from 3,200 tons to 4,000 tons of yarn respectively).
1/   "Present" figures are preliminary data for 1979, projected figures are
for 1985.



- 30 -
In weavinF, production of gEey fabrics will increase from presently 207
million m to 250 million m , again, concommitant with a general increase in
quality as well as increased volumes of wider fabrics, color woven materials,
blended materials and terry fabrics in line with expected market trends for
those items. In Finishing, in order to balance increased production of
grey fabrics, production of finis?ed fabrics will increase from about 152
million m to about 207 million m with increased emphasis on product quality.
In Garments, existing plants will be improved through technical assistance
while one new plant will be installed in the phased out spinning section of
SB's Bakirkoy plant. Improved quality and increased output will increase
CTD's products' values, increase the potential for exports and will absorb
surplus labor resulting from the streamlining of the upstream textile
operations.
C.   Machinery, Equipment and Buildings
5.06      In the Spinning sections of CTD, investments will be focused on
six plants (Map IBRD 14575), and will cover modernization of existing equip-
ment (rehabilitation of some 47,000 spindles, replacement of drafting systems
at ring frames and speed frames); about 63,000 obsolete spindles will be
scrapped. Certain bottlenecks will be removed through addition of new
machines (drawing, combing). Installation of overhead cleaners for the ring
frames, addition of electronic yarn clearers to existing winders and the above
modernizations are expected to remove dust and improve yarn quality in those
plants where high quality fabrics are woven. Quality will further be upgraded
through better use of raw materials by introducing testing instruments. In
Eregli plant, manufacturing equipment for about 500 tons of sewing thread will
be installed. In the new Karaman and Adana plants, certain machinery installed
in 1974/75, which never became operational due to design problems, will be
replaced and the remainder of equipment rehabilitated and equipped with
missing components and spare parts (Annex 4-8).
5.07      With respect to Weaving the Project will focus on eight plants
(Map IBRD 14575). Chosen technology will, again, be conventional; 1,439
looms will be scrapped and 817 new looms installed. 766 looms and portions
of auxiliary machinery will be rehabilitated or replaced to allow CTD to
produce an increased volume of wider fabrics, larger quantities of color
woven materials and terry fabrics in line with market demand for such items.
Spare parts for all plants will be provided to help allow rehabilitation of an
adequate level of maintenance. Weaving operations in the Bakirkoy plant will
be phased out by the time the Project is completed.
5.08      With respect to Finishing and Printing the Project will focus on
five plants (Map IBRD 14575) where obsolete dyeing, printing and finishing
equipment will be either modernized or replaced. Finishing facilities in
Bakirkoy will be phased out by end 1983. Obsolete steam generating and water
scouring units will be replaced. The production flow in all plants will be
balanced to maximize capacity utilization and to increase the proportion
of finished fabrics production as compared to grey cloth. New finishing
facilities will be considered only during Phase II of RMP.



- 31 -
5.09      As noted above, the Project includes one new garment plant with a
capacity of 1.7 million pieces of shirts and pyjamas per year, to be placed in
the vacated spinning section of Bakirkoy. During Phase II of the RMP another
garment plant may be installed after phasing out and removing the weaving and
finishing facilities at Bakirkoy. In addition, technical assistance to the
existing plants in Izmir, Bergama, Manisa and Adiyaman is expected to increase
quality and output of these plants to allow them to participate in a rapidly
expanding market.
5.10      Civil works have been kept to a minimum under the Project concept
on account of the severe local funds shortage in SB and the country. Thus no
new buildings are envisaged and civil works will be limited to rehabilitation
and repair of floors and ceilings in the existing mills, as well as work
connected with improvements of the lighting, ventilation, humidification,
steam delivery and effluent disposal systems.
D.   Technical Assistance
5.11      In order to prepare and implement the detailed action programs
(para 5.18) which form part of the reorganization, reorientation and rational-
ization of CTD, the Project includes necessary technical assistance (about
480 man-months); terms of reference for such assistance are given in Annex
5-2 1/. Such assistance has been grouped into (i) operational technical
assistance (OTA) to cover aspects of organization, management systems, ope-
rations, marketing and training (about 360 man-months) 1/ and (ii) financial
technical assistance (FTA) to cover aspects of organization, management
information-systems, financial planning, budgeting and control, general and
cost accounting (about 120 man-months). OTA and FTA will overlap to a certain
extent and CTD staff will therefore have to coordinate the activities of
financial and technical consultants.
5.12      OTA is grouped into two stages:  The first stage of OTA (Project
File, Item H) which is to be provided by the Swiss textile consultant firm
GHERZI 2/ covers a period until about November 1980 (60 man-months financed
by the second tranche of the Bank's PPF--P018-TU) and includes (i) assistance
in finalizing project preparation, implementation schedules, procurement
documentation, training programs and revised product mix; (ii) assistance in
reorganization at headquarter (creation of CTD), reorientation of marketing and
management assistance to the new CTD (revision of long-term objectives, redefini-
tion of management functions, tools for corporate planning, production planning
and control, and cost control); and (iii) operational technical assistance in
one integrated textile plant (Eregli) and one garment plant (Manisa). Assist-
ance in these plants includes improvement of plant organization, improvements
in industrial engineering standards, production planning, standard costing
system, workers' incentive systems, introduction of modern procedures for
1/   Man-month rates are discussed in para 6.05.
2/   GRERZI will reinforce its team with marketing experts from a local firm
in Istanbul (Tubitak) and has arranged with four European textile manu-
facturers to assure training of CTD personnel in European plants.



- 32 -
machine maintenance, raw material management as well as operational, health,
and safety procedures for supervision and machine operators and quality
control. The second stage of OTA which is to be carried out between 1981 and
1983 (300 man-months to be financed under the proposed Bank loan) will shift
its attention to the plant level and will be based on the experience gained
during the first stage. OTA will also include assistance for supervision of
erection, rehabilitation and commissioning of machinery as well as direction
and supervision of CTD's training program.
5.13      The financial technical assistance (FTA) will also be grouped into
two stages. The first stage of FTA will be financed by a grant from UNDP/UNIDO
which is also going to be the executing agency, and will amount to about
20 man-months during 1980 (in parallel with OTA). It will concentrate on
(i) establishing financial and accounting systems for the new CTD; (ii)
improving financial planning and control at the plants' level; and (iii)
revising information systems between plants and CTD. Terms of reference for
this work (Project File, Item I) have been agreed upon between SB, UNDP/UNIDO
and the Bank. A firm (Whitehead, UK) has been selected. It is expected to
start work in June 1980. The second stage of FTA will be carried out between
1981 and 1983 (about 100 man-months, to be financed under the proposed Bank
loan), will focus on improvements of financial planning, control and cost
accounting in the individual plants under CTD.
5.14      With regard to improvements in the information system between ASM
and CTD and its plants, both OTA and FTA will limit themselves to help improve
inventory control systems and information flows about sales from retail shops
to CTD. SB confirmed that it will retain the services of suitable consultants
for OTA and FTA, acceptable to the Bank on the basis of terms of reference
mutually agreed with the Bank, during the implementation of the Project.
Effectiveness of a contract for the second stage of OTA is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. SB further agreed to cause CTD to engage
in a suitable contract with consultants for the second stage of FTA prior to
March 31, 1981.
E.   Project Management and Implementation
1.   Project Management
5.15      SB and CTD will have prime responsibility for the execution of the
Project, supported by GHERZI. However, during the recent past SB's record of
implementation of projects has been unsatisfactory. To assure satisfactory
execution of the Project SB has established an initial core (16 persons) of a
strong Project Implementation Unit (PIU), headed by a capable project manager,
Mr. Mehmet Yatkin, an experienced textile engineer with managerial experience
and supported by technical assistance. Given the large number of plants
containing one to four different production sections (spinning, weaving,
finishing, garments) it is estimated that the PIU will have to grow to about
35 highly qualified employees by mid 1980, and ultimately to 95 persons, for
both, CTD at headquarters and at the plant level, with experience in financial,
technical, marketing and engineering management (Annex 5-3). After completion
of essential reorganizational work in a given plant in production planning and
control, operations, financial planning and control, quality control and
marketing, a plant team will split up and move to other plants reinforced by
new PIU team members. Eventually team members will be assigned permanently



- 33 -
to a plant where they will continue to carry out the recurring action programs
(para 5.18). PIU will be supported by a team of consultants which at any
given time will number about 10 experts hired under the OTA and FTA contracts.
SB and CTD have agreed to maintain and increase PIU according to an agreed
schedule, and CTD is at present actively recruiting further personnel for PIU
who will work as counterparts with the consulting firms.
5.16      Coordination of Project activities will take place at the divisional
level in Ankara by the Project Manager of the PIU. Responsibility for, and
direction of subprojects in individual plants will be vested in a Project
Manager at the plant level who will report to the plant management, directing
PIU members assigned to the plant, and closely cooperating with operational
plant departments as well as visiting consultants. The plant's Project
Manager, through plant management, will report to PIU at CTD headquarter in
Ankara. Details of inter-communications and reporting will be worked out on
the basis of experience gathered during technical assistance work during the
first half of 1980. Plant Project Managers will prepare monthly progress
reports which PIU will assemble at the divisional level for SB management.
2.   Implementation Schedule
5.17      The resulting overall implementation schedule for the Project is
shown on the following page. It was prepared by GHERZI and SB, and is con-
sidered to be realistic by the Bank, since (a) most of engineering work
regarding the type and location of equipment has been completed as part
of the feasibility study, and (b) no major civil works are involved. The
Project will be implemented over the period 1980-83. 1/ The consultants
responsible for OTA are in place since March 1980, and those responsible
for FTA are expected to start in June 1980. GHERZI will assist SB in the
preparation of the detailed design, engineering, and tender documents and the
evaluation of qualifications of vendors. Procurement of foreign goods will
be advertised internationally on about June 1, 1980.   Tenders will be issued
on September 1980 and contracts for machinery and equipment awarded before
February 1, 1981. Mechanical completion is estimated for June 30, 1983 and
about 90% of the potential capacity utilization of the rehabilitated and
expanded facilities is expected to be realized before the end of 1983. The
detailed implementation schedules for each of the 19 plants will be prepared
prior to December 31, 1980 by the PIU in collaboration with respective
plant managers with the assistance of the consultants and will be phased
according to the overall project schedule.
3.   Recurring Action Programs
5.18      SB has agreed that Recurring Action Programs will be prepared
annually by each mill and will be assembled by CTD before November 30 preceding
I/   Completion of the Project is defined as the date on which rehabilitation,
erection and installation of parts and machinery under the Project will
have been completed and CTD will have reached an aggregate monthly
production of at least 4,400 metric tons of yarn and 17 million m of
finished fabric during a continuous period of 60 days.

the following fiscal year. They will include (i) production programs; (ii)
maintenance programs; (iii) technical assistance programs (OTA and FTA);
(iv) staffing and training programs; (v) operational budgets with targets
for production costs, profits, and exports; (vi) investment programs, and
(vii) five-year rolling financial projections for CTD. The above programs
will be reviewed and adjusted by CTD on a quarterly basis except for the
five-year projections which will be revised annually.
F.   Employment and Training
5.19      Poor performance of SB's cotton textile plants has been caused,
among others, by inadequate training of a portion of the labor force considered
redundant. The SB Textile Training and Research Center (STTRC) in Bursa has
not been used to the extent possible and on-the-job training in the plants has
been inadequate. Therefore, a detailed staffing and training program will be
established for the Project by CTD and the Consultants by December 31, 1980.
The staffing program will call for staffing targets in each plant. Broadly,
the training program will include initially training of about 50 Technical
Instructors (for spinning, weaving, finishing, garments, for all mills) in
four textile and garment plants in Western Europe to be arranged by OTA con-
sultants. In a follow-up stage those instructors will attend short seminars
organized, staffed and supervised by OTA consultants at STTRC in Bursa, to
discuss the organization of teaching techniques for the courses subsequently
to be given in the plants. Such seminars will be repeated once every six
months during Project implementation to serve as a clearing house for ideas
and solving of problems connected with the training program. In a third
stage, training courses for mechanics, foremen and loom fixers will be carried
out by the Instructors on a continuous basis in their respective plants.
Thus, altogether it is estimated that over 1,000 supervisors and operators
will be retrained in textile engineering, operation and maintenance procedures
for textile and garment machinery and equipment. In addition and subject to
availability of potential supervisory and management personnel, at least 40
Turkish nationals with appropriate education, language abilities and experience
will be selected for a special six-month training program abroad in textile
technology and plant management, which should be followed by practical training
programs of three months duration in appropriate foreign textile plants.
5.20      The STTRC in Bursa will be utilized essentially for purposes of
supervisory training, training of instructors and, possibly, for language
training. A crash language course may be required before the first group
of technical instructors is sent to Europe (para 5.19). The research facili-
ties should be used more extensively for quality control and industry surveys
of the Turkish Textile Sector (comparison of products of public and private
industry, and with foreign products). SB and CTD agreed to provide to the
Bank (i) said staffing and training program prior to April 30, 1981, and
(ii) progress reports on staffing and training, quality control and industry
surveys on a annual basis prior to November 30 of each year from 1981.



- 36 -
5.21      Direct employment effects are small in relation to the investment
and amount to about 1,680 new jobs being provided in the garment sector,
offset by an attrition of about 940 redundant jobs in spinning, weaving and
processing or a net gain of 740 jobs. However, this ignores the very large
amount of over-employment in the present facilities and the very low produc-
tivity of the present work force. The main anticipated benefit of the proposed
Project is the substantially increased production from largely the same plant
and labor force, achieved through a careful balance of modernizing investments,
better organization and management.
G.   Ecology
5.22      The main sources of pollution in cotton textile plants are (a) high
alkalinity (ph above 7); (b) cellulosic waste increasing the biological oxygen
demand (BOD); (c) suspended solid (SS) content of the effluent generated in
processing operations, as well as inside the plant; (d) dust pollution from
fiber particles; and (e) noise pollution. The existing environmental standards
for industrial effluents issued by the Government in 1973 are generally less
stringent than current Bank guidelines. Until revised standards and a time-
table for compliance is published by the Government, it has been agreed with
SB management that by 3 months after Project Completion CTD will operate its
dyeing, processing and finishing operations according to environmental and
occupational health standards for textile plants acceptable to the Bank.
VI. CAPITAL COSTS. FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost Estimates
6.01      The total financing required for the Project is estimated to be
US$130.7 million including US$17.7 million financial charges during construc-
tion. In addition, US$19.8 million will be required to bring up to and
maintain the working capital of existing operations at acceptable levels
(para 6.04). A summary of capital costs is shown below in mid-1979 terms
and detailed assumptions are given in Annex 6-1 and the Project File (Item Q).

6.02      Equipment costs expressed in mid-1979 terms have been estimated by
GHERZI based on price quotations obtained from textile machinery suppliers
in April 1979, and have been revised by the Bank to reflect certain changes
in scope. Imported equipment costs are based on FOB plus transportation and
insurance costs, excluding Turkish customs duties of which SB is exempted
as is practiced with all SB investments. Local taxes included in the cost
estimates are estimated at US$2.3 million. The base cost includes estimated
costs of foreign spare parts and machine components for the existing equipment,
adequate to reinstate in CTD a reasonable level of maintenance. Restitution
of maintenance through the supply of spare parts as well as technical assist-
ance services (para 6.05) constitute major cost items in this rehabilitation
Project. Civil works costs are estimated based on the preliminary design
prepared by GHERZI, and price information received from local contractors in
April 1)79. Existing buildings and structures are to be used with minimum
modif!zation under the Project, for the purpose of minimizing local currency
cost'.
6.03      The total Project cost includes provisions for overall contingencies
of about 38% on base costs, including 6% for physical contingencies 1/ and
32% for price contingencies. Price escalation for foreign costs is calculated
on the basis of projected international inflation rates of 12%, 10.5%, 9%, 8%,
7% per year for 1979 through 1983. The same international price inflation
rates have also been used for local supplies and services expressed in US
dollars on the assumption that the differences in domestic and the inter-
national inflation rates will be accounted for by adjustments in foreign
exchange rates. This assumption is based on the new economic policy package
announced on January 25, 1980. Given the well defined project scope and small
proportion of civil construction costs, the project cost estimates including
contingency provisions are considered realistic.
6.04      Permanent incremental working capital for the Project is estimated
at US$7.0 million, including US$1.8 million in foreign exchange necessary to
finance additional raw material inventories of man-made fibers, chemicals and
dye stuffs which have to be imported. Details for working capital require-
ments are given in Annex 6-1. In order to improve CTD's financial structure
SB converted TL 2.49 billion of its short-term debt into equity. Furthermore
an additional working capital of US$19.8 million for the existing production
facilities is included in the above financing requirements in order to main-
tain CTD's current ratio at a level of at least 1.2 during implementation of
the Project.
6.05      The feasibility study for the entire RMP (Phases I and II) and the
Project (Phase I) was carried out by GHERZI and financed by PPF at the rate
of US$10,800 per man-month. For technical and financial consulting services
during the implementation period, the same man-month rate (US$10,800 in
1/   7% on all items except for spares and components for existing machinery,
for which no physical contingency is provided.



- 39 -
mid-1979 terms) has been assumed. In addition, costs of US$3,700 per man-
month to cover expenditures for international travel, subsistence as well
as local transportation, local office operating expenses, and miscellaneous
items, have been included, resulting in a man-month cost of US$14,500.
B.   Financing Plan
6.06      Annual financing requirements and a proposed annual financing plan
are shown in Annex 6-2. The financing plan is summarized below:
CTD - Proposed Financing Plan
----TL Million  a --]--  - --US$ Million----
Local  Foreign  Total   Local  Foreign  Total
Equity:
Additional Equity Contribution 1,260         -   1,260   18.0          -    18.0
Internally Generated Funds       1,855   1,260   3,115   26.5       18.0    44.5
Debt:
IBRD Loan                            -   5,810   5,810       -      83.0    83.0
Suppliers' Credit                    -     350      350      -       5.0     5.0
Total                         3,115   7,420  10,535   44.5    106.0   150.5
/a   The figure expressed in TL have been calculated using the exchange rate
of US$1.00 = TL 70 and are therefore only notional, as changes in the
exchange rate are expected.
/b   The agreed equity contribution by the Government is TL 1,700 million
equivalent to US$18 million at expected exchange rate adjustments
(footnote a).
6.07      Under the new economic policy, which was accompanied by substantial
price increases of SEE products and elimination of most of the SEE products
from the price-controlled Basic Goods category, SEEs are, as already noted,
allowed to set their product prices in line with market conditions, so as
to generate enough funds not only to cover their operating needs, but also
generate funds for investments. The above financing plan takes this new
policy into account, and therefore relies heavily on internally generated
funds for project financing. For projection purposes prices are increased in
line with anticipated international inflation during the project implementa-
tion period (para 7.03). This requires, however, a change in SB's pricing
policy and strengthening of CTD's marketing and financial management. It is
assumed that SB product prices will be reviewed and adjusted in line with
market prices. SB management has agreed that the prices will be reviewed
and adjusted frequently as needed taking into account competitive market
conditions, production cost increases due to inflation and the objective
of CTD to earn a reasonable return on capital under conditions of efficient
operations. The Government undertakes to enable SB to carry out such pricing
policy. Rehabilitation measures under the Project in terms of equipment,



- 40 -
action programs, technical assistance and training, are designed to boost
production, reduce unit cost of production and improve quality. Given those
measures, it is reasonable to expect that CTD will generate enough funds from
1981 to contribute about US$44.5 1/ million equivalent to the financing of the
Project during its implementation.
6.08      In addition to internally generated funds, the Project requires
local funds of TL 1.7 billion to be provided in the form of equity contribu-
tion by the Government. These funds are required early in the Project execu-
tion when the cash generation of CTD is not yet sufficient to cover financing
needs of the Project. This additional equity is necessary to maintain a
reasonable debt/equity ratio throughout the implementation period, and to
provide a cushion against the risk of insufficient cash generation arising
from (i) unforseen delays in project implementation and (ii) failure to
increase prices in line with cost increases. The initial cash equity contri-
bution of TL 400 million is a condition of effectiveness. The Government has
also agreed to provide an additional TL 800 million prior to December 31, 1981
and the remaining TL 500 million of equity by December 31, 1982.
6.09      SB attaches high priority to the Project in its investment plans
and has agreed that CTD will not make investment outside the Project exceeding
US$3 million equivalent in any year prior to the completion of the Project.
SB has agreed not to transfer funds from CTD to its other operations unless
CTD meet a minimum current ratio of 1.5 during Project implementation. If
needed, SB will also provide the necessary funds to complete the Project.
6.10      As for foreign financing, the Bank loan will cover 94% of the
foreign cost components or 80% of total costs of equipment, civil works,
consultancy and training, net of local taxes. The Bank loan of US$83 million
would be made to the Government (Borrower) at an interest rate of 8.25%
p.a. for 17 years including four years grace. The entire amount would be
on-lent to SB (Beneficiary) at an interest rate of 10.5% p.a. for 12 years
including four years of grace, the spread between the Bank interest and
10.5% p.a. payable to the Government being charged as administration and
guarantee fee. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by SB. Effectiveness
of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and SB is a condition
of effectiveness of the Bank loan. SB agreed to contract suppliers credits
amounting to US$5 million equivalent to assist in financing the Project unless
adequate funds are demonstrated to be available from other sources, prior to
December 31, 1981. 2/  Foreign exchange required for interest during con-
struction and working capital will be obtained through internally generated
foreign exchange under the foreign exchange retention scheme for exports, or
1/   The total surplus cash flow during the implementation period is estimated
at approximately US$50 million equivalent, including US$44.5 million
for Project financing.
2/   For purposes of financial projections, those suppliers credits were
assumed to be obtainable at 8% p.a. interest rate, for 6 years including
1 year of grace period.



- 41 -
through special conversion by the Government of local funds internally gen-
erated by CTD. The export earnings in 1979 were US$29 million; this level
of export earnings, as a minimum, is expected to be sustained throughout the
Project implementation period. Therefore, CTD should be able to generate
sufficient foreign exchange to cover its operating needs and interest during
construction. Should there be any shortage of foreign exchange, however, the
Government has agreed to convert SB's local funds into foreign currency. The
Government has also assured to provide funds (both local and foreign), if
required to complete the Project.
C.   Procurement
6.11      Services financed by the Bank will be procured in accordance with
procedures established by the Bank for such procurement. Goods costing about
US$52 million financed by the Bank will be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Items costing
less than US$100,000 equivalent but not exceeding the aggregate amount of US$4
million will be purchased through limited international shopping on the basis
of suitability, availability and price considerations following approval by
the Bank of a list of items involved. In view of the rehabilitation nature
of the Project (provision of spares and machine assemblies for existing
equipment) as well as the need for commissioning certain existing equipment
which presently is idle because of lack of spares and machine assemblies,
proprietary items totalling US$17 million will be procured on the basis of a
list of goods satisfactory to the Bank pursuant to such competitive procedures
as are appropriate under the circumstances.
6.12      Certain equipment to be procured through international competitive
bidding or shopping is also available in Turkey in suitable quality (mostly
looms and overhead cleaners). For the purpose of bid comparison for such
equipment, local eligible manufacturers will be allowed a preference margin of
15% or the actual custom duty, whichever is lower. Assurances were obtained
that, if local suppliers should win contracts through international bidding,
the Government would allocate foreign exchange to finance the local suppliers'
requirements for imported parts or components required under their contracts.
Procurement will be advertised internationally on about June 1, 1980. Tenders
will be issued about September 1, 1980 and the first equipment orders are
expected to be placed in January 1981. Procurement of local goods and services
financed by SB will be carried out by local tendering procedures applicable in
all SEEs. These procurement steps and their schedule are considered reasonable.
D.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement
6.13      Allocation of the proposed Bank loan of US$83 million is as follows:



- 42 -
CTD ProJect - Allocation of Bank Funds
Amount              Application
(US$ million)     (Foreign Expenditure)
1.  Plant, Equipment, Machinery              68.0          100% of foreign
& Spare Parts (FOB);                                  expenditures or 100%

2.  Consultancy & Training                    7.8          100% of foreign
expenditures
3.  Refunding of Project Preparation          1.0          Amounts due
Advance
4.  Unallocated                               6.2          100% of foreign
expenditures
Total                              83.0
The Bank loan is estimated to be disbursed according to the schedule presented
in Annex 6-3. Up to 10% of the Bank loan might be used for local currency
expenditures (para 6.12). Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account
after the Project completion will be cancelled.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Domestic inflation in Turkey is estimated to have been 64% in 1979
and is expected to remain high during the Project implementation period. With
inflation rates such as this, financial projections based on local currency
would present a distorted picture of the financial position of the Company.
Under the circumstances, and given the Government's new foreign exchange
policy which includes frequent adjustment of exchange rates, financial pro-
jections have been prepared in US dollars. The price base is early 1980, and
therefore all the base input and output prices are converted at the rate of
US$1.00 = TL 70.0, unless otherwise stated.
A.   Projected Production Build-up and Sales
7.02      For each cotton textile plant, a production build-up has been pro-
jected based on the market potentials, production facilities and proposed
capital investments. Trends of expected production for spinning, weaving,
processing and garments are given in Annex 5-1 and are summarized below:

CTD - Production Build-up

Spinning (thousand tons)                41      41     44      54         32%
Weaving (million sq. m)                207    214    233    250           21%
Processing (million sq. m)             152    165    205    207           36%
Garment (million pcs.) /a                1.7    2.6    5.6    6.3         270%
/a   Includes the production of the DYB financed Izmir plant which is not
part of the Project. The net increase due to the Project is 0.4, 1.4,
1.7 million pieces respectively for 1981, 1983 and 1986.
The analysis, details of which are provided in the Project File (Item G), is
based on realistic assumptions with regard to capacity utilization and produc-
tion efficiency, and is considered achievable, particularly in the light of
production levels of 1973 very close to the levels assumed for 1986.
7.03      On the basis of the above, and assuming that intermediate goods such
as yarn and woven fabrics are used internally as long as there are capacities
for further processing within CTD, sales forecasts have been made for each
category of products. Fabrics for garments are assumed to be purchased
entirely from outside to provide the flexibility in garment manufacturing.
Details of sales volume for each category of products during Project implemen-
tation are given in Annex 7-1. The early 1980 prices, including the latest
price increase of January 31, 1980, are used as the basis for unit prices
which are then inflated in line with international inflation. Considering
the high inflation in Turkey it will be necessary for SB to review prices
frequently and adjust them as required to account for market conditions and
inflation (para 6.07). Under these assumptions operating profit would grow
from 3.7% of net sales in 1980 to 7.4% in 1984. It is expected, however, that
such price increases would still not narrow the traditional price differential
of 10-15% between SB and private sector textile products because the cotton
textile product prices in Turkey are in fact expected to increase, at least,
in line with inflation, due to the strong demand for cotton textiles antici-
pated during the coming years. Improved quality due to the provision of
modernized equipment and technical assistance, should also give SB management
an option to achieve real price increases over and above inflation, which,
for projection purposes have, however, conservatively been disregarded.
B.   Operating Cost Estimates
7.04     Assumptions used in the financial projections are listed in Annex 7-2.
Production costs are based on current costs of raw materials (except for
cotton), and other inputs such as dyes and chemicals, maintenance materials
and labor (labor costs projections in Project File, Item R). The cost of raw
cotton is, among others, determined by international prices, exchange rates
applicable to Turkey's cotton exports and the country's price stabilization



- 44 -
levy. After the devaluation of the Turkish Lira in January 1980, the exchange
rate applicable to cotton export became equal to the general exchange rate of
US$1.00 - TL 70 from the US$1.00 - TL 35 which had been applied specifically
to agricultural commodities. Instead, the Government introduced a price
stabilization levy ranging from TL 36 to TL 41 per kg of raw cotton. On
the average this would mean a price differential of TL 38/kg or US$0.54/kg
in favor of domestic cotton users. 1/ Given the early 1980 FOB price of
US$1.80/kg for short staple Turkish cotton, the delivered price of raw cotton
(at the textile plant) is estimated at US$1.26/kg. It is assumed that the
levy will remain at the present level in future, while the international
cotton price will rise as projected in the Bank's commodity price forecast.
Most of the operating costs are inflated in line with estimated annual inter-
national inflation rates of 12%, 10.5%, 9%, 8%, and 7% during the 1979 through
1983 period; thereafter no inflation is assumed. Real price increases are
assumed, however, for utility expenses (4% p.a.), man-made fiber prices (2%
p.a.), and wage and salary expenses (1.5% p.a.).
C.   Financial Projections and Financial Covenants
7.05      Financial projections for CTD "with the Project" are given in
Annex 7-3. Key financial indicators are summarized below, in current US
dollars until project completion in late 1983 and constant US dollars there-
after. In order to make year to year comparisons easier, the conversion of
CTD's short term debt into equity is assumed to have taken place at end-
1979, rather than in early 1980.

million into equity made early 1980.
1/   This is compensated for by a production tax (35% included in ex-
factory price) on yarn, which amounts to TL 47 per kg of raw cotton
used for the production of yarn.



- 45 -
7.06      In 1980, there will be no installation of new equipment nor delivery
of spare parts for rehabilitation of existing equipment.; the Stage I.OTA and
FTA consulting services are the only Project component to be implemented
during this year. It is expected therefore that there will be no difference
in the production to the case "without the Project". Provision of spare
parts, components, and technical assistance are expected to yield some limited
results in 1981 and 1982 because of resulting improvements in efficiency.
However, the full impact of Project benefits would only be realized in 1983
when the product mix is expected to be fully adjusted and garment manufactur-
ing will be operating profitably. Sales in 1983 are expected to be 60% over
the 1979 level in real terms. The financial ratios are expected to remain
within acceptable limits throughout the implementation except for the debt
service coverage in 1980 as described above. SB and CTD have assured that CTD
will maintain from 1980 throughout the life of the loan a current ratio of no
less than 1.2 times, a debt/equity ratio of no more than 60/40 and will not
incur any debt, if as ; result of that debt, the debt service coverage ratio
would fall below 1.5. Other financial covenants are contained in paras 4.17,
4.19, 4.40, 4.42, 4.44, 6.09, 6.10 and 7.10.
7.07      Incremental financial projections are shown in Annex 7-4 key finan-
cial indicators are summarized below.
CTD - Key Financial Indicator Incremental for the Project /a

/a   The incremental effect in 1980 is insignificant, and therefore not
shown in the table.
/b   Including interest expenses for long-term debt.
Tc   Due to loss of production for some items during Project implementation
and increased financial charges, the incremental effects of the Project
on OP and PAT are expected to be negative.
Incremental sales revenue due to the Project would account for 14% and 21%
of total revenue in 1983 and 1984 respectively. This would mean that the
Project will enjoy high leverage when rehabilitation work achieves its objec-
tives, which is demonstrated in high incremental PAT as % of sales of approxi-
mately 14% to 18% after 1983.
7.08      A comparison of these projections with those of cotton textile
operation "without the Project" (details of which are given in the Project
File), shows the marked difference in CTD's financial scenario between the
two cases. In order to highlight these differences, a comparison of some
financial indicators is listed below for 1984:

1.   Base Case                                                         25.1
2.   Capital Cost Increase 10%                                         23.2
3.   Operating Cost Increase 10%                                       21.6
4.   Sales Revenue Decrease 10%                                         19.0
5.   1 year Delay of Incremental Production                            20.3
The Base Case return is estimated at 25.1%. The return is most sensitive
to changes in the sales price; thus a 10% and 15% decrease in sales revenue
would drop the return to 19.0 and 15.7% respectively, underlining the impor-
tance of regular price adjustments. As is usually the case for rehabilitation
projects, the return is not overly sensitive to capital costs increases. A
10%-increase in total operating cost would yield a return of 21.6%. While a
10% increase in cotton prices would result in a 22.9% return, the return is
quite insensitive to utility price changes and labor wages, due to the rela-
tively insignificant amount of incremental utility costs and labor bill. One
year delay in project implementation would yield a return of 20.3%.
E.   Audit and Reporting
7.10      In order to improve financial planning and control within CTD, the
financial consultants to be appointed under the Project will assist CTD to
develop and implement improved financial planning and control and management
reporting procedures, including five year rolling projections. During project
implementation the presence of these financial consultants would also serve
in an internal auditing function. Semi-annual financial statements will be



- 47 -
prepared by CTD and submitted to the Bank within 60 days after the end of each
quarter, whereas annual audited reports will be submitted within six months
after the end of each fiscal year and five year projections, making allowance
for severance pay, before November 30 of each year. Those five year projec-
tions will form the basis for determining outside financing requirements.
Consultants will also assist in preparing quarterly progress reports, and after
completion of the Project, a completion report on the progress and results
achieved under the Project and the management and operating assistance. SB
agreed to submit these reports to the Bank no later than 30 days after the end
of each calendar quarter and 6 months after the Project completion respectively.
F.   Ma;or Risks
7.11      Under normal circumstances the proposed Project which consists of
rationalization and modernization of well established facilities run by fairly
experienced personnel, would only face small risks. The main technical risks
arise from the need to carefully coordinate the relocation and rehabilitation
of existing equipment in 18 widely dispersed plants, so as to minimize the
disruption of current operations. The technical risks are acceptable, in view
of: (a) the amount of expatriate technical assistance provided by the Project;
(b) the allowance already made for production losses due to dismantling,
transport and erection of the equipment; (c) a special physical contingency
provided for new machinery to replace existing equipment damaged during
relocation or rehabilitation; and (d) the fact that production levels antici-
pated after completion of the Project are estimated to be only marginally
higher than those already achieved in 1973. Projected production levels by
1984 are only marginally higher than those already achieved in 1973, high-
lighting the rehabilitation aspect. However, given (i) the present political
and economic situation in Turkey; (ii) the specific problems of SEEs, as well
as (iii) SB related problems, several risks need to be considered.
7.12      In recognition of the country's difficult financial situation,
the Project relies, to the extent possible, on internally generated funds
to finance local currency requirements and foreign exchange needs over and
above the proposed Bank loan and proposed supplier's credits. It therefore
requires frequent price adjustments in line with cost increases and market
conditions to maintain a healthy cash flow. This is in line with the recent
Government policy of January 25, 1980. However, if inflation continues
unabated, this pricing policy could be reversed again, with consequences of
Project delays, increased costs and reduced cash generation. Initially, local
fund requirements for the Project, although relatively small, must come from
equity. If equity injections, required during 1980-81, were delayed because
of a shortage of Government funds, the Project's implementation would be
delayed, again with a concommitant increase in Project costs and resulting
in reduced cash generation. The shortage of energy in Turkey could further
disrupt operations, and prevent CTD from achieving its production targets,
thereby again reducing cash generation and increasing the risk of delays.
Finally, labor unrest or strikes and resulting disruptions in plants could
seriously reduce capacity utilization and even endanger physical assets.



- 48 -
7.13      The deficiencies of Turkish SEEs (para 4.07), particularly lack
of management continuity, inadequate personnel, compensation and lack of
incentives would also threaten the success of the Project. Special agree-
ments were obtained with regard to these problems to reduce their impact
(employment policies, para 4.22; incentives, para 4.24 and 4.25; pricing,
para 4.39; investment, para 4.16). Moreover, intentions of the new Government,
as expressed in the new economic policies, are to provide more management
autonomy to SEEs and have them emphasize the objective of profitability and
financial soundness.
7.14      The third group of major potential risks is under the control of SB
management. The success of the Project will depend to a large degree on the
support SB management is willing to provide to the Project. SB has repeatedly
emphasized the priority which it accords to the rehabilitation of CTD and,
therefore, expressed its commitment to (i) the introduction of organizational
changes (paras. 4.20 and 4.21); (ii) the carrying out of action programs
(paras 5.11 and 5.17); and (iii) the cooperation with expatriate technical
assistance. Particularly important will be management's commitment to (i)
delegate adequate authority to individual plants; (ii) take responsibility
with regard to controlling costs in plants and ASM, and monitoring and adjust-
ing prices on a regular basis; (iii) provide CTD with the necessary funds for
Project excecution; and (iv) refrain from draining CTD of its cash generation,
both foreign and local, required for the Project as well as renewal investments
required throughout the life of the loan. While the risks in the aggregate
are not insignificant, care has been taken to design the Project in a way
which will minimize their effects. Moreover, the major goal of the Project--
to restore a level of production already attained in the early 1970ies--has
been set at a modest level. The aggregate of risks is therefore deemed
acceptable.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01      In calculating the economic rate of return of the Project, border
prices based on international prices expressed in constant early 1980 terms
have been used for all tradeable goods and services; domestic prices were used
for all nontradable goods with some appropriate adjustments as described below.
All conversions have been made at US$1.00 = TL 70, the official exchange rate
at the beginning of 1980. Imported raw materials are valued at c.i.f. border
prices, while local raw materials, unless otherwise specified, are priced at
f.o.b. border prices. Cotton prices are based on the Bank commodity price
forecasts of US$2.25, c.i.f. North Europe, for Mexican SM 1-1/16", which
historically has demonstrated the same price trend as Turkish Adana and Izmir
varieties. International transportation and handling costs are estimated at
US$0.13/kg, resulting in the long-term f.o.b. price of US$2.12/kg for raw
cotton. The current price of polyester fiber of about US$1.60/kg f.o.b. North
Europe, is below the expected long-term price due to the temporary oversupply
in the international market and is therefore adjusted upward to arrive at the



- 49 -
long-term c.i.f. price of US$2.17/kg (in 1980 terms). Adding transportation
and handling charges, the long-term delivered price of polyester is estimated
at US$2.36/kg. The costs of utility has been adjusted upward by 57% on the
average. Based on a comparison between public and private sector wages, 80%
of the financial labor costs are used as economic cost of labor. No adjustments
are made for salaried personnel.
8.02      The product prices are based on the most recent SB export price list.
For the products sold only domestically at present, a comparison was made with
the prices of similar private sector products which are internationally traded,
with appropriate adjustments for quality differences. This has led to a reduc-
tion of about 10% to 15% in SB prices in the case of fabrics and 19% in the
case of garments. For blended fabrics intended for domestic market, the c.i.f.
border prices were established based on the current international prices and
adding transportation aad insurance costs. In the absence of comprehensive
historical cost accounting data, it is difficult to evaluate CTD's competitive
situation in the Turkish domestic as well as international market. However, a
comparison of production costs of selected product items after completion of
the Project shows that CTD will be cost competitive, both locally and interna-
tionally, in yarn, fabrics and garments at the lower end of the market spec-
trum which SB produces. A comparison of financial and economic prices of
products used is given below.

/a   Net of export levy.  All yarn sales are for export markets.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.03      The economic rate of return is calculated, on an incremental basis.
Using above prices and assumptions, the economic rate of return of the Project
is estimated at 23.6% (Annex 8.1). The high economic rate of return results
from the following reasons: (i) the low capital investment due to the
rehabilitation nature of the Project; (ii) the supply of spare parts and
technical assistance to update the maintenance program which has been long
overdue, will generate some noticeable effects as early as in the second year
of the Project implementation; (iii) the sharp rise in labor productivity to
be achieved by more efficient utilization of the existing labor force through
technical assistance; (iv) the structural shortage in supply of textile goods
in Turkey is expected to prevail for some time which will allow SB's incre-
mental production to enter into the market without major difficulties.



- 50 -
8.04      The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below:
CTD - Economic Rate of Return (X)
1.   Base Case                                                    23.6
2.   Capital Cost Increase 10%                                    21.8
3.   Operating Cost Increase 10%                                  20.2
4.   Sales Revenue Decrease 10%                                   17.6
5.   Combination of 2 and 5                                       16.1
6.   Combination of 4 and 5                                       13.9
7.   1 year Delay of Incremental Production                       19.5
The return is hardly sensitive to changes in capital costs. The return is
more sensitive, however, to changes in operating cost, with a 10% and 15%
increase resulting in the return to drop to 20.2% and 18.4% respectively. The
return is most sensitive to changes in sales revenue. A 10% and 15% drop of
sales would yield returns of 17.6% and 14.4% respectively, confirming again
the importance of a rational pricing policy.
8.05      When the Project achieves stable operations (expected in 1986), it
is estimated that SB's incremental foreign exchange earnings would be US$22
million while the incremental foreign exchange operating costs including debt
services would be US$17 million, resulting in a net foreign exchange inflow of
US$15 million for 1986.
C.   Other Benefits
8.06      The Project constitutes the first phase of the RMP scheme.  Although
the Project is financially and economically viable in itself, it is designed
in a way to establish an institutional framework in CTD to be relied upon
as foundations for the second phase. Sizeable efforts and investment will be
made for such purposes through OTA and FTA, totalling 11% of the Base Invest-
ment Cost. Much attention will be paid to organizational issues throughout
Project implementation. If successful, the Project is expected to fully
prepare CTD's organizational structure as well as its technical and financial
capabilities for the second phase of RMP.

TURKEY
SUMERBANK COTTON TEXTILE RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF SUMERBANK PROPOSAL FOR
OPERATION OF COTTON TEXTILE DIVISION (CTD)
Sumerbank (SB) shall operate its Cotton Textile Division (CTD) on the basis
of the following principles:
1.   General:  CTD shall be granted as much autonomy as permitted under the
existing laws of the Borrower. For this purpose, SB will, where possible,
delegate its powers to CTD and, as required to individual plants included
in CTD.
2.   Scope:  SB will establish the management of CTD at SB Headquarters in
Ankara. CTD management shall direct, coordinate and control the activities
of all the cotton textile plants included in CTD. Through the
reorganization, the operational autonomy of plants included in CTD shall
be strengthened sufficiently to permit them to (i) effectively reduce and
control operating costs, (ii) improve quality, and (iii) efficiently achieve
production targets.
3.   Functions:  CTD, on the divisional as well as on the plant level, will
have all departments and functions necessary to carry out its business
purpose independently and sufficiently and, in particular, shall include
departments with respect to manufacturing, marketing (including product
development), financial planning and control, investment planning, new
projects' implementation, personnel management and administration.
Particularly on the plant level the functions of investment planning,
financial planning and control, quality control, purchasing as well as
marketing shall be improved.
4.   Staffing:  SB will delegate its powers with respect to personnel matters
to CTD, and, as required, to individual plants to the extent permitted
by law.



68 -                             ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
CTD shall be headed by a Director who will report directly to the
General Director of SB. CTD and its plants shall employ and retain
regular staff in sufficient numbers. Such staff shall be suitably
qualified and competent and in particular shall possess relevant
technical and other experience and, where necessary, adequate foreign
language abilities.
Staff on contract positions within CTD shall be selected at the
discretion of CTD's Director. Staff on contract positions within
plants shall be selected by the Director of CTD in consultation with
management of the plants.
5.     Sales and Marketing Activities:  Responsibility for marketing CTD's
products including sales and product development, shall be vested
in CTD. Alim ve Satim (ASM) shall function as CTD's priority customer
and provide CTD with market information from its network.
Coordinated by CTD, the individual plants will be empowered to
sell their products directly to (i) foreign customers (exports);
(ii) customers inthe public sector (postal service, hospitals, etc);
(iii) garment manufacturers (within and outside CTD); (iv) ASM; and
(v) wholesale customers. CTD will develop a market information
system which will link CTD, individual plants and ASM. CTD shall
review its product mix on a regular basis and determine the number
of products items to achieve more efficient production and
economies of scale.
6.     Accounting and Management Information System:  CTD will, with the
assistance of consultants, assure that its plants will (i) develop
a standard-costing system to control costs in individual plant
departments, including the revaluation of their assets to reflect
replacement costs for purposes of product costing; and (ii) develop
an efficient and timely management information system.
7.     Investment:  CTD shall (i) carry out, for each investment project,
technical, economical and financial analyses; (ii) establish the
feasibility of projects it proposes for approval by SB. SB will
promptly and favorably consider such projects. The initiative
for maintenance and replacement investments shall be with the
individual plants. SB and CTD will promptly and favorably consider
such proposals.
8.     Debts:  SB will authorize each individual plant to maintain lines of
credits with a financial institution up to a maximum which shall
adequately cover its working capital requirements. In the case of
other financing a plant proposes to contract, SB shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay its approval.

9.     Purchase Contracts:  The individual plants will be empowered to enter
into purchase contracts for domestically produced current inputs and
spare parts. For imports and machinery contracts SB shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of the plant's proposed
award. CTD shall have priority to use the portion of the aggregate
of plants' export earnings permitted by the laws of the Borrower for
the purpose of purchasing their imported operational requirements
and service their debt.

improve present financial reporting system and cost accounting system;
within individual plants operational department including establishment
of a standard costing system and replacement costs for fixed assets;
close cooperation with the technical consultant (GHERZI TEXTILE
ORGANIZATION, Zurich, Switzerland) will be required;
(iii)   improve the basic financial planning, budgeting and control system;
this work will concentrate initially on immediate possible improvements
and will subsequently incorporate the new standard costing system
of item (ii) above;
(iv)    establish and introduce a meaningful system for financial ratios and
targets for improved control purpose;
(v)     improve the investment planning system on the plant level;
(vi)    establish and introduce a project cost reporting systems;
15.       On the ASM level the financial consultant would assist SB staff to;
(i)     improve the present financial reporting system (both, intra-ASM and
to plants and SB headquarters. Emphasis will be on more speedy
feedback to plants and CTD);
(ii)    design a more market-oriented budgeting system for ASM, which will
involve, both at the preparation time and during subsequent budget
control, CTD   and individual plants;
(iii)    improve the present inventory control systems at ASM warehouses and
in retail stores.
3.  Stage II
16.       During Stage II, which will be financed by the IBRD loan, the financial
consultants will assist   SB  staff to introduce the systems developed for Eregli
and Manisa, in the other  SB   plants,adjusted for specific requirements there.
They will train   SB  personnel in the use of the revised systems and would provide
a supervisory function for PIU staff, which will help introduce the revised systems.
Similarly financial assistance will be provided in CTD to implement the revised
financial7management systems , including an improved investment planning and contrcl
system.
17.       Detailed terms of reference for Stage II will be similar to those for
Stage I with a detailed plan indicating the sequence of assistance in individual
.plants. These terms of reference will be drafted by the financial consultants for
review and approval by SB and Bank.    A financial consultant is presently being
selected by UNDP/UNIDO, through international selection procedures, acceptable to
the Bank.    Provided the selected firm's performance during Stage I is satisfactory,
the firms would continue to provide its services during Stage II.

TURKEY - SUMERBANK COTTON TEXTILE RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
CTD - ESTIMATES OF CAPITAL COST AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
A.     Assumptions for Capital Cost Estimates
1.        The Base Cost Estimate (BCE) reflects estimated equipment prices pre-
vailing in April 1979. The detailed list of machinery and equipment and their
unit prices, and construction and engineering works are given in the Project
File.
2.        The following assumptions have been the basis of estimating the BCE.
Machinery and Equipment costs: include 2 years supply of spare parts; Freight
and Insurance: Estimated to be 4% of local and 8% of foreign FOB price;
Erection: 2% on local and 4% on foreign FOB prices. Physical contingencies
are 7% on the BCE. No physical contingency for spares and,components for
existing facilities are included.
Following rates of inflation are assumed to calculate price contingencies.
1979      1980       1981       1982       1983
12%      10.5%        9%         8%         7%
The same rates are applied both to foreign and local components, based on the
assumption that the differences in domestic and international inflation rates
will be accounted for by adjustments in foreign exchange rates.
3.        Interest during construction for IBRD loan and suppliers credit is
calculated based on the expected schedule of expenditure (Project File, Item Q),
and at 10.5% p.a. and 8% p.a. respectively.
B.     Assumptions for Working Capital Requirements
4.        In the estimates of Working Capital requirements certain assumptions
have been made, which would provide a current ratio of 1.2 of above during the
Project period. These assumptions, which are explained below, depart from the
most recent historical data, but are modified in order to reflect the expected



ANNEX 6-1
- 90 -                                Page 2
improvement due to the technical assistance. Furthermore, a gradual build-up
of working capital has been assumed to avoid undue financial strains.
(i) Current Assets
(a)   Cash
5% of cash operating costs is considered to be sufficient.
Any excess or deficit cash will be shown in the cash surplus
balance account.
(b)   Accounts Receivable
25 days or 7% of the sales volume is accounted.
(c)   Inventory
Raw Materials: 34% of yearly requirements or 122 days of
supply is used.
Work in Process: Inventory of work in process is assumed
to be 7% of total operating costs.
Finished Goods: The finished goods inventory is estimated
to be 11% of total operating costs.
Spare Parts: One year supply of spare parts is assumed.
Others: Other inventories include goods in transit and
consigned goods, accounting for 2% of total operating costs.
(ii) Current Liabilities
(a)   Accounts Payable
Accounts payable is approximately 25% of total cash
operating costs.
(b)   Other Current Liabilities
Other current liabilities represent short term borrowing,
advances received and tax payables, all of which account
for about 29% of total sales. At the end of March, 1980,
however, TL 2,490 million of CTD's short term was converted
to equity. Due to this paper transaction, CTD's other
current liabilities are reduced by this amount throughout
the projection period.

SUMERBANK COTTON TEXTILE RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
Assumptions Made for Financial Projection
A.     Sales Price
1.        Beginning 1980 prices are used as the basis of price projection and
converted into US dollars at the rate of US$1.00 - TL 70. Then the prices are
inflated in line with international inflation during 1980 through 1982 period.
In 1983, the price is increased by 2.1% which is about one third of the expected
level of international inflation in the year so that SB's long term profit margin
reach the industry norm (3.0 - 4.0% on sales). There is no real increase in-
cluded in the price projections throughout the project period despite of projected
improvements in quality. The improved profitability is almost exclusively due
to improved operations and for the remainder, due to expansion in certain
specialty areas (blended fabric, sewing thread, garments).
Constant 1980 unit prices used for the projection are listed below:
In TL            In US$
cotton yarn/kg                         TL 221           US$3.15
sewing thread/kg                       TL 463           US$6.62
grey fabric/square meter               TL  55           US$0.78
finished fabric
printed/square meter                TL  62           US$0.89
dyed/bleached/square meter          TL  84           US$1.20
color woven/square meter            TL  99           US$1.42
blended fabric                      TL 110           Us$1.57
garments  a/ pcs                       TL 528           uS$7.54
a/ Garment price per piece is the weighted average and adjusted
each year to reflect the changes in product mix. In determining
sales prices of garments, it is assumed that fabric costs represents
60% of the garments sales prices.

B.     Operating Costs
2.        During the past year, repeated devaluation together with various
price stabilization mechanism affected the local cotton price. After June 1979
devaluation exchange rates applicable for agricultural commodities including
cotton are set at US$1.00 = TL 35, compared with the general exchange rate of
TL 47.1. This would effectively mean approximately US 43 cents of price
differential per kilo of raw cotton in favor of local cotton users. After
January 1980 devaluation, the exchange rate applicable to cotton export is
adjusted to TL 70, which is also the general exchange rate. The government
of Turkey, however introduced a new price stabilization levy averaging
TL 38 or US 54 cents per kilo of raw cotton. International price of Mexican
S.M. 1-1/6'variety projected by the Bank is used as the basis of raw cotton
and adjusted for transportation costs and the price stabilization levy. It
is assumed that the amount of levy would remain unchanged through the projection
period..
3.        Historically raw materials accounts for about 35 to 43% of production
costs as compared with 14 to 17% for labor, 11% for yarn production taxes, and
4% for maintenance. Among the raw materials the main cost item is cotton which
representing aroung 25 to 30% of the total production cost. All of the fabrics
needed for garment manufacturing are assumed to be purchased from outside at
US$1.49/square meter. Dyes amd chemicals costs are assumed to be US 5.5 cents
per square meter of processed fabric based on historical data. Current price
of US$298/kg for polyester fiber is used. All of these are beginning 1980
prices and inflated by international inflation rate, except for polyester
fiber, dyes and chemicals and utilities, to which a real annual price increase
of 2% is added.
4.        The actual wages and salary payments during the first 3 quarters of
1979 are used as the base labor rates. The change in labor requirements were
taken into account. Based on the historical data during 1973-1979 period,
salary and wage rates are assumed to add 1.5% real increase on and above
inflation each year.
5.        Production Tax on Yarn is called for under Turkish law.  Tax rate
included in yarn ex-works price is 35%. When used internally, production costs
plus 10% profit is used in place of ex-factory price. The production tax on
yarn, in fact, eliminates the favorable price differential of raw cotton for
domestic cotton users.
Utilities
6.        Based on SB cotton textile operations historical data, following usage
factor is established and used for projections.
Spinning:   1.8 kwh per kg of yarn (Ne 20)
Weaving:    0.5 kwh per square meter of fabric
Processing: 200 liter of water per kg of processed fabric
25 kg of steam per kg of processed fabric
1.5 kwh per kg of processed fabric.
Based on these coefficients, utility prices for each stage of production is
estimated as follows all in constant 1980 terms;
Yarn: US 5.7 cents per kg of yarn
Woven Fabric: US 1.4 cents per square meter of woven fabric
Processed Fabric: US 3.5/cents per square meter of processed fabric
Utility expenses are assumed to increase 4% in real terms each year.

7.        Financial charges assume an interest rate of (i) 10.5% p.a., 17 years
maturity, including 4 years of grace for IBRD loan, and (ii) 8% p.a., 6 years
maturity, including 1 year of grace for suppliers credits.
8.        The depreciation rate for textile machinery is 7-10% p.a., and for
civil works 2-6% p.a. Weighted average of 8% is used.
Maintenance
9.        Annual maintenance requirements (materials) have been estimated by
GHERZI/SB staff and inflated using international inflation rates.
Other Major Operating Costs
10.       Short-term interest is estimated to be 1% of operating costs in the
early years of the project. However, this is gradually increased to 1.5% of
the operating costs despite the gradual reduction in short term debt through
financial restructuring as CTD starts financing its needs increasingly by short-
term loans based on market terms for interest.
11.       Tax rate of 41.7% is used for projection purposes to account for
income tax, financial equilization tax and mandatory contribution to industrial
institutions such as Turkish Productivity Center, etc.
