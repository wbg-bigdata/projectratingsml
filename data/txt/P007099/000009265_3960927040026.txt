ECUADOR
INSTITUTO ECUATORIANO DE TELZCOMUNICACIONES (ISTEL)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Loan and Project Su_ary
Borrowert            Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones (IESTEL)
Guarantor:           The Republic of Ecuador
Amounts              US$45 million equivalent
Terms:               Seventeen years including a five-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate
Pro3ect
Descriptions       The project, the first Bank telecommunications operation
in Ecuador, will help expand and rehabilitate telecommuni-
cations facilities and assist IETEL's institutional deve-
lopment. Specific components will: (a) expand local
telephone service to connect 189,000 additional
subscribers; (b) rehabilitate the existing network to
improve service to about 50,000 existing subscribers;
(c) expand the long distance network; (d) extend service
to rural commmnities through installation of 76 exchanges
in rural areas; and (e) expand and modernize international
telephone, telex and data service. The project would
assist IETEL's institutional development by helping to
finances (a) an agreement for technical cooperation or
*twinning* between ISTEL and a more developed
telecomunuications administration; (b) a management
development program for IETEL staff; and (c) technical
assistance to help strengthen IETEL's project
implementation capacity.
Proiect Benefits
and Risks:        Business and rural subscribers will be primary beneficia-
ries of expansion of the network. However, all sub-
scribers will benefit from overall improved quality of
service--particularly in Guayaquil where deterioration of
the cable network and congestion are most severe. Busi-
ness and Government subscribers will be the major benefi-
ciaries of the expansion of long distance telephone, telex
and data facilities and mobile telephone services.
Project risks relate tot (a) IETEL's ability to implement
the project, given past low levels of investment and
institutional weaknesses; and (b) maintaining management
stability and political support for institutional
improvements and policy changes. The first will be
minimized bys (a) using private foreign and local
contractors for cable installation; and (b) having turnkey



- ii .
contracts for exchange and transmission equipment. Also,
in the Guayaquil region, consulting engineers will assist
IZTZL with project implementation. The second risk will
be minimized through agreements on a long-term action plan
committing the company to specific performance targets and
actions during project implementations and through close
supervIsion during 1988 and 1989. Loan conditionalities
with respect to project implementation will also help
reduce this risk.

ECUADOR
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Telecomunnications services in Ecuador are inadequate.  There is
large unmet demand for service, and quality of service is poor in both rural
and urban areas. Principal constraints to efficient sector performance and
development have been (a) the poor institutional environment of the primary
service provider, Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones (IETEL) which
has limited its ability to implement projects and operate and maintain the
network; (b) poor pricing policies which have limited resource generation and
increased network congestion; and (c) severe underinvestment in the sector due
to lack of resources, low sector priority and poor procurement practices.
1.2      The Bank reviewed the organization, finances and investment program
of the telecommunications sector in 1986 during preparation of the Country
Economic Memorandum (April 87). Bank's assistance to the sector was requested
by the Government of Ecuador and IETEL and is being provided through two
initiatives. The ongoing Public Sector Management Loan (Ln. 2156-EC) will
help strengthen financial and administrative systems. The proposed project
will focus on alleviating physical and resource constraints affecting sector
performance and furthar institutional development.



- 2 -
II. THE TBLZCOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background
Sector Orsanization
2.1      The Ministry of Public Works and Communications is responsible for
overall supervision and control of th telecommunications sector in Ecuador.
IRToL provides International and domestic long distance telephone and telex
services and local telephone services to over 952 of the subscribers. Addi-
tionally, INTEL has been delegated responsibility for allocation and control
of the radio frequency spectrum. Empresa Publica Municipal de Telefonos, Agua
Potable y Alcantarillado (ETAPA), a corporation owned by the municipality of
Azuay, provides local telephone services in the city of Cuenca. In addition
to the public switched network, there are several dedicated private networks
to meet the specialized requirements of private companies, public sector
entities in the petroleum and energy sectors, and the Armed Forces. Ecuador
hae no telecommunications manufacturing industry as such although some ancil-
lary equipment, such as small diameter subscriber cables, are produced
locally.
2.2      The Ministry of Public Works and Communications exercises control of
INTEL through chairmanship of its Board. While the Act which established
IBTEL in 1972 formally gives it the rights associated with a public corpora.
tlon, Government procedures constrain IETEL's operational autonomy
(para. 2.10).
Access to Service
2.3      With 343,000 direct exchange lines (DELs) in service, the average
telephone density in Ecuador, at end 1987, was 3.5 direct exchange lines
(DELs) per 100 inhabitants. This compares unfavorably with the averages for
other Latin American countries (Colombia 9.5, Venezuela 5.8) and to the
average for Latin America as a whole (about 7 DELs per 100 inhabitants).
About 981 of all telephone lines are concentrated in urban areas. Quito and
Guayaquil, with 28S of the country's population, had 772 of the DELs.  Rural
areas, with about 401 of the population, had only public call offices (PCOs)
or no service. Nearly all DELs were served by automatic exchanges, with only
90 lines, In the rural areas, served from small manual exchanges. There were
1,000 coin box telephones and public call offices. Automatic telex service
was available to about 3,230 subscribers of whom about 881 were in Quito and
Guayaquil.
Usage of Service
2.4      Current statistics do not distinguish between residential and busi-
ness telephones, nor is there data on the composition of traffic. However,
since domestic call charges were unchanged over the last 30 years, the revenue
from domestic (local and long distance) calls per DEL is a good indicator of
the usage per line. Over the period 1982 to 1986, the domestic call revenues
grew on average nearly 271 per annum compared to a 41 growth in DELs. The
more than doubling of usage per line over the period indicates the level of



unsatisfied dew=nd for telephone connections, estimated at 422 of total demand
at end 1987.
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
2.5      At end 1987, total telephone switching capacity was 459,000 lines and
telex exchange capacity 7,550 lines. (This includes the 28,900 lines of tele-
phone switching capacity provided by ETAPA in Cuenca). Annex 1 gives statis-
tics on the development of facilities over the period 1980-87. Details of
existing facilities are provided in Annex 2. Despite a large unmet demand
(para. 2.7), only about 75Z of telephone exchange capacity is presently used.
This is largely due to underutilization of capacity of recently commissioned
exchanges which have been placed in service ahead of expansion of the outside
plant necessary to connect it to subscribers.
2.6      The quality of service is poor, with many outages and long delays in
restoration. Only 50Z of faults are cleared within three days. Call comple-
tion rate is low, averaging only 35Z. There is also severe congestion on mny
inter-urban routes during business hours when the call completion rate is
practically zero. The poor quality of service is primarily due to (a) delayed
rehabilitation and replacement of faulty or unserviceable equipment and
cables; (b) equipment imbalance resulting from faulty planning and delayed
investment; and (c) poor maintenance.  About 202 of the exchange equipmeni
needs replacement. Most of these old and obsolete exchanges are situated in
the business areas and serve heavy traffic-generating subscribers. Equipment
regrading is overdue in many of the older electromechanical exchanges. Re-
dimensioning of exchanges and inter-exchange routes for efficient handling of
traffic is also necessary. The cable network requires replacement in partic-
ular sections as well as rejointing where use of inadequate materials and
improper splicing procedures has made the waterproofing ineffective. This is
a particular problem in Guayaquil, where there is a sharp increase of cable
faults during the rainy season. A recent survey of the Guayaquil network
indicated that 202 of the primary and 50Z of the secondary cable network needs
to be replaced. This has affected service to about 50,000 subscribers. In
addition, lack of free cable pairs and poor operational practices have often
resulted in bypass of the congested secondary network and direct connection to
the subscriber from primary cables. This, coupled with non-maintenance of
updated cable records, has created problems in fault clearance. A severe
shortage of skilled maintenance engineers has further aggravated the problem.
Demand for Service
2.7      The available data on demand is limited as IETEL does not maintain
waiting lists in areas where exchanges are saturated and in areas where th*re
is currently no service. Even where waiting lists are maintained, there is
significant suppressed demand as potential customers are discouraged from
registering by the current long lead time in obtaining connections. The
historic growth rate in DELs over the period 1982-87 of about 52 per annum is
no indication as it reflects a supply constraint due to underinvestment in the
sector. On the basis of demographic and economic data, IETEL estimates the
total demand (working lines and unmet demand) at end December 1987, to be
589,000. Demand is estimated to grow by 52 per annum over 1987-92. These
estimates are reasonable. INTEL aims to meet 802 of demand by 1992 as against



- 4 -
582 at end 1987. A demand and supply curve for telephone lines in Ecuador is
given in Annex 3.
B. The Entity
Organization and Management
2.8      ISTEL, the proposed borrower and implementing agency, is a govern-
ment-owned corporation administered by a six-member Board of Directors, whose
chairman is the Minister for Public Works and Comunications. The other
members are representatives from: the Ministry of Finance, the Armed Forces,
the National Development Council (CONADE), the Engineering Association and the
General Manager oi IETUL.  The Board establishes policy and approves tariff
proposals, procurement contracts and other major operational decisions.
Tariffs approved by the Board are subsequently coatfirmed by a ministerial
accord issued by the Minister of Public Works and Comunuications.
2.9      The organization is divided into a Corporate Headquarters and two
Regions with regional headquarters in Quito and Guayaquil. In general, the
Regions are autonomous with respect to detailed engineering, operations and
maintenance, training and personnel and control their day-to-day operations
within approved budget ceilings.   Efforts have recently been made to improve
intra-regional coordination through changes in organizational structure. The
effectiveness of these changes will be assessed and reconuendation. for
changes will be made to IETEL's Board (para. 3.3(vi)). IETEL's organization
chart is given in Annex 4.
2.10     Although it is an autonomous corporation, IETEL's operations are
subject to review and approval by several Government agencies. The Ministry
of Finance approves annual budgets for operating and capital expenditures and
any subsequent intra-category transfers. Procurement, which is governed by
Ecuador's Procurement Law, requires approval of several Government agencies.
Government personnel policies and procedures which apply to administrative,
financial and higher level technical staff generally do not fit in a business
profit-oriented enterprise. During the period of project implementation, and
as part of an agreed action plan, IETEL will review existing personnel
policies and other factors in its institutional environment affecting opera-
tional efficiency and make recommendations for necessary changes (para.
3.3(vi)).
Staffing and Training
2.11     As of December 31, 1987, IETEL's staff totalled about 6,027.  While
IETEL's staff ratio of 18 per 1,000 DEL's is reasonable, being only 2 to 3
times that of telephone companies in developed countries, staff composition is
not in line with the requirements of the company. Technical staff (engineers,
technicians, operators, and linemen) constitute only 43Z of total staff and is
less than administrative staff. Moreover this percentage has declined over
the last 10 years while the percentage of administrative and support staff has
increased. IETEL's staff composition is given in Annex 5. Current IETEL
plans to improve staff productivity to 1511,000 lines by 1991 will require a
virtual freeze in hiring administrative staff, and retraining to meet the
requirements of the expansion program. Development of a comprehensive man-
power and training plan is a necessary first step (para. 3.3(iii)).



-5-
2.12     Training of IETEL staff is provided mainly through the Regional
training centers at Quito and Guayaquil.  Direccion Nacional de Personal
provides limited training in general and administrativo subjects and some
specialized telecommunications training has been provided by equipment
suppliers. Training in INTEL has been inadequate, and budget allocations for
both external and internal training have been underutilized; the training
budget was reduced in 1987 because of perceived ineffectiveness. The national
training unit at corporate staff headquarters has not played an effective role
in coordinating and planning training activities. Regional training centers
are poorly managed, available facilities are not well maintained, and there is
a severe shortage of qualified instructors. IETEL has taken some measures to
overcome the deficiencies in the more critical areas. Phase 1 of a Swedish
technical assistance program provided training in maintenance of exchange
equipment and some initial assistance with outside plant maintenance. To
supplement its own resources IETEL is using local private contractors to
assist with network maintenance. Additional funds have also been allocated to
IETEL under the PSHL to provide urgently needed assistance in outside plant
maintenance (para. 3.3(iv)). A twinning arrangement to be financed by the
proposed project (para. 3.3) will provide substantial support to IETEL in
staff training and development including assistance in strengthening in-house
training facilities. Additional training will also be provided through
Phase 2 of the Swedish assistance program (para. 3.3(iv)).
Billing and Collection
2.13     IETEL's billing is fully computerized.  There are marked differences
in performance between the Guayaquil and Quito regions. 'While bills are
issued on schedule in Quito, within 20 days of the end of the billing period,
there have been major delays in Guayaquil. At the time of loan appraisal,
issue of bills in Guayaquil was 5 months behind schedule. Billing was brought
up to date with the assistance of an external consulting firm. As agreed
during appraisal, IETEL submitted to the Bank, prior to loan negotiations, a
status report on billing in Guayaquil and measures taken to help prevent
extensive delays in the future.
2.14     Collection of accounts receivables needs to be improved in both
regions, although the problem is more acute in Guayaquil. IETEL has been
reluctant to enforce disconnection policies in the case of state-owned enter-
prises and in the Guayaquil region where there are major problems with bil-
ling. Measures agreed under institutional action plan to reduce accounts
receivable include seeking revised arrangements for payment of Government
bills, carrying out an inventory of outstanding receivables with the assist-
ance of PSML consultants (para. 3.3(i)), follow up legal action and more
vigorous application of disconnection procedures in respect of overdue
accounts.
Accounting
2.15     IETEL's accounting systems place heavy emphasis on cash budget and
revenues. Cash operating and capital expenditures are approved annually by
the Government and are used as a control tool by IETEL's management. Coummer-
cial accounts however have been largely ignored and have been unreliable due



to inconsistent policies and lack of documentation and control. The auditors
found that several accounting procedures were not in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, the most important being, presentation of
revenues on a cash basis and costs on an accrual basis, inconsistent deprecia-
tion of fixed assets and inappropriate recording of some asset and income
items resulting on balance in understatement of these accounts. In assessing
historical performance (para. 4.2) financial data has been adjusted where
possible, including adjusting cash revenues to reflect accruals. Technical
assistance provided under the IETEL component of the PSML will support IhTiL
efforts to take corrective actions (para. 3.3(i)).
Audit
2.16     IETEL has been slow in finalizing accounts and in having them
audited. Also, the Controller General's Office, which has responsibility for
auditing state enterprises has delayed initiating hiring procedures for exter-
nal auditors until IETEL's financial statements were available. This has
further delayed availability of audited accounts. Audited financial state-
ments for FY86 were available only in February 1988. IETEL has appointed
auditors for its 1987 accounts and has agreed that auditors will continue to
be appointed in a timely manner. Appointment of auditors for FY87 accounts
was a condition of Board presentation (para. 6.3(a)). Improvements in
accounting systems and procedures in FY89 will reduce the time required to
finalize accounts and to prepare draft financial statements. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that audited financial statements for FY88
will be submitted to the Bank within eight months of the close of the fiscal
year, and for FY89 onwards unaudited and audited financial statements will be
submitted to the Bank within four months and six months respectively, of the
close of the fiscal year (para. 6.1(a)).
C. Sector Development
Sector Goals and Obiectives
2.17     The Government of Ecuador has recognized that well functioning tele-
communications services are crucial to economic development and to achieving
growth in non-traditional exports and increased efficiencies in productive
sectors. At the same time, current economic difficulties make it essential to
improve the efficiency of public enterprises and public sector finances. In
line with this, the main goals of the telecommunications sector are tot
(a), improve quality of, and access to, telecommunications services in
business centers and rural areas through network rehabilitation and
efficient and cost effective network expansion;
(b) increase operational efficiency through improved management and orga-
nization; and
(c) generate higher revenues to cover operating costs and contribute a
significant percentage of investment costs.



-7-
Sector Constraints
2.18     The principal constraints to sector development have been the
followings
(a) Poor Institutional Environment. Government regulations and proce-
dures vhich govern procurement, financial management, capital and
operating budgets and personnel restrict managerial options and
affect operational efficiency. Civil service salaries which apply to
managerial, administrative and most higher level technical staff,
limit IBTEL's ability to attract qualified staff and to link salaries
to performance. IZTEL also suffers from internal deficiencies in its
systems and procedures for financial management, accounting,
corporate planning and administration. Staff training has been
inadequate contributing to a large extent to poor network mainte-
nance. IETEL's management places more emphasis on technical rather
than financial, personnel and commercial management. The company
needs to become more business oriented. Both the Government and
IETEL have recognized the urgent need for improvements in IETEL.
ISTEL has taken initiatives to improve performance such as a corp-
orate reorganization and strengthening operations and maintenance
procedures with assistance of foreign consultants. 'hile some cons-
traints need to be addressed in the context of overall public sector
management in Ecuador, the current project and the PSHL will support
major institutional development efforts (para. 3.3).
(b) Poor Pricing Policies. While international tariffs have been pegged
to the US dollar, local and long distance domestic tariffs have
declined sharply in real terms.   The domestic call charge at 0.3
sucre (US$0.0012) per impulse had not been adjusted in more than
thirty years and was previous to the recent increase, among the
lowest in the world. This resulted in increasing subsidies to local
service, reducing revenues for expansion and rehabilitation and
increasing network congestion from excessive use.   Domestic tariffs
were adjusted to 1.5 sucres per impulse.
(c) Sector Underinvestment. There has been severe underinvestment in the
sector. Investments averaged only 0.5Z of GDP over the past four
years, whereas 12 of GDP would be needed for rapid development. This
reflects (i) lack of resources, (ii) low sector priority and thus
limited access to external financing, and (iii) procurement difficul-
ties which limited expansion to small purchases from existing
suppliers. ISTEL has financed the development of telecommunications
services principally through credits from a few suppliers with whom
it has had a long-standing relationship.
2.19     Bank Group's Role and Strategy.  The Bank's strategy in Ecuador is to
support macroeconomic and sector policy reforms through both policy based
lending and project loans. As part of these efforts, emphasis is placed on
improving the efficiency of public enterprises, supporting Government efforts
to improve public finances and development of economic infrastructure through
appropriate rehabilitation and expansion investments. The proposed project in



conjunction with the PSML is designed to extend these efforts to the
Telecomunuications sector. Bank involvement will help alleviate key
constraints which have limited sector development. Major emphasis will be
placed on improving IETEL's institutional performance by (a) strengthening the
institution through improved staff training and management development,
(b) improving pricing policies, and (c) determining necessary changes in
IBTEL's external and internal environment to improve its operational
efficiency. Progress in these are4as will be monitored during project
implementation through regular jo.nt review of performance vie-a-vist  (a)
agreed performance indicators and (b) the action plan for institutional
improvement (para. 3.3). External financing from Bank and cofinancing sources
will help the sector correct past underinvestment.   Use of international
competitive bidding (ICB) for Bank-financed equipment and the promotion of
competAtive procurement for non-Bank-financed items should result in
significantly lower equipment costs than in the past. Contracts for outside
plant installation will help develop local contractors and encourage transfer
of know-how in the case of joint ventures.

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.1      IETEL's investment program for the period 1988-1994 comprises ongoing
works, the proposed project and preinvestment for post-1991 works. The
program is consistent with the sector objectives outlined in pars. 2.17. The
total investments under the program are estimated at US$835.9 million with a
foreign component of US$536.7 million. Ongoing works, which will add 158,000
lines of switching capacity in 1988, are cofinanced through bilateral funds
and suppliers' credits. The investments in ongoing works during 1988-1992 are
estimated at US$40.2 million with a foreign component of US$25.8 million.
Other works include 80,000 lines for Region 2 at a total cost of US$133.7
million and a foreign cost of US$93.5 million. Initial investments for future
works is projected at US$332.0 million with a foreign component of US$176.0
million. The proposed project is detailed in Annex 6 and the investment
program is given in Annex 7.
Proiect Objectives
3.2      The principal objectives of the project are to help
(a) improve the quality of, and access to, telecommunications services in
Ecuador through rehabilitation and expansion of the telecomnunica-
tions network and replacement of obsolete equipment;
(b) strengthen IETEL's management and organization and increase its com-
mercial orientation through a comprehensive institutional development
program;
5C) improve service to business subscribers by modernizing and expanding
international telephone, telex and data services;
(d) improve IETEL's procurement practices; and
(e) increase private sector participation through development and use of
private contractors for construction of outside plant.
Proiect Description
3.3      Specifically, the project consist3 of the followingt
Part A.  Investment Program:
(a) expansion of local telephone services by the addition of about
189,350 lines of local exchange equipment with associated cables to
make about 189,000 connections;
(b) rehabilitation of the cable network in Guayaquil to improve service
to about 50,000 existing subscribers;



- 10 -
(c) expansion of the long distance network by the addition of five new
transit exchanges and associated interexchange routes and reorganiza-
tion of the network for efficient traffic handling;
(d) extension of telephone service to rural communities in Ecuador by the
installation of 76 new exchanges in rural areas, and provision of
service to isolated areas (i.e., the Galapagos islands);
(e) installation of a new international telephone exchange with capacity
of 1,500 terminations and a new satellite earth station at Guayaquil;
(f)  extension of telex and data services; and
(g) installation of a mobile telephone service.
Part B.  Institutional Improvement:
(a) twinning IETEL with a more developed telecommunications administra-
tion to improve the performance of key technical and managerial
staff, increase the company's commercial orientation, strengthen
IETEL's in-house training program and sensitize IETEL to internal and
external factors affecting its operational efficiency.
(b) carrying out a tailor-made management development program for IETEL
managers with assistance of local management consultants; and
(c)  strengthening IETEL's project implementation capacity through techni-
cal assistance in the preparation of detailed network plans, compu-
terization of cable records and supervision of the rehabilitation and
expansion of the network.
These measures, which will be financed by the proposed Bank/CDC loan, form
part of a comprehensive timebound institutional action plan (Annex 8) agreed
with IETL which will be carried out during the period of project implementa-
tion. The plan includes actions to be carried out with IETEL resources as
well as measures to improve institutional performance with technical assist-
ance from Sweden, Japan under the proposed OECP loan, and the Bank under both
the proposed project and the PSML. Key areas to be strengthened and sources
of assistance are as follows:
(i) Financial Systems and Procedures. The IETEL component of the PSML
will help improve IETEL's financial and accounting systems and proce-
dures to overcome the deficiencies identified (para. 2.15). During
the period of project implementation, consultants financed under the
PSML will help IETEL design and implement an integrated commercial
accounting system (including cost accounting), carry out a physical
inventory of fixed assets and inventories, revalue fixed assets and
verify accounts receivables. Design and implementation of new
systems and training of staff are expected to be completed by July
1991.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that
(a) verification of accounts receivable will be completed by
September 30, 1989; (b) verification and revaluation of fixed assets
by December 31, 1989; and (c) fixed assets will be revalued
periodically (every year) during project implementation, in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.1 (b)).



- 11 -
(ii) Pro1ect Implementation. Technical assistance under the proposed Bank
and OECF loans will provide support to IETEL staff in implementinS
the proposed investment program. Consulting engineers, financed
through the proposed Bank loan vill assist ISTEL staff in the
Guayaquil region to prepare detailed cable network plans, computerize
cable assignment records and supervise the rehabilitation and expan-
sion of the cable network. Consultants financed under the OECF loan
will help INTEL prepare and evaluate bid documents, negotiate
contracts, supervise installation and carry out acceptance tests.
The project will be coordinated and supervised by a project manager
to be appointed at corporate level, head of the Project
Administration Unit.
(iii) Manpower Planning and Training. An important project objective is to
increase the availability of competent staff during project implemen-
tation. It was agreed during loan appraisal that by August 1988,
IETEL would carry out a detailed assessment of its current staff and
develop a manpower and training plan on the basis of productivity
targets and the staffing requirements of its current investment
program. This will provide a base for the two initiatives to be
supported by the proposed Bank loan. First, the twinning arrangement
between IETEL and a more developed telecommunications organization
which will provide for exchange of staff between the two companies,
on-the-job training of IETEL staff and technical assistance to
improve IETEL's in-house training capability. Visits have been
arranged to potential partners. in addition to staff training,
interaction through the twinning arrangement with a commercially
oriented telecommunications organization will sensitize IETEL staff
to factors constraining institutional efficiency. The proposed Bank
loan will finance the fees of the twinnitg institution and foreign
currency expenditure of IETEL staff participating in the program.
Additionally, the Bank loan will help finance tailor-made management
development program for IETEL managers which will be carried out with
the assistance of local management consultants. The program will
make extensive use of case studies relevant to IETEL's business
environment. About 300 hours of training will be provided over a two
year period for the estimated 40 managerial staff expected to partic-
ipate in the program.
(iv) Operations and Maintenance. A key objective of the action plan is to
improve the operations and maintenance of the cable network in
particular that in Guayaquil. To provide urgently needed assistance
in Guayaquil US$100,000 has been allocated from the PSML to finance
the expenses of three cable supervisors who will assist and help
train IETEL staff in the maintenance of the outside plant network.
The consultants were in the field from August to November 1988.
Phase 1I of the Swedish technical assistance program will provide an
additional 51 manmonths of consultancy over a two-year period to help
improve operations and maintenance systems and procedures for the
cable network. The consultancy contract has been submitted for
approval to relevant Government agencies. The progress of this
critically needed assistance program will be monitored closely during
implementation of the proposed project.



- 12 -
(v) Traffic Management. Lack of expertise and equipment to monitor and
effectively manage traffic is a key factor affecting network perfor-
mance. IETEL has agreed to carry out a traffic study, in accordance
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, which is expected
to be completed by negotiations. The proposed Bank loan will finance
necessary traffic measuring equipment. IETEL will establish a
traffic management unit by end 1989.
(vi) Institutional Environment. During the period of project implementa-
tion, IETEL, assisted by the twinning institution, will review
existing personnel policies, assess the strengths and weaknesses of
its new organizational structure and identify changes in internal and
external regulations and policies to improve the efficiency of
IETEL's commercial operations.  Recommendations for changes in these
areas will be submitted by IETEL to its Board by December 1989. The
Bank will be given the opportunity to comment on proposed changes.
Management stability is an important element in successful implementation of
the proposed institutional development program. The Bank received assurances
that the guarantor will strive to maintain continuity in management during the
project period and will advise the Bank of pending changes in senior
management. Progress towards achieving the objectives of the action plan will
be monitored (a) through agreed performance indicators (para. 3.11); and (b)
by reviewing actual progress vis-a-vis specified completion dates for ongoing
and proposed institutional initiatives. Terms of reference for the technical
cooperation under the twinning arrangement are given in Annex 9 and for the
consultants' services to be financed under the Bank loan in Annexes 10 and 11.

Project Cost
3.4      The total cost of the project is estimated at Sucres 124.2 billion
(US$330.0 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of Sucres
90.9 billion (US$241.4 million equivalent). These project costs reflect:
(a) the contract price for equipment for which contracts have already been
signed; (b) the median price of the bids received for equipment for which bids
have already been received; and (c) estimated end 1987 prices based on IETEL's
experience with contracts relating to ongoing works and on experience in other
countries for other components, with inflation adjustments to bring them to
mid-1988 level. The local cost component includes Sucres 14.6 billion ($58.5
million equivalent) in custom duties and taxes. IETEL is liable for custom
duties at an average rate of 262 for telecommunications equipment. Details of
project costs are given in Annex 7 and reproduced in Table 3.1.

lb  Local costs include S::cres 14,620 million (US$58.5 million) in customs duties and
local taxes, which are not eligible for Bank financing.
Contingencies
3.5      Physical contingencies are 52 on local and foreign costs for equip-
ment, 102 on local and foreign costs for services and 10 on civil works.
Price contingencies for foreign costs are based on increases of 3.02 p.a. in
1989 and 1990, and 4.02 p.a. in 1991 and thereafter. Price contingencies for
local costs are assumed equal to global price increases, and the cost table is
calculated in equivalent US dollars. Total project costs in local currency
shown in the table reflect total project costs in dollars converted to sucres
at the projected exchange rates given in Annex 7. Price contingency in sucres
is the total Project cost less base cost plus physical contingencies.
Pro1ect Financing
3.6      The sources of project financing are indicated in Table 3.2.  The
project's foreign costs (US$241.4 million) will be financed by several



- 14 -
cofinanciers and IDTEL. The Commcnwealth Development Corporation (CDC) is
expected to provide a loan of £1S million (US$27 mllion). CDC, jointly vith
the Bank, will provitK full foreign cost financing for the expansion and reha-
bilitation of the local cable network, traffic measuring and test equipment,
training and management development, consultancy and some miscellaneous
project items (para. 3.10). The foreign cost of most of the other equipment
will be financed through bilateral funds and suppliers' credits from Japan,
France, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and Italy. Procurement contracts, including
financial arrangements, have already been signed with Italy, Spain and France.
A financing agrwemnt has been signed with Japan. Financing agreements with
Brasil and Mexico are pending Government approval. IZTEL will finance the
foreign exchange gap of about US$31.5 mlllion and the local costs of US$4.6
million from net internal cash generation. INTEL will be the borrower and
lmplementing agoncy for the Bank loan. The loan will be guaranteed by the
Government of Ecuador. It will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
loan that financing contracts with CDC, Italy and Japan would be effectlve.
With respect to other cofinancing sources where equipment to be financed is
not expected to be installed before mld-1990, the Bank would have the right to
suspend all or part of the project if such cofinancing is not in place by June
30, 1990 (para. 6.4).

be given the margin of preference as per Bank's guidelines. Bank-financed
contracts totalling US$1.0 million equivalent or more will be subject to prior
Bank review of procurement documentation and will cover about 982 of the total
value of such contracts. CDC has agreed that World Bank guidelines will be
followed in joint-financed (CDC/Bank) items. Other Bank-financed contracts
will be subject to post-award review. Selection of Bank-financed consultants
(about US$1.8 million) would be in accordance with Bank's guidelines. Most
other equipment not financed by the Bank (switching, transmission, telex,
etc.) is being procured through ICB on price and terms bidding where financing
offer& are also evaluated. Switching equipment for extensions on existing
exchanges to be financed by bilateral credit (US$16.5 million) will be
procured through negotiations with the original supplier. Buildings and other
civil works (US$7.5 million) will be procured through LCB. Procurement is
well advanced for non-Bank financed items. The list of goods and services to
be procured under the project is given in Annex 12 and Bank-financed bid
packages in Annex 13. Suppliers and financing sources have been identified
for all major items being procured through price and terms bidding. Contracts
have already been awarded for about 252 of exchange equipment.

3.8      The Bank has recently conducted a detailed review to determine the
consistency of Ecuadorian procurement procedures with Bank's guidelines.
During the review,the following specific points of conflict between Ecuador's
Procurement Law and Bank's procurement guidelines were identified. Local law
(a) permits, without further review, contract changes of up to 35? in quanti-
ties of goods or services, vs. 15? to 20X acceptable to the Bank; (b) requires
that foreign bidders have a local representative; (c) specifies a two-envelope
bid submission system, whereas the Bank requires a single envelope;
(d) requires that bid and performance guarantees be supplied by a bank
established in Ecuador, whereas the Bank accepts banks established anywhere;
(e) does not allow for price adjustments; (f) does not permit the submission
of bids by mail; (g) does not specify clear evaluatinn criteria for selecting
a bid; (h) requires that the financial solvency of a foreign bidder, when
certified by a foreign bank, must be recertified by a local bank; (i) requires



- 17 -
that letters of credit or other advances to cover purchases of goods or
services be secured by a 1002 bank guarantee by the seller or service
provider; (j) requires that consultants be registered in Ecuador to be eligi-
ble for hiring; and (k) requires that consultants be associated with Ecua-
dorian consultants having at least a 302 participation in the assignments
under consideration. However, Ecuador's procurement law (Article 45) also
provides that the procurement procedures of international financial institu-
tions supersede local law, so long as such procedures are expressly stated in
the relevant contracts. Accordingly, the draft Loan Agreement contains
express provisions to make the Bank's guidelines for procurement and its
procurement practices prevail over the specific provisions of local law which
are in conflict with Bank's guidelines and practices. These provisions were
confirmed at negotiations.
Implementation
3.9      IETEL will implement the project, except that installation would be
done by contractors under IETEL's supervision. Switching and eransmission
equipment will be installed by suppliers on a turnkey basis. Cable installa-
tion will be done by private contractors--local, foreign or joint venture
firms. Local contractors will be responsible for subscriber installation. Zn
the Guayaquil region, consulting engineers, financed under the proposed
Bank/CDC Loan, will assist IETEL with project implementation. Additional
support will also be provided under the OECF loans para. (3.3(ii)). A project
manager at corporate level head of a Project Administration Unit, will
coordinate and monitor implementation of physical project components as well
as progress on agreed actions under the institutional action plan. The
proposed schedule of construction for the major components is presented in
Annex 14. The project is expected to be completed by January 31, 1995.
Disbursements
3.10     The proposed Bank loan of US$45.0 million would be disbursed against
full standard documentation for (a) 10OZ of foreign expenditures on imported
goods; (b) 1002 of foreign expenditures, 502 of local expenditures on works
for cable construction; (c) 10O2 of total expenditures on consultants
including fees of twinning institution and the Project Administration Unit;
and (d) 1002 of foreign expenditures incurred for consultant services. Bank
financing of local expenditures will be net of taxes and duties. A Special
Account of US$3.8 million will be established with a bank acceptable to the
Bank. This figure represents four months estimated average disbursements.
The Special Account would be replenishable and would be used for disbursements
against all expenditures. Applications for replenishment will be submitted at
regular intervals. Disbursements for amounts less than USS20,000 would be
made against Statements of Expenditure. Signed contracts for consultancies
financed under the project would be conditions for disbursement against cable
contracts (para. 6.4). The implementing agency will submit withdrawal
applications to the Bank and CDC maintaining a ratio of Bank/CDC disbursements
of 45 to 27 in each withdrawal. The proposed loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by June 30, 1995. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given
in Annex 15, and is based on the standard disbursement profile for all
telecommunications projects in Latin America, FY76-85. The closing date of
the loan would be June 30, 1995.

Performance Indicators
3.11     Performance indicators to monitor IETEL's implementation, operational
and financial performance are given in Annex 16. While the targets for later
years are tentative, those fcr fiscal years 1989 and 1990 together with action
plans to achieve them, were agreed upon during loan negotiations (para. 6.1).
Performance with respect to these targets will be reviewed during project
supervision. In the event of delays in meeting targets, IETEL and the Bank
will discuss actions necessary to facilitate compliance. Assurances were also
sought from IETEL during loan negotiations that targets for each of the
subsequent years, together with any necessary corrective measures, will be
reviewed with the Bank by September 30 of the preceding fiscal year. During
project implementation, INTEL will report progress against the physical
indicators through quarterly project reports and progress against the
financial indicators will be reported in annual financial statements
(para. 6.1(c)).

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
4.1      ISTEL's financial performance was generally satisfactory during the
period 1982 to 1986. Growth in international revenues offset the decline in
real terms of domestic revenues and operating income and net income were posi-
tive throughout the period. ISTEL's financial position was healthy with
current ratio ranging from 1.6 in 1982 to 2.5 in 1986. The actual rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets in operation is difficult to assess due to
inadequacy of data but is estimated to have exceeded 122 over the period
(para. 4.4).
4.2      IETEL's historical financial performance over the period 1982-86,
based on adjusted financial data (para. 2.15), is given in Annex 17. Selected
indicators are summarized in Table 4.1. A decline in revenue and income
growth from 1982 through 1984 due to lack of tariff adjustments was reversed
in 1985, when floating of the dollarlsucre exchange rate resulted in a sharp
increase in revenues from international telephone and telex services, where
tariffs were pegged to the dollar. International telephone revenues which
represented 352 of total revenues in 1982 and 52Z in 1986, grew at an average
26Z in real terms between 1982 and 1986 contributing to a growth in gross
revenues over the period of 11 in real terms. By end 1986, with the decline
in real terms of domestic telephone revenuesIDEL, international telephone
revenuelDEL represented 652 of total telephone revenues/DEL compared to 442 in
1982.

/a Cash revenues adjusted to reflect accruals.
4.3      IETEL's operating ratio was low, ranging between 352 and 48X which
was below the normal range of 55-802 for similar companies. While this in r.
sense is good it reflects some underlying problems such as low depreciation of
assets (due to inconsistent depreciation policies and undervaluation of
assets) and low salaries for professional and technical staff. Past invest-
ment levels have been low and financed primarily by internally generated funds
and short term credits and this is reflected in a very high debt service
coverage. In 1986, the ratio of long-term debt to total capital increased to
32Z, reflecting increased investments in 1985 and 1986 and greater use of long
term financing.
4.4      While a significant percentage of IETEL's revenues is pegged to the
dollar (para. 4.2), fixed assets have not been revalued to reflect the subs-
tantial depreciation of the sucre. Additionally, donated assets (including
land for some rural exchanges) have not been reflected in the asset base and
there have been delays in transferring works in progress to assets. As a
consequence, rate of return on assets on a historical basis gives a very mis-
leading picture. A better estimate can be obtained by revaluing fixed assets
on a replacement cost basis (about US$1,500 equivalent/line). On this basis
and adjusting net income for revalued depreciation, the rate of return on net
fixed assets in operation at end 1986 was about 12X.

Projected Financial Performance
4.5      IETEL's projected financial statements and notes and assumptions used
in preparing the projections are provided in Annexes 18 and 19 respectively.
Selected indicators of financial performance over the next five years are
summarized in Table 4.2. An increase in domestic call charges from S/. 0.3 to
an average of SI. 1.5 per impulse in 1989, and increases in subsequent years
to meet financial covenants have been incorporated in the financial
projections. Projected financial performance is satisfactory, reflecting
expected improvements in collection of accounts receivable, quality of
service, and operations and main.enance.  Domestic telephone revenues per DEL
are expected to increase as a result of the proposed tariff increases,
reducing the heavy reliance on international revenues. IETEL's operating
ratio is expected to be satisfactory, ranging between 60Z and 67S.  Wages and
salaries are expected to increase in line With inflation with an increased
percentage of staff salaries established on the basis of collective bargaining
agreements. With the tariff increase in 198b ,ind projected adjustments in
future years the annual rate of return after tax on average revalued net fixed
assets in operation is expected to range between 9Z and 132 and net internal
cash generation as a percentage of the average of the current and next year's
investment is expected to exceed 35Z which is satisfactory. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that IETEL will take necessary steps to
assure a rate of return of at least 102 on average net revalued fixed assets
from FY90 onwards when revaluation of assets is expected to be completed
(para. 6.1 (d)).

Financing and Exchange Risk
4.6      External financing for ISTEL's total investment program is being
provided by a mixture of bilateral, multilateral and suppliers credit.   The
Bank project entails parallel financing (by OECF and export agencies of
Brazilian, French, Italian, Mexican and Spanish suppliers selected through
price and terms bidding) as well as joint cofinancing with the Comonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) (para. 3.6).
4.7       ISTEL's net internal cash generation and debt service coverage will
be monitored closely during project implementation. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that IETEL will take necessary steps (including tariff
increases) to ensure that it maintains a debt service coverage of at least 1.5
times and that net internal cash generation is at least 302 of the two year
average of its total investment requirements for the current year and the
following year (para. 6.1(e)).



- 23 -
4.8      Financial projections have taken into account the effect on not
income and equity of an increase in sucre liabilities and In debt amortization
as a result of the expected decline in the value of the sucre with respect to
the dollar. Continuation of current ISTEL policy of linking international
tariffs to the dollar and adjustments in domestic tariffs to meet internal
cash generation and debt service covenants will provide adequate protection
against forelgn exchange risk.

V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits
5.1      A key element of Government's economic development strategy is to
diversify and promote exports to reduce reliance on petroleum. Inadequate
telecommunications facilities is currently a major constraint on economic
activities in Ecuador. Improving the telecommunications system is crucial to
promoting the growth and efficiency of business in non-traditional sectors.
Adequate telecommunications will allow rapid access to market information and
more efficient use of transportation facilities through effective coordination
of transport of goods. Compared with physical transportation telecommunications
is in general more efficient in terms of capital, energy consumption and user
time.
5.2      Expansion and rehabilitation of telecommunication facilities which will
be carried out under the proposed project, will contribute to economic
efficiency by (a) increasing the efficiency of enterprises in key business areas
in Quito and Guayaquil through improved communications; (b) improving
productivity of rural agricultural communities by providing access to market
information; and (c) increasing the efficiency of transportation, by facili-
tating coordination of vehicle use and substituting communications for travel.
Although business and rural subscribers will be primary beneficiaries, all
subscribers will benefit from overall improved quality of service--particularly
in Guayaquil where deterioration of the cabla network and congestion are most
severe. Business and Government subscribers will be the major beneficiaries of
the expansion of long distance telephone, telex and data facilities and mobile
telephone services.
Tariffs
5.3      Telecommunications tariffs in Ecuador are summarized in Annex 20.
International tariffs are established in US dollars and have kept pace with
domestic inflation. Domestic tariffs have been increased five-fold recently.
Local and long distance calls are billed at 1.5 sucres (US$0.006) per impulse
with a local call corresponding to one impulse. For long distance calls, the
number of impulses per minute varies with distance with the cost of a three
minute call ranging from 18 to 66 sucres (US$0.07-US$0.26). In recent years,
major devaluations of the sucre and hence high nominal revenues from
international traffic have allowed IETEL to maintain a positive net income.
However, low domestic tariffs have limited financial surpluses and contributed
to network congestion.
Return on Investment
5.4      Calculation of the rate of return on IETEL's investment program over
the period 1988-92 is given in Annex 21. Incremental benefits result from
(a) the estimated 189,000 new subscribers to be connected and the 50,000
subscribers in Guayaquil who would continue to have poor or no service without
network rehabilitation; and (b) incremental revenues from other existing
subscribers resulting from network expansion and improved call completion rates.
The projected internal rate of return on this basis is 25%.



- 25 -
5.5      This does not reflect the full economic value of telephone service
which is well in excess of both the cost of provision of service and the price
charged. There is evidence that subscribers are willing to pay considerably
more for telecommunications services   The current black market rate In Zcuador
for a telephone connection is estimated at a minium of twice the current
connection fee of US$100 equivalent and as high as US$1,000 in business centers.
In calculating the economic rate of return of the program, no consumer surplus
has been incorporated. On this basis, and adjusting for taxes and duties, the
economic rate of return (ERR) is 312. Sensitivity analysis carried out on the
ERR indicate that In the very unlikely worse case scenario, with a 202 increase
in capital costs, 202 reduction In revenues and 202 increase In operating costs,
the ERR would fall to 202.
Resource Mobilization
5.6      IBTEL is a source of revenue to Government. In contrast to other
public sector enterprises which receive budget support from allocation of oil
revenues, IETEL receives no government funding. Over the 5-year period
1988-1992, IETEL is expected to provide about US$257 million equivalent to
Government through contributions, the 252 tax on subscriber billing and customs
duties and taxes.

5.7      A primary risk relates to rETEL's ability to implement the project,
given past low levels of lnvestment and institutional weaknesses. This will be
minimized by (a) using private foreign and local contractors for cable
installations and (b) having turnkey contracts for exchange and transmission
equipment. Consulting engineers will also assist IETEL with project
implementation (para. S 3 (ii)). Another risk is whether management stability
and political support for institutional improvements and policy changes can be
maintained. This risk will be minimized through agreements on a long-term
action plan committing the company to specific performance targets and actions
during project implementation, and through close supervision during 1988 and
1989. Loan conditionalities with respect to project implementation will also
help reduce thie risk. Additionally, an agreement was reached with the borrower
during loan negotiations, on a side letter stating that the guarantor will
strive to maintain continuity in management during the project period and will
advise the Bank of pending changes in senior management (para. 3.3).
Least Cost Solution
5.8      As is the case in any country with an existing telecommunications
network, the configuration of the existing network in Ecuador limits the number
of viable alternative solutions that could be considered to achieve the targets
proposed for extending and improving service   The dimensioning and timing of
works under the 1988-92 expansion program, of which the Bank project is an
integral part, are based on engineering studies designed to minimize the cost of
the project. Given existing telecommunications technology, the program which
emphasizes network rehabilitation, decentralization of transit centers and
network digitilization represents a least cost solution to provide the
quantities and types of equipment which would comply with IETEL's targets.

Environmental and Health Aspects
5.9      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or health
lapacts. On the contrary, better telecommuwnications services improve the
delivery of routine and emergency health services, particularly in rural areas.
Increased use of telecommunication services reduces environmental pollution and
promotes conservation through reduced and more efficient use of the
transportation system.

VI. RZCOHMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached During Negotiations
6.1      During negotiations the following agreements were reacheds
(a) FY88 audited financial statements vill be submitted to the Bank
within 8 months of the close of the fiscal year. For FY89 and future
years, unaudited and audited financial statements will be submitted
within 4 months and 6 months respectively, of the close of the fiscal
year (para. 2.16);
(b) Verification of accounts receivables as of December 31, 1988 will be
completed by September 30, 1989 and verification and revaluation of
fixed assets by December 31, 1989. Also, fixed assets will be
revalued periodically (every year) during project implementation in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.3)s
(c)  IETEL will review with the Bank by September 30 of each year its
performance vis-a-vis agreed performance indicators, its targets for
subsequent years and any necessary corrective measures. IETEL will
Teport progress against physical indicators through quarterly project
reports and progress against financial indicators in annual financial
statements (para. 3.11);
(d) IETEL will take necessary steps to assure a rate of return of at
least 1OZ on average net revalued fixed assets from FY89 onwards
(para. 4.5);
(e) IETEL will take necessary steps to ensure that it maintains a debt
service coverage of at least 1.5 times and that net internal cash
generation is at least 30Z of the two year average of its total
investment requirements for the current year and the following year
(para. 4.7).
6.2      During negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) a detailed time
'bound institutional development action plan which will include measures to
improve overall institutional performance, financial performance, and
operational efficiency (para. 3.3), (b) performance indicators for FY89 and
FY90 together with action plans to achieve them (para. 3.11) and which will
state that the guarantor will strive to maintain continuity in management
during the project period and will advise the Bank of pending changes in
senior management (para. 5.8).
Condition of Effectiveness
-  6.3       It will be a condition of effectiveness that financing contracts with
CDC, Italy and Japan be effective. With respect to other cofinancing sources
where equipment to be financed is not expected to be installed before mid-
1990, the Bank would have the right to suspend all or part of the project if
such cofinancing is not in place by June 30, 1990 (para. 3.6).



- 28 -
Conditions of Disbursement
6.4 (a) Signed contracts for consultancies financed under the project will be
conditions of disbursement against cable contracts (para. 3.10).
Recommendations
6.5      Subject to agreement on the above, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan to IRTEL of US$45 million for a term of 17 years including 5
years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.

ECUADOR
INSTITUTO ECUATORIANO DS TELECOMUNICACIONES (IETEL)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Technical Cooperation
(Between IETEL and the Twinning Institution)
Introduction
1.       IETEL, hereinafter called the "GUEST* institution is the entity
responsible for provision of all telecommunications services in Ecuador other
than local telephone services in the city of Cuenca. The 'GUEST* institution
has planned a large development program over the period 1988-1992, designed to
expand and improve the telecommunications network throughout the country and
to introduce new services to subscribers. The program calls for modernization
of the network through installation of state-of-the-art digital exchanges,
fiber optic cable and digital microwave transmission systems. The number of
direct exchange lines are expected to increase from 430,000 to 730,000 over
the plan period. Also included in the plan is institution building through a
comercial orientation in the management style and development of the human
resources of the institution, specially those in professional and managerial
positions.
Objective
2.       The objective of the twinning arrangement is to use the services of a
more developed telecommunications entity, hereinafter cal ed the "HOST'
institution to provide technical cooperation to the 'GUZSTO to improve its
capacity to handle the ambitious development program.
Description of Services
3.       It is envisaged that the  HOST' will provide technical cooperation
both in Ecuador (at Quito and Guayaquil) and in the HOST's country. A list of
areas to be covered in the program in the HOST and GUEST countries are at
Attachments 1 and 2. The priority areas, list of participants and period of
traininglassignment will be finalized after joint discussion between the GUEST
and the HOST. After these discussions the HOST institution will prepare a
comprehensive time-phased action program with set priorities. For each
recommended action, the HOST will indicate the GUEST and HOST institutions'
personnel needs (number and specialities), material requirement, foreign and
local cost estimates-and anticipated results. Work to be carried out in the
GUEST country and the HOST country would be specified. The mode of technical
assistance is envisaged as followst
A.       Training in HOST Country
4.       'GUESTO participants in the program will spend 3 to 6 months in the
'HOST' institution receiving 'on-the-job' training. The program would be
designed not only to update the speciality knowledge of the concerned GUEST



- 45 -
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 4
participant but also to broaden his knowledge in other areas. For example, a
transmission maintenance engineer will be given assignments and hands-on
training in the transmission maintenance office of the "HOST' in order to
deepen his skills in his area of speciality. However, to broaden his skills
he would also be given exposure to other areas such as exchange maintenance,
transmission engineering, cable maintenance, transmission planning, accounting
and finance, subscriber equipment maintenance and marketing.
5.       It is estimated that about 40 guest staff would participate in the
training program with a total of about 120 man-months of training. in the
'HOST' institution, a coordinator will be nominated to organize the program
for the visitor and to follow-up his progress in the different assignments.
At the end of each assignment, the concerned "HOST" manager will submit his
evaluation of the trainee's performance to the coordinator. The overall
performance evaluation of the trainee will be sent to the 'GUESTO management,
on completion of his training.
B.       Training in GUEST Country
6.       Experts from the HOST institution in selected areas will visit the
GUEST country on short assignments. During this period they will work with
counterpart "GUEST' staff. Besides transfer of know-how through one-to-one
contact, they may also be asked to hold seminars, workshops, etc. About 20
HOST staff are expected to participate in the program for a total of about 60
man-months.
Financial Arrangements
7.       IETEL has requested a loan from the Vorld Bank to finance part of the
investment program. The resources to finance the twinning arrangements, will
come from the IETEL, and from the Bank. The IETEL will finance the salaries
and other social charges of the 'GUEST' staff, normally in local currency.
The Bank will finance the foreign expenditures, namely travel costs, per-diem
in the 'HOST' country of the 'GUEST* staff, the 'HOST' charges for the coordi-
nation and expenses, and the `HOST' staff travel costs and per diem in the
'GUEST' country.
Implementation
8.       The 'HOST' institution would implement, with assistance from the
'GUEST', those actions, studies and training programs as specified in the
comprehensive action program. The 'GUEST' and 'HOST' institutions would
assign specific working groups for each of the activities. The program should
be carried out over a three-year period. The 'HOST' would provide a senior
manager to plan the program and direct and supervise the activities. Joint
evaluations of the program would be carried out once a year. In addition
reports on the performance of the 'GUEST' trainees would be sent to the
'GUEST" management on the completion of training of each participant. An
accounting report will also be sent monthly for settlement of payments.

INSTITUTO ECUATORIANO DE TELECOMUNICACIONES CIETEL)
FIRST TZLECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Management Development Program
Background
1.       IETEL is in the process of implementing a big development program.
It expects to double the number of exchan@e lines over the next five years and
substantially expand the services. The company is also moving towards a more
business-oriented and independent mode of operation.
In the past the company has been more technically oriented, with many
of its financial and personnel functions regulated and supervised by various
government ministries. There was no emphasis on marketing and customer
functions as demand for services far outstripped supply capacity.
Expansion of services as well as the move towards a more independent
organizaton, with fewer employees subject to civil service regulations,
present new challenges to the management which will need to assume
responsibilities in areas in which it has had little experience. There is
also need for a change in organizational culture and management style.
Management Development Program
2.       IETEL's management recognizes this and sees management development as
a key element in institution building.
Obiectives
3.       The objectives of the management development program aret
(a)  to develop team-problem-solving techniques to be employed by IETEL's
management on a day-to-day basis;
(b) to enihance the capabilities of the participating managers in solving
complex managerial problems through mutual cooperation;
(c) to promote result oriented management style throughout the
organization;
(d) to upgrade the capabilities of the individual managers through
teaching managerial techniques;
(e)  to promote a change in IETEL to operate as an independent company in
a competitive market environment (towards a marketing and business
orientation).



- 49 -
ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2
Method of Delivery
4.       The program will be carried out over a period of two years using
different teaching methods. Emphasis should be placed on case studies and
group discussions. Materials, case studies and problems for group discussion
should be taken from or closely related to IETEL's business environment. Some
on-the-job training should also be included. Provision should be made for
some subjects (i.e., time management, computer literacy) which are not
specifically IETEL oriented to be administered through other channels and
taken separately by individuals.
Participation
5.       All higher level managers in IETEL would participate in the program
on a group basis. About ten participants are expected from each region and
some 15 from HW for a total participation of 35-40 persons.
Scope
6.       The program should consist of some 150 instruction hours a year (300
for the two years). It is expected that the organization carrying out the
training program will provide five full three-cay training sessions a year,
away from IETEL premises.

Income Statement
(a) Domestic automatic traffic averages 1,147 impulses per month per
subscriber. This is projected to increase 12 in 1989, 22 in 1990 and
32 in 1991 and subsequent years. Growth is as a result of increased
traffic due to network rehabilitation and expansion. Tariffs are
according to latest increase with an average of 1.5 sucre per
impulse; and would be adjusted subsequently in order to meet
financial covenants.
(b) The rental charge is calculated at the current average level of 237
sucreslmonth per subscriber up to 1990. This is a weighted average
of current tariffs for residential, business and industrial
subscribers. This is projected to increase in parallel with
inflation from 1991 on.
(c) Average connection fee per subscriber is 53,240 sucres up to 1990;
from 1991 on this tariff is adjusted with inflation..
td) International telephone revenues for 1988 through 1994 are projected
assuming a 12 2 annual increase in traffic at constant rate in
dollars.
(e) International telex revenues are projected assuming a 6 2 annual
increase in traffic at current rates.
(f)  Number of staff is based on target staff/DEL ratios.  Increase in
salary per staff is based on current and expected collective
agreements, after due consideration of decrease in dollar terms
resulting from 1988 devaluationt 352 per annum in 1989, 50 2 per
annum in 1990, 40 2 per annum in 1991 and 1992 2; and 35 2 per annum
in 1993 and 1994.
(h) Annual depreciation is 52 of gross revalued fixed assets in
operation.

(i) Interest expenses are calculated loan by loan. Interest for the
World Bank Loan is assumed to be 82. For 1992 and future
investments, it is assumed IETEL will obtain foreign financing for
30X of total investments.
(j) Exchange Loss is the increased loan amortisation for foreign debt
arising from devaluation of the Sucre with respect to the US dollar.
Balance Sheet
(a) Revaluation for 1987 is on the basis of $1,500 per DEL equivalent
which is the best estimate of replacement cost. For 1989-1994 the
actual average cost per line of the current investment program has
been considered ( apprx. US $ 2,000 per line )
(b) Work in progress at the end of the year is a function of the same
year Investment Program.
(c)  Inventories are calculated as 3 2 of Total Net Fixed Assets in
Operation.
(d) Accounts Receivable are calculated as equal to 2 months of average
Operating Revenues.

FIRST TELECO0MMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investments
1.       The proposed project is an integral part of IETEL's 1986-1992 devel-
opment program which includes ongoing works, other works and initial invest.
ment for future works. The close interrelationship between various components
makes it difficult to separate incremental benefits and costs of the project
from the rest of the program. Thus, the rate of return has been calculated on
the basis of the program as a whole excluding initial investment for future
works. The benefit period extends from 1988 to 2014 at the end of which
period, it is estimated that on average all the equipment provided under the
program would have completed its useful life. Capital costs include
preinvestments in 1987 for the proposed project.
2.       Benefits are (a) revenues from the estimated 189,000 new telephone
subscribers to be connected and the 50,000 subscribers in Guayaquil who would
continue to have poor or no service without network rehabilitation;
(b) incremental revenues from existing telephone subscribers as a result of
network expansion and improved call completion rates; and (c) increased
revenues from 5,370 new telex subscribers. Operating costs are the
incremental operating costs to provide service to incremental subsectors
valued at average opereting cost per subscriber. From 1995 onwards, costs and
benefits related to the FY1988-1992 program are assumed to remain constant in
real terms.
3.       All incremental costs and revenues have been deflated to bring them
to their comparable 1988 price levels.  A summary of the program's incremental
costs and benefits at 1988 price levels is given in Table 21.1 below.

The projected financial rate of return on this basis is 25.12 which is
satisfactory.
Economic Rate of Return
4.       financial benefits based on incremental revenues to  ESTEL understate
economic benefits of the program as the economic value of teleco.uunications
service is well in excess of price charged. There is evidence that sub-
scribers are willing to pay considerably more for telecomtunications service:
the black market rate for a telephone connection is estimated at a minimum of
tvice the connection fee and as high as US$1,000 in business centers. In
calculating the economic rate of return the consumer surplus has not been
taken into account. On this basis and adjusting for taxes and duties the
economic costs and benefits are given in Table 21.2 below.
