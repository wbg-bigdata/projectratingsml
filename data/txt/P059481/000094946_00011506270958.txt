ENVIRONMENTAL CODES OF PRACTICE                                         INTRODUCTION
1.      INTRODUCTION
1.1     Purpose and Scope of the Environmental Codes of Practice
According to the Blhutaniese Environmental Assessment Sectoral Guidelines, February 1999, all new road
projects of any classification are subject to a comprehensive Environmental Assessment (EA) and its
clearance by the National Environment Commission (NEC) before any project work can start. This EA
forms the basis for the environmental management of the project.
In order to manage the road project on the execution level in an environmental soulid way and in
accordance with the recommendations of the sectoral guidelines issued by NEC, Environlmenltal Codes of
Practice (ECP) are a requirement. The ECP include all stages of a project such as planning, study, survey,
design, tendering, contract documentation, project execution and supervision, operation, maintenance, and
rehabilitation.
Tlhe ECP are to be used by all parties involved witih road construction and maintenance activities suchi as
government agencies concerined (Division of Roads, Forest Services Division/Forest Development
Corporation, Ministry of Trade and Industry), consultants and contractors.
The ECP are to be considered as part of the standard operating practices for all DOR road construction,
maintenance and rehabilitation activities and must also become part of the project tender documents and
contract documents packages.
With the help of the ECP, DOR and the other proponents concerned will be able to fulfil their obligations
with regard to the "Institutionalising and Strengthening of the Environmental Assessment Process in
Bhutan" (Reference Document 1999) and the "Sectoral Guidelines" for Highways and Roads.
In preparing the Bhutanese ECP, Highways and Roads, reference was also made on the Nepalese and
Fijiai Einvironimental Codes of Practice.
The ECP in its present form contains only basic environmental rules, which will allow taking the first
important steps towards environmental friendly road works. Later on, when their implemiienitationi has
become common practice among the actors concerned, these rules may become more rigtid in order to
introduce furthier steps in that direction. Therefore, the ECP has to be considered as a "living document"
which, from time to time, may need revision.
1.2     Content of Environmental Codes of Practice and its Use
The ECP consist of a simple and summarized environmental management plan for every project stage.
This management plan can be used as Environmental Manual.
Tlle following project stages are covered:
E  Plannling, studying and surveyilg
*  Design7
*  Tender documents
*  Constructioni and supervision
* Operation and maintenianice
Since road rehabilitationi can be treated in the same way as road constructioni it is not covered separately.
The individual management plans for each project stage contain a short introduction whiere important
aspects of that project stage are mentioned like e.g. the institutionial responsibility for that project stage,
the basic DOR manuals to be followed, the existing laws, rules and regulations to be followed, the correct
work sequence and other matters, if any.

ENVIRONMENTAL CODES OF PRACTICE                                           INTRODUCTION
The management plan is kept in table form and summarizes the following:
a  the sequence of the project activities to be carried out
e  the potential negative environmental impacts for each activity
*  the proposed mitigation measures
*  the need for public participation and co-ordination with other government agencies
e  socio-economic and cultural considerations
*  the need to budget mitigation measures
*  the supervision requirements (only for construction, operation and maintenance)
*  the monitorinig and evaluation requirements
Very often, the time required to plan and prepare a road construction project is underestimated. Therefore,
the managemenit plans for these project stages contain an average time frame for the executioll of all the
required stage activities.
Since the proposed management plans are new for DOR and kept very short and to the point, it was felt
necessary to explain them in more detail. Therefore, each management plan is supplemented with an
annex where the required explanations and suggested instructions and/or specificatiions can be foulid.
T=he involvement of environmental activities at various project stages is illustrated in the followinig page.

2.    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS
2.1     Planning, Studying and Surveying
The planiing, study and surveying stage of the project has the greatest impact with regard to ecology
and economy of a road project. It is imperative to assign these tasks to highly experienced engineers
only. Geologically weak and ecologically sensitive areas have to be avoided if ever possible and the
road must be optimally integrated into the terrain.
The DOR "Survey Manual" is the technical basis for any road survey activities. The institutional
responsibility for planning, studying and surveying lie with the DOR.
The work sequence for planning, studying and surveying follows as below:
0 Planning
- ordering of topographical map
- geological assessment based oni aerial photos
- input of all available data (e.g. social, cultural, environmental and aeological) into
topographical map
a  Pre-feasibility Study
- desk study based on topographical map
- ground reconnaissance for all alignment options
- proposal of best alignment
= Feasibility Study (preliminary survey)
- select optimal road corridor and peg line fixation
E Environmental Assessment (EA and feasibility study should be conducted interactively)
- identify all significant environmental issues
- draw environmental management plan
* Detailed Survey
- comprelhensive mapping of road corriclor
2. 1. 1    Time Frame

2.2      Design
The DOR "Road Design Manual" is the technical basis for any road design activities. All data
collected during the previous project stages (pre-feasibility, feasibility and detailed suivey) must be
made available to the design engineer. In order to get a realistic picture of the prevailing site
conditions the design engineer must visit the road alignment before he starts with the design to be able
to produce a realistic and sound design.
The institutional responsibility for the design lies with the DOR.
The work sequence for design follows as below:
Alignment
- preliminary drafting of vertical alignment
- preliminary drafting of horizontal alignment
- optimization of vertical/horizontal alignment
- cross sections
- mass haul diagram
Other design features
- permanent structures / slope stabilization
- water management
- temporary facilities
2.2.1    Time Frame
Due to accessibility problems, road construction must be executed section-wise. In average, a section
of 10 km is a suitable contractor workload. Hence, the design work must be staged accordingly. To
cover all aspects required for a careful and sound road design the following time frame is suggested.

2.3      Tender Documents
All work items concerning environmental issues must be included in the Tender Documents:
as quantified work items in the Bill of Quantity (BoQ) and as clauses in the Technical Specifications
(TS). This forces the contractor to calculate their costs and to execute them technically correct.
To enable an environmental friendly road construction, formation cutting and permanent works must
be tendered as one package because support structures for safe spoil material deposits or retaining
walls have to be built before spoil material deposition or back filling of retaining walls can start.
The institutional responsibility for the tender procedure lies with the DOR.
The work sequence for preparation of tender documents follows as below:
* Bill of Quantity
- preparation of work items list
- calculation of quantities
- preparation of schedule of rates
* Contract clauses
- special clauses
- techn7ical specifications
2.3.1    Time Frame
For the introduction of environmental friendly construction methods many new work items will be
required. These items will have to be specified (Technical Specifications) and rated (Schedule of
Rates) to be included in the Tender Documents. This will lengthen the present tendering procedure to
at least 2.5 months.

2.4     Construction and Supervision
It is in this stage of the project where corrective environmental mitigation measures are considerable.
In identifying the best possible mitigation measures, it is important to know which area of construction
activity needs corrective action. The area requiring corrective measures can therefore be scoped into
II broad headings:
I. Quarries and gravel/sand extraction from river beds
2. Spoil disposal (including temporary stockpiling of materials)
3. Slope stability
4. Drainage
5. Work camp location, operation and closure, restrictions on workers (sanitationi, fuelwood
collection, poaching)
6. Use of bitumen
7. Explosives and toxic waste management
8. Management of stone crushing plants
9. Water management
10. Air and noise management
I I. Road use and safety operation
This document should be used along with DoR "Blasting Manual" and "Bio-Engineering Manual in
Bhutain".
In addition the following documents should be followed:
-  Rules and Regulations for construction of temporary, semi-permanent and pernanent houses on
either sides of the roads, 1995
* Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan, 1995
* Road Safety and Transport Act, 1997
* Land Compensation Rate, 1996
-  [nstitutionalizing and strengthening of the environmental assessment process in Bhlutan, Volume
13 -Appendices, 1999
The work sequence for preparation of tender documents follows as below:
I St contract
- site clearing
- retaining structures
- formation cuttiing / embankment
- water management (catch drains, French drains and temporary side drains)
- breast walls
- bioengineering
l  2iid contract
- stone soling

ENVIRONMENTAL CODES OF PRACTICE                  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
2.5    Operation and Maintenance
It is often a tendency to emphasize the importance on providing a road thereby occasionally
overlooking the backup maintenance required for road, in which case the whole project objectives and
sustainability concept might just be self defeated. The environmental consequences resulting during
operation period are: wearing road surface, development of potholes, landslides, pollution of waters
near work campsites, and often health hazards due to accidents. To eliminate the above problems the
area requiring mitigation has been scoped into the following:
I. Quarries and gravel/sand extraction from river beds
2. Spoil disposal (including temporary stockpiling of materials)
3. Slope stability
4. Drainage
5. Work camp operation
6. Use of bitumen
7. Explosive and toxic waste management
8. Management of stone crushing plants
9. Water management
10. Air and noise management
11. Road use and safety operation
12. Road surface
Though some of the mitigation measures reflected here are similar to the construction phase. as
operation and maintenance being an independent work phase there is a necessity to mention here. This
codes of practice may become more productive if used along with DOR "Field Manual of Road
Maintenance" and "Bioengineering manual in Bhutan".

ANNEX I
1   PLANNING, STUDYING AND SURVEYING
The planning, studying and surveying phase is the most important phase of all the project stages.
It is in this phase where all the fundamental decisions are made to achieve an alignment, which
can be constructed and maintained with least cost, minimum instability and a tolerable
environmental impact.
Tlherefore, only a highly experienced and multi-disciplinary team of specialists can adequately
handle these tasks.
1.1 PLANNING
1.1l. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Often, large slope failures of temporary or even permanent nature occur after construction. In
many cases, these failures require comprehensive stabilization measures such as costly support
structures or other recurrent restoration measures after every monsoon. Sometimes, such failures
are so deep rooted that there is no chance of stabilization and re-alignment over several
kilometers is the only solution.
But slope stability is not the only factor. Also the social, cultural and ecological environment
can be negatively affected or even destroyed during or after road construction.
1.1.2. Mitigation Measures
With the existing aerial photographs of 1:35,000 scale covering most of the country, SoB can
produce topographical maps of 1:25,000 scale with, depending on the ruggedness of the area,
I Om or 20m contour lines. These maps are a solid basis for the designing of topographical
optimal alignments at this early project stage.
These aerial phiotographs also allow a first comprehensive assessment of the geo-technical
situation of the project area. An interpretation of the photographs enables an experienced
engineering geologist to indicate the geological weak spots oln the topographical map.
The assessment of all known socio-ecological data, viz. taken from land use maps, property
maps and satellite imageries, such as existing infiastructures, location of prime agricultural land,
sensitive ecosystems and important cultural and religious sites, and its indication il the
topographical map further allows the engineer to avoid such sites or areas when selecting suitable
road alignment options at the pre-feasibility study stage.
1.1.3. Public Participation and Coordination
The planning stage requires co-ordination between DoR and other government bodies suchi as tile
SoB.
Page I of 39



ANNEX I
The production of an accurate topographical map is time consuming and must tilerefore be
ordered from SoB well in advance to have it available when the pre-feasibility project pilase
starts.
The same timely (early) assignment of an engineering geologist is required for the assessmenit of
the geo-techinical situation of tile project area.
1.1.4. Budgeting
For the planning phase the costs for the production of the topographical map and for the
assignment of the engineering geologist must be duly budgeted.
1.2 PRE-FEASIBILITY STUDY
1.2.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
What has been said under para 1.1.1 is equally valid for pre-feasibility study phase. Besides this,
also protected areas and species habitats can be negatively affected or even destroyed during or
after road construction.
1.2.2. Mitigation Measures
The desk study must be based on all available data known at this stage. This inclCLdes the
topographical map, the geo-technical and socio-ecological assessments. Wherever possible, the
proposed alignment options must avoid geo-technical weak spots, not affect socio-ecological
sensitive areas and cultural sites and be practical and direct as possible.
The ground reconnaissance must include a complete walkover of all the selected alignimlelit
options-to determine the topographical and geological feasibility and to collect as much data as
possible to gain a sound basis for the physical, environmental, economic and social comparison
of the alignment options.
Based on the groulid reconnaissance, out of the available alignment options, the best alignment
must be choseni by weighing the given set of selection criteria.
1.2.3. Public Participation and Coordination
Public participation is an important and necessary component for a road project. The public
involvement is likely to result in a more sustainable project withi the people feeling a sense of
local ownership, acceptability and a commitbment for maintaining the road. It involves atwo-way
flow of information. Firstly, the study tearn has the duty to inform the local population in the
road area of all aspects of the project for all the project stages (adverse impacts and benefits).
Secondly, the public is knowledgeable about local conditions and issues that are crucial for a
good project design, the project management and the road operation. During the execution of the
pre-feasibility study, the local population must be informed about the available options for giving
motorable access to their area. The better they are informed about advantages and disadvantages
of the available alignment options the easier will be tihe dialogue later on with them whien they
are confronted with the disadvantages of the new road during construction, operation and
mainteniance.
Page 2 of 39



ANNEX I
At this project stage, all available data concerning physical, socio-economical, cultural and
ecological factors mtist be collected from the locals to receive a broad and valid infomlilation
basis for all the proposed alignment options.
1.2.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
A very crucial factor is the road length. The shorter the road, the lower the constructioni.
operationi and maintenance costs and the less environmental damage. But from a purely social
point of view, all people of the project area should profit by a direct access to the new road.
However, this can lead to a high increase of road length, which would no more be economical as
a whole.
In addition, the existing network of mule tracks and footpaths should be taken into accoulit to
arrive at the optimal access.
A careful weighing of all factors involved will lead to an optimal solution and show whicil village
or infrastructure can be accessed directly or only indirectly by the planned road.
A careful identification of affected private land and property for each individual alignmelnt
option is essential because it is an important criterion with regard to the selection of the best
alignment.
Likewise, the land use and the location of cultural sites along the alignment options are of high
economical, cultural and ecological significance for the selection of the best alignment
1.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY
1.3.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
The less accurate the information on the future road area the greater is tile potential tilat
unexpected factors crop up during the construction which may result in a considerable increase of
cost. This is not only valid for the construction costs but also for recurrent costs for operation
and maintenance.
Inaccurate or missing information on the ecological factors of a road area also may lead to large-
scale damages or even to a substantial destruction of the ecological environment.
Negligenice or inaccurate information on the discharge volume of surface water can trigger large-
scale soil erosion especially at outlets.
1.3.2. Mitigation Measures
The road corridor and the peg line must carefully consider the topographical, geo-techlnical (slope
stability, rock strata, quarries and material disposal sites) and hydrological factors (wvet zones) to
come up with an optimal road corridor and peg line.
If there are possibilities to minimize negative environmental and social consequenices, tilen the
alignmenit should be adapted accordingly.
An engineering geologist can only effectively assess the geological features.
Page 3 of 39



ANNEX I
The same is valid for the ecological features. An experienced environmentalist only is suitable
for this task.
At this stage already, also the hydrological features need close attention to come tip with
adequate and suitable water management measures.
In addition, suitable sites for temporary facilities such as contractor camps, spoil disposal areas,
potential quarries (aggregate extraction) and borrow pits (soil, gravel and sand extraction) have to
be identified. This will help to realize early whethier there are serious resource bottlenecks
requiring the search for additional resources further away from the planned aliognimenit and the
feasibility for its access.
1.3.3. Public Participation and Coordination
Often the local population can offer essential and valid information about thestability of slopes.
They know where and how previous slope failures had occurred and where soil erosioll is likely
to occur.
They also know about the location of water sources and the water table levels (danger of
seepage) at various places. For suitable dimensioning of water crossings (bridges, culverts, and
causeways), the local population must be consulted about the flood level of streams and rivers.
1.3.4. Budgeting
The works of all the other specialists, other than DoR engineers, contributing to th:is project stage
must be budgeted. This involves the engineering geologist and the environmental specialist.
1.4 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMEN'T
1.4.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
The negligence or inadequate recording of all the prevailing environmental factors may lead to
significanit and costly environmental problems later onl.
1.4.2. Mitigation Measures
The most important factor to optimally guide the EA is a clear ToR for the EA Team. It is
obvious that such a task must be given to an experienced team of specialists. The team muist
propose mitigation measures wherever required and come up with improvements whleni necessary
to protect the environment effectively. The team  must assess whethler the project is
environmentally feasible or not.
The potential stakeholders such as all government agencies involved, NGOs and private people
have to be approached for their input with regard to potential environmental problems caused by
the road project.
The government clearance by the NEC is the official environmental approval of the project.
Page 4 of 39



ANNEX 1
1.43. Public Participation and Coordination
For this project stage, the assignment of the EA Team  needs some preparation and co-
ordination. The team can be assigned by DoR only when NEC has worked out the ToR for the
EA. The assignment itself by DoR is also a matter, which requires some time and procedures.
The EA Team must inform the local population which alignment option has been selected for
execution and for what reasons. Complete information on the process of alignment selection
again helps to secure the full co-operation of the local population for the further project stages.
More specific and detailed information on important project issues can Ilow be collected from
the local population for the selected alignment option.
1.4.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
The EA Team now must identify in detail all affected private land and property with regard to
size, value and owner.
Furthermore, the team-n must identify affected infrastructure and cultural sites withi regard to
the potential damages and to the means of mitigation and protection.
1.4.5. Budgeting
DoR must have a budget for the cost of the EA Team.
1.5 DETAILED SURVEY
1.5.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Missing or incomplete survey data result in a faulty or inadequate design and thus often
lead to higher construction, operation and maintenance costs.
Unnecessary tree cutting for better visibility during the survey weakens the stability of the
surface soil layers and can result in shallow slope failures. The wide corridor opening also
results in loss of wildlife habitat particularly birdlife.
1.5.2. Mitigation Measures
The road corridor needs careful and complete mapping of all important terrain features anld
must be wide enough at places where spoil deposits are feasible. Other relevant data like land
use, infrastructure, cultural sites, fragile slopes, seepage areas, etc. must also be mapped.
In addition, campsites, spoil locations, quarry and borrow pit sites have to be mapped too.
The felling of trees for visibility during the detailed survey is weakening the surface soil layers
and i-nay trigger shallow slopes failures later on. Therefore, tree felling should be avoided
wherever possible at this project stage.
Page 5 of 39



ANNEX I
1.5.3. Public Participation and Coordination
Whenever and wherever required, the further mutual exchange of informatiion between
project staff and locals should be encouraged and supported.
Page 6 of 39



ANNEX 2
2 DESIGN
2.1 VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
2.1.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Requirement of re-alignment at the time of road upgrading and rehabilitation due to inadequate
and too steep grades.
Fast road scouring due to vehicle pressure and surface runoff.
2.1.2. Mitigation Measures
Compared to the horizonital alignment thevertical alignment must satisfy also the requiremiienits
of the next higher road class because once it needs upgrading, this should be possible witilout
requiring re-alignments with the corresponding high cost.
For the gradient of 8 - 10% the road stretch should not exceed I 00m.
2.2 HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
2.2.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Large-scale slope failures of temporary or even permanent nature may occur after constructioll
completion. In many cases, these failures require comprelhensive stabilization measures sucih as
costly support structures or other recurrent restoration measures after every m71on1soo01.
Sometimines, such failures are so deep rooted that there is no chance of stabilization and re-
- alignment over several kilometers is the only solution.
The destruction of up- and down-slope vegetation and of valuable forest over wide areas due
to uncontrolled dumping of spoil material.
Wide road corridors, bare of any vegetation, restrict the free movement of wild animiials
considerably.
2.2.2. Mitigation Measures
For the construction of feeder roads, the general rule must be to keep the amount of earthwork
minimal. In steep mountainous terrain, this can only be achieved if the horizontal alignmelit
follows as closely as possible the contour lines. Tile advantages of minimal earthwork are low
construction costs and most important, least negative impact on the up- and down-slopes such as
up-slope failures, damages to vegetation, valuable forest and agricultural land and uliconitrolled
deposition of large volumes of spoil materials.
In areas with less than 70% slope grade, a balanced cut and fill within the cross section should
be applied. In areas with over 70% slope grade, the balance should be achieved over short road
Page 7 of 39



ANNEX 2
sections. This requires a certain amount of support structures like toe walls, retaining walls and
breast walls.
Full cut can be applied when the risk of slope failure is minimal and frequent locations for safe
deposition of spoil material exist.
Full fill is recommended whien the prevailing rock has persistent joints, bedding or foliation
planes dipping parallel to the slope, when scree or similar deposits are in a critical stability angle.
when eroding or highly erodible soils have to be crossed and wheni, for pavemelit drainage
purposes, terraces have to be crossed.
In steep forest areas, spoil material can be deposited below the road in a controlled way by tile
application of log barriers.
A valuable tool concerining the arrangement of spoil material deposition is the mass haul
diagram whicil indicates where and how much spoil material exists and where it can be safely
deposited.
2.3 PERMANENT STRUCTURES
2.3.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Structure failures often occur in unstable areas (sinking) or when the structure cannot be
founided on solid rock.
2.3.2. Mitigation Measures
In unstable areas or when the structure is not founded on bedrock, flexible gabion structures
shiould be choseni to withstanid the unfavorable site conditions successfully. Suitable support
structures for spoil material deposits are toe walls and log barriers.
2.4 WATER MANAGEMENT
2.4.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Unconitrolled surface water discharge over the road edge creating large-scale erosion on the
downi-slopes.
The sinking of road sections and up-slope failures due to down- and up-slope seepage.
2.4.2. Mitigation Measures
The limited width and the design speed of feeder roads allow for a constant cross-fall towards the
mountainiside. This prevents an unconitrolled surface water discharge over the road edge.
Side drain water must be discharged at every available stream crossing so that the amount of
discharge water can be kept minimal and no erosion is caused at the water outlets. No other than
natural stream crossings must be used for water discharge.
Page 8 of 39



ANNEX 2
Where an increased discharge of surface water endangers the stability of the water outlet, erosion
protection measures mu1st be applied (bioengineering measures, ripraps, check darns, etc.).
In areas with high water table (seepage), side drains and up-slope catch drains must always
been lined so that no surface water can penetrate into the subsoil. This avoids building up of pore
water pressure, which increases the risk of slope failure.
2.5 SLOPE STABILISATION
235.1 Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
After construction, bare slopes tend to erode and fail under difficult site conditions (geological
weak areas, erodible soils).
2.52. Mitigation Measures
Bare slopes must always be covered with vegetation (grass, shrub and trees) as soon as the works
oln the slopes are completed to avoid erosion and shallow slope failures. These bioengineering
measures are cheap and perfectly suitable in most of the cases. But they must be tailor made for
each individual site responding to the prevailing site conditionis.
For unfavorable site conditions (deep-rooted instability) support structures such as breast, toe
and retaining walls are required. But very often, such permanent structures can be kept smaller
and cheaper when applied in combination with bioengineering measures.
To find suitable and long-lasting solutions slope stabilization measures must always be designed
in close co-operation with engineering geologists.
2.6 TEMPORARY FACILITIES
2.6.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Temporary facilities such as road camps, borrows pits, spoil disposal sites, quarries and
stone crushing plants can produce soil and air pollution.
Spoil disposal activities may disturb river flow patterns.
2.6.2. Mitigation Measures
These temporary facilities must be incorporated in the design to guide the project properly.
Page 9 of 39






ANNEX 3
3 TENDER DOCUMENTS
3.1 PREPARATION OF TENDER DOCUMENTS
3.1.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Intended measures aiming at environmentally sound construction are not executed
properly or not at all because they are not described in the Contract Clauses and not
priced as work items in the Bill of Quantities.
Temporary facilities such as contractor camps, spoil disposal areas, quarry sites and borroNv pit
areas can have serious negative effects on the environmenit if they are not managed carefulily.
3.1.2. Mitigation Measures
The intended mitigation measures must also be included as work items in theBill of Quantities
with the estimated amount of work volume so that the contractor can calculate the item price and
the total cost for their execution.
Likewise, all mitigation measures must be individually defined and described in detail in the
Contract Clauses of the Tender Documents so that the contractor knows how to perform them
properly.
Withi regard to the cost estimate of the work contract, DoR must prepare a schedule of rates for
all the intenided mitigation measures.
DoR must also include special clauses in the Conditions of Contract with regard to the
environimental project management such as:
e the contractor must comply with the environmental mitigation measures as per ECP
* besides the work program, the contractor lias also to submit an environmental management
plan, specific to the works, that conforms with the requirements stated in the ECP. This plan,
prepared by the contractor, shall include specific methods to be employed for: location of
work and labor camps, drawings indicating how storage areas and adjacent surface waters
will be protected against contamination, methods of spoil disposal, quarry and borrow area
site operation, protection and restoration procedures.
*  the Engineer has the authority to immediately stop the works in areas of concern when the
environmental supervision activities reveal a serious existing or imminent envirolilnielital
hazard
*  the Engineer has the authority to extend the contract duration and increase the cost of thle
contract for the implementation of remedial actions, provided the environmelital problem was
not caused due to negligenice or non-compliande to the ECP by the contractor
*  final acceptance of the completed works will not occur until the environmental clauses have
been satisfactorily implemented
Page 10 of 39



ANNEX 3
*  operation, restoration and renovation of all quarry sites and borrow areas must be in
accordance with the environmental mitigation measures as per ECP
v  disposal of spoil and excess material as per ECP
3.1.3. Budgeting
The review of tender documents regarding environemnt requirements by an EA specialist must
be budgeted.
3.1.4. Monitoring
It is suggested that the tender documents are reviewed by an EA specialist before tendering to
assure that all measures are taken to prevent unnecessary environmental hazards to the project
area.
3.2  TENDERING OF WORKS
3.2.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Insufricient awareness of the environmental requirements may lead to halfhearted and
inadequate quoting of such measures and thus to unsatisfactory implementation of the works.
3.2.2. Mitigation Measures
Tlherefore, the ECP must explicitly become an integral part of the Tender Docunnents.
Page I I of 39



ANNEX 4
4 CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION
4.1 QUARRY
4.1.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
The impacts resulting out of quarry activities are: slope instability as a break in natural contours
often causing slope failures, dust pollution, surface water disruption, health hazard, and are
aesthetically unpleasing as vegetation are removed and surroundings covered by pollutants.
4.1.2. Mitigation Measures
In addition to the indicated quarry sites (by EA report) the construction responsible should
plhysically identify and thoroughly investigate other suitable quarry sites involving engineering
geologist. Thle location shiould be away from population centers, cultural sensitive sites, drinkinig
water intake points, potential croplands, and protected biological areas.
When opening the site, care should be attended to keep the vegetation clearing at the minimum
possible. The blasting operations should be conducted in a controlled manner, not overchargilig
the holes and proper warnings/signals relayed to the surrounding people prone to danger on time.
The blasting is always recommended to follow by benches (series of holes blasted at a time and
the next series following few seconds later and so on..). For stone quarrying, the operation should
begin from the crown of the slope and then move gradually downward. Shot hole blasting is NOT
RECOMMENDED. In case of dry weather the contractor should wet the site by spraying water
to keep dust pollution low.
Sand quarrying along tile riverbed should not be concentrated at one spot to avoid natural flowv
disruption. Quarrying near bridges or river training structures should not take place.
Quarries should be restored through proper site trimming and bioengineerinig measures.
4.1.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To enhiance the environlmental mitigation measures it is important that DoR initiates consultation
and coordination withi relevant government agencies and local people. GSoB and FSD sIhould he
involved in identifying and locating quarries. GSoB can ensure that the site is teciinically
feasible. As botlh of these agencies issue quarrying permits conflict arising later due to
duplication of permit for the same site can be resolved by involving both agencies at a time.
Bioengineering specialist can help to restore the sites by suggesting and identifying suitable
vegetation species.
Equally importanit isX the involvement of the Dzongkhag administration and local people in
designatinig the sites, and its distinct boundaries. This can avoid road damages resultin1g out of
random quarrying.
Page 13 of 39



ANNEX 4
4.1.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
When considering a quarry it shiould also iticorporate the local interest. The commercial quarries
sihould not deprive the resources of local people. Their agriculture-based livelilhood shiould be
respected.
4.1.5. Budgeting
It is a traditional practice that the quarries are not restored after the operation, as this lias not been
budgeted. Budgeting provision lias to be covered in the project under site restoration and slope
stabilization head. The contractor shall be paid as per actual work performed and on thle
satisfaction of the DoR engineer (BoQ).
4.1.6. Supervision
The success of environmental mitigation measures entirely depends oln quality supervision. The
supervisor should know the measures to be implemented at each site. He should be equipped withi
all relevant documents suchi as project and contract document, road construction manlual, blasting
manual and bioengineering manual.
It is assumed that the daily supervision is executed by the contractor's engineer. However, the
periodic supervision shiould be conducted by the project implementation unit (PIU), DoR. All the
supervision activities planned and executed must be well documented.
4.1.7. Monitoring / Evaluation
The monitoring can be segregated into two: daily monitoring and periodic monitoring. Again it is
assumed that the daily monitorinig will be carried out by the contractor's engineer. Wlhile periodic
monitoring should be carried out by DoR on need basis and biannually by an external team. All
findings and instruCtiolIs imparted must be well documented.
Tlle evaluations carried out at project midterm  or at its completion can also be called a
irnonitorinig in the sense that findings can alter the ongoing as well as future project
implemenitationi modalities.
The indicators are: sites look relatively leveled and vegetation is outcropping, engineer's report of
site closure and executed restorations.
Remarks: all rehabilitation/restoration works should be completed before the DoR issues
the completion certificate. This applies to all the following construction activitiies.
4.2 SPOIL DISPOSAL
4.2.1. Potential impact
A series of adverse impacts can result from improper spoil disposal like: disruption of local
lhydrology, manmade landslides, loss of vegetation  cover, pastureland  ancl aesthietically
unpleasing sites.
Page 14 of 39



ANNEX 4
4.2.2. Mitigation Measures
To keep the damage at the minimum, excavators must be used for constructioni. The excavated
material such as topsoil and stones should be stacked at safe places for reuse at a later stage of
construction.
For slope gradients of less than 70%, a concept of balancing cut and fill should be applied.
Minimizing the cut material can eliminate/reduce the environmental damages (refer design
mitigation measures). The recommended spoil disposal sites are small natural depressions.
abandoned quarries and degraded areas. Spoil material should be filled in benciles to prevent
slope overloading. The spoil deposits should be trimmed well and bioengineering measures
applied.
4.2.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To ensure that spoil is deposited at the right places prior consultation of the local people is
required. This can prevent spoil depositing in their cultural and other sensitive areas (local
beliefs). For bioengineering measures, bioengineering specialist shiould be consulted withi regard
to suitable vegetation species.
4.2.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
The experiences elsewhere in the country and in the region have revealed that casual spoil
disposal has deprived local drinking and irrigation water facilities and at the same tilme lhas
damaged tile agricultural land. The road activities should consider avoiding such damages. In
addition complaints from the locals can hinder project progress.
4.2.5. Budgeting
Spoil hiaulage must be budgeted for the distances required.
4.2.6. Supervision
The responsible agencies and the frequency of monitoring are as discussed in section or para
4.1.6.
4.2.7. Monitoring / Evaluation
The responsible agencies and the frequency of monitoring are as discussed il section or para
4.1.7.
The parameters to be monitored are: spoil disposal sites, bioengineering applications and success
rates, conflicts withi the locals.
The success indicators are: less landslides, vegetated construction sites, no local conflict, and
enginieers completion report.
Page 15 of 39



ANNEX 4
4.3 SLOPE STABILITY
4.3.1. Potential Negative Environmentall Impacts
Unstable up and downhill road slopes can result in: soil erosion, clogging of side drains, rulloff
spillover on tle road surface and down the slope causing landslides, and hindering the traffic
movement.
4.3.2. Mitigation Measures
Maintain the batters' gradient as specified in the Road Design Manual, developed by DOR. The
existing vegetation on the slopes outside the immediate construction corridor should remilain
undisturbed during road construction and/or upgrading. Bioengineer barren slopes to stop soil
erosion and protect thiem  from  grazing. Erect support structures whiere slope failures are
anticipated or occurred. Monitor slope failures and initiate remedial actions at the earliest
possible.
4.3.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To carry out slope stability investigations, DOR shiould consult and coordinate with engineerin-
geologist for professional inputs. ln addition the DOR should also refer to bioengineering
specialist to suggest suitable vegetation species wihen applying bioengineering measures.
4.3.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
Wlhen applying mitigation measures consideration should be given to the local land use and
grazing lhabits.
4.3.5. Budgeting
Thie cost for engineering geologist advice, bioengineering measures and grazing protection cost
shiould be included in the overall budget of thlle project.
4.3.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 4. 1.6.
4.3.7.  Monitoring/Evaluation
As discussed in the section 4.1.7.
The success indicators are: no landslides; and bioengineering measures visible.
4.4 DRAINAGE
4.4.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Excess surface ruioff along the road due Ito inadequate drainage structures, siltation of wvater
courses down stream due to erosion from unlined drains, slope failures or landslides and xvater
seepage.
Page 16 of 39



ANNEX 4
4.4.2. Mitigation Measures
The adequacy of culverts, chaninels, bridge waterways and other drainage structures and their
ability to dischiarge tihe runoff should be considered. All permanent drainage chaninels througi
highi water table areas shiould be lined. Maintain drains open at all timnes.
4.4.3. Public Participation and Coordination
Dzongkhag administration and locals should be consulted when locating drainage structures.
4.4.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
When deciding on local drainage installations, the drinking water and irrigation water supply
should be considered. Considering this at an early stage can avoid conflict with the locals, whici
can affect project progress.
4.4.5. Budgeting
Adequate budget provision should be kept for additional drainage structures, as drainage is
considered to be the most important factor for hill roads.
4.4.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 4.1.6.
4.4.7. Monitoring/Evaluation
As discussed in section 4.1.7.
Success indicators are: controlled surface runoff, no landslides, no complaints from the locals.
4.5 WORK /LABOR CAMP LOCATION, OPERATION AND CLOSURE
4.5.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Air and noise pollutioll from the construction machines, water pollution from oil and grease and
unsanitary waste disposal practices, social conflict, deforestation and wildlife disturbance.
4.5.2. Mitigation Measures
Camps should be located away from settlements or drinking water supply intakes, landslides or
flood prone areas. The trees should be protected as far as possible when setting up camps. No tree
cuttings shall be allowed except dead and fallen trees.
Labors shiould be provided with reasonable shelters, preferably made of bamboo and tin sheet
roofing. The camps must be equipped with water and pit latrine facilities. Solid wastes should be
collected (pit holes) and disposed off to safe places. Oil and grease from machines should be
collected and removed from the site for recycling or annihilation.
Pa,e 17 of 39



ANNEX 4
Wlhen closinig the camps all wreckage, rubbish and items no longer used must be collected and
disposed off or burned. The site must be restored applying bioengineering measures.
The workforce should be provided with fuel in areas of fuelwood sliortage.
4.5.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To ensure that a suitable site is located it shiould be mandatory to consult tile local people througLh
the respective Dzongkhag administration. Involving the locals will allow to identify sites
acceptable to all the parties and will avoid sites sensitive to local beliefs, close to monlumenits and
water supply intakes.
To create awareness among the labors on the preservation of vegetation and wildliife FSD should
be consulted.
4.5.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
If private land is involved the expropriation of land should be according to the Land Act of
Bhutan, 1979 (amended in 1998) and compensated as per the Land Compensation Rate, 1996. It
is recommended that priority should be given for 'land for land' in the same locality. Temporary
land expropriation should be compensated as per the annual yield of the land.
The cultural sites should be identified and protected, e.g. chorten should be prevented from
damage and restored after construction with paintings.
4.5.5. Budgeting
Thie budget for sites restoration, provision of reasonable shelters for labors, solid and liquid
wastes disposal and sanitary provisions, property compensation, and fuel for labors should be
included in the project cost.
4.5.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 4.1.6.
4.5.7. Monitoring / Evaluation
As discussed in the section 4.1.7.
Parameters to be monitored are: provision for water & sanitation, waste collection facilities and
disposal sites, proper site closure.

sulfur dioxide resulting in human healthi hazard and destruction to vegetation. High concentration
of airborne dusts can damage surrounding vegetation, agricultural crops, and surface water
resources. Excessive noise can result in the disruption of livestock and wildlife's natuLal
existence, and can also cause annoyance and potential health hazard to human population.
4.10.2. Mitigation Measures,
The blasting operation shiould adopt controlled methods (i.e. no overcharging) ancl be conducted
during daylight lhours. Single shiot hole blasting should be discouraged.
Stockpiled sand and gravel should be slightly wetted before loading especially during Nvindy
conditionis. Dirt or gravel roads passing thrOucghl population centers should be black topped and
water sprayed during constructionl.
Vegetative buffer zones should be used to protect potential water resources from road activities.

ANNEX 5
5 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Most of the environmental problems related in this phiase are similar to the one mentionied in the
construction phase. However, certain additions are made depending uponl the nature of the
problems in the maintenance phase.
5.1 QUARRY
5.1.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
The impacts resulting out of quarry activities are: slope instability as a break in natural contours
often causing slope failures, dust pollution, surface water disruption, health hazard, and are
aesthetically unpleasing as vegetation is removed and surroundings covered by pollutants.
5.1.2. Mitigation Measures
In addition to the indicated quarry sites (by EA report) the construction responsible shoLlld
physically identify and investigate it thoroughly involving engineering geologist. The location
should be away from population centers, cultural sensitive sites, drinking water intake points,
potential croplands, and protected biological areas.
When opening the site, care should be taken to keep the vegetation clearing at tile minimtim
possible. The blasting operations should be conducted in a controlled manner, not overcharging
the holes and proper warnings/signals relayed to the surrounding people prone to danger on time.
It is recommended to execute blasting operations in benches (series of holes blasted at a time and
the next series following few seconds later and so on..). For stone quarrying, the operation sh1ou.ld
begini from the crown of the slope and then move gradually downward. Shot hole blasting is NOT
RECOMMENDED. In case of dry weather the it should wet tile site by spraying water to keep
dust pollution low.
Sand quarrying along the riverbed should not be concentrated at one spot to avoid natural flowv
disruption. Quarrying near bridges or river training structures shiould not take place.
Quarries should be restored tihroughi proper site trimming and bioengineering measures.
5.1.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To enhiance the environmental mitigation measures it is important that DoR initiates consUltation
and coordinationi with relevant government agencies and local people. GSoB and FSD shIould be
involved in identifying and locating quarries. GSoB can ensure that tile site is techiically
feasible. As both of these agencies issue quarrying permits conflict arising later due to
duplication of permit for the same site can be resolved by involving both parties concurrenltly.
Bioengineering specialist can help to restore the sites by suggesting and identifyinig suitable
vegetation species.
Equally important is the involvement of the Dzongkhag administrationl and local people in
designating the sites, and its distinct boundaries. This can avoid road damages resulting out of
random quarrying.
Page 25 of 39



ANNEX 5
5.1.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
Wheni considering a quarry it should also incorporate the local interest. The commercial quarries
should not deprive the resources of local people. Their agriculture-based livelihood should be
respected.
5.1.5. Budgeting
It is a traditional practice that the quarries are not restored after the operation, as this has not been
budgeted. Budgeting provision has to be covered under the annual maintenalnce budget.
5.1.6. Supervision
Close supervision is necessary during spoil spreading, as it is advisable to lay in benchies. The
daily supervisioni should be the responsibility of site engineer. Periodic supervision can be carried
out DoR.
5.1.7. Monitoring
The road maintenance site engineer should carry out the daily monitoring, while a periodic
monitoring should be done by DoR.
An external team (possibly initiated by Dzongkhag) can also conduct periodic monitoring
depending upon need basis.
The parameters to be monitored are: spoil disposal sites, bioengineering applications and success
rates, conflicts with the locals.
5.2 SPOIL DISPOSAL
5.2.1. Potential impact
A series of adverse impacts can result from improper spoil disposal like: disruption of local
hydrology, manmade landslides, loss of vegetation cover, pastureland ancl aesthletically
unpleasing sites.
5.2.2. Mitigation Measures
To keep the damage at the minimum, excavators must be used for construction. The excavated
material suchl as topsoil and stones should be stacked at safe places for reuse at a later stagte of
constructioni.
For slope gradienits of less than 70%, a concept of balancing cut and fill should be applied.
Minimizinig the cut material can eliminate/reduce the environmental damages (refer design
mitigation measures). The recommended spoil disposal sites are small natural depressions.
abandonied quarries and degraded areas. Spoil material should be filled in benchles to prevent
slope overloading. The spoil deposits shouild be trimmed well and bioengineering measures
applied.
Page 26 of 39



ANNEX 5
5.23. Public Participation and Coordination
To ensure that spoil is deposited at the riglht places prior consultatioll of the local people is
required. This can prevent spoil depositing in their cultural and other sensitive areas (local
beliefs). For bioengineering measures, bioenginieering specialist should be consulted with regard
to suitable vegetation species.
512.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
The experiences elsewhere in the country and in the region have revealed that casual spoil
disposal has deprived local drinking and irrigation water facilities and at the same time has
damaged the agricultural land. The road activities should consider avoiding such damagaes. In
addition complaints from the locals can hinder project progress.
52.5. Budgeting
Spoil haulage must be budgeted for the distances required.
51.6. Supervision
The responsible agencies and the frequency of monitoring are as discussed in section or para
5.1.6.
512.7. Monitoring
The responsible agencies and the frequency of monitoring are as discussed in section or para
5.1.7.
The parameters to be monitored are: spoil disposal sites, bioengineering applications and success
rates, conflicts with the locals.
The success indicators are: less landslides, vegetated construction sites, no local conflict, and
engineers completioni report.
5.3   SLOPE STABILITY
5.3.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Unstable up and downhill road slopes can result in: soil erosion, clogging of side drainis, ruilloff
spillover on the road surface and down the slope causing landslides, and hinderinig the traffic
movement.
5.3.2. Mitigation Measures
Maintaini the batters' gradient as specified in the Road Design Manual, developed by DOR. The
existing vegetation on the slopes outside the immediate construction corridor should remaini
undisturbed during road constructioni and/or upgrading. Bioengineer barren slopes to stop soil
erosion and prevent them  from grazing. Erect support structures where slope failures are
anticipated or have occurred. Monitor slope failures and initiate remedial actions at tlhe earliest
possible.
Page 27 of 39



ANNEX 5
5.3.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To carry out slope stability investigations, DOR should consult and coordinate with engineering
geologist for professional inputs. In addition the DOR should also refer to bioengineering
specialist to suggest suitable vegetation species when applying bioengineering measures.
5.3.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
When applying mitigation measures consideration should be given to the local land use and
grazing habits.
5.3.5. Budgeting
The cost for geological advice, bioengineering measures and grazing protection cost should be
included in the overall budget for maintenarice.
5.3.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 5.1.6.
53.7. Monitoring
As discussed in the section 5.1.7.
T1he success indicators are: no landslides; and bioengineering measures visible.

Excess surface runoff along the road due to inadequate drainage structures, siltation of water
courses down stream due to erosion from unlined drains, slope failures or landslides and water
seepage.
5.4.2. Mitigation Measures
The adequacy of culverts, channels, bridge waterways and other drainage structures and their
ability to discharge the runoff should be considered. All permanent drainage chaniniels through
high water table areas should be lined. Maintain drains open at all times.
5.4.3. Public Participation and Coordination
Dzongkhag administrationl and locals should be consulted when locating drainage structures.
5.4.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
Wheni deciding on local drainage installations, the drinking water and irrigation water supply
should be considered. Considering this at an early stage can avoid conflict with the locals, wilich
can affect project progress.
Page 28 of 39



ANNEX 5
5.4.5. Budgeting
Adequate budget provision should be kept for additional drainage structures, as drainage is
considered to be the most important factor for hill roads.
5.4.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 5.1.6.
5.4.7. Monitoring
As discussed in section 5.1.7.
Success indicators are: controlled surface runoff, no landslides, no complaints from the locals.

5.5.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
Air and noise pollution from the construction machines, water pollution from oil and grease and
unsanitary waste disposal practices, social conflict, deforestation and wildlife disturbance.
5.5.2. Mitigation Measures
Camps should be located away from settlements or drinking water supply intakes, landslides or
flood prone areas. The trees should be protected as far as possible when setting up camps. No tree
cuttings shall be allowed except dead and fallen trees.
Labors should be provided with reasonable shelters, preferably made of bamboo and til sheet
roofing. The camps must be equipped witil water and pit latrine facilities. Solid wastes shoulcl be
collected (pit holes) and disposed of to safe places. Oil and grease from machiiies should be
collected and removed from the site for recycling or annihilation.
Wheni closing the camps all wreckage, rubbish and items no longer used must be collected and
disposed of or burned. The site must be restored applying bioengineering measures.
The workforce shiould have access to other energy means in areas of fuelwood shortage.
5.5.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To ensure that a suitable site is located it should be mandatory to consult the local people through
the respective Dzongkhag administration. linvolvinig the locals will allow  to identify sites
acceptable to all the parties and will avoid sites sensitive to local beliefs, close to monumilenlts and
water supply intakes.
To create awareness amonlg the labors on the preservation of vegetation and wildlife FSD should
be consulted.
Page 29 of 39



ANNEX 5
5.5.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations
If private land is involved the expropriation of land should be according to the Land Act of
Bhutan, 1979 (amended in 1998) and compensated as per the Land Compensation Rate. 1996. It
is recommended that priority should be given for 'land for land' in the same locality. Tempolary
land expropriation should be compensated as per the annual yield of the land.
The cultural sites should be identified and protected with mitigation measures e.g.chorten7 should
be prevented from damage and restored after construction with paintings.

For road signs/indications standard approved paints should be used ensuring distinct and easy
visibility. All danger sites slhould have clear signs indicating the type of problem. During blasting
operations a person should convey the warning to the approachinig traffic.
Safety support structures should be erected wherever necessary in danger sites.
5.11.3. Public Participation and Coordination
To have standard sigins and knowledge on approved paints RSTA should be consulted.
5.11.4. Budgeting
Provide budget for signs and paints.
5.11.5. Supervision
As discussed in section 5.1.6.
5.11.6. Monitoring
As discussed in section 5.1.7.
The parameters to be monitored are: erection of signs/structures at all required sites.
Indicators: distinct and visible signs, no or less accidents.

5.12 ROAD SURFACE
5.12.1. Potential Negative Environmental Impacts
The impacts related to poor road surface maintenance are: road shoulder erosion.
development of potholes, traffic skidding and development of settlement structures.
5.12.2. Mitigation Measures
Monitor potholes and fill them with suitable aggregates and patch up witil bitumen incase of
blacked topped road. Never ever fill potholes with soil (particularly with higih clay content) as
this makes roads slippery. Ensure that proper road shoulder is maintained and is clean of
debris and other objects.
Enforce Rules and Regulations for construction of temporary, semi-permanenit and permianenit
houses on either sides of the roads, 1995 issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA).
5.12.3. Public Participation and Coordination
DOR should consult and coordinate with concerned dzongkhag administration to enforce the
rules and regulations, issued by MOHA.
5.12.4. Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerationss
If already existing structures withini road right of way (ROW) need to be relocated for safety
reasons necessary compensations should be arranged as per Land Compensation Rate, 1996.
5.12.5. Budgeting
The compensation for the relocation of existing structures within road ROW should be
included in the annual maintenance budget.
i5.12.6. Supervision
As discussed in section 5.1.6.
5.12.7. Monitoring
As discussed in section 5.1.7.
The indicators are: no potholes, no accidents, no cowsheds and other structures are seen along
the                                                                       road.

6   MONITORING / EVALUATION
Monitoring is an important tool to ensure that the proposed mitigation measures are
implemented and to know the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. This can also indicate
if there is a need to revise mitigation arTangements for the potential adverse impacts. The
inonitorinig activities are:
1. Baseline Monitoring, is a collection or measurement of environmental parameters durinig
pre-project time.
2. Effects Monitoring, is a collection or measurements of environmental parameters during
project implementation time that can be attributed to the project.
3. Compliance Monitoring, is a periodic sampling or measurement to ensure that the
regulatory requirements are observed and tihe standards are met.
For the monitoring to be effective it is very crucial to have well establishied baseline data.
Monitoring of impacts should be linked to the predictions of impacts so that thlere is
information on:
* the nature of impacts;
* the magnitude of impacts;
*  the geographical extent of impacts;
* the time-scale of impacts;
X  the probability of impacts occurring;
*  the significance of impacts; and
e  the level of confidence in the prediction of impacts.
Environimental monitorinig for roads is required at two stages:
1. Construction phase monitoring; and
2. Operation phase monitoring.
6.1 CONSTRUCTION PHASE MONITORING
ln this phiase of the project, three levels of monitoring are pertinent i.e. routine monitoring.
periodic monitoring and evaluations.
6.1.1. Routine Monitoring
This should be the responsibility of the construction agency, and happens on a routinie basis
as project advances. Records should be maintained for whatever is monitored.

ANNEX 6
6.1.2. Periodic Monitoring
An external team (team suggested by EA for that particular project) has to be formed as
appropriate to carry out this monitoring. The cost of monitoring should be budgeted in the
project. If possible bianinual monitoring should be carried out, once during monsoon and once
during lean season.
6.1.3. Evaluation
Projects may be subjected to evaluations e.g. midtern and final evaluations to meet
economical ecological requirements. The findings of the mission can benefit the project in
mitigating some of the adverse impacts.
6.2   OPERATION PHASE MONITORING
Unlike the construction phase monitoring there are two levels of monitoriig, i.e. routille
monitoring and periodic monitoring.
6.2.1. Routine Monitoring
The site engineer should carry out this monitoring on a routine basis. He should inforn the il-
clharge of the Road Maintenance Cell responsible for that road for timely action.
6.2.2. Periodic Monitoring
An externally formed team should carry out this monitoring if possible on biannual basis. The
team can be proposed by the EA team commissioned for the particular project. The budget for
this monitoring should be included in the maintenance cost.
