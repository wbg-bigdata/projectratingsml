MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXEE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S. N. C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATFS
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendaion on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$150.0 million equivalent is submtd for your approval. The proposed loan,
which would be guarateed by the United Mexican States, would be repayable over 15 years, including
three yeas of grace, at the Bank's iarlable interest rate and charges. NAFIN would be the Borrower.
Ihe National Instte for Crops, Livestock, and Forestry Research (Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones
Forestales y Agrpecaras, INIFAP) and the Directorate of Studies for the Agricultura Sector (Direccion
de Estudios del Sector Agropecuario y Forestal, DGES.AF) of the Secretar  of Agriculture and Water
Resources (Secretaria de Agricultura y Rewrsos Hidraulicos, SARH) would be the executing agencies.
2.        B and. The overall impact of research and extension on Mexican agriculture in recent
years has been weak. A recent Bank Agricultura Technology Sector Review (Report No. 9297-ME)
identified underinvaestmet, resulting from deep cuts in public expnditures in the 198Qs, and Inefficient
resource management as the primary constrais to a productive agricultural research and extension
system. The proposed operaton would address these issues by financing investments in inmfastructure,
farm, laboratory, and office equipment, training, and institonal development for the chief national
research and extenion agencies. The proposed operation would help in restoring public fimding for
research and extension to adequate levels, in reorienting activities in line with new government priorities,
and in catalyzing policy changes to improve the efficiency of technology generation and transfer.
3.       The proposed operation is consistent with the Government's strategy for agricultural
tecnology. The main objective of the Governent's strategy is to reverse the falling rate of agricultural
productivity gains through improved research and extension. This involves generatng and extending new
agricultural technologies, and acceleratng the tmnsfer of existing ones. With Bank support under
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loans I and II, approved in March 1988 and June 1991, respectively, the
Government has sought to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture and it would continue that
effort in this operation, by targeting public research and etension services on poorer rainfed and tropical
areas in which private research and extension are less prominent. The straW  explicidy recognizes
appropriate roles for basic research conducted in universities, applied and adaptive research done in
INIFAP, and technology transfer done by a unified public service and a variety of private sector agencies.
4.        Rationale for Bank GrollD bxvolvement. Bank involvement is justified in helping to revive
public investment in agricultural research and extension, and thereby restoring the vigor of what had been
a successful system. The Bank would help promote the reorientation of expenditure consistent with the
reduced role of the agricultural public sector, with a new emphasis on poorer and rainfed regions, and
with better cost recovery for public services. External assistance would also help meet problems of
managing a more complex agricultural research program, of shifting emphasis to rainfed and tropical
agriculture, of lowerin environmental costs, and of using results of basic research more effectively.
Bank support has been shown to improve research and extension linkages at the national level in related
operations in Mexico and the project design is fully consistent with lessons from successful Bank-
supported agricultural research and extension projects worldwide.



-2 -
S.       PKej  Qbkti=. Project objectives are to: (a) help generate new technology in crops,
livestock, foestry, ad natural reurce magement, using applied and adative reseah, with acen
on those products and regions lest likely to interest private research; (b) validate technology proposed
to producers using adaptive research and strngthened links to extension; (c) transfer agricultural
technologies to producers via exteion; (d) improve isitutional capacity to manage the generation and
diffusion of new technologies, including the capacity to identify problems and allocate resources to them;
and (e) stablish a more sustainable improvemen in funding for agricultural research and extenion via
reater mobilization of nonfederal fsmding.
6.       lk               . Tbe proJect would finance a maJor share of activides of the two
principal public agricultural research and etension institudons, with links to others doing basi^ research
outside SARH. The proposed project size is conguent with appropriate levels of public investment in
these activities, based on international experience. Project priorities-by agroclimate, commodity, farm
type, and production system-have been reviewed thoroughly in sector work and in project preparadon,
and the investment plan has been designed accordingly. The proposed executing agencies-INIFAP for
the research and iutdonal development components, and the DOESAF for the extension component-
are established branches of SARH, with adequate staff and procedures for implementing the project.
7.       The proposed project would have three components: (a) a research component would amount
to about 53% of total project cost, including contngencies; (b) an extension component would amount
to about 35% of project cost, including contingencies; and (c) an institutional development for research
component would amount to about 12% of project cost, including contingencies. The wihology
gm lcn.th    weha.rhs ne           (totl cost of US$163.2 million) would be executed by INIFAP
and would include applied crop improvement and management, livestock management, forestry, and
training. Priority products would be maize, beans, rainfed wheat, rainfed rice, fruits, vegetables,
oilseets. beef, milk, and foresty goods. A small amount of collaborative research would be contracted
to Mexican universities and other qualified entities. A program of adaptive research would be done in
close collaboration with the etension service. Other subcomponents would be for seed productton
ethods, natua resource management (principally soil and water conservation), and genetic resources.
The Inw          tnfer hroug h onAcomoone  (total costs of US$102.7 mfllion) would continue
the Agricultural Extension Project (Proyecto de Oraizcion, Capacitacion, Asistencia Tecnica, y
Investigacion, PROCATI) (Loan 2859-ME) now under implementation and would be executed by the
DGESAF. Project activities are on-farm trals, staff training, technical assistance and training to
producers, and soil conservation, many of which would be executed in close coordination with INIFAP.
Investments would be made in vehicles, field equipment, computing and communications equipment, and
training mateials. As with PROCATI, limited incremental recurrent costs would be fmanced on a
declining scale, including staff salaries. The proposed operation would work in 75 of the 193 rural
development districts of Mexico, including the 25 existng ones of PROCATI; the districts were selected
on the criteria of non-duplication of private   nsion, potential for productive rainfed agriculture, and
consistency with the orientation of reseach in the proposed project. The insdtutional development for
reserh component (total costs of US$34.1 million) would strengthen the capacity of INIFAP; help in
mobilizing resources through cost recovery from the private sector and state and local governments;
broaden the intellectual base of agricultural research and stegthen INIFAP's links to basic research; give
speciized advice to agrcultral scientists; and provide more scientific and technical informaion to
INIFAP staff. In this contet, this component would improve INIFAP's library and scientific information
services. I would also strengthen INIFAP's managerial capacity and management information systems,
providig data about the returns to individual programs and research pnorities. Further, it would
suppor, inter alia, long-term technical assistance to mobilize non-federal funding from public-private
patunhips; a study of the environmental and productivity effects of agricultural research and extension;
endowment of research by Mexican and other qualified organizations in collaboration with INIFAP; and
efficiency measures and technical support to INIFAP's research networks.

8.       Total prject cost would be US$300 million, lncluding taxes and duties of US$32.1 million
and a foreigp exchange component of US$139.3 million. The proposed Bank loan woud finance US$150
million. Schedule A shows project cost and the finacing plan. Retroactive financing woud be granted
for up to US$10 million for digible expenditures incurred after June 17, 1991. Local cost financing of
US$46.9 million would be provided in order to help meet the high trainig and incremental recurrent
operatig costs of the proposed project. Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursemen, as well as the d en schedule. A dmetable of project processing and the status of
Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map relevant to the project and
the Staff Apprais Report No. 9782-ME dated April 13, 1992 are also atched.
9.       Pro  iW      atpn. The borrower would be NAFIN. Loan proceeds would be disbursed
over a seven-year period. The research and Instittional development components would be executd by
INIPAP, and the exteion component by the DOESAF, which are the current researcb and extension
agencies of SARH. A project man  m unit would be created witin INIFAP to faclitate coordination
between the proposed executng agencies and to assist with procurement, audit, and reporting.
10.      Kea issues and actions. The Government has taken the following important actions in
preparation for the project: it has (A) issued a statement of its agricultral tehology policy; (B) created
a qualified Project Unit to manage the operation; (C) established a Research Grants Committee to allocate
resech pants competitively under the project, using the rules of the Program of Support for Science
in Mexico (Programa par el Apoyo a la Ciencia en Mexico, rACIME); and (D)) apprved a 1992 project
budget with adequate resources for the project's research, extension, and soil conservation actvities.
I1.      During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following actions: (A) The Government
will: (i) maintain in each executing agency an organizonal structure, functions, and adequate staff,
all satsfcry to the Bank, for the implementation and supervision of the project; (H) promptly inform
the Bank of any proposed change in the orgaizational structre or functions of any of the execudng
agencies; and reo    n of the executing agencies; and (ili) maintain the Project Unit with stucture,
functions, and staff atsfaory to the Bank. INIFAP will (B) train and allocate key personnel for its
scientific support and information needs; (C) design an iegratd library system by August 31, 1992,
and make it operational by January 1, 1993; and (I)) make operational a research management
information system (MIS) by January 1, 1993. The Government (E) will submit to the Bank terms of
reference by August 31, 1992 for a study of the enviromental effects of agriculture and will complete
an initial phase of the study no later than June 30, 1994; (F) will submit terms of reference by August
31, 1992 for a study of the impact of research and extension on agricutural productivity and will
complete the fit phase of the study no later than June 30, 1994; (G) will: (i) furnish an annual report
acceptable to the Bank no later than March I of each year; (ii) provide to the Bank an anmal project
work plan no later than June 15 of each year; and (iii) hold an annual project review by September 30
of each year; (B) will use the project implementation and impact indicators, as shown in Schedule I of
the Guaraee Agreement; (1) will hold a mid-term review of the project by September 30, 1994 to assess
overall project imple tion and impact and will make changes in the project as recommended by that
review; (J) wil submit to its Congress adequate annual fiscal budgets for research, extension, and soil
conservation in the annual work plan and furnish evidence by March 15 of each year of the budget
apprwved by Congress; (K) will conduct any proposed research with trsgenic organisms under safety
stndards acceptable to the Bank; (L) agreed on a final list of the 75 eligible rural development districts
for extension acdvities in the project; and (M) will apply national standards and procedures acceptable
to the Bank for the udlization of pesticides in the project. (N) Ithe project unit will select eight additional
pflot soil conservation districts by June 30, 1993. The Govement (0) will use qualified agencies
perform monit    and evaluation of the extension component; (P) will have the project audits audited
in accordance wih procedures acceptable to the Bank; and (Q) will apply, as the governing procedures



-4-
of the Research Grants Commi_, the opating rules of PACIE, which are acceptable to the Bank,
for evauating proposals made ta the Research Grants Committee. Tle conditions of feivMena are
as follows: (a) the Government and NAFIN shall have signed a sasfactory agrement for transferring
the loan proceeds; and (b) the project unit shall have signed contracts with qualified entites for
monitoring and evaluating the extension component of the project.
12.                  L>=. Ibe proposed operation would incur no direct environmental costs and
would have an en         ratng of C. It is expected to produce direct environmental benefits from
broader application of better tecbhiques for soil conservation, reduced chemical input use, integrated pest
management, and more robust genetic resources. Indirect environmental benefits are expected from
greater i    onal caplity to calculate environmental costs and to design research and extension
programs to lessen such costs.
13.                  t. Expected benefits are more productive methods for crop and livestock
production, and forestry management, incresed cacity to generate new methods, and transfer of
existing technology. Major examples are higher-yielding plant cultivars, superior techniques for crops,
livestock, and forestry, better targeting of public research and etension efforts, and faster adoption of
experimentally proven ideas. Ihese benefits are expected to occur principally on the country's 17 million
hectares of rainfed crop land, and to a lesser extent on the 7 million heetares of irrigated land. As many
benefits would accrue to poor produces and women agriculturalists, the project is anticipated to have a
positive impact on poverty. Institutional benefits would be from lower management costs and more
effient resource allocation. An additional benefit would be a broader, more stable, funding base from
public nonfederal and private sources. While those funds cannot now be estimated accurately, it is
cipated that they would be important in later years of the project.
14.      ErjW Risks. Some previous agriculural projects have been hindered by lack of budget,
excessive tuover of managers, and changing priorities duing implementaton. The Government has
apprved an acceptable project budget for 1992 and has crated a qualified project unit. Priority activities
for research and extesion were agreed before appraisal. Particular risks involve the extension of
inefficient or inppropriate technologies to producers, restrictive seed policy, susinability in reforming
the focus and practices of extension, and inadeq    research and extension linkages undermining the
effectiveness of the operation. Sector work on agricultur  technology and soil conservation has been
used in project preparation to define a realistic set of priority technologies and commodities in
collaboration with the Government. Approprift seed policy reforms have been incorporated in the new
Mexican seed legislation of June 1, 1991. Though difficultes may arise in reforming extension, requisite
refrms have been incorporated in the loan's conditionality. Improved research and research/extension
lins are a major part of the proposed operation, to be achieved through joint research and extension
activities in techology validation and transfer.
15.      R_              . I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
