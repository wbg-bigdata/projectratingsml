MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK
FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A MINIG DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$30.0 million to help finance a Mining
Development Technical Assistance Project (PASMA). The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
The loan would also refinance a Project Preparation Facility (PPF-238-AR) provided for
project preparation.
Country/Sector Background
2.    Partially supported by a formidable structural reform and an ambitious privatization
program, Argentina's ongoing macroeconomic program has resulted in relative price stability
and economic growth unknown for decades in the country. Since sustained future growth
hinges on an expanding and dynamic private sector, the Government's new role is to avoid
distortions that may repress or misguide private economic activities, and to provide an
enabling institutional and regulatory framework for the development of such activities, among
them mining.
3.    The Government's mining sector policy follows broader economic policy and is
formulated by the federal Mining Secretariat (SM) at the Ministry of Economy, Public
Works and Services. In the past two years SM has resolutely pursued both sector reform
and its development, in close cooperation with the provincial governments, which administer
mining rights according to the Argentine Constitution. In addition, SM develops the
country's geological and mining sector data bases and provides technical support to the
provincial administrations. Following analytical work which addressed sector deficiencies
and underlined the country's significant geological potential and the possibly large
contribution of mining to the economy, the Govermnent developed a strategy to become an
enabler of increased, environmentally sound private mining (Annex 1).
4.    A 1993 World Bank Mining Sector Review, carried out with Swedish and Finnish
collaboration, showed that mining activities, at less than 0.5 percent of GDP and 1 percent of
exports in 1991, were far below the country's potential (Argentina Mining Sector Review,
Report No. 11704-AR, June 30, 1993). Production is mostly divided among many small
non-metallic operations--almost 400 of them in the six provinces of Catamarca, Chubut,
Jujuy, Mendoza, Salta and San Juan. Yet only three producers of metallic minerals account
for over 80 percent of the value of the country's production; two others account for 75
percent of gold production. While Argentina has large areas of favorable geology for the
discovery of mineral deposits, the potential of the country is largely unknown due to the
paucity of geological data, deficient information infrastructure and little exploration activity.



- 4 -
To achieve the sector's potential, it is estimated that investment in exploration should be over
US$45 million per year. The sector's past poor performance was likely due to long-term
macroeconomic instability, and the Government's excessive role in the sector. More
recently, it has been mostly due to: weak administration by provincial governments, many
of which still hold large areas, blocking access to potential deposits; outdated legal
frameworks and complicated concession and cadastral management arrangements lacking the
guarantee sought by potential investors; inadequate and inefficient institutional structures;
lack of appropriate geoscientific and sector data; and the poor infrastructure and remoteness
of potential mining areas from industrial centers and ports (although this is not a major issue
for large mining operations within an adequate policy environment).
5.    The Bank's sector report recommended that: (i) the Government encourage private
investment while avoiding wasteful promotion schemes; (ii) federal and provincial
governments better define their responsibilities, divest from mining interests and restructure
their sector agencies; (iii) legal provisions be revised to provide simple, enforceable
procedures and non-discretionary administration to grant mining rights and apply health,
safety and environmental regulations; and (iv) an independent geological service be
established. The Government endorses these recommendations. Three recently approved
laws improve the mining investment and institutional frameworks, and create the Geological
Survey--albeit not autonomous. Other institutional changes include the creation of the units
for Environmental Management and of the Unified Data Base for the sector. Divestment of
mining reserves has started. Mining companies have expressed serious interest in investing
in Argentina, yet other important reforms are needed to promote environmentally sound,
competitive private mining.
Project Objectives
6.    The main objective of the project is to develop and support, through an institutional
development technical assistance operation (IDTA), the government's policy, regulatory and
institutional reforms which encourage the expansion of private investment in mining in an
environmentally sound way. The project would help build the capacity needed--at the federal
level and in selected provinces--for an efficient administration of mining rights. It would
also support divestiture of mining interests held by provinces; establish adequate
environmental safeguards for mining operations; and strengthen services that support mining
growth, including the public provision of reliable geological and mineral information.
Project Description
7.    This IDTA project has four components: (i) a Policy Development Component
(US$1.4 million or 4 percent of base costs) to ensure the consistency of mining sector policy
with the country's overall economic liberalization efforts; to revise and prepare the legal
framework; and to develop tools for its implementation, including procedures for the
provincial administration of mining rights and appropriate environmental norms and standards
(to be implemented through the environmental management subcomponent); (ii) a Policy
Implementation Component (US$16.6 million or 47 percent of base costs) to help develop the
capacity of the federal Mining Secretariat and sector agencies in selected provinces, including



- 5 -
their cadastral and registry systems and advisory services, as well as the mechanisms to
monitor and enforce environmental management. It would also finance relevant skills
transfer, training and divestiture efforts; (iii) a Support Services Component (US$16.1
million or 45 percent of base costs), to build up the geological infrastructure in support of
private investment decisions: geological and thematic mapping; a sector data bank and public
information network; mineral and market statistics and promotion facilities; a geological
repository and ancillary facilities; and the selective strengthening of the mineral and
geological laboratory system; and (iv) a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to oversee project
implementation (US$1.4 percent of 4 percent of base costs). The project would finance
consulting services and contract works, computer equipment and software, field and office
equipment and vehicles, training, incremental operating costs (for establishing and
strengthening functions), and the necessary upgrading of facilities. Annex 2 describes in
detail the project's components and its implementation schedule.
8.    The total cost of the project is US$40 million equivalent, including US$3.7 million
for contingencies. It would be financed by a Bank loan of US$30 million, or about 75
percent of total project cost net of taxes and duties, and a government counterpart of US$10
million. The project will finance about 228 specialist-months of international consultancies
and about 1,841 specialist-months of local experts. The loan would cover 100 percent of the
project's foreign exchange costs and about 5 percent of local costs. Bank financing of some
local costs is justified since the project supports an underdeveloped sector. The Government
would cover about 95 percent of local costs. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A and Annex 2, Attachments C and D. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Government will provide counterpart funds of no less than
US$2.9 million in each of the first two years of project implementation, US$2 million in the
third, US$1.2 million in the fourth and US$1 million in the fifth year of project
implementation. One year before completion, arrangements would be made to ensure future
funding to support core sector activities initiated by the project, that will become permanent,
such as maintenance of the unified mineral data base.
Project Implementation
9.    The Argentine Republic would be the Borrower. The Secretariat of Mining (SM) in
the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services would coordinate project
implementation, and directly implement components that strengthen federal policy,
legislation, agencies and services (Undersecretariat of Mining, National Directorate of
Mining, Mineral Statistics, Data Bank and Information Network, Geological Survey,
Repository and Laboratory system). The provinces would be responsible, with the help of
SM, for implementing improvements to their mining cadastre and registry systems, and
environmental control mechanisms. Six provinces would participate in the project. Four of
them (Mendoza, San Luis, San Juan and La Rioja) would do so under a regional scheme,
"Nuevo Cuyo", that has started to develop homogeneous mining regulations, cadastres and
administrative arrangements. The other two are Catamarca and Salta, and were selected
based on their commitment to reforms. The PCU in SM will remain throughout
implementation, to coordinate federal and provincial subcomponents and carry out project
monitoring and supervision, consultancy arrangements and procurement and disbursement



- 6 -
activities. The project would be implemented over five years and terms of reference for all
components were prepared with the support of the Bank's PPF. Procurement of goods and
services and the selection and contracting of consultants would be carried out according to
Bank guidelines. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B and discussed in
Annex 2. All procurement documentation and decisions for contracts expected to cost
US$100,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. About 10 percent
(US$3.7 million) of the project's total base cost estimate would cover contingencies.
Disbursements will take place over a period of five and a half years according to
arrangements summarized in Schedule B. A Special Account to be managed by SM would
be established in the Banco de la Naci6n with an authorized allocation of up to
US$1,700,000, which is about four months of initial disbursements. Eligible expenditures of
up to US$400,000 incurred up to 12 months prior to loan signing would be retroactively
financed. Quarterly progress reports would be submitted by the PCU to the Bank. Reviews,
18 months after effectiveness and yearly thereafter, would verify implementation progress
and allow for periodic adjustments (one such review would be a Mid-Term Review).
Attachment A to Annex 2 contains the Implementation Schedule, and information on annual
contractual and other payments can be found in Annex 9.
10.   The PCU has engaged a private accounting firm to maintain accounts and process
payments for preparation expenditures. This system will be maintained during project
implementation. Separate accounts will be kept for all expenditures made under the project.
Project Accounts, the Special Account and all procurement, including Statements of
Expenditure, would be audited annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank
and appointed for at least three years. Audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later
than six months after the end of the Government's fiscal year.
Project Sustainability
11.   The project would support sector growth by creating appropriate conditions for
mining development and helping to attract long-term private investment. The legal and
institutional framework and technical services that it promotes will assist in expanding and
diversifying the country's economy and exports. Only provinces that have committed to the
proposed reforms would participate in the project. In addition, a formal agreement (drafted
during preparation and signed before negotiations) establishes the framework and provisions
of the unified mining cadastre. The project strengthens these provincial administrative roles
and the related advisory services that will be provided by the national level. Once in motion,
these activities should catalyze further reforms and sector growth in other provinces as well.
Lessons Learned
12.   There have been no previous mining loans to Argentina. However, reviews of
various recent Technical Assistance operations in Argentina, which the project has taken into
account, underline the need to aim at well-defined objectives and to implement clearly
focused, carefully designed components in a limited time period. They also indicate that: (i)
terms of reference, documentation for contracting services, and the criteria for the provision
of advisory services under such operations should be defined during the preparatory stage;



- 7 -
and (ii) Bank supervision is costly, particularly when implementation relies on many
individual consultants. In addition, since technical assistance is often aimed at sensitive
issues as well as capacity building within complex governmental structures, counterparts must
be highly committed and capable. Consultants may help establish functions and routines to
facilitate new government roles, yet they should not substitute for normal institutional
activities and decision making. Finally, units and counterparts responsible for
implementation should have sufficient delegation of responsibility, and a monitoring system
with clearly measurable intermediate and final goals should be established. Annex 8 contains
lessons learned in the sector in other countries.
Rationale for IBRD Involvement
13.   This operation is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board on May 4, 1995, which states, in para. 67 that "...Bank support for
private sector development would also be provided through the strengthening of institutions
providing assistance in.. .mining development...". Following the Bank's mining sector
review, the Government requested Bank assistance in 1993 to finance a program of reforms
and institutional improvements to support sector growth, along the lines of actions
recommended by the Bank's report, some of which the Government had started to
implement. Following approval of a Bank PPF in April 1994, the SM continued its work on
reforms in parallel with project preparation. It organized a series of meetings to inform
interested parties of sector developments and to offer and auction off to private investors
mining exploration and concession rights in areas still held by provincial entities. The
Federal Government is firm in its intention to facilitate the transfer of all such existing rights
to the private sector. The provinces selected to participate in the project are those actively
implementing this policy.
14.   The Government formulated in 1995 a Sector Policy and Strategy document,
reconfirming its role as facilitator of private mining activities, and in December 1994 it
signed a formal Agreement with each of the participating provinces, regarding
implementation of the project. In addition, it has taken significant steps to modify the legal
and institutional frameworks to encourage mining growth, yet such frameworks still lack
essential elements to attract large-scale private investment to mining operations. The Bank's
assistance will support efforts to bring about such modifications--in particular the design and
establishment of a mining cadastre system that provides security of tenure--and assist in
policy implementation, including measures to avoid the negative environmental impacts of
mining and improve geological and mining information. Through the proposed project, the
Bank would support the liberalization, modernization and growth of potentially important,
export-oriented private activities that would be geographically spread.



-8-
Future Actions
15.   The Govermnent would, in the future:
(i)   review project implementation 18 months after effectiveness--and annually
thereafter--to discuss with the Bank project progress and any issues and follow-
up actions;
(ii)   review with the Bank and allow it to comment on any proposals or draft
legislation or regulations affecting mining activities during project
implementation;
(iii)  procure goods and services through arrangements satisfactory to the Bank;
(iv)   allow the Bank to review and comment on the mining sector agencies' budgets
and staffing levels on a yearly basis during project implementation;
(v)   ensure that counterpan funding will be allocated in a timely manner during
project implementation. In addition, one year before project completion, the
Government and the Bank would review and agree on satisfactory
arrangements by the Government, to ensure adequate institutional as well as
financial sustainability (staffing and funding of recurrent costs) to support the
ongoing programs, and ihat the PCU would cease functioning at project
completion;
(vi)   one year after effectiveness, the participating provinces will have formulated
environmental regulations for mining satisfactory to the Bank; and
(vii)  three years after effectiveness, the Government will have converted the
existing National Geological Service Directorate into an administratively
separate agency.
16.   As specific conditions of effectiveness the SM would:
(i)   set up and maintain the PCU under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank--with
a project coordinator, a deputy and an administrative/procurement specialist
with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank and two support staff; and
(ii)   have secured the counterpart budget funding allocation to cover the project's
first fiscal year of implementation, and yearly thereafter.
Poverty Category: Not applicable
Environmental Aspects
17.   Mining activities have been limited in Argentina, and the Mining Code (CM) includes
only work safety provisions plus two articles dealing with environmental protection. A
general environmental law is under discussion in Congress, as well as a specific law
providing a well-designed framework for environmentally sound mining, which was
formulated during project preparation. Preparation of the regulations for this specific law is
funded by IDB in cooperation with this project. Preparation of subsequent norms and
standards are included in this project, as they involve tasks over a much longer period.



- 9 -
However, they are expected to be in place in time to address growth in mining activities,
which traditionally require long lead times. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment was
carried out for this Category B project . The project's environmental work includes: (i) a
program to develop and establish environmental norms, standards and procedures--including
provincial regulations, environmental guidelines, and a registry and qualifications system--
and the enabling institutional structure with clearly defined responsibilities at the federal and
provincial levels; (ii) measures to enable the provincial administrations to develop their
administrative capacities, facilities, resources and staff training to implement and enforce
such a program; and (iii) environmental baseline studies, to prepare natural, social and sector
background data in each participating province.
Program Objective Category
18.   This IDTA operation belongs fully to the Bank's Private Sector Development Program
Objective Category.
Participatory Approach
19.   The basic environmental legislative work addressing mining activities was carried out
in consultation and coordination with industry branch organizations, trade associations, the
miner's unions and NGOs. This approach, including media coverage informning the public,
has continued for the national level and each of the participating provinces. In order to
achieve meaningful results the project helps these provinces to develop adequate institutional
capacities, regulations and screening criteria applicable to different kinds of mining
operations according to their size, type and location. Mendoza, the only province with an
environmental law now in place, requires public hearings in connection with major industrial
uses or environmental conflicts, but has yet to establish the screening criteria. Significantly,
two major environmental groups contributed during project preparation with their knowledge
and studies: the Argentine Wildlife Foundation (FVSA, dealing mainly with flora and fauna)
and the Environmental and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN, an internationally known
group of academics focusing on legislation). Another local NGO, the Argentine Council for
Sustainable Development, was also informed about the project, as it promotes environmental
awareness and management in industry "from within."
Benefits
20.   The project would facilitate increased foreign and local investment in mining to
develop Argentina's hitherto underdeveloped mineral potential. It would technologically
update the quality and enhance the usefulness of government services supporting mining
growth, and develop a better legal framework--including a revised mining code--improved
and unified concession procedures and secure tenure provisions through the Unified Mining
Cadastre. In addition, the project would help develop technical services to enhance the
productivity of small- and medium-scale mining. Finally, the project will help develop
mechanisms throughout the sector to ensure adequate capabilities and technological skills for
the application of environmental safeguards in mining and related activities.

Risks
21.   The main project risk is sustaining the provincial stance for reform. While
participating provinces have already expressed their readiness, and have been involved in
project preparation, (i) the political will may change and (ii) the establishment of reliable
provincial administrative capacity during implementation may be more difficult than planned.
To address (i) above a Federal Agreement has been signed with participating provinces
whereby all parties are committed to implementing the project, including the Unified Mining
Cadastre. In addition, the expansion of geological infrastructure for sector growth
(geological and thematic mapping, mining data bank and basic laboratory services) helps
sustain a firm backing for reforms since such infrastructure benefits all mining activities.
Regarding (ii), there is some flexibility in the project's strong institutional component to
respond to changing needs, with a technical advisory capacity at the federal level, that can
help guide and support the development of managerial and administrative capacities at the
provincial level (and that can help extend such activities to other provinces later), and
training (on-the-job and formal) addressing specific needs. However, the administrative
capacity deals with the establishment and maintenance of new work routines that respond to
changes in the role of government (to that of an enabler in the sector), and as such may
involve longer than anticipated lead times. Finally, mining requires stable, politically neutral
macroeconomic conditions, to commit long-term investment resources. Argentina's present
macroeconomic policy has provided a window of opportunity to attract mining concerns and
investment to exploration, yet there is a risk that it will not hold. While addressing this risk
is outside the project's possibilities, by strengthening the geological infrastructure and mining
rights tenure security, the project strengthens the enabling environment for overall sustained
growth in mine development activities, which once established are likely to continue.
Recommendation
22.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
THE MINING SECTOR
A. Background
1.    In Argentina, unlike many of its South American neighbors, mining is currently not a
major economic activity. The sector accounted in 1994 for only 0.25 percent of GNP. In
1993, the total production value of all types of minerals was pesos 497 million (see Table
Al. 1). Construction materials, mainly limestone, granite, marble and onyx, account for over
65 percent (pesos 325 million) of the total value of mining production. Production of
construction materials is carried out in most provinces, while mining of other minerals in
concentrated in the mountain provinces. Mining of metallic minerals is not significant and is
concentrated in a small number of operations producing zinc, silver and lead as well as gold.
The total value of production of metallic minerals amounted to about pesos 44 million in
1993, or about 9 percent of the total value of minerals production. Non-metallic minerals
production, of which clays, borates, gypsum, and bentonite were the most important, was
pesos 126 million, or 25 percent of total minerals production in 1993.

2.    Mineral exports were US$70 million in 1992, or about 0.5 percent of total Argentine
exports of US$12.3 billion. Lead and zinc concentrates and refined products accounted for
two-thirds of this value, and borates for most of the remainder. Minerals imports were much
more significant at a value of US$665 million, or 16 percent of Argentina's total imports in
monetary terms. Iron ore imports were the most important category with US$126 million.
Alumina imports for the aluminum smelter in Chubut amounted to US$70 million. The other
most significant imports were: sodium carbonate for the glass and detergent industries
(US$31 million), refined copper, mainly for electricity supply (US$27 million), and titanium
oxides for manufacturing paints and pigments (US$25 million).

B. Past Performance of Mining
3.     Mining activities in Argentina increased during the 1970s but declined during the
1980s. The value of mineral production increased from an estimated US$740 million in
1970 to US$870 million in 1980 (in 1991 prices). This increase can be attributed mainly to
the development of borate mining to supply local and Brazilian markets, and to increases in
production of construction materials in order to meet the demand of the strongly growing
domestic building industry. Subsequently, the production of minerals declined to pesos 400
million in 1990 (in 1992 prices) due mainly to the crisis of the construction industry in
Argentina which significantly affected the production of limestone, granite and other
construction materials. Gold production increased between 1980 and 1991 due to the
development of the YMAD gold mine in Catamarca and the Mina Angela in Chubut.
Production of iron ore by the HIPASAM mine in the province of Rio Negro came to a halt



- 21 -                                 ANNEX 1
in 1990. The crisis in the world tin markets caused the closure of the tin mine in Jujuy in
1991. Among non-metallic minerals, production of borates declined as markets shrunk both
domestically and in the main foreign market, Brazil. The industry appears to have reached
its nadir in 1990. Since that year, production of minerals by value has increased to reach
pesos 496 million in 1993. Nonetheless, this level is still far below the levels achieved in the
mid- 1 980s.

4.     Table A1.3 presents the 1990 structure of the mining industry in the six key mining
provinces. Presently, the six most important mining provinces are Catamarca, Chubut,
Jujuy, Mendoza, Salta and San Juan. The five largest companies in these six provinces
produce US$95 million annually, over one-half of the total mineral value of production in the
six provinces. Three companies account for over 80 percent of Argentina's metallic mineral
production: Minera Aguilar, the main zinc and lead producer in the country; and YMAD
and Cerro Castillo, which account for over 75 percent of gold production in Argentina.
Boroquimica annually produces borates valued at US$35 million, which accounts for 28
percent of Argentina's production of non-metallic minerals (excluding construction
materials). Dofia Amalia, the major limestone producer, has an annual output of about



- 22 -                            ANNEX 1
US$11 million. Other producers in these six provinces consist of small and medium mines,
most of which register an annual output below US$1 million. There are an estimated 400
small- and medium-scale mining operations in Argentina, the majority of which are in the six
main mining provinces. These small and medium-sized operations present special difficulties
since management skills are lacking, economies of scale cannot be achieved, infrastructure in
many of the areas is poor or non-existent, and the companies have limited access to internal
markets and no access to export markets.
D. Mining Development Constraints
5.    The previous stagnation of mining in Argentina has resulted from a combination of
external and internal factors. Economic and political instability in Argentina has had a major
effect on the development of mining. Periodic economic crises and a highly regulated
economy have, in the past, made potential investors wary. An important detrimental factor
has been the heavy involvement in mining development by the federal and provincial
governments, both directly in exploration and development and indirectly through
interventionist sector policies and regulations. The most important specific constraints to
development can be summarized as follows:
(a) A deficient legislative and regulatory framework based on the original
(frequently amended) mining code of 1886 that is so diverse, outdated and complicated that
potential investors have found it very difficult to do business. Previous government efforts at
mining promotion have led to the creation of subsidized mining operations that were not
economically viable and which resulted in considerable fiscal losses.
(b) Poor administration and application of the minerals legislation. The
Constitution places administration of the mining code in the hands of the provinces, and the
demarcation of authority and responsibility between the federal and provincial governments
has not always been clear. There has been a notable lack of cooperation between the federal
and provincial mining institutions, which has often led to duplication of effort. Furthermore,
the provincial mining authorities in many cases lack the logistical means to efficiently
accomplish critical sector support functions such as licensing and administration of mineral
rights, provision of technical assistance to small-scale miners, collection of rentals and
royalties and monitoring of health, safety and environmental concerns.
(c) The regional geological data base of Argentina is deficient. So far, only about
20 percent of the country is covered by published geological maps at a scale adequate for
planning purposes. Without these basic geological maps potential investors do not know
where to begin exploring and how to reduce their risk. The country is thus at a considerable
disadvantage when compared to its neighbors where more basic geology information exists.
Considerably more actual geological mapping work has been carried out, but compilation and
publication of maps was suspended from 1987 until the end of 1992, as provincial and
federal governments were undertaking the development of specific deposits. The use and
availability of other geo-information systems is varied. Aerial photography, satellite
imagery, airborne geophysical data, geo-chemical surveys, drill hole and other data are held
by various entities such as provincial mining companies, YPF, YCF, Fabricaciones



- 23 -                             ANNEX 1
Militares, and others. But there is little sharing of these data between agencies, and modern
interpretation is constrained by a lack of appropriate hardware and software.
(d) Difficult access to exploration land by private investors. In the past the
federal and provincial governments established reserve areas in many of the known
geologically promising zones and also created security zones in the mineral-rich border areas.
The reserve areas were supposed to be explored and developed by federal (Fabricaciones
Militares) or provincial government-owned mining companies (Table Al.4 lists such
companies in provinces participating in the project). Article 409 of the Mining Code (CM)
permits the provinces to establish mining reserves of up to 200,000 hectares for an initial
period of four years, extendable for an additional five years, to conduct geological
exploration. Most of the provinces have reserved areas, but very little exploration or
development work has been undertaken on provincial reserves. In most cases, the original
prospects investigated during various regional exploration programs of the 1960s and 1970s
have not been significantly upgraded by additional drilling or other work. In these instances,
effective development of Argentina's most promising mineral areas has been frozen for many
years without any work being performed. Even though the federal government has disposed
of the mineral assets of Fabricaciones Militares, in many cases these mining titles have been
taken over by government-owned provincial companies. The result is that promising areas
are still withheld from private sector development. Recently, some provincial companies
have signed joint ventures or option agreements with private local and foreign companies. It
is very common in most countries, Argentina being no exception, for land speculators,
including government organizations, to overvalue land holdings, hence making it difficult to
negotiate with investors. The mine title situation in the provinces has meant that land is not
readily available initially for the exploration work that may lead to investment at a fair cost.
Also, the provincial mining authorities have been lax in enforcing surface rentals and work
obligations of the title holders, with the result that land is not made available to subsequent
investors.
(e) Widely divergent and inconsistent provincial tax and royalty policies. The
general level of corporate taxation of income in Argentina has not been a major constraint on
development of mining. However, until 1993 when the provinces agreed not to levy mining
royalties above 3 percent, provincial royalties were levied on production at excessively high
rates, sometimes as high as 10 percent of the market value of the minerals extracted. The
imposition of these elevated royalties has led to sub-optimal investment and mining decisions.
In effect, royalties at any level are ad valorem taxes and reduce the amount of ore which can
be mined, since they increase the so-called cut-off grade for mineral deposits. In addition to
the generally high rates, the provinces have established different methods of calculation of
the royalties. This has had the deleterious effect of making the provinces compete against
each other not on the basis of the true economic potential of the deposit but rather on the
basis of imposed fiscal measures. Moreover, in neighboring countries with which Argentina
must compete for investment (Chile for example), royalties on mining production are either
non-existent or set at effective rates far below Argentina provincial levels.

(f) Lack of adequate physical infrastructure, particularly with regard to present
and potential future mining areas located in remote mountainous regions. Major industrial
centers and ports are also far removed from these mining areas, making transport of maIiy
bulk products extremely expensive even if adequate transport infrastructure exists. In
previous years, it was not possible to export mineral products (for instance in the case of the
El Pachon copper deposit) through Chile, even though the distance to Pacific ports is much
less than the distance to Argentina's Atlantic ports!'. Energy costs are very high and the
An agreement between Chile and Argentina regarding this matter is under negotiation, and would allow
Argentina's mining products to be exported through Chile.



- 25 -                            ANNEX 1
provision of adequate water in the arid mountainous and plateau regions has also been a
serious limitation.
(g) Lack of adequate environmental and safety legislation and controls. As in
many other countries, environmental issues are relatively new to Argentina. In the past,
there have been no national or provincial environmental policies or legislation. The existing
federal mining code provides for few provisions in the critical areas of mining pollution
control, health and safety measures. In the absence of federal and provincial regulations,
some of the existing foreign-owned mining operations have taken it upon themselves to
attempt to comply with "intemational best practices". Nonetheless, awareness of
environmental issues in some operations and monitoring the compliance with appropriate
standards by the authorities has been lacking (for a more detailed explanation of
environmental issues, constraints and proposals, see Annex 3).
E. Mineral Potential
6.    Argentina is considered to have good geological conditions for the discovery of both
metallic and industrial mineral deposits. The country has a surface area of 2.7 million
square kilometers, of which about 25 percent has exposed potentially ore-bearing rock
formations or structures. This mining potential area is roughly similar to those of Chile,
Peru or Bolivia. The deficiencies of the geological data base and the paucity of continued
and high-quality exploration activities in the past means that the true mineral potential of
Argentina is still largely unknown. The great number of prospects and mineral indices
principally within, but even outside the Andean mountain chain augurs well for the future of
the mining industry in the country.
7.    From the point of view of structural development, Argentina lies to the south of the
craton-dominated shield terrains of Brazil (typified by massive iron-manganese deposits,
greenstone gold and diamondiferous kimberlites) and to the east of the axis of the main
Peruvian-Chilean pluton dominated porphyry copper belt, the world's premier copper
province containing about 40 percent of known global resources. Because of the lateral
zoning of mineral belts and different paleoclimatic conditions across the Andes, it is unlikely
that Argentina could host world-class giant copper reserves similar to Chuquicamata and
Escondida. But there are good possibilities to discover and exploit large copper deposits
similar in type to Andina, Disputada, Pelambres or El Teniente. The north-western part of
Argentina, from Mendoza to the border with Bolivia, shows the most favorable and
diversified mineral potential of the country. Apart from the eastern-most border of the
porphyry copper zone, this area includes the southern extension of the Bolivian polymetallic
(lead-zinc-silver), gold-antimony and tin belts. An important part of this area is covered by a
Cenozoic and Recent acid volcanic province now known in Chile, Bolivia and Peru to host
major precious metals epithermal mineralizations similar to El Indio or La Coipa. It also
includes the high inter-montane evaporite basins of the Puna which contain boron, lithium,
potassium and other salts. The southern Andes of Argentina cover a narrow area along the
border with Chile, thus representing a more restricted area of prospective interest. This area
is however characterized by geological environments favorable to the discovery of porphyry
copper, polymetallic and epithermal precious metals deposits.



- 26 -                            ANNEX 1
8.    More recently, the potential of non-traditional mining areas outside the Andes was
also demonstrated, such as the Deseado and Somuncura Mesozoic volcanic areas with
vein-type precious metals deposits in Santa Cruz and Chubut, respectively; and the Sierras
Pampeanas in San Luis, Cordoba and La Rioja (gold). Documented opportunities exist for
the development of several other commodities, including uranium, coal, semi-precious stones
and, particularly, a wide range of industrial minerals and rocks, including a variety of
ornamental rocks (e.g. marbles and granites) and construction materials.
F. Mining Sector Reform
9.    In July 1989, the Government initiated a reform of macro-economic policies, which
involved the stabilization and deregulation of the economy and the privatization of public
enterprises. In order to reduce the fiscal deficit, the Government took measures to increase
revenues and to divest and/or close loss-making federal public enterprises. The
divestiture/liquidation program included the sale of public enterprises related to mining, such
as the steel companies (SOMISA and Altos Hornos Zapla), the iron ore mine (HIPASAM), a
coal mine (YCF) and Fabricaciones Militares (FM) which held several mining concessions.
The divestiture of federal mining assets is now virtually complete.
10.   As part of the overall reform of economic policies, the government commissioned
several studies of the mining sector, and the Bank prepared in 1993 a mining sector
review.Y These reports called attention to the deficiencies in the sector but also to the
significant geological potential in the country and the possibilities that a vibrant mining
industry could contribute substantially to the economy. Cognizant of the deficiencies and
aware of the potential, the government has moved resolutely to reform the sector. This
reform movement continues and will be supported and strengthened by the proposed project
loan. The important steps already taken include:
11.   Reform of mining fiscal legislation. Mining Investment Law No. 24.196 of 1993
removes several impediments to private sector investment. An analysis of this law, and its
impact on potential government tax receipts, is detailed in Annex 4. In general, this
legislation conforms to international best practices and can do much to stimulate new
investment.
12.   Revitalization of regional geological cartography and research. The Mining
Reorganization Law No. 24.224 of 1993 establishes as a national priority the compilation of
geological information and maps at appropriate scales. Thus, a national program of
geological mapping has been re-initiated and ten maps at a scale of 1:250,000 are being
readied for publication. The Law establishes a "Geological Charts Committee" to advise the
government on geological mapping and data gathering programs. Furthermore, geology data
that has been previously widely dispersed among various government departments is to be
centralized in the Federal Mining Secretariat and companies and provincial governments have

been invited to supply any information of relevance that they may hold. The Law further
establishes new rates for mining permits, title issuance fees, and surface rentals.

13.   Restructuring of federal and provincial institutional relationships. A Federal
Mining Agreement (Law No. 24.228) was signed by the federal government and the
provinces in July 1993. It establishes several key principles to remedy previous deficiencies,
among them: (i) recognition of the primacy of the provinces in application of the minerals
legislation; (ii) support for the divestiture of previous provincial reserve areas; (iii) removal
of preferential treatment of provincial mining companies; (iv) strengthening of the federal
secretariat of mining; (v) elimination of provincial and municipal taxes; (vi) upgrading of the
mining cadastre systems in the provinces; (vii) harmonization among the provinces and
federal government of mining procedures and regulations; (viii) removal of distortions in the
pricing of key inputs such as energy and transportation; (ix) the need to establish
environmental regulations and their effective implementation; (x) establishment of a unified



- 28 -                            ANNEX 1
information system and the centralization of minerals data; and (xi) greater vigilance in the
monitoring of compliance with payment and work obligations on the part of the mining title
holder.
14.   Restructuring of the federal mining institutions. The Sub-Secretariat of Mining
was upgraded to a Secretariat of Mining (SM) and restructured in 1992, reflecting the
recognition by the Government of Argentina of the potential significance of the sector for the
national economy, as well as the need for competent and focused policy leadership and sound
institutional structure. It reports to the Ministry of Economy. The organization (Figure
Al. 1) consists of the previously existing National Directorate of Mining (DNM) and a new
National Geological Survey Directorate (DNSG). A third unit, at the National directorate
level, is responsible for the coordination of the five SM regional offices. The DNM has
three directorates: Investment, Evaluation and Development. The new DNSG also has three
directorates: Regional Geology, Mineral Resources and Applied and Environmental Geology.
More recently, an environmental unit of an advisory nature and reporting directly to the
Secretary of Mines has been established.
15.   As in most other countries, the SM is responsible for the establishment of national
sector policy and the federal legal and institutional framework. SM coordinates the policy
with the provinces through the Federal Mining Council, established in 1992. The DNM is
responsible for the administration of the Mining Investment law and for promotion and
information activities (including statistics and markets). It participates actively in the
modernization of the legal framework. Unlike all other Latin American (except Venezuela)
and the vast majority of other countries, the Geological Survey (DNSG) is integrated within
the SM and has no administrative autonomy (thus implying a lack of flexibility to carry out
its activities). Nevertheless, its functions do correspond to those of a modern Geological
Service, and include regional mapping and mineral resources assessment as well as applied
and environmental geology. All exploration and mining development activities are left to the
private sector.
16.   Much effort has also been expended to improve the efficiency and coordination of
federal technological institutes. Most of the activities within this field have been
concentrated within three autonomous entities now reporting to the SM: INTEMIN (chemical
laboratory, mining and metallurgical technology and services), CRAS (hydrology) and
INPRES (seismology).
17.   Restructuring of the provincial mining institutions. The sectoral institutional
arrangements vary from one province to another. However, the structure of a typical
Provincial Secretariat of Mines would consist of (i) a Provincial Mining Directorate (DPM),
including a legal unit for sector administration and a technical unit to provide geological and
technical support, and assistance to miners; and (ii) a Provincial Mining Corporation, in most
mining provinces (see Table A1.4), for managing mineral reserves. Such structures need to
be modernized, in order to fit with the new sectoral policy and distribution of responsibilities
which has been acknowledged by the Provinces in the Federal Agreement, and also to better
use generally scarce resources (with the exception of Mendoza and Neuquen where the
DPMs benefit from oil revenues). While most of the technical functions would now



- 29 -                            ANNEX 1
correspond to federal entities (Geological mapping) or directly to the private sector
(exploration and mining), emphasis will be given to the development of sector administration,
which represents the principal provincial function, including the licensing of mineral rights
through the establishment of a modern mining cadastre. Strengthening of the monitoring and
legal enforcement functions regarding health and safety, as well as compliance with
environmental regulations, is also needed.
G. New Investment in Exploration and Mine Development
18.   The new mineral policies and laws are beginning to have a positive impact on
investment in exploration and mining development. Because of these as well as the current
boom in mining investment in South America, Argentina has attracted the interest of a
number of large and small mining companies (see Table A1.5). These investors are
currently spending an estimated US$40 - 50 million in exploration annually, and a number of
potential projects have reached the advanced planning stage. The risks involved with mineral
exploration are very large: it has been estimated that only 1 in 1000 ore mineral showings
found during grass-roots exploration (prospecting) activities results in an operating economic
mine; the odds improve somewhat to 1 in 2 after orebody delineation, and to 2 in 3 after the
feasibility study. Of the projects that enter production, only 1 in 5 achieve the full financial
returns foreseen in the feasibility study. The number of companies present and the amount
being spent can be taken as a sign of confidence in the mineral potential of Argentina.
Furthermore, the resources spent on exploration would be consistent with the level of
expenditures necessary in other countries to find and define mineral orebodies, and if
sustained, will probably reveal new orebodies.
19.  In addition to the exploration effort, several projects are currently in an advanced
planning stage,3' among them:
Cerro Vanguardia. This large gold deposit is located in the province of Santa Cruz.
The mining titles are held by Fomicruz, the government-owned provincial mining
company. Fomicruz has an agreement with a joint venture composed of Anglo
American (South America) and Perez-Companc & Co. for the development of the
Cerro Vanguardia deposits. According to Anglo American sources, the deposit will
be developed first as an open pit, and later extended underground. Production of gold
and silver should be around 250,000 ounces (8 metric tons) and 2,500,000 ounces per
year, respectively, making Cerro Vanguardia one of the largest gold mines in South
America. Projected sales from the operation are around US$112 million per year and
the operations would employ around 200 persons. The initial capital investment is
US$200 million. Anglo American is presently completing advanced exploration, mine
planning, and engineering studies; production is scheduled to begin in 1998.
Bajo de la Alumbrera. The Bajo de la Alumbrera copper gold deposit is located in
Catamarca province. This deposit had been previously explored through funding of
3/    Figures are all best available estimates.



- 30 -                           ANNEX 1
the central government and international organizations. The mining title belongs to
the mining company Yacimiento Minero Aguas de Dionisio (YMAD), owned by
Catamarca province and the University of Tucuman. YMAD subsequently entered
into a joint venture with International Musto (IMZ), a Canadian mining company.
IMZ has spent US$10 million conducting further exploration work and a feasibility
study. In January 1994, IMZ signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement with the
Australian company Mount Isa Mines (MIM), and take over bids for Musto's shares
have been made since. The deposit is large and amenable to open pit mining
techniques. The in-situ grades are 0.53 percent for copper and 0.68 grams/ton for
gold. As of April 1995, estimated scheduled production rates, were of 170,000 tons
of copper and 640,000 ounces of gold over a 19-year mine life. The project is now
organizing financing for the estimated US$750 million capital investment, and the
promoters indicate that production could start in 1997. However, several issues
concerning infrastructure and environmental protection remain to be solved and if the
project goes forward this start-up date could well be delayed.
Potasio Rio Colorado. Located in Neuquen province, the potash deposit at Rio
Colorado is being studied by a local company, Minera Tea. The deposit is 1,100
meters underground and is comparable in quantity and quality to Canadian potash
deposits. A feasibility study has been performed which indicates that the mineral can
be extracted using solution mining, whereby hot water is injected into the mineralized
beds and pumped to the surface where it is evaporated by solar means. Minera Tea
reports that it has invested almost US$20 million on studies and has a small pilot plant
in operation. Minera Tea is negotiating with a foreign partner to establish a joint
venture for the development of the deposits. Potash is used primarily as an ingredient
in fertilizer. Brazil would be the primary export market, and it is estimated that
production would carry a market value of about US$100 million per year.
Salar del Hombre Muerto. The Salar del Hombre Muerto is a deposit of evaporite
lithium/potassium enriched brines located in Catamarca and Salta provinces. FMC
Lithium International Corporation (USA) will bring the salar into operation over the
next few years. The product will be exported at a market value of US$70 million per
year. The capital investment required to develop the operations is estimated at
US$100 million.
El Pachon. Located in San Juan province, the El Pachon copper-molybdenum
deposit has been adjudicated to a consortium headed by Minera Aguilar, a subsidiary
of COMSUR (Bolivia, which is partly owned by Rio Tinto Zinc-UK) and Cambior
Gold (Canada). This deposit has been thoroughly explored originally by Minera
Aguilar when this company was owned by St. Joe Minerals. Feasibility studies with
various options as to production and transportation methods have been carried out.
The deposit is estimated to have 800 million tons of reserves grading 0.6 percent
copper and 0.016 percent molybdenum, and can be mined by open pit methods.
However, the lack of infrastructure and the constraint that the product had to be
exported via Argentina's Atlantic ports and not through Chile which is much shorter,
made transportation costs prohibitive. The latest feasibility study on this deposit



- 31-                                ANNEX 1
estimated a capital expenditure of well over US$1 billion, much of it in required
infrastructure. The chances of mining this deposit profitably should increase now that
the governments of Argentina and Chile are entering into an agreement which would
permit Argentine minerals to be exported through Chilean ports.
20.   The Argentine provinces have many other deposits which have been explored to some
extent. Recently, over 150 prospects were presented at an international investors conference
in Buenos Aires, including metals, non-metals, and construction materials projects. Annex 5
provides an assessment of the economic impact under three scenarios of the development of
these and other mining projects.

ANNEX 2
ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION, ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
I. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.    Project Objectives. The main objective of the project is to help encourage the
expansion of private investment in mining activities in an environmentally sound way in
Argentina. To this effect, it will develop and support policy, regulatory and institutional
reforms, help establish a unified mining cadastre, strengthen the provision of sector
information and geo-scientific data, and establish a mechanism to address environmental
matters and issues in sector activities. The project has three substantive components:
technical assistance for mining sector policy development (policy framework development),
policy implementation (institutional strengthening, unified cadastre and environmental
management), and the development of the sector's support services (technical support
infrastructure). All these areas will deal with action programs and discrete tasks at the
federal and/or provincial levels, depending on the specific issues. A fourth component is the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), which will manage project implementation at the SM. The
project will be implemented over five years, and all programs included in the first component
are expected to be completed in the first two years. Attachments A and B to this Annex
show the proposed scheduling of components, programs and tasks included in the project,
and their estimated costs are shown in Attachment C. In addition, Annex 7 shows a matrix
of key activities and their timed target indicators. General terms of reference for the project
were formulated during preparation, detailing first year program tasks. They were reviewed
during appraisal, and agreed with SM. All such TORs are kept in Project Files.
2.    The project will finance technical assistance, studies, equipment and vehicles, discrete
works, training and related incremental costs to:
(a)   further develop the sector's policy framework by: (i) continuing and
completing the revision and reform of its legal and regulatory framework at
the national and provincial levels, and establishing appropriate provisions for
environmental management in the sector; and (ii) studying the existing market
for official research and technology transfer facilities in order to adapt the
services provided by such facilities to the new role of the State;
(b)   support and develop sector institutions at the national and provincial levels
by: (i) continuing the institutional adjustment to adapt sector agencies to the
state's role as a facilitator of private activities in the sector; (ii) implementing
a training program to enable staff in different capacities at SM, provincial
administrations and SINATEM (the national mining technology system), to
address their evolving responsibilities and to exchange views regarding sector



- 35 -                            ANNEX 2
policy and issues with private parties (especially trade associations and the
affected communities); and (iii) assisting in the progressive and realistic
divestiture of provincial mining companies.
(c)   help provide a strong geological infrastructure by: (i) carrying out
geological and thematic mapping, supported by geophysical and geochemical
activities and (ii) establishing a geological repository;
(d)   establish a unified mining cadastre for the country, which will start being
developed in the six provinces participating in the project;
(e)   set up environmental monitoring and control activities by helping develop
and establish the mechanisms: (i) at the provincial level, to obtain and update
environmental baseline data; to formulate, adapt, disseminate, supervise and
enforce environmental regulations, norms and standards, and to ensure the
participation--in the processing of proposed mining operations--of parties
potentially affected by such operations; and (ii) at the federal level to provide
assistance to provinces regarding discrete environmental issues; and
(f)   help determine the role of official support to scientific and technology
development in the sector, particularly regarding small- and medium-sized
industries involved in mining, and develop the Unified Data Base and Mining
Information programs to facilitate and promote the growth of private activities
in the sector.
3.    Institutional Framework. The Secretariat of Mining (SM) at the Ministry of
Economy, Public Works and Services formulates mining policy, in line with the country's
overall economic policy, and is in charge of developing, maintaining and making publicly
available the sector's information and data base, including sector statistics, geo-scientific data
and marketing information. It provides forums for representatives of both the private sector
and provincial authorities to communicate their concerns to the federal government in a
formal, periodic fashion, through the Mining Advisory Council (Consejo Asesor de
Empresarios) which brings together members of trade associations and industry groups, and
the Federal Mining Council (COFEMIN) which groups provincial mining authorities
representing their respective Governors. Both groups meet at least once a month, the first in
Buenos Aires, the second in a province. Provinces own the mineral resources and are
mandated to administer mining rights. They grant and cancel exploration permits ("cateos")
and mining concessions, manage mining cadastres, collect mining statistics and monitor
sector activities. However, many have often subsidized the sector, with funds from mining
permits and royalties, and have established provincial mining entities that have discouraged
private activities. In addition, most provincial governments have assumed a technical
assistance role regarding small-scale and medium-sized mining activities. Issues associated
with these arrangements have only recently begun to be discussed, and will be gradually
addressed in a systematic, serious way through the project.

4.    The institutional structure of SM is evolving to provide an appropriate functional
setting for SM's new, proactive role as a facilitator of private mining in Argentina. The
front office of the Secretary formulates and establishes sector policy, and the
Undersecretariat is charged with implementation of such policy through two line agencies,
the National Directorate of Mining (DNM) and the National Geological Service Directorate
(DNSG), which is to become administratively separate in the future. The former:
(i) gathers, organizes and provides summarized sector statistics; (ii) monitors, evaluates and
manages the effects of the new fiscal regime applicable to mining; and (iii) centralizes
cadastral data originating in the provinces and promotes private mining. The project will re-
group and enhance some of these activities--statistics and promotional--and strengthen the
cadastral capability so it can provide technical assistance to provinces requesting it
(Attachment E). It will also establish a task force to develop a unified mining data bank
(BUD) which will be accessible to the public. In 1993 DNSG was created within SM re-
establishing the geological data gathering and mapping functions that had been practically
eliminated a decade before. The project strengthens the capability of DNSG to produce
geological infrastructure (field work and mapping) redirecting SM's existing field offices
(called "Delegations") to provide the necessary logistical support, and helps establish a
geological repository within DNSG. Modern organizational structures grant an autonomous
status to entities charged with such functions in other countries. Yet, there is a pressing need
to continue geological work with as little disruption as possible, and hence it is expected--but
not required--that the Argentine geological service will become autonomous in the future,
within the life of the project, once its long-term work program and discrete routines are well
established. It will become at least administratively separate from SM three years after Loan
effectiveness. In addition, a Task Force has been established, directly dependent upon the
Undersecretary, to deal with environmental matters at the federal level (Annex 2,
Attachment E).
5.    Three semi-autonomous research institutes have a sectoral dependency from SM.
They are: (i) INTEMIN, the National Mining Technology Institute, recently formed by
joining four mining-related research centers--CIPROMIN, CIDEMAT, CIGA and CIIM--
which were previously part of the National Industrial Technology Institute; (ii) CRAS, the
Regional Groundwater Center; and (iii) INPRES, the National Institute for Seismic
Prevention.
6.    The SM has created two consultative bodies to discuss regularly with the sector's
interested parties and administrators the evolution of sector policies and its legal and
institutional framework and specific instruments. These entities meet monthly with the
Secretary of SM. The Federal Mining Council (COFEMIN) brings together the provincial
sector authorities, and the Mining Advisory Council (CAE) groups representatives of the
private sector, mainly national mining sub-sectoral trade associations.
7.    Provincial organizational arrangements vary, as do their specific mandates. The most
common pattern is a Secretariat or/and a Provincial Directorate of Mining (DPM), which is
usually a line agency of a provincial ministry of economy or of production. Depending on
the provincial regime, there is also a mining registry which may be attached to the DPM or
to the provincial judicial system. While the key provincial functions should be the mining



- 37 -                             ANNEX 2
cadastre--to properly register and ensure the legal status of mining rights--monitoring sector
activities, and supervising environmental management by operators, most of the DPM's
existing mandates were directed in the past to extension efforts. The project will enhance the
former and discourage the latter (while carefully determining the appropriate timing of such
actions).
8.    Provinces still maintain (although some only on paper) mining corporations that have
carried out very limited exploration, and were originally established to exploit mineral
resources. While most of them would have disappeared in time, their relatively recent
inheritance of mining rights previously held by Fabricaciones Militares (the productive
branch of the Armed Forces which has been largely privatized) rekindled their business
instincts, and many are now actively seeking partners among private mining concerns, or the
outright sale of such assets. Such divestiture will be assisted by the project.
II. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS
A. Policy Development Component
A.1. Legal Framework Development Subcomponent
Duration:    2 years
Cost:        US$570,000
9.    As part of its overall liberalized economic framework, the Federal Government is
pursuing policy reforms in the mining sector, and is vigorously encouraging a similar stance
in the provinces, which are responsible for the administration of mining rights in Argentina.
The project supports the country's new mining policy, now adopted by most provinces,
which establishes that the role of government is to provide a transparent, non-discretionary,
secure administration of mining rights. However, Argentina's Mining Code is an antiquated
instrument dating back to the last century, and it does not appropriately support modern
mining. Efforts to replace it have met in the past with strong resistance, and the present
administration opted for a gradualist strategy that has achieved important changes. Yet,
while three federal laws enacted in 1993 have begun to provide a better business environment
for modern mining, much more needs to be done, at both the national and the provincial
levels.
10.   The analysis already carried out shows that the body of legislation applicable to the
mining industry in Argentina is excessive and lacks uniformity, has duplications and is not
complied with or enforced in an effective, systematic way. The most deficient law at the
national level is the CM, most of which is obsolete and difficult to enforce. Serious
deficiencies associated with the Code are, among others, the: lack of definitions and potential
for administrative discretionality; classification of mines; obligations required of miners;
principles for obtaining mining rights; limitations on the size of private mining claims; and
the possibility it provides for provinces to maintain large reserves, which in effect removes
potentially important mining areas from the market. Also, the number of provincial
standards applicable to mining is excessive, and the codes for provincial mining procedures



- 38 -                             ANNEX 2
are often complicated. Hence one of the priority objectives of Argentina's official policy for
the sector is to modernize its legal and regulatory framework, including the reform of the
CM at the national level and the revision or establishment of associated legal and regulatory
provisions at the provincial level. Given past difficulties, it is understood that this is a task
that requires the build-up of sufficient consensus to ensure its legislative approval. The
present Administration has presented to Congress for its approval two additional amendments
to the Code--one dealing with environmental aspects, the other with urgent modernization
measures. In addition, a formal Agreement between the federal and provincial
administrations will facilitate the establishment and development of a unified mining cadastre
in the country.
11.   This subcomponent will provide resources to: (i) revise and modernize mining
legislation and regulations at both levels: federal (CM and mining related regulations) and
provincial (Mining Procedures Codes; environmental norms applicable to mining); (ii)
prepare uniform application forms for exploration permits, all procedural steps and
concessions; and forms related to the administration of mining rights such as reports,
notifications, and public notices; and (iii) draft a training manual for provincial officials,
dealing with the new mining legislation and procedures. Environmental norms applicable to
mining will be developed in collaboration with the Environmental Management
Subcomponent, as such work is also the practical training grounds for provincial staff that
will enforce the norms. It is estimated that about eight foreign and 48 national specialist-
months will be required together with resources to cover the corresponding operational
expenses.
A.2. SINATEM Studies Subcomponent
Duration:    2 years
Cost:        US$840,000
12.   The existing technological levels and capabilities in mining activities are an important
concern of both federal and provincial authorities, particularly among medium and small size
firms. While large scale, modern mining will bring with it new technologies and obtain the
qualifications needed either in the Argentine or other labor markets, most mining concerns
that have traditionally operated in the country will have to adjust their management,
operating and marketing technologies to adapt to the evolving economic paradigm, which
requires them to be competitive and shed prior patterns. Technological capacity is an
important factor in this adaptation, and INTEMIN has been established to provide assistance
in the reconversion that existing mining concerns must undertake. Besides INTEMIN, there
are research and development centers in the country (Universities, foundations, and
provincial agencies) that may become useful instruments for this reconversion. For this
reason a coordinating mechanism, the National Assistance System in Mining Technologies
(SINATEM) has been established, to help focus existing institutional resources towards the
present needs of mining activities.
13.   The subcomponent will finance three studies to determine the market for the existing
research and development services in Argentina (supply and demand studies), analyze the



-39 -                              ANNEX 2
present and potential roles of small and medium mining (PYMES) in Argentina and identify
the respective issues. The studies would also provide policy recommendations regarding
such issues, and action proposals towards their solution (Project items B1(b.iv), SINATEM
Training Program, and C.2, Research and Technology Development Subcomponent would
later implement such proposals). The project will finance about 30 foreign and 63 local
specialist-months of consultancies, technical and administrative support and incremental
operational costs.
B. Policy Implementation Component
B.1.  Institutional Capacity Development Subcomponent
Duration:    5 years
Cost:        US$5,536,000
B.1.a.       Institutional Framework Development Program
14.   The broad sectoral institutional framework has been reformed during the last two
years, as part of the policy to reduce the role of the State, and to adapt sector agencies to
better-defined functions, eliminating most of their past widespread overlapping. Further
detailed adjustments remain to be implemented at the federal level and, more particularly,
within the Provinces where the reform process has in general been more limited and uneven.
During project preparation, a careful and detailed institutional capacity analysis and
development work (ICADS) was carried out with representatives of federal and provincial
agencies involved in the project. The respective roles of such agencies and of the private
sector have been clearly defined and the institutional capacity gaps identified. These results
must now be translated into rationalized institutional structures. Overall, this
subcomponent's tasks will be coordinated by the Undersecretariat of Mines with the help of
the PCU. Two sub-programs are included:
B.1.a.i.     Institutional Modernization and Strengthening Sub-Program
Duration:    9 months
Cost:        US$1,239,000
15.   This sub-program aims at defining an institutional model for the sector at the federal
and provincial levels, which will be implemented gradually during the project, starting in
year 2. The model would be defined through a participative process (workshops and
seminars), with the support of international and national short-term consultants. The work
will focus first on (i) the distribution of functions and responsibilities within the framework
of the new mining policy as defined in the sector's 1993 "Federal Agreement" and according
to the results of the ICADS exercise; (ii) the mission statement and organizational status of
the Geological Survey entity; (iii) the objectives, functions, responsibilities, strategies and
working plans of the provincial agencies; and (iv) the progressive and realistic divestiture of
provincial state-controlled mining companies. Second, work will include the design of the
resulting institutional model as well as a detailed inventory of its infrastructural needs



- 40 -                            ANNEX 2
(facilities and equipment) to be funded under the Institutional Infrastructure Sub-Program.
Provisions include the financing of: 17 specialist-months of international and 101 specialist-
months of local consultants; (ii) workshops and seminars; and (iii) some incremental
operational costs. These activities would be closely coordinated with the National System of
Public Administration (SINAPA).
B.1.a.ii.    Institutional Infrastructure Sub-Program
Duration:    4 years
Cost:       US$2,985,000
16.   Based on results of sub-program Bl(a.i) above, funds would be provided to upgrade
facilities at the National Secretariat and Undersecretariat of Mines (SM and SSM), the
Mining and the Geological Survey National Directorates (DNM and DNSG), three or four
regional offices (SM Delegations), and the Provincial Mining Directorates (DPMs) of
participating provinces. This sub-program will provide funds for office rehabilitation,
purchase of basic core office equipment (including administrative hardware and software not
included in the BUD subcomponent), vehicles, purchase of legal and technical literature, and
the publication of information on legal and administrative procedures. A modest amount will
also fund expected incremental operational costs. Its cost was estimated from the ICADS
activities.
B.1.b.      Training Program
Duration:    5 years
Cost:       US$1,312,000
17.   This Program is composed of four sub-programs. The two first are aimed at
enhancing the management and technological skills in the federal and provincial
administrations, respectively. A third will develop the fiscal skills required in order to
properly apply the mining taxation regime, and the fourth will help retrain staff in existing
mining research institutions. More specific, technically oriented training (some parts of it
on-the job, others of an academic nature) is also included in several subcomponents (Mining
Cadastre, Environmental Mechanisms, Geological Infrastructure and Information
Infrastructure), covering both the federal and provincial administration levels.
B.1.b.i.    Federal Level Institutional Management and Technological
Updating Training Sub-Program
Duration:    5 years
Cost:       US$225,000
18.   This sub-program will provide systematic, long-term training within sector agencies
regarding in particular management and technological updating of staff and management, in
order to continuously strengthen their institutional capacity and enhance their human resource
capabilities. Various training needs were identified during the ICADS work, related to



- 41 -                             ANNEX 2
existing institutional capacity gaps--such as project planning, budgeting and monitoring;
human resources policy and management; information systems; and systematic technological
updating. The sub-program will be coordinated by the PCU, and provide one specialist-
month of international consultancy to verify the present and future training needs at the
federal level and design a corresponding long-term training proposal.
B. 1 .b.ii.    Provincial Level Institutional Management and Technological
Upgrading Training Sub-Program
Duration:    5 years
Cost:        US$225,000
19.   This sub-program is aimed at the provincial administration level and will be
implemented on a multi-provincial basis if appropriate. As in the preceding sub-program,
the potential training areas were identified during the ICADS exercise. The PCU will
manage implementation of this sub-program in coordination with COMIDI (a committee that
includes the provincial project coordinators). The proje^t will fund one specialist-month of
international consultancy to identify in detail the present and future needs of the provincial
sectoral institutions and design a long-term training proposal. Project funding would be
available to implement such a proposal.
B.1.b.iii.    Fiscal Training Sub-Program
Duration:    Five years
Cost:        US$462,000
20.   The new mining investment law 24,196 (May 1993) establishes a favorable taxation
regime for mining. However, Argentina lacks a mining tradition and has few of the seasoned
professionals in mining taxation, accounting and finance that are needed to adequately apply
the new law. This situation is worse in the provinces, which have been traditionally isolated
from the main financial and fiscal activities in Buenos Aires. This component would
improve capacity in taxation, mining accounting, and finance at the national and provincial
levels to effectively administer the new legislation and tax regime. Specific mining taxation,
accounting and finance training activities to be funded include conducting: (i) three major
seminars during the project, dealing with basic principles and international best practices;
(ii) one refresher course yearly in Buenos Aires or some provincial location; (iii) visits to
the provinces periodically by teams of counsellors and instructors to reinforce training and
assist in implementation; (iv) courses abroad; (v) selected audits of mining company financial
statements; and (vi) advisory assistance to national and provincial mining administrations on
a retainer, case by case basis.
21.   The sub-program will increase the understanding of officials regarding calculations of
various taxes, royalties and fees. Particular attention will be paid to international practices
regarding deductible expenses, amortization of assets, categorization of expenditures, and
deferment of expenditures. Through instruction in the spreadsheet analysis of various fiscal
parameters, officials will learn to determine the effects of various fiscal measures on the



- 42 -                              ANNEX 2
mining enterprise's viability. The training will focus on teaching international standards of
mining accounting including, among others, valuation of inventories, recording of sales and
expenses, depreciation and depletion allowances, financial charges, determination of income,
expensing or amortization of capital expenditures, and capital budgeting. Training will also
be provided in mine finance, traditional sources of project funding, flow-through shares,
operation of capital markets specializing in mining equities, use of risk and hedging funds,
equity and debt issues of mining companies, new financial instruments for project finance,
investment risk analysis, financial and ratio analysis, projections of cash flow and other
topics. It will also deal with the international best practices and standards of financial
disclosure and reporting, including how to analyze income statements, balance sheets, and
flow of funds statements. Instruction will also be provided concerning standards and
methods of industry regulation and supervision.
22.   The sub-program will be implemented by the PCU. Staff from the national and
provincial mining administrations and their counterparts in the Secretariat of Finance and
related government agencies would benefit from this training. It will be necessary to recruit
international experts with practical business experience in various taxation, accounting and
financial aspects, to ensure adequate awareness and knowledge of practices in mining
countries with which Argentina must compete to attract mining investment. It is likely that,
at least during the sub-program's initial phases, a large internationally recognized accounting
firm may have to be contracted to find the experts with the requisite skills and experience.
The objective of these experts will be to design the training program and to "train the
trainers" rather than spend extensive amounts of time in Argentina. The sub-program will
finance 5 foreign and 20 local specialist-months of consultancies, three seminars and four
refresher courses, and ten international courses.
B.l.b.iv.    SINATEM  Training Sub-Program
Duration:    3 years
Cost:        US$400,000
23.   During the two initial years of implementation programs dedicated to SINATEM (see
project subcomponent A.2 above), a retraining program would be designed to assist the staff
of the agencies involved in the SINATEM framework (i) to adjust their roles according to the
defined institutional policy and its new objectives and functions; (ii) to participate, when
relevant, in the implementation of the project programs (e.g. Information infrastructure).
Study trips abroad would be part of this retraining program, in order to benefit from the
experience of foreign entities with similar functions of technological support to the mining
industry. In addition, study trips for technical training in laboratory skills and quality
standards programs would also be included.

B.2. Cadastre and Registry System Subcomponent
Duration:    3 years
Cost:        US$7,223,000
24.   A priority objective of the Government's mining sector policy is to establish a
well-informed, uniform and interactive cadastral system. The project will finance the
transformation of the physical registries of participating provinces into proper mining
cadastres. The cadastre will provide reliable information about the precise location of mining
rights in the territory, expressed in Gauss-Kruger coordinates--which is obligatory in
Argentina and can be translated and expressed in any other coordinate system--and also about
the legal status of mining rights. The procedures required in order to apply the cadastre
process will be transparent, public, of general application and non-discriminatory. In
addition, the cadastre will cover both the mining rights requested and granted after it
becomes effective, and already existing ones as well as the ones that have been simply
requested. Hence the cadastral procedure will have stages, instances and resources to allow
owners of older mining rights to adequately defend their rights. Older mining rights that are
not inserted into the new cadastre must be legally cancelled in order for the information
resulting from the cadastre to be correct and useful in practice. Both elements--cadastre
coverage and the defense of older mining rights--affect the length of time necessary and the
budgetary resources needed to implement the cadastre.
25.   The cadastre would continue to be related to the terrain's topographical features, and
hence it will be necessary to improve some geodesic networks and cartography, both of
which have serious deficiencies in Argentina. This also affects the length of time and budget
needed to implement the cadastre, and implies that participating provinces must: train their
present staff and hire twelve additional staff during eight months; purchase computer and
topo-geodesic equipment--which for a typical province includes: three 486 computers, one for
digitalization, plotter and database, one for the registry and the third for the counter
(providing access to the public); one double screen Pentium; one portable 486 (field work),
one 4GB rigid disk; one magnetic-optical (CD ROM) disc; one DAT tape; two laser printers
(for the registry and database); one A3 matrix printer (for digitalization); one eight-pencil
pen plotter; one 36" x 48" digitalizing table; three UPS units; one each of word processing,
digitalization, image processing and topographic calculation software programs; one DBase
database; one LAN; two GPS geodesic order receivers and navigator-type GPS positioners;
one complete station (1" reader); hand-held VHF transmitters; Landsat TM digital format
images and B/N hardcopies, and other equipment. Likewise, field work to locate and
measure a total of about 2,400 geodesic points and 9,000 corners in total will be contracted
out at an estimated cost of about 40 percent of the subcomponent's total, as well as the
verification of such work (also to be contracted out, to a different firm). The subcomponent
includes two specialists/months of international and 184 specialist/months of local
consultants. Finally, it will finance operating costs, vehicles and the provision and
furnishing of adequate facilities (through office rehabilitation works or additions, equipment
and furniture purchases) for the cadastre and registry functions. Annex 6 gives
implementation details for the cadastre. The time allocated to implement the cadastre



- 44 -                            ANNEX 2
subcomponent does not include that required to resolve any disputes arising from issues
associated with older mining rights.
B.3. Environmental Management Subcomponent
Duration:    5 years
Cost:       US$3,810,000
26.   The general objective of this subcomponent is to set up an environmental protection
system for mining activities in Argentina. This system should bring together the respective
mining administration agencies at the national and provincial levels as well as other public
and private environmental entities. The subcomponent will: (i) develop and implement the
environmental legislation--including norms and standards--for mining activities in the
participating provinces (in collaboration with subcomponent A. 1 above); (ii) establish and/or
strengthen the provincial capabilities to undertake environmental management functions in the
sector; and (iii) undertake baseline studies in order to establish the values of environmental
standards and parameters; and as a result of the above, develop environmental management
methods applicable to mining activities, in line with the country's federal nature, each
province's ecosystems and the potentially competitive uses of natural resources.
B.3.a.      Legal and Regulatory Program
Duration:    4 years
Cost:       US$1,905,000
27.   An effective environmental legal and regulatory framework requires a federal law and
specific regulations, as well as technical and procedural instruction manuals for each
province. Such regulations and manuals will be elaborated with the participation of the six
provinces, under the supervision of the environmental unit within the national Secretariat of
Mining, and in collaboration with all affected or potentially affected groups. The legal and
regulatory system as a whole will become the basis of reference for authorities, private
mining activities and third parties. To be implemented in close collaboration with the
Institutional Capacity Development Subcomponent (B. 1), this program will help prepare the:
(i) environmental regulations for the six provinces; (ii) instructions for the preparation of
environmental impact evaluations; (iii) instructions for the notification of authorities
regarding prospection and exploration works; (iv) organization of registries of environmental
consultants and of laboratories capable of performing environmental work; and (v) technical
manuals for environmental practices and procedures.
B.3.b.      Environmental Management Program
Duration:    5 years
Cost:       US$250,000
28.   The institutional buildup, strengthening and training provided through subcomponent
B. 1 will make possible the application of the resulting legislation and work procedures. This



- 45 -                             ANNEX 2
activity is mostly directed at the provinces, and includes the establishment and strengthening
of local capacities by, inter alia, participation in the formulation of environmental legislation,
regulations, norms and standards; the development and application of methods and routines
for issuing exploration permits and mining concessions (including requirements of
environmental assessment and management programs); and the establishment of appropriate
monitoring, supervision and control within the sector regarding such programs and the
applicable occupational health and safety provisions.
B.3.c.       Baseline Studies Program
Duration:    2 years
Cost:        US$1,645,000
29.   Baseline studies are carried out to obtain comprehensive information regarding the
existing natural and social conditions of a given area. This program will: (i) provide the
specific information and data for the formulation, establishment and adaptation of
environmental norms and standards, and to support decision-making regarding location of
infrastructure, housing and mining and processing facilities; (ii) develop multidisciplinary
research methodologies to be applied in environmental analysis; and (iii) strengthen the
research capacity and human resources in environmental issues related to mining activities.
The program will finance an environmental baseline study for each of the participating
provinces and will proceed on a schedule of priority areas determined by the location of
provincial protected areas and proposed mining operations. Work will make selective use of
existing data from available sources, through field and source compilation, revision,
supplementation, and comprehensive interpretation of such data. Such work will include,
inter alia, (i) the study and determination of water resources: watershed areas, rain statistics,
resource modelling, and water sampling and analysis (results will also be documented in a
geographical information system); (ii) evaluation of the areas' environmental vulnerability;
and (iii) determination of mining impacts regarding existing or past operations. Close
collaboration with INTEMIN, CRAS and other research organizations is expected.
30.   Mining Secretariat staff as well as from the provincial agencies, and local consultants
when necessary, will implement the environmental programs, assisted by a team of foreign
consultants. This effort has been estimated to require about 35 foreign and 590 local
specialist-months of consultancies. The programs will include the purchase of field and
office equipment--computer equipment and software and laboratory equipment--two vehicles,
satellite imagery (in coordination with other subcomponents), analysis services and
operational and training costs. Annex 3 details this subcomponent's activities.
C. Support Services Component
C.1. Geological Infrastructure Subcomponent
Duration:    5 years
Cost:        US$10,700,000



- 46 -                           ANNEX 2
31.   The availability and regular publication of basic geological and mineral resource maps
is an essential service which must be provided by governments to attract and orient private
investments to mining activities as well as to provide cross-sectoral information for
government use and for the community at large (for purposes of public works, land use
management, agriculture, and environmental protections). Because of past inadequate mining
development policies and institutional issues, this essential work has been largely neglected:
only 30 percent of the country has an initial systematic geological map coverage. The
Mining Restructuring Law of 1993 provides a strong mandate to the Geological Survey
National Directorate (DNSG) to reactivate and strengthen these basic services. Mapping
production was re-initiated and a few regional maps have already been compiled on the basis
of existing information. However, this material, with some exceptions, does not provide the
information a modern Geological Survey should produce because the available data are
partially outdated or poorly identified in the field, and/or their processing and interpretation
has not been carried out according to modern concepts or techniques. The DNSG has
already taken steps to design modem products, namely the generation of standardized
geological and mineral resources maps at scales of 1:250,000 and--at a later stage--
1:100,000. This subcomponent, to be housed in the DNSG, would include three programs:
(i) Geological Mapping; (ii) Mineral Resources and Thematic Mapping; and (iii) the National
Geological Repository. These three programs would strengthen the core mapping and
mineral sector development activities of the DNSG.
C.1.a.      Geological Mapping Program
Duration:    5 Years
Cost:       US$5,442,000
32.   The main goals of this program are to: (i) strengthen and modernize DNSG's
geological map production through the development of remote sensing data processing and a
digitalized map processing and editing capacity; (ii) support the systematic geological
mapping of previously umnapped or inadequately mapped areas, and publish professional
quality packages of data and maps; (iii) train DNSG's geologists on-the-job in dynamic and
modem field mapping and map production techniques; and (iv) provide the basic and reliable
geological information necessary to attract investments and plan sectoral and cross-sectoral
activities. The work would aim at the digitalized production of about 60 1:250,000-scale
maps and 10 1:100,000 scale maps over the Andean Cordillera area, first within the
boundaries of the six provinces directly participating to the project, covering some 550,000
km2 or about 75 percent of the prospective mineral areas of the country. The bulk of the
work will be carried out by the permanent staff of regional geologists of the DNSG, under
the guidance of international consultants and the support of specialized national consultants.
Geologists now doing mineral inventory work at the provincial mining offices will be
integrated into the DNSG teams active within the respective provinces. The subcomponent
would provide a total of 57 specialist-months of international and 240 specialist-months of
national consultants. It includes field and office equipment satellite images, data treatment
and map processing equipment (specific hardware and software), vehicles and incremental
operating costs. Specific field as well as on-the-job training is also included. The geological



- 47 -                            ANNEX 2
mapping program will be undertaken in close collaboration with the geophysics and mineral
resources mapping program.
C.1.b.      Geophysics and Mineral Resources Mapping Program
Duration:    5 Years
Cost:       US$4,329,000
33.   More information than basic geology is required to develop a specific data base for
use by the mineral industry The mineral resources thematic mapping being implemented by
the DNSG is aimed at generating and producing interpretations of different data sets, to be
published and made available in maps, and descriptive and interpretative formats. Data sets
being developed and integrated would include regional geophysics, geochemistry and
geology, structures, distribution of mineral deposits, metallogeny, infrastructure and other
topics, with key areas being subject to field checking. The results of this work provide
guidance as to metallogenic provinces and districts which are prospective for the discovery of
specific ore deposits. The specific objectives of this program are to: (i) develop the DNSG
capacity to gather, process and interpret mineral resources data sets, and produce
professional maps and reports; (ii) develop the institution's capacity to process and interpret
geophysical data; (iii) support the mineral resource assessment of regions where mining
potential is deemed to be high, but poorly defined; and (iv) support the implementation of
airborne geophysical surveys over selected areas of the regions defined under (iii) above.
The work aims at producing about 60 1:250,000 scale and about 10 1:100,000 scale
digitalized mineral resource maps over the Cordillera area, first of all within the six
provinces directly participating in the project, covering some 550,000 km2 or about 75
percent of the mineral prospective areas of the country. The bulk of the work will be carried
out by the permanent staff of mineral resource geologists of the DNSG, under the guidance
of international consultants. Geologists presently doing mineral inventories in the provincial
mining offices will be integrated to the DNSG teams active within the respective Provinces.
The subcomponent would provide about 58 specialist-months of international and about
140,000 line-km of airborne survey (magnetometry and radiometry). It also finances field
and office equipment, geophysical data treatment and processing equipment (including
specific hardware and software) and incremental operating costs. Specific field as well as
on-the-job training is also included. The geophysics and mineral resources program will be
undertaken in close collaboration with the geological mapping program, with which resources
such as satellite images, remote sensing processing and digitalization and interpretation
facilities would be shared.
C.1.c.      National Geological Repository Program
Duration:    2 years
Cost:       US$929,000
34.   Much information, such as rock samples, geochemical samples, and drill cores,
gathered during the past three decades by the Secretariat of Mines and other State



- 48 -                            ANNEX 2
organizations 1' doing geological investigation--most of which are now being privatized or
liquidated--should be retrieved and made available in an orderly manner, as it is an important
asset which should be used as a basis for future work. The two main activities to be
supported under this program would be to: (i) clearly define the materials which should be
collected, and design in detail the organization and required physical infrastructure of the
repository, including a cost-benefit evaluation; and (ii) subject to the result of (i) above,
design and establish the required facilities. The funding of this program would provide for
two specialist-months of international and 24 specialist-months of local consultants, and
funding for specialized architectural and technical consultancies, construction work,
equipment purchases, installation of the Repository and incremental operation costs. The
DNSG library would be also be enhanced through this program, through the financing of its
restructuring and the purchase of technical literature in order to update its resources and the
services it provides to the public.
C.2. Research and Technology Development Subcomponent
Duration:    3 years
Cost:       US$1,850,600
35.   Studies under A.2 above will determine how sector research and development efforts
should be redirected, and the timing of such actions. This subcomponent would support such
reorientation, undertake the corresponding functional and organizational reforms, and, if
needed, strengthen and modernize the facilities and equipment dedicated to these efforts.
While the extent of these reforms cannot be known until after the studies are completed, an
overall cost has been estimated for the subcomponent, based on preliminary results of
preparation work. It is envisaged that SINATEM members will redirect their action to: (i)
applied research and the technological support of productivity improvements in Small and
Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs); (ii) the solution of discrete issues affecting production
and marketing of SME products; and (iii) help update SMEs on environmental matters. As
estimated, the subcomponent would finance eight staff-months of foreign and 96 staff-months
of local consultancies, the cost of workshops and seminars, new equipment, minor facilities
and training of operators.
C.3. Information Infrastructure Subcomponent
C.3.a.      Unified Mining Information System (BUD) Program
Duration:    5 years
Cost:       US$2,344,000
36.   An essential tool in the development of private sector mining is the rapid and efficient
access to accurate information. At present, some information of relevance to the mining
sector is collected and published, in particular statistics on production volumes and values.
4/    Principally YPF, FM, CNEA, YCF and others.



- 49 -                             ANNEX 2
However, this information is collected by a number of different agencies at the provincial
and national levels and is not fully used as a decision-making tool. The project will improve
the quality and quantity of cadastral, environmental, geological and other sector information
which must be integrated into the system. An integrated information data bank, using
modern processing and communications technologies, will be of great value to the
government and private producers and enable the sector to grow and compete more
effectively. This component will provide funding for: (i) technical assistance: three
specialist-months of foreign and 96 specialist-months of local consultancies; (ii) procurement
of equipment (computer hardware and software), equipment maintenance and training; (iii)
minor rehabilitation works; and (iv) incremental operational costs.
37.   The objective of the BUD is to systematize the collection and interpretation of sector
information at the provincial, national and international levels, making use of state of the art
technology to gather, store and provide the information to interested parties in a timely
fashion. The BUD will consist of several layers of information, such as: (i) institutional,
legal and fiscal aspects; (ii) mining cadastre (permits and concessions); (iii) geological maps
and information; (iv) mining technology information; (v) environmental control and
monitoring information; and (vi) production and marketing statistics. The component will be
implemented by a specially designated task force of specialists located within the SM. There
will be an overall coordinator of the BUD, assisted in each province by a provincial
coordinator. The task force approach is necessary as a transition step, in order to build the
necessary skills base within the SM while at the same time ensuring independence and
objectivity in the collection and assembly of data. By the fourth year of the project it is
anticipated that sufficient skills will have been developed and data gathered to determine the
definitive institutional arrangements for the BUD.
38.   The program will be implemented in phases: the first will precisely define the
information needs and uses thereof, specify the hardware and software requirements, and
train personnel to effectively implement the system. During this first phase, bibliographies,
technical reports, projects, statistics, directories, and other relatively easily assembled data
would be produced. During the second phase, cadastre and environmental information would
be added as it is collected through other project components. The third phase will integrate
geo-information such as cartography, maps, geophysics and geochemistry data into the BUD.
The national and provincial information systems would be linked and become interactive
through cable, satellite, and radio liaison.
39.   Equipment to be procured includes inter alia: personal computers (Pentium and 486),
work stations, servers, laser printers and plotters, digitizing tables, scanners, supporting
communications devices, and various accessories. Software requirements include programs
in database management, word processing, archives and statistical management, geo-statistics
processing and others. In addition, subscriptions to various local and international electronic
databases will be funded. Because the national and provincial organizations lack the
qualified personnel necessary to design and implement the system, funding of local and
international consultants is provided. Some rehabilitation work, in particular the up-grading
of electrical supply and computer security in government offices, will be required. Finally,



- 50 -                              ANNEX 2
an allocation for training of personnel on a continuing basis is included in the five-year
program.
C.3.b.       Mining Information and Promotion Program (MINPRO)
Duration:    5 years
Cost:        US$1,267,000
40.   The BUD will collect and synthesize data. Making the data available to interested
parties and promoting investment in the sector will be a function of the Mining Information
and Promotion Unit. At present, the national and provincial secretariats publish essentially
only statistical abstracts and directories. In addition, access to international information via
subscriptions to industry trade journals, statistical databases, and on-line information services
is inadequate at the national and provincial levels. In the past two years, the SM has
prepared investment guides and directories of opportunities for specific conferences and
promotional campaigns. In addition, a few private firms publish quarterly and monthly
magazines concerning the sector. While these documents and publications are useful and
generally up to international standards, a more focused information dissemination campaign
conducted on a systematic basis would improve awareness of the country's potential to the
investment community and to the public at large.
41.   The principal objective of the dissemination of information is to make available to all
interested parties at nominal cost, in an appropriate format, and at convenient locations
selected information products about mining. An important additional function will be to
sensitize and educate the general public as to the importance and contribution of mining,
including the associated potential issues. An important benefit will be to provide the
information and data required by private sector specialist publications. The various
information products and activities envisaged in this component include, inter alia, the: (i)
preparation and publication of the annual Estadistica Minera de la Republica Argentina; (ii)
periodic preparation and dissemination of a Mining Investor's Guide; (iii) publication of
regular newsletters, directories (business, mineral, financial) and opportunities bulletins; (iv)
preparation of trade show/conference printed and visual materials; (v) participation in at least
four international industry trade shows and conferences per year for the duration of the
project; (vi) preparation of specialized marketing and other studies of sector-wide
importance; (vii) preparation of various technical manuals and studies in association with
INTEMIN (SINATEM); (viii) analysis of international minerals marketing, prices, and other
trends; and (ix) preparation of video and educational material for use in schools and other
public sensitization campaigns.
42.   The skills needed to successfully implement an information and promotion campaign
are specific and different from those required for the BUD. Hence the MINPRO unit will be
separate, but will draw extensively on information generated by the BUD as well as
INTEMIN and other government agencies. The various information products will evolve
with the progress of the project and as information is fed into the integrated information
system. Publication of some of the current products such as the statistical reports,
directories, and other material need not be delayed and will continue. Additional planning



- 51-                            ANNEX 2
studies will be undertaken with the assistance of local and international consultants, to define
exactly the types of complementary products and promotional campaigns required. During
the project various training courses will be organized at the national and provincial levels for
public and private sector officials in advertising and publication techniques, international
marketing of mineral properties, preparation of business and financial plans, mineral product
norms and standards, and export and international markets, among other topics. Finally,
MINPRO would not replace or compete with private sector groups in Argentina to
disseminate information. Rather, the function of MINPRO would be to serve as an initial
catalyst to spur the private sector into a more active role in the dissemination of mining
sector information. The project will finance about 1.5 specialist-months of foreign and two
specialist-months of local consultancies; four market studies; SM attendance at four
international sector conferences per year; training; the production of publications; and
subscriptions to sector publications.
D. Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) Component
Duration:    5 Years
Cost:       US$1,410,000
43.   The project was prepared with the support of a Coordinating Unit (PCU) which will
continue to operate throughout implementation. The PCU links with SM's line agencies as
well as the provincial agencies which participate in the project, and, during implementation,
will monitor, supervise and provide its management control, by components, subcomponents
and programs and of the project as a whole. The PCU will manage procurement--including
all contracting for works and purchases--and the hiring of consultants, the contractual
relationship with the Bank and the project's overall administration and accounting--which
includes managing the Project's Loan Account and its other funding. PCU staff have
attended Bank procurement seminars and satisfactorily implemented procurement under the
PPF. As was done during preparation, an accounting firm will be retained with PCU funds
to carry out the main accounting tasks during project implementation. The PCU will be
responsible for preparing and submitting to the Bank quarterly reports dealing with project
implementation, and for contracting under TORs acceptable to the Bank, the yearly audits of
the project including the timely submission of such audit reports to the Bank.
44.   The PCU will have a General Coordinator and an alternate, an
administrative/accounting assistant, all chosen to the Bank's satisfaction, and two secretaries.
It will also be able to hire temporary support if needed during peak periods of work.
Funding is also provided for the unit's operating costs (most PCU equipment was acquired
during project preparation).

III. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
45.   Procurement. Goods and contract works will be procured in accordance with Bank
Procurement Guidelines (January 1995). Consultants to be financed by the Loan (amounting
to about US$9.7 million or 24 percent of cost) will be selected and hired by the PCU in
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
(August 1981). The principal Terms of Reference for work included in the project were
drafted during preparation and reviewed at appraisal. Draft contracts for consultants and
consultancy services will follow the IBRD Standard Form of Contracts, as applicable.
Procurement of goods, at an estimated cost of US$8.5 million equivalent (or 21 percent of
costs) includes purchase of computer equipment and software, furniture, instruments, field
and office equipment and vehicles. They would be procured using: ICB for packages each
estimated to cost US$350,000 or more, for a total cost of about US$5.9 million, including a
two-stage bidding procedure for computer hardware and software; NCB for packages each
estimated to cost between US$100,000 and US$350,000, for an aggregate cost of about
US$1.1 million; and shopping procedures for goods and materials which need to be
purchased in packages smaller than US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.5
million. Given the need to obtain service, maintenance and spare parts promptly, all vehicles
and technical equipment and instruments will be procured from agents or vendors serving the
country with after sales facilities, and the respective arrangements may be procured jointly
with such packages. Costs of contract works to be financed under the project amounting to
about US$10.9 million (or 27 percent of costs) would be procured using: LIB for laboratory
services, geophysics works, geology works and cadastre positioning benchmarks (at an
aggregate cost of about US$8.9 million); and NCB for facilities rehabilitation works (at an
aggregate cost of US$2.0 million). For all LIB procurement under the project, a large
enough number of suppliers would be invited to ensure appropriate competition and
representation. All ICB, LIB procurement will be carried out using the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents (SBD) and for NCB, ad hoc SBD will be prepared and agreed. Training
will be contracted following Bank guidelines for consultants (see above), and educational
materials will be procured using shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.

46.   Bank Review of Procurement Decisions. Procurement documentation and decisions
under ICB and LIB and for contracts for goods, civil works and contract works expected to
cost US$100,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The prior review
of consultant contracts would be in accordance with Bank Guidelines, except for contracts
with consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000
respectively. The proposed review procedures would result in a prior review of well over 80
percent of total contract value under the project, which is satisfactory.
47.   Disbursement. The Loan would be disbursed over a five and a half year period (six
months beyond implementation), against expenditures net of taxes and duties, as follows: (i)
100 percent for international and 74 percent for local consultancies; (ii) 85 percent for
laboratory services, geological and geophysical contract works, and cadastre positioning
benchmarks; (iii) 100 percent of foreign and 85 percent of local expenditures for goods;
(iv) 37 percent for incremental operating costs; (v) 33 percent for facilities rehabilitation;
(vi) 100 percent for international and 46 percent for local training and educational materials;
and (vii) 100 percent to refinance the PPF. Disbursement of Loan proceeds would be made
against seven categories (base costs): (i) consulting contracts (US$7.6 million); (ii) contract
works (US$6.9 million); (iii) goods: computers, equipment and vehicles (US$6.6 million);
(iv) incremental operating costs (US$2.2 million); (v) facilities rehabilitation (US$0.6
million); (vi) training and educational materials (US$1.8 million); and (vii) PPF refinance
(US$0.8 million). Unallocated contingency allowances amount to about 10 percent of total
project base costs. A Special Account would be established at the Banco de la Naci6n, with
an authorized allocation of up to US$1.7 million, equal to four months of expected
disbursements, with an initial deposit to be made of US$1.0 million, and a full amount of
authorized allocation to be released when disbursements reach a level of US$5.0 million.
Disbursements will be made under the authorized signature from a designated representative
of the Borrower. At negotiations, Government assurances will be sought that withdrawal
applications for replenishment of the Special Account will be prepared by the PCU in
accordance with Bank policies and procedures. Disbursements will be made against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts not requiring the Bank's prior review.
Therefore disbursements for all contracts for: goods, civil works, and contract works of less
than US$100,000; consulting services by firms and individuals of less than US$100,000 and
US$50,000 respectively; and all incremental operational expenses, would be made on the
basis of SOEs and certified by the PCU. Eligible expenditures up to 12 months prior to loan
signing would be retroactively financed up to a maximum equivalent of US$0.4 million.
48.   Project Implementation and Reporting. The Republic of Argentina would be the
Borrower, represented by the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services. The
implementing agency would be the Secretariat of Mining (SM). The participating provinces
of Catamarca, La Rioja, Mendoza, Salta, San Juan, and San Luis--which have signed an
agreement with SM to this effect as a condition of negotiations--will implement the Unified
Mining Cadastre as agreed with the Bank in their jurisdictions. Project implementation will
be coordinated by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), which has been in charge of project
preparation and would continue during implementation to coordinate the project, with a
five-year budget of US$1.4 million. The PCU would continue to be responsible for



- 54 -                            ANNEX 2
administering project funds and procurement processing--including the hiring of consultants--
supervising implementation, and following up on agreed conditionality and financial
provisions (its specific responsibilities are detailed in the previous section of this Annex).
Not later than 45 days after each quarter, the PCU would submit quarterly progress reports
to the Bank covering all project activities. A first project review, 18 months after
effectiveness, and subsequent reviews yearly thereafter would provide detailed analysis of
implementation progress. Attachments A to D to this Annex contain implementation and cost
details, and Annex 9 the Estimated Annual Contractual and Other Payments Table. Each
province has also appointed a coordinator, usually the Provincial Director of Mines, who has
participated in project preparation and will continue during implementation. The General
Project Coordinator at SM would also continue during implementation. The maintenance of
the PCU as established would be a condition of effectiveness. The Loan would re-finance
the US$750,000 PPF granted by the Bank in 1994.
49.   Accounts and Audits. The PCU has engaged a private accounting firm to maintain
accounts and process payments for preparation expenditures, and this system will be
maintained during project implementation. Project Accounts, the Special Account and all
procurement, including Statements of Expenditure, would be audited annually by independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank and appointed for at least three years. The audit reports
would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the Government's
fiscal year.

ANNEX 3
ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY OF THE SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
A. Introduction
1.    This Annex summarizes the Mining Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) which
examines the environmental situation in the mining sector of Argentina and considers the
environmental aspects of the Mining Development Project (PASMA) (see Map IBRD 27034-
AR). The SEA is based on a report by the S.M. Group International of Canada ("Simplified
Sectoral Environmental Assessment") prepared in September 1994 for PASMA and kept in
Project Files as background for the project, which provides extensive information particularly
on the natural baseline conditions in Argentina, and on supplementary information gathered
during four visits to Argentina in 1994 and 1995. Annex 1 to this MOP contains information
on the country's mineral sector.5'
2.    In order to understand how mining is developing in Argentina and how environmental
matters are treated, it is important to take into account the two following basic factors:
(i)    Argentina is not a "mature" country regarding either mining or environment.
The country lacks the mining tradition of most of its neighbors. Only a handful of
medium size mines have been operating, mostly during this century.
Environmental issues are essentially new to Argentine industry and mining.
However, a sectoral environmental law for mining activities has been drafted during
project preparation and is under discussion in Congress.
Only recently has the Argentine society at large developed a concern for
environmental issues. Similarly, the environmental awareness in industry in general
is also in its infancy.
(ii)   Argentina is a Federal Country. The 1994 National Constitution recognizes
provincial ownership of natural resources, including minerals. The Nation defines
general policies and broad legal frameworks, and the provinces are in charge of their
enforcement when they formally adopt them. The Mining Code (CM), for example,
applies to the whole country, but its detailed regulations and administration are the
responsibility of the provincial governments. The same applies to environmental
protection.
5/    Also, an "Argentina Mining Sector Review" was done by the Bank in 1993 (Report 11704-AR).

B. Environmental Policy and Legislative Framework for Mining
Mining Laws and Regulations
3.    The federal CM of 1886, amended several times since its inception, provides the
basic legal framework for mining and provinces are responsible for implementing it. Many
provinces have issued their own mining regulations as a complement to the CM, sometimes
in coordination with neighboring provinces. The CM refers to environmental matters only in
a very general way. During 1993, this framework was complemented with two new laws
(the Mining Investment and Restructuring Laws, respectively) and a Federal Mining
Agreement (AFM) between the federal authority and most of the provinces. Article 23 of
the Mining Investment Law established the responsibility of mining companies to deter and
mitigate environmental impacts, and the provision of a fund for environmental preventive
measures or future rehabilitation in each mining concern. The companies may set aside
annually, at their discretion, up to 5 percent of the mine's operation costs, this sum being tax
deductible from profits. The AFM mentions the need to create funds for environmental
research and practical measures, establishing the obligation to obtain an Environmental
Impact Declaration (DIA) in connection with prospecting, exploration, exploitation, and
treatment of ores.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
4.    Article 41 of the 1994 National Constitution of Argentina, establishes the right to a
healthy, balanced environment, appropriate for human development and for productive
activities to satisfy existing needs without compromising those of future generations, as well
as the duty to preserve such environment. It also establishes that environmental damages
generate a priority obligation to restore the environment. Authorities must provide for the
protection of these rights, the natural use of natural resources, the preservation of the natural
and cultural patrimony and of biological diversification, and for the dissemination of
environmental information and education. The Nation's duty is to establish minimum
protection guidelines and norms, and the provinces that of establishing the complementary
norms, while respecting local jurisdictions.
5.    In compliance with the above, the National Secretariat of Mining (SM), in
consultation with relevant authorities and private parties including NGOs, drafted an
Environmental Protection Law for Mining Activities (EPLMA) which is now being discussed
by the Congress. Ninety days after the EPLMA is enacted its regulations must be approved,
establishing environmental quality procedures, methods and guidelines, in order to provide
the minimum protection guidelines and norms. The provinces must comply with such
guidelines and norms, and they must establish the emission ceilings for each element bearing
in mind the priority use of natural resources, their present deterioration and the conditions of
the ecosystems in a given mining project's area of influence. The Government considers that
in order to achieve environmentally sustainable mining development, it is necessary to: (i)
enact EPLMA as a Complementary Title within the CM, in order unify procedures as much
as possible throughout the nation, without requiring further approval by the provinces; and
(ii) establish environmental quality standards for receptor bodies. Hence provinces, through



- 70 -                               ANNEX 3
the Constitution and the CM, have delegated to the Nation the establishment of the mining
policy's norms and procedures while retaining their ownership and role as administrators of
such resources.
6.    The EPLMA will be the first nationwide environmental law. The provinces,
according to their specific conditions, will establish procedures and norms that may be more,
but not less, demanding than the national ones. The Nation may establish, for instance,
international standards related to environmental quality, whose application has already been
proven to be efficient. Provinces may, according to the type of activity or to the level of
deterioration of their ecosystems, adjust their standards so they are not below the ceilings
which apply throughout the country. The SEA has a compilation of the environmental
legislation at the national level and in the provinces participating in PASMA. Table A3. 1
indicates which of the six PASMA provinces have enacted laws related to the environment.
7.    Hazardous Wastes. The 1991 Hazardous Waste Law No. 24,051, enacted as an
urgent measure following various fatal accidents (in non-mining industries) and patterned
after the US hazardous waste legislation, is not yet widely applied as only the provinces of
Chaco, Mendoza, La Pampa, Tierra del Fuego and Chubut have adopted it.

*There is no specific provincial occupational health and safety law in each of PASMA provinces: this
is covered by a National Law.
8.    Water Use. In spite of the dry conditions in many parts of the country and the
resulting widespread scarcity of water supply, there is no federal legislation regarding the use
of water resources. Provincial regulations vary widely, but usually the use of surface or
ground water is subject to permits from provincial authorities and the payment of a fee
("canon"). The fee is normally a fixed amount (usually very moderate) for a certain right of
use and is not used to conserve water resources by pricing.



- 71-                             ANNEX 3
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
9.    The use of the EIA as an instrument for environmental management has only very
recently been introduced. Consequently, no official instructions are available yet on how
such studies should be carried out, and there is little knowledge on the subject among the
authorities responsible for its supervision and control. Given this, two major upcoming
mining ventures--Bajo de La Alumbrera in Catamarca, and Cerro Vanguardia in Santa Cruz--
which are managed by foreign companies, are voluntarily carrying out EIAs according to
international standards, and the largest local mining concern, Minera Aguilar, is undertaking
mitigation measures also in a voluntary, independent manner.
10.   The EPLMA indicates the general requirements to prepare EIAs whose methodology,
procedures and standards will be established by the guidelines and norms contained in the
regulations to the EPLMA. These regulations will establish the quality control levels for
receptor bodies including all the parameters for contaminants. In each province, the
implementing authority will follow the environmental quality values that correspond for the
priority use of each receptor body, according to the World Health Organization tables or to
more demanding levels. Once this is determined, all ElAs must include a model linking the
concentration of the discharge's contaminants with the concentration in the receptor body.
The provincial authorities must verify that the discharges proposed by the EIA will not
produce a higher contamination than allowed.
Occupational Health and Safety
11.   Occupational health and safety matters are governed in Argentina by the 1972
National Law No. 19,587, regulated by Decree No. 351 dated 1979. This law establishes
the regulations that companies must follow in order to protect the health of employees in the
working place, except for matters related to handling radioactive material, including uranium
mining, which are the responsibility of the National Commission of Atomic Energy.
12.   The CM stipulates that a Mining Police (PM) must be established by each province,
responsible for controlling compliance with the industrial norms of health and safety in
mineral exploitations and for reporting accidents. The PM of some provinces have adopted
specific internal regulations for mining activities which respond to the particular
characteristics in such provinces. Often these regulations emerge from labor agreements
between the organizations that represent the workers (unions), and the companies or trade
chambers, and they have not been approved by higher provincial instances. These
agreements are presented to the respective authorities, and when a conflict occurs it becomes
their responsibility to mediate between the parties. The PM only intervenes upon delegation
from the labor authority. This has taken place in the provinces of San Juan, Salta and
Catamarca. The Province of Jujuy is the only one that has enacted as provincial laws three
arrangements contained in such agreements, dealing with compensation for risky tasks; staff
working with X-ray services; and the regulation of unhealthy tasks. However, due to the
limited capabilities of the PM in most provinces, the control of the authorities regarding
health and safety conditions in mining activities is limited.



- 72 -                            ANNEX 3
Public Consultations
13.   The EPLMA was formulated in close consultation and coordination with various
affected parties, including the Provincial Mining Secretariats, the National Secretariats of the
Environment (SRNAH) and of Agriculture, the federal councils of mining and the
environment, industry branch groups and trade associations, the miners' union, and non-
governmental organizations. Consultations will continue in the further regulatory work to be
carried out by PASMA. Direct consultation with the general public on environmental
matters is compulsory only in the Province of Mendoza, where the environmental law
requires public hearings to be held in connection with any major industrial establishment or
environmental conflict. The regulations of the EPLMA will recommend public consultations
in order to evaluate mining projects, and specific norms establishing this public consultation
mechanism will be promoted in the provinces.
C. Institutional Framework
National Level Agencies
14.   The SM, at the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services, formulates the
federal mining policy and supervises the sectorO', which includes three semi-autonomous
institutes: the National Institute of Mining Technology (INTEMIN), the Regional Center for
Underground Waters (CRAS), and the National Institute of Seismic Prevention (INPRES). It
has created a National Environmental Management Unit within its organization (UGAN), in
order to handle environmental matters related to mining activities and to be the interlocutor
with the different government and NGOs at the national, provincial and municipal levels, that
are linked to environmental issues. The UGAN drafted the EPLMA, and is now formulating
its National Regulations, as well as the manuals and guidelines that will support the
environmental mining authorities, managers and the public in general, in all related matters.
The UGAN also supports and advises on environmental issues, any provincial and municipal
administrations that request it. Institutionally, UGAN is linked to the Provincial Units for
Environmental Management (UGAPs) which are being set up. UGAN has a
multidisciplinary team of professionals.
15.   The provincial Governments are represented in the Federal Mining Council
(COFEMIN) at the SM, and the Federal Environmental Council (COFEMA), two
consultative bodies which meet regularly, the former set up under SM's auspices. The SM
has also set up a consultative body that includes representatives of the private sector: the
Mining Advisory Council (CAE), which participates in the review of the sector's
performance and any proposed changes to sector policy.
6/    This MOP's Annex 2 describes the sector's institutional framework, Annex 1 deals with the respective issues
affecting the sector's growth.



- 73 -                             ANNEX 3
16.   Natural Resources and Human Environment Secretariat (SRNAH). The SRNAH,
established by Decree No. 2,419/91, is the prime federal authority in Argentina regarding
environmental matters. It depends directly from the Presidency. Other sector entities have
gradually become part of SRNAH, among them the National Administration of National
Parks, National Institute of Water Science and Technology, National Directorate of Wild
Fauna, and National Directorate of Natural Resources. SRNAH's objectives are to: (i)
promote, protect, recover and control the environment and the conservation and rational use
of natural renewable resources, at the national level and in the municipality of the city of
Buenos Aires; (ii) act as implementing authority for laws related to promotion, preservation,
protection, recovery and control of wildlife resources and the quality of air, water and soils,
as well as matters related to the generation, manipulation, transportation and treatment and
final disposal of hazardous substances and the protection of the ozone. SRNAH's three
undersecretariats deal with: (i) natural resources; (ii) the human environment; and (iii)
institutional relations. It has a total staff of 744, including advisors, professionals, technical
and administrative personnel according to the 1994 National Official Bulletin.
17.   Other National Institutions. Other national institutions involved in environmental
issues are the (i) Ministry of the Interior; (ii) Ministry of Economy and Public Works and
Services; (iii) Secretariat of Housing and Environmental Quality, in the Ministry of Health
and Social Action; (iv) Ministry of Foreign Relations; (v) Secretariat of Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries; and (vi) the office for the Ecological Coordination of the
Metropolitan Area (covering the Municipality of Buenos Aires and the adjacent municipalities
that belong to the Province of Buenos Aires).
18.   Summary. Environmental responsibilities are dispersed at the national level, and
most of the responsible entities within each ministry are national directorates or simply
directorates. This situation has contributed to a lack of compliance in practice with many
functions and tasks. Furthermore, the fiscal restraint which has been taking place for a
decade limits the human and budgetary resources allocated to environmental management.
Provincial Institutional Organization
19.   Provincial governments must designate the authorities which are to implement the
EPLMA. The entities involved in environmental matters in the six PASMA provinces are
described in the SEA, including a general assessment of their main functions, human and
budgetary resources and capacities. Each province has various environmental organizations,
usually within different administrative units. They may be Ministries, Secretariats or
Directorates. Only in a few provinces, such as Cordoba and Mendoza, are these bodies
reasonably well organized and staffed, while in the others they are rudimentary, if existing at
all. In the Province of Catamarca, environmental matters are handled by the Science and
Technology Secretariat through its Environmental Institute, which does not have clearly
defined functions and responsibilities, and mainly contracts professionals for specific
projects. A fairly mature institutional framework is already established in the Province of
Mendoza which can be a base model for other PASMA provinces where environmental
institutions are embryonary and lack the required human or budgetary resources. San Juan,
however, has several and sometimes well-developed research and service institutions,



- 74 -                            ANNEX 3
generally supported by federal funds (National University, CRAS, INPRES), providing
trained human resources which could probably help develop an adequate institutional
framework.
20.   Some provinces, for example Salta, Catamarca, La Rioja, San Juan and San Luis,
leave the responsibility for environmental permits and control to sector organizations (such as
the Provincial Mining Directorate), while in Mendoza the Environmental Ministry has such
responsibilities. The former alternative does have an advantage: it uses the existing
administrative setup and resources of the PM, which is already responsible of controlling the
effective use of the mineral resources and the occupational health and safety in mining
operations. This seems a viable route of action in the less advanced provinces until
knowledge and capacity is built up and more independent environmental entities or
mechanisms can be established which eventually take over these functions. While this
arrangement could lead to a possible conflict of interest resulting from the mining authorities'
responsibilities for both promoting mining and at the same time controlling its environrmental
performance, if well developed, it has the advantage of establishing an appropriate
environmental conscience and professional practices among mining sector staff in the
provincial administrations.
Environmental Research and Development
21.   Research capacity and experience concerning the human impact on nature and natural
processes are comparatively abundant in Argentina, yet research directly related to the
mining sector is very limited. The following is a list of relevant institutions:
*     The Regional Center of Groundwater (CRAS) is a joint federal-provincial agency.
It deals with hydrology, hydrogeology, geophysics and water chemistry, and has a
laboratory for inorganic water analysis. It is sectorally linked to the SM, and the
provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and La Rioja participate in it.
*     The National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) is a federal agency that
carries out studies concerning land use and rural technologies with emphasis in
agriculture. It has published a set of soil maps (Atlas de Suelos de la Republica
Argentina), at a 1:500,000 scale.
*     The Regional Center for Scientific and Technological Research (CRYCIT) is a
research organization in Mendoza that carries out major research projects on
desertification and ecological management.
*     The Institute of Seismic Prevention (INPRES) in San Juan is an efficient and active
institution. It has prepared the seismic hazards and risks map of the country, the
seismic micro-zonification of the most threatened urban areas such as San Juan and
Mendoza, and has issued the corresponding building norms.
*     The National Institute for Hydraulic Sciences and Technology (INCITH), located
in Ezeiza (Buenos Aires) has prepared flood hazards maps for most of the country.
*     The National University of San Juan (UNSJ). The Museum of Natural Sciences at
the University is carrying out investigations of flora and fauna with emphasis on
environmental aspects. Its Institute for Mining and Metallurgical Research (IIMM) is
capable of carrying out environmental technical studies and EIAs.



- 75 -                            ANNEX 3
Private Sector Associations
22.   There are two main associations at the national level representing on-going concerns
of the mining and metal industries: the Argentine Chamber of Mining Managers (CAEM),
which represents the larger companies within the mining sector, and the Argentine Mining
Union (UMA), which represents smaller companies and many of the companies based in the
provinces, particularly producers of industrial minerals. In addition, the Argentine Council
for Sustainable Development (CEADS), an association of mostly large industrial companies,
representing nearly half the Argentine industry, promotes environmental awareness and
management in industry "from within."
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
23.   The Argentine Wildlife Foundation (FVSA) is the largest and most prestigious of the
environmental NGOs in Argentina, with extensive international contacts. It deals mainly
with the protection of flora and fauna, and has no special expertise in mining, but has
nevertheless taken active part in the development of the mining environmental law proposal.
The Environmental and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN) is an internationally known
group of academics specializing in environmental legislation, particularly water laws, which
was also consulted during the formulation of the proposal for the EPLMA. In addition to
these well established organizations, a large amount of small (or very small, often only one
or two staff) NGOs are active locally in the provinces or within specific fields of interest.
D. Environmental Baseline Data
24.   The six provinces participating in the project occupy a large contiguous area in the
northwestern part of Argentina, including the northern high and dry part of the Argentine
Andes and the low-lying semi-deserts to the east of the mountain chain. The following
paragraphs summarize the country's general environmental characteristics.
25.   Geography. Argentina is the second largest country in South America and the eighth
in the world, with an area of 2,791,810 km2. It extends from sub-tropical regions to the
north (210 46' S) to sub-arctic regions to the south (55 03' S) along 4,000 km. Due to great
variations in latitude (about 330) and altitude (from 50 m. below sea level: Salina Grande,
Peninsula de Valdes) up to about 7,000 m. above sea level (Aconcagua), it shows two
gradients of physical variability, orientated east-west and north-south respectively,
generating a great diversity of climatic and soil conditions. Most of the country is
characterized by arid to semi-arid conditions, and annual precipitations average 515 mnm.
26.   Geology and Mineral Resources. Argentina is considered to have good geological
conditions for the discovery of both metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. Annex 1 to
this report summarizes information on the country's mineral potential.
27.   Hydrology and Water Resources. Argentina has great variations in rainfall, soils,
vegetation, and climate. The Andes, which reach 7,000 meters above sea level at the highest
peaks, represent an important regulator of the winds and rainfall. As a result the hydrology



- 76 -                             ANNEX 3
and water resources vary greatly in different parts of the country. The most general and
typical meteorological pattern is the following: humid winds coming from the Pacific Ocean
climb the mountains and leave most of the humidity and rainfall on the western side (Chile);
they descend on the east side of the Andes (Argentina) as dry winds, leaving almost no rain.
The greatest amount of moisture is to be found just next to the mountains; the rest of the
region becomes drier from the northwest to the southeast. The Argentine river network has:
(i) two large basins (Atlantic and Pacific); (ii) areas with endorreic basins or without
drainage to the sea; and (iii) areas with surface waters that don't have a definite course. The
River Plate basin is the most important of those draining in the Atlantic. The most important
rivers belong to this system: the Parana, Uruguay, Paraguay, Pilcomayo, Bermejo, Salado
and Iguazu. The Patagonic plateaus are traversed by main rivers which originate in the
Andes and drain into the Atlantic, have small water flows and are not navigable, although
they are useful for irrigation. These main rivers are the Colorado, Negro, Chubut and Santa
Cruz. In the Western arid region of the system, the river Desaguadero gathers the melted
ice waters drained from the Central Andes into the rivers Jachal, San Juan, Mendoza and
Tunuyan, among others. The Pacific Ocean basin includes short and torrential rivers that in
general flow into the lakes of the Patagonic Andes. Among them are the rivers Manso,
Epuyen and Futaleufu. In addition there are basins in Argentina that do not flow to the sea
with numerous rivers originating in the mountains in the interior. The most important are
the rivers Sali-Dulce, Primero y Segundo, that converge in the Mar Chiquita depression, and
the river Quinto. About 80 percent of the rivers' median water flows corresponds to the
rivers Uruguay and Parana, while 45 percent of the territory is drained by rivers that only
account for 1 percent of the rivers median water flows.
28.   Natural Areas. A descriptive classification of the Argentine regions has been
prepared under the supervision of the National Commission of Environmental Policy. This
classification includes jungles, forests, semi-deserts, savannas and parks, pastures and
subtropical savannas, the transition ecotone and the Antarctic ecosystem. A detailed
description of each of these areas is provided in the SEA.
29.   Natural Protected Areas. Argentina has a National System of Natural Protected
Areas. As detailed in the SEA, Salta and Mendoza use the classification of the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) which includes the following management categories for such
areas, of which the first eight are nationally and the last two internationally recognized:
I.    Scientific Reserve or Strict Natural Reserve
II.    Natural Park (National or Provincial)
III.   Natural Monument (National or Provincial)
IV.   Flora and Fauna Sanctuary
V.   Protected Landscapes
VI.   Resource Reserves
VII.  Natural-Cultural Reserve
VIII. Multiple Use Reserve
IX.   Biosphere Reserve
X.   World Patrimony Site



- 77 -                             ANNEX 3
30.   The Province of Mendoza has three categories in addition to the above:
XI.   Panoramic Roads. These are linear areas along the sides of roads, highways,
routes, paths, channels or rivers, which because of their high scenic, cultural,
recreative, or forestry values should be protected for recreational, environmental
education and preservation purposes.
XII.  Natural Water Resource Reserves. These are water reservoirs or basins
located in wild environments of a high ecological or recreational value.
XIII. Natural Recreational Reserves. These are areas which because of their high
scenic, landscape and recreational value, are dedicated to touristic, recreational,
cultural and educational activities.
31.   The following three types of zones are used to administer and manage the above:
*     Intangible Zones: categorized as Natural Strict Reserves, are zones lacking human
activity, which contain ecosystems and flora and fauna species of existing or potential
scientific value, and whose ecological processes have been spontaneous, or have had
minimum interferences. In these areas, the scientific value has a priority with respect
to scenic beauty.
*     Restricted Zones: are areas whose natural state should be only altered and up to the
minimum necessary to ensure the control and protection of the Intangible Zones that
they adjoin, from outside influences . Their natural state can only be altered by
having the least possible impact on the environment in order to implement the non-
extractive economic activities that are considered by the Management Plan. Mining
exploration and exploitation are prohibited in Restricted Zones.
*     Controlled Use Zones: the only economic activities permitted in these areas are
those whose impacts on the surroundings or the ecosystem are of a conservation or
recovery nature; mining, oil and gas development, hunting and commercial fishing, as
well as the introduction of exotic species of fauna and flora, are expressly prohibited.
The implementing authority, through regulations, will determine the types and nature
of economic activities allowed and grant permits and concessions for them, and
whether there can be sport hunting and fishing of existing exotic species in them.
32.   Although the project provinces do not yet use them, they are aware of new
classification of IUCN, which reduces the number of categories to the following five, that in
turn include the previous ones: (i) scientific reserves and wildlife areas; (ii) national parks
and similar reserves; (iii) natural monuments; (iv) habitat and wildlife management areas;
and (v) ecosystems conservation areas--Landscape and aquatic protection.
33.   The National Parks Law (No 20,351/80) formally excludes mining activities from
national parks, natural reserves and natural monuments areas. Of the 27 national parks and
natural reserves in Argentina, which cover a total area of 2.6 million hectares, or about
0.9 percent of the total land area of the country, only three small ones are located in the
project area. They are: El Rey, Baritu and Los Cardones (which has not yet been declared



- 78 -                                 ANNEX 3
as such) in the Province of Salta. Notably none is in the high Andes or in the high
mountain plains2' (Puna), which are in the areas of major mineral interest.
34.    The protected areas in PASMA provinces are in Table A3.2 (the Province of San Luis
has none).

35.   However, in some of the provinces (particularly San Juan and La Rioja) there are
extensive provincial natural reserves in bio-geographic areas. There are 170 such areas in
the country, amounting to 3.4 percent of the total land area. In many of them there is little
control and no established management plans, and they have been set aside for different
reasons, often to protect the vicunia and with no explicit ban on mining activities. Having
successfully protected the vicuina, some provinces are defining more specifically where in
such areas and under what conditions mining will be allowed"'. However, a recent case
involving small-scale salt exploitation and the preservation of flamingo habitats in the
Province of La Rioja has drawn attention to the potential conflicts between mining activities
and nature preservation issues. A detailed inventory and evaluation of the existing provincial
protected areas is necessary to help the provinces in their process of screening and defining
areas where mining should be excluded or tightly controlled.
36.   The protected areas--particularly the provincial ones--are often not clearly defined,
due either to the poor quality of maps, or to insufficient precision in the definition of their
boundaries or to a combination of both. Cases have been reported (Mendoza) where the
responsible authority (DPM) could not determine whether a requested concession overlapped
with a provincial natural reserve. The project's mining cadastre and unified data base will
include environmental data (including their location and delimitation as well as their
description, environmental data and the legal restrictions to mining activities within them).
Hence the project will improve the information tools available for a better management of
protected areas, and help avoid overlapping of mining rights with them. However, detailed
knowledge regarding flora and fauna and sensitivity of the natural environment within the
project area is limited. Although comprehensive research has been carried out in relation to
desertification problems, studies integrating all different aspects of the physical habitat (as
would be desirable for the decision-making regarding larger mining operations) are still
lacking.
37.   Demography. Argentina has a population of about 32.6 million and an average
population density of 11.7 inhabitants/km2. The Federal Capital has a population density of
14,827 inhabitants/km2, while in the provinces of the project it varies between 2.0
inhabitants/km2 and 9.5 inhabitants/km2. Overall, the country's urban population represents
87 percent of the total. The age composition of the Argentine population differs significantly
from that of most other Latin American countries: the population under 15 years of age is
about 10 million, the active population about 19.8 million, and about 2.9 million are over 65
years old. The rate of population increase has diminished during the last decade.
Argentina's projected population for the year 2000 is 36 million, and is expected to grow to
44 million by the year 2025.
38.   Indigenous People. There are presently 14 indian groups in Argentina, most of them
very small; together they represent only 1 percent of the total population. These
11/   The proposed environmental law states that mining in "protected areas of multiple use" shall be evaluated by
the implementation authority (provincial) in agreement with other competent authorities.

communities include the: (i) Toba, Wichi, Mocovi, Oilaga and Chiriguano-Chane in Chaco
province with approximately 110,000 persons; (ii) about 2,000 Guarani Indians in Misiones
province; (iii) about 40,000 members of the Mapuche, Tehuelche and Yamano communities
in Patagonia; (iv) about 140,000 Kollas in the Altiplano; and (v) about 60,000 Calchaquies
Indians in the northwest region. All these communities are very small and live in marginal
areas of the country.
39.   Indigenous people, as defined by the General Atlas of the Argentine Republic (1982)
as "people who live in some form of community, maintaining certain cultural patterns" are
present within the province of Salta but not in the other five PASMA provinces. According
to official data from the Salta provinceL2 there were in 1984 about 18,000 individuals
belonging to this category, mainly consisting of the Chiriguano and Mataco ethnic sub-groups
in the northeastern part of the province. Besides minor gold washing, in which this
population occasionally participates, there is no present mining in this area and little potential
for the development of such activities. Consequently, there are no existing conflicts with the
indigenous population due to mining activities and owing to the limited potential for the
development of such activities, no immediate concern by the authorities (further details are
provided in Annex F of the SEA).
40.   The General Atlas also includes the ethnic Kollas, of which from 30,000 to 50,000
live in the northwestern part of the province of Salta and further to the north in the Province
of Jujuy. This group belongs to the Quechua-Aymara population which is predominant in the
mountainous part of Bolivia to the north. However, although it preserves some traditional
cultural habits, it no longer masters its original language and is generally well integrated into
the national society. Many of them work in mining operations in the provinces of Jujuy and
Salta, in the same conditions as all other personnel, occupying the full range of positions.
41.   Natural Disasters. Major natural disasters in Argentina include floods, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, and landslides. Among these, earthquakes and landslides are of some
concern in the project area. The western part of Argentina is also threatened by several
volcanoes located in Chile.
E. Environmental Impact of Mining Activities
42.   Due to the modest size of the Argentine mining industry, its impact on the
environment has been relatively limited, and there is little knowledge or documentation on
the enviromnental impact produced in Argentina by mining activities in the past, although
people living near them have been traditionally concerned with the impacts caused by mining
activities. Mining has taken place only in small and scattered areas, and, for example, most
of the Andean mountains have hitherto been virtually untouched by mineral exploitation,

exploration or other activities causing scars, tracks or contamination in the landscape. -'
Thus, Argentina does not have any extensive environmental liabilities from previous mining
and should be in a good position to develop an effectively managed, environmentally lenient
mining industry. The following generalizations regarding environmental aspects of sector
activities are based on findings from visits to mines currently in operation in the six
provinces of La Rioja, Catamarca, Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, Salta, Jujuy and Santa
Cruz:
*     metallic mining produces solid, radioactive and hazardous wastes, water and air
pollution, and brings about health and security risks. The six PASMA provinces are
in a semi-arid and arid zone, where water is a scarce resource, and the use of
groundwater is very expensive due to the depth of the water table. As many of the
potential mining areas are located upstream from agricultural areas, particular
attention should be paid to water resources, and to the potential pollution of surface
water and groundwater. The mining of radioactive materials is under the control of
the National Commission of Atomic Energy (CNEA). This organization has its own
regulations concerning environmental impact, which are now applied conscientiously
and efficiently;
*     non-metallic and application rocks mining may produce mostly solid wastes, water
and air pollution and health and security risks; and
*     Argentine authorities and the SM who are responsible for environmental matters at the
national and provincial levels, have already identified some areas which may be
sensitive because of wildlife, vegetation or social issues. This is the case of Laguna
La Brava in La Rioja Province, where the flamingo fauna could be affected by the
potential exploitation of the sulfates concentrated in the La Brava salt field.
43.   Possible Future Impacts. A common argument in discussions about the
environmental impact of mining in Argentina is that most mining occurs or will occur in
mountainous and/or semi-arid areas where there is little alternative use of resources. This
may be true in some cases (if the question of preservation of restricted ecosystems or of the
natural landscape as such are ignored), but in most places there are competing interests.
These may be agriculture, impacts on nearby towns or villages, the well-being of the miners
(and their families) themselves and/or wildlife habitats. In the foreseeable future, most
mining projects will likely be developed where the density of known prospects is high, i.e.,
in the northern part of the Argentine Cordillera, and to a less extent in the southern
Cordillera, in the Sierras and the Patagonian meseta. These regions include principally the
Puna, the Altos Andes, the Monte and the Estepa Patagonica ecosystems areas. Without the
implementation of an Environmental Management Plan, the development of mining activities
could result in, i.e., the following negative impacts:
*     mining companies--most likely the foreign ones--might hesitate to invest in costly
projects if the legal environmental framework is not clearly defined, fearing to be
13/   The main regional environmental problems are overgrazing and desertification due to the lack of economic
options.



- 82 -                            ANNEX 3
subject to unpredictable or discretionary measures which could significantly affect the
economy of planned or even ongoing operations;
considering the lack of a proper provincial regulatory and control framework, the
planning of impact mitigation measures would be left to the decision of each mining
company and for each specific development project. Large and responsible
international companies would typically include such measures in their plans and
apply international standards, as they are part of their normal policies and operations.
Application of such principles might tend to be less systematic when dealing with less
financially strong companies or with those not mastering modem and environmentally
adequate technologies;
*     without adequate mining concession procedures that duly consider public information,
populations that could be affected in their activities or conditions by mining
development projects would be kept out of the decision process;
*     very little, if any, baseline data exist regarding the natural concentration of potentially
harmful metallic elements (such as cadmium, lead, mercury, etc..) in the weathering
zone of mineralized areas. Even if environmental protection measures are
implemented, the lack of precise characterization of sensitive areas would probably
affect the efficiency of "blindly" defined mitigation techniques;
-     similarly, the lack of regional sensitivity data would inhibit the recognition of areas in
which mining should be excluded or strictly controlled in order to preserve them; and
-     improper environmental attention could result in the contamination or destruction of
specific eco-systems within the apparently resistant Altos Andes or Puna areas.
Additionally, many current or potential mining areas are within or upstream of
agricultural areas: fruit and grape culture in the north, and oviculture in Patagonia.
Since water is a scarce commodity in most of the mining zones of Argentina, possible
contamination of surface or ground waters would considerably affect such economic
activities or nearby villages and towns.
44.   The implementation of a Mining Environmental Management Plan as outlined in
Section F below, would considerably reduce or avoid the impact described above. For
example:
*     with clearly defined "rules of the game", mining companies would feel safer to invest
in Argentina, thus effectively contributing to one of the main objectives of PASMA;
*     the preparation and presentation to the competent authorities of EIAs and/or
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)--as established by the EPLMA--would
provide the basis for a systematic monitoring and control of mining impact mitigation
measures, according to clear procedures and development and land use policies;
*     the generalization of the "Mendoza model" of public consultation for mining
concessions would increase environmental awareness of involved populations and
allow them to participate in the decision process;
*     systematic baseline data gathering, processing and analysis would permit the
development and/or adjustment of realistic norms and standards, as well as effective
monitoring of mining projects, based on the characterization of specific sensitivity
areas. Furthermore, areas in which mining should be strictly controlled or even
excluded could be defined on the basis of actual data and facts;



- 83 -                            ANNEX 3
*     baseline data will help the responsible authorities and mining companies to improve
water management and liquid waste treatment in order to avoid damage to surface or
ground waters which could affect alternative land use activities in surrounding or
downstream areas; and
*     the strategy to develop an environmental consciousness--and knowledge regarding
environmental sustainability--among provincial mining administration officials and
staff evolves from their traditional role as caretakers of the country's natural wealth.
Such consciousness and knowledge, respectively raised and nurtured by the project,
would in fact permit the implementation of the mining policy, which clearly states the
principle that mining activities must be undertaken in environmentally sound ways.
Social Considerations
45.   As stated, the Andean mountains and their foothills are very sparsely populated.
Their largely deserted character is further stressed by the fact that 60-70 percent of the
population of the project (PASMA) provinces live in urban areas. While the Province of
Mendoza has a diversified economy based on agriculture as well as industry, the other
PASMA provinces are less developed and have serious economic and associated social
problems. The province of Catamarca, for example, with a population of only 260,000,
suffers from serious unemployment and covers 90 percent of its provincial budget with
federal contributions. Many of the provinces of the Argentine Andes, which is the area
thought to have the best mining potential in the country, exhibit similar characteristics.
There should be no doubt that mining development in these areas, if well planned and
carefully executed, would be of great benefit to them and their population, and is probably
one of their few development options.
F. Recommended Priorities for a Mining Sector Environmental Management Plan
Major Issues
46.   Legal Aspects. The existence of an articulate policy in environmental matters and a
workable legal framework are of utmost importance for the protection of the environment,
for the development of the mining industry and for attracting investment capital. Policies,
legislation and the administration of laws and permits should be clear, long term,
unambiguous and unbiased. In Argentina, such policies, legislation and administrative
framework have started to be developed very recently, mostly at the federal level.
Accordingly, efforts to promote the mining sector should be accompanied by the completion
of environmental legislation at the federal and provincial levels and the development of its
implementation framework.
47.   The EPLMA was prepared by an SM task-force, in coordination with SRNAH and in
consultation with involved federal and provincial authorities, private sector representatives,
NGOs and other interested parties. It was approved by the Senate in December of 1994 and
is expected to be approved by the Deputy Chamber before the start of implementation of the
Project. Its regulations are under preparation and must be approved through a Decree within
90 days after the Congress approves the law. Provinces will then have to provide for the



- 84 -                             ANNEX 3
implementation of the law and regulations through specific provincial decrees or legislation.
Project provinces--which participated in formulating the law and its regulations--have agreed
to do this once the law is enacted. To this effect, all entered into a Federal Agreement for
the implementation of the project (December 1994). While a federal environmental
regulatory framework for mining would be established during 1995, development and/or
refinement of norms and procedures--including the provincial regulations--are still needed in
order to have a comprehensive protection system. This aspect is an important initial activity
of the project.
48.   Institutional Aspects. The distribution of responsibilities has been clearly defined at
the federal level, as SRNAH has delegated to SM the formulation of sectoral environmental
provisions regarding non-renewable resources. This should evolve in the medium term in
order to avoid the potential conflict of interest between the strong mining promotion policy
driven by the SM and its responsibility to support environmental regulations. Competent
organizations dealing with environment need to be strengthened in all the provinces except
Mendoza, where an acceptable level of organization and resources is in place.
49.   Provincial governments must designate their responsible authorities for EPLMA's
enforcement, and while in Mendoza the Ministry of Environment is already in charge, most
likely the respective provincial Mining Directorates (DPMs) will be designated in the other
provinces. This latter case is a temporary solution and a viable route of action, which should
be supported until more independent and sustainable environmental entities are established
and can take over, yet it would be particularly sensitive in provinces which have commercial
interests in mining ventures. The suggested solution is to establish in each DPM a temporary
"environmental unit" (UGAP) or task force, which is formed on an as needed basis and
reports to UGAN (national level). This UGAP would not be a line structure within the
sectoral administration and would be responsible to coordinate the development of regulations
and their enforcement as well as the technical and administrative functions between the
different concerned institutions, according to the specific provincial institutional schemes and
capacities in terms of human and economic resources. In this manner, a relative autonomy
would be maintained.
50.   Protected Areas. National park areas and a number of provincial areas where
mining is not authorized or limited are already defined. The deficiencies which cause such
areas not to be always respected--principally at the provincial level--are generally a lack of
(i) clear knowledge of baseline conditions and of the sensitivity of specific ecosystems; and
(ii) a reliable cadastral system. Also, sensitive areas which should be protected are not
comprehensively identified, often due to difficulties of access (Altos Andes and Puna) and,
basically, to the absolute lack of baseline information on natural conditions.
51.   Water Use. The institutional framework for control of water use is well established
in all PASMA (project) provinces. However, clear criteria for such control have not yet
been established, particularly in remote areas where mining may develop and where the
potential conflict of use is not clearly identified. Moreover, specific baseline data on
watersheds are not always available. Baseline data surveys to be carried by PASMA will
provide background information which should help the water administration authorities to



- 85 -                             ANNEX 3
develop or improve water management plans for important watersheds. Handling of water
resources is particularly controversial, as provinces have the right to establish the priorities
for water use, e.g., if the resource will be earmarked for human or animal consumption, for
irrigation, etc., and to grant concession rights as established by their Water Laws. The
procedure in order to authorize a mining exploitation will require that the implementing
authority establish the priorities for the use of water. The EPLMA determines the criteria or
quality standards for each type of use.
Recommended Priority Activities
52.   The recommended priority activities include:
(i) Formulation of legislation, norms and standards. This activity should comprise
the: (a) development of environmental regulations, guidelines, norms and standards for the
mining sector in each of the six PASMA provinces (to serve as their legal instruments for
environmental management); (b) development of detailed instructions to prospectors for the
elaboration of ElAs; and (c) elaboration of technical-environmental manuals regarding
different mining activities.
(ii) Implementation of public environmental management. This activity should be
carried out in PASMA provinces and include the strengthening of local capacity through
the: (a) participation in the elaboration of national legislation and manuals, and of
provincial environmental legislation (in cooperation with national and other provincial
staff); (b) introduction of methods and procedures for issuing permits and monitoring; and
(c) improvement of supervision and control of occupational health and safety rules within
the sector.
(iii) Baseline studies. These environmental studies aim at providing natural, physical, and
social background data to help: (a) take decisions in the administration of mining rights
regarding the use of water, soils and air resources; (b) determine in each province the
sensitivity of the environment; and (c) evaluate the impact from previous mining activities.
(iv) Enviromnental Management and Training. Institutional capacity building should be
envisaged as a dynamic process through which legislation and environmental management
successively are brought to a higher degree of sophistication. The involvement of mining
sector organizations in much of this work should provide a close contact between the
parties to enable efficient dissemination of information during the process. The inherent
relative slowness in mineral exploration and development (a period of several years usually
elapses from the first identification of a prospect to the design of the mine or the initiation
of exploitation works) should also leave ample time to develop well devised and concerted
environmental rules and management.
G. Project Description
53.   Overview of the Project. The project is planned to be carried out by SM with
financial support from the World Bank. An overall objective of the project is to promote
private mining sector growth in Argentina in order to encourage development options in
regions that show good geological potential, thereby creating employment and export
revenues. More specifically, the project would develop and support legal and institutional



- 86 -                           ANNEX 3
reforms that encourage the expansion of private investment in mining in an environmentally
sound and rational manner. It would help, at the federal level and in the provinces of
Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, La Rioja, Catamarca, and Salta to: (i) create the capacity
needed for a fair and efficient administration of mining rights; (ii) establish proper
environmental safeguards; and (iii) strengthen the technical infrastructure and services that
support mining growth. (The project does not include environmental management of nuclear
minerals, as this is under the responsibility of another National institute.) The duration of
the project would be five years. The estimated total cost amounts to US$40 million. Annex
2 contains the detailed description of the project, which includes a: (i) Policy and
Regulatory Component; (ii) Policy Implementation Component; (iii) Support Services
Component; and (iv) Coordinating Unit. The project's Environmental Subcomponent is
part of (ii) above and is detailed below.
Environmental Subcomponent
54.   Objectives. The subcomponent's main objective is to implement a preventive
environmental protection system for Argentina's mining activity at three levels: the national
level, the provinces included in the project and the related--public and private--agencies. The
subcomponent has three specific objectives, the: (i) development and implementation of the
environmental legislation and its regulatory framework for mining activities at the provincial
level in the participating provinces; (ii) strengthening of the environmental management at
the national and provincial levels; and (iii) preparation of environmental baseline studies in
order to establish standards and parameters, and to develop management methods applicable
to mining activities in line with federal policy, the ecosystemic condition of each PASMA
province and the competitive uses of natural resources.
55.   Activities of the Environmental Subcomponent. The strategy to achieve the above
will be implemented by a competent working group at the national level, which will enhance
organization and training and help introduce efficient environmental management in the
provinces. The legislation and management programs are complemented with regional
research on the existing environmental baseline conditions and nature, in order to have
information available for the establishment of provincial standards in line with local
conditions. All these activities will be supported and supervised by experts. The different
working elements of the program will be closely coordinated for their efficient
implementation and to achieve a useful and intensive on-the-job and formal training of the
staff. The program will include three principal elements: (i) further development of the
environmental legislation for mining; (ii) dissemination of information about the respective
legislation and the implementation of the public environmental management in the mining
sector; and (iii) preparation of baseline studies in order to link the sensitivity of the
environment to the intervening factors. These efforts, to be carried out in the six PASMA
provinces, will generate significant materials, knowledge and methodologies that are likely to
be useful in other provinces. All the information and data gathered through the
subcomponent will be documented in a database system connected to the Unified Data Bank
for mining (BUD) supported by the project. The environmental subcomponent will be
implemented in five years according to the schedule and main activities described below.
Details of the organization of the component, its staff and costs are in Annex H of the SEA.



- 87 -                             ANNEX 3
56.   Activity 1: Development of Environmental Legislation. Effective supervision of
the mining sector requires a general law and its regulation, and the elaboration of provincial
regulations and a series of consulting manuals and procedural guidelines. This in turn
requires preparing and establishing more specific local regulations to complement the legal
framework with technical instructions. In addition, these tools have to be elaborated and
agreed with the concerned groups, and the staff of the environmental management team need
to be qualified in their use. The legislation and dissemination system will be used to obtain
endorsement of environmentally sound mining by the authorities, mining managers and
others. Hence the dissemination of material and the transfer of knowledge are most
important. These information, education and coordinating tasks should be achieved by the
direct participation of interested parties during the process of preparing the regulations and/or
through public hearings. The products of this activity will include the:
*   environmental regulations for mining for each of PASMA provinces, which, based on
the Regulatory Decree, will be specific for the ecosystemic conditions of each
province and will be the main legal instruments at the provincial level;
*   instructions for the preparation of the EIA. The EPLMA will require that an EIA be
prepared for the approval of each stage of mining activity;
*   instructions for the reports dealing with prospection and exploration works that must
be presented to the authorities. These reports will be required although their approval
is not needed for the activities to proceed;
*   organization of a registry of accredited environmental consultants for mining matters
and the definition of requirements for their inclusion in such registry. The EPLMA
explicitly refers to the creation of such registry; and the
*   technical environmental manuals for mining. The following types of manuals will be
prepared, and will include transparent penalties for non-compliance (depending on
what is deemed necessary during the detailed planning of the project's start-up):
Water quality monitoring registry
Air and gas emissions quality monitoring registry
Environmental management of ore washings
Environmental management of cyanides
Management of the acid drainage from mines
Environmental management of water (including equipment maintenance)
Vegetation
Heap leaching
Plants and mines closures
Mining exploration
Perforations and explosions
Management of reactives, chemical products and other solid wastes
Appropriate miner conduct (e.g., respectful treatment of local people, no
hunting, no burning of natural vegetation).
57.   The employment of competent professionals in each product is necessary in order to
achieve quality results. Above all, the experience and knowledge found within the mining



- 88 -                           ANNEX 3
sector (public or private) will be used, and external consultants hired as appropriate. The
products will be prepared under the SM coordination with the direct or indirect participation
of working or reference groups made up of interested and affected parties such as the:
Federal Mining Secretariat and Provincial Mining Secretariats
National System of Mining Technologies (SINATEM)
Natural Resources and Human Environment Secretariat
Agriculture, Cattle Raising and Fisheries Secretariat
Provincial Environmental Authorities (when existing)
Federal Mining Council (COFEMIN) and Federal Environmental Council (COFEMA)
Argentine Chamber of Mining Managers (CAEM)
Argentine Mining Union (UMA) and Argentine Industrial Union (UIA)
Argentine Mining Workers Association (AOMA)
Federal and Provincial Legislators
Non-Governmental Organizations
58.   Activity 2: Implementation of environmental management for mining in the
public sector. The provincial implementation authorities for environmental management will
perform tasks involving mining concessions, monitoring of occupational health and safety,
and other related to the natural environment. In most cases the responsible organization will
be the PM which depends on the DPM. The project will help train the PM's staff and other
persons and to enable institutions involved in environmental management in mining.
Regarding environmental issues, the implementation authority must: (i) prepare and
implement the provincial environmental mining legislation; (ii) review applications and issue
environmental permits; (iii) inspect and monitor mining operations, determine fees, or other
charges, and, if applicable, impose sanctions and fines; (iv) provide information about legal
provisions and technical advice; and (v) help in general the provincial authorities.
59.   PASMA aims to develop provincial entities so they become able to comply with their
tasks. It includes institutional strengthening and training by introducing methods and routines
and by developing the necessary facilities. Staff of the relevant institutions in the provinces
will participate in training dealing with the: (i) formulation of regulations and national
application manuals; (ii) preparation, in collaboration with the UGAN and consultants, of
provincial environmental regulations; (iii) participation in the work of provincial
environmental baseline studies; (iv) development of staff knowledge and qualification by
means of courses, on-the-job training and specific environmental instruction; (v) introduction
of methods and routines for the review of applications, operational tests, environmental
monitoring and issuance of permits; and (vi) counseling and improvement of controls in
occupational health and safety matters.
60.   Occupational health and safety in mining is the only subject in the program that is
part of the specific mandate of the Occupational Health and Safety Law. The National
Directorate for Health and Safety in the Workplace within the Labor Ministry is responsible
for its supervision at the federal level, and the original legislation has been in various
opportunities complemented through decrees. The provinces have often, on their own,
introduced modifications (in some cases more strict) in order to comply with the CM. Each



- 89 -                             ANNEX 3
province is responsible for implementing this legislation in its jurisdiction. The CM states
that the PM of each province should control the implementation of occupational health and
safety norms in mining activities and also report accidents to the relevant provincial labor
agency. Due to the limited capability in terms of knowledge and facilities regarding mining
health and safety, it was considered crucial to include these matters in the above program.
61.   Activity 3: Environmental baseline studies in order to deternine the sensitivity of
nature and related factors. The general objective of these studies is to provide
comprehensive information on the physical and social conditions, in order to support
environmental management. The specific objectives of the baseline studies are to: (i) provide
relevant information and data needed to establish environmental standards and norms; (ii)
provide information on natural and human conditions that may help decision making for
locating industrial facilities, roads and other infrastructure, and settlements; (iii) develop
multi-disciplinary research methodologies and guidelines for their application in
environmental studies; and (iv) strengthen the research capability and develop human
resources in the environmental field with special emphasis in the mining sector. Protected
areas and those where mining is likely to occur should be studied on a priority basis.
62.   There are data on the biophysic and human environment in different ministries,
universities and research institutes of the provinces, as well as in some federal institutions.
However, the quantity and quality of information provided by such data varies, and the
information is scattered. In order make these data useful for environmental purposes, a
comprehensive task--including gathering, revision, supplementation, interpretation and
presentation tasks--will be carried out in the six PASMA provinces. This work entails three
main activities: (i) regrouping and provision of additional knowledge related to water issues;
(ii) evaluation of environmental vulnerability in the province; and (iii) definition of the
impacts of former mining activities.
63.   Superficial or groundwater resources are few and valuable in the arid zones where
most of the mining potential is located. Hence, the environmental work will try to estimate
and qualify these resources. This will be useful for decisions by the authorities regarding the
permissible use and consumption of water resources, and serve as a reference in order to
establish effluent standards for mining projects. The related work will include various
technologies, such as the de-limitation of water basins through satellite imagery and
topographical mapping, the compilation of statistics regarding rain, modelling of water
transportation, water sampling and analysis, etc. These data will be interpreted and
documented in the mining information system.
64.   The evaluation of environmental vulnerability is done in order to prepare multi-
thematic maps delimiting zones with homogenous sensitivity and according to a series of
various parameters. This product will be used as a planning tool, and as a teaching
instrument for presentations and for educational purposes. It studies the physical (geology,
geomorphology, hydrology, edaphology, vulcanology, meteorology), biological (flora, fauna,
ecosystems) and human environments (human activities, indigenous groups).

65.   The definition of mining impacts is done in order to evaluate the contamination or
environmental degradation attributable to previous operations, their potential impact with
respect to human beings and nature, and the justification, feasibility and costs of
rehabilitation. Such work includes mapping, sampling, analysis and evaluations.
Justification of the Environmental Subcomponent
66.   Legal Aspects. The EPLMA complies with Article 41 of the National Constitution,
which establishes that "All the inhabitants have the right to have a healthy, balanced
environment adequate for human development and for the productive activities that fulfill
their actual needs without jeopardizing those of future generations... " and that "... It is the
Nation's responsibility to dictate the norms that contain the minimum protection and the
responsibility of the provinces to establish the norms that supplement them, provided these
do not affect local jurisdictions.". Consequently, EPLMA's Federal Regulations will
establish the minimum environmental quality procedures, methods and guidelines, including
the quality guidelines for each type of receptor body, depending on the use of such body and
including all the parameters of potential pollution. Later, the implementing authorities in
each province must establish the priority use for each receptor body and control the
minimum values of environmental quality as established by the regulations, or they must
establish a level of greater quality for their respective province. All EIA reports must be
based on the established quality guidelines values, and include a model that links the
concentration of the pollutants discharge with the concentration in the receptor body. The
implementing authority must verify that the discharges proposed in the report do not produce
a higher pollution than allowed, and control compliance with the quality standards, by
establishing the discharge limits for each project based on the priority use that has been
assigned to the natural resources, their present level of deterioration, and the ecosystematic
conditions in the area of influence of the project. The inclusion of the EPLMA in the CM
will enable this management to be exercised.
67.   Through the Federal Agreement for the Implementation of PASMA the Nation and
the six provinces commit themselves to carry out in each province an analysis of the existing
baseline conditions and to establish a monitoring and permanent control system for the
mining environment, in order to ensure compliance with the legislation in effect and to
contribute to the environmental sustainability of mining activities. This implies that in order
to carry on mining activities in multiple use areas it will be necessary to have previous
baseline studies.
68.   Water resources in the mining provinces and more in particular in PASMA provinces
are not abundant, and consequently there is specific legislation for water management. For
the same reason the mining companies have an institutional and social incentive to recycle
this rare resource.
69.   There is national legislation in effect regarding hazardous wastes which deal with the
management, transportation, treatment and final disposal of hazardous wastes. Some of the
PASMA provinces have ratified it (e.g., Mendoza and Catamarca) and the others are in the
process of doing so.



- 91-                             ANNEX 3
70.   Public hearings are supported by the new National Constitution, whose Art. 43
approves the right of any citizen or NGO to request that the authorities stop any action that
may damage the environment. The Province of Mendoza implements the right to public
participation through public hearings. The Province of San Juan has enacted a similar
provincial law and is in the process of regulating it. The Province of La Rioja is considering
to establish similar public hearings. Yet while the Nation establishes the guidelines required
by the National Constitution through the EPLMA, it can only recommend to the provinces
how to implement the mechanisms of public participation. Hence the EPLMA Regulations
include the express recommendation to carry out public hearings for the evaluation of mining
projects, and encourages provinces to establish such mechanisms.
71.   The EPLMA establishes that holders of mining rights, concessionaires, directors,
managers, professionals, authorities, contractors and subcontractors involved in a mining
activity are jointly responsible for damage caused by mining. The environmental
professionals who have worked on the EIA report must co-sign the presentations to be made
by the mining company, and they are also co-responsible for any damage that may occur if
the legislation is not complied with as a result of such EIAs, and can also be sanctioned for
non-compliance. The Law requires compensation for different types of damage, and such
compensation is established for failure to comply with the following environmental measures:
mitigation, rehabilitation, restoration and recomposition. The typology of sanctions as
established by the EPLMA includes: (i) Warning; (ii) Public admonishment; (iii) Fines; (iv)
Suspension of entitlement to the environmental quality product certificate; and (v) Temporary
closure, that can be final, after three serious faults.
72.   The existing legal framework regarding occupational health and safety establishes the
regulations that companies must follow, and the CM stipulates that the Mining Police is
responsible for controlling compliance by mining companies with industrial norms regarding
health in the workplace and to report the respective accidents. The PASMA will strengthen
the PM's capacity to do so.
73.   Institutional Aspects. The EPLMA and its Regulations establish the institutional
framework for their implementation, whereby each province should assign budgetary
resources to the related tasks. The process that will establish the environmental mechanism
for mining is as follows:
*   the National Congress enacts the EPLMA, includes it in the CM and gives 90 days
for the enactment of its Regulations by the Executive;
*   the Provincial Governments have 60 days after the enactment of EPLMA's regulations
to prepare and approve their Provincial Regulations according to the Federal Mining
Agreement;
*   the Provincial Governments designate the implementation authority (IA) in charge of
implementing the EPLMA (implementation authority) and provide it with resources to
do so;
   the environmental management mechanism takes effect when a mining company
prepares and presents to the responsible authorities an EIA for a mining project,
which the IA must then evaluate;



- 92 -                             ANNEX 3
*   the IA evaluates the EIA, either with its own specially trained staff or by hiring
consultants to do so. This evaluation is paid with provincial budgetary resources;
*   once the EIA evaluation is done, the IA and the mining company enter into an
agreement, by signing a joint Declaration of Environmental Impact (DIA), which
establishes their respective commitments and obligations;
*   once the project starts the IA begins its permanent environmental monitoring and
control activities, either with its own resources or by contracting consultants. The
resources of PASMA's satellite information system may be used to support these
provincial monitoring and control activities; and
*   the legislation calls for an update of the DIA every two years, based on the data
obtained by the monitoring activity, such update to be made at the request of the
mining company or of the IA.
74.   The project provides for the institutional strengthening of the provincial mining
authorities (which may be the designated IA) and of the National and Provincial
Environmental Management Units (UGAN and UGAP). It also provides for training their
staff, purchases of equipment and the preparation of regulations, manuals, environmental
guidelines for exploration and instructions for EIAs. In addition it supports the: (i) Mining
Cadastre System that will contribute to establish the actual location of the mining areas using
satellite technology; (ii) Mining-Environmental Interactive Network (RIAM) included in the
Unified Data Bank (BUD), that will disseminate environmental information allowing the
different agencies, NGOs, private companies and the general public to access and interchange
processed information dealing with the environment; and (iii) National System of Science and
Technology applied to mining production, that may help re-equip or identify reference
laboratories and the reconversion of productive systems and technologies applied to the small
and medium size mining companies, which in turn would benefit the mining environment.
75.   Environmental Baseline Studies. Baseline studies must be done in order to establish
the existing conditions of the receptor bodies in each province before the start of mining
activities. This procedure is considered the most adequate given that provinces own and
have jurisdiction over their natural resources, and given the diversity of ecosystems in the
country. The baseline studies will provide a knowledge about ecosystems in each province
and their inventory which, complemented with the future EIAs and their monitoring, will
allow their continuous updating. The BUD in turn will support these tasks by including all
the environmental information related to prospects, projects and operating mines.
76.   Until such environmental baseline studies are completed, mining operations in areas
of multiple use will not be approved, in application of the Federal Agreement for the
implementation of PASMA. Protected areas issues will be also addressed through the
definition of baseline information in PASMA provinces; such information will lead to the
delimitation or clarification of areas that must be protected from mining. The Cadastre
Subcomponent will establish the precise coordinates of each mining right and claim, as well
as of the protected areas, and it will also establish simple, direct and transparent procedures
for the concession of mining rights. By clearly defining the location of each area, the
cadastre will facilitate environmental management.



- 93 -                            ANNEX 3
77.   The SEA contains information on sensitive areas in PASMA provinces. Although
some such sensitive areas have been already classified, the project includes tasks to achieve
their overall, uniform classification. The exclusion of activities from environmentally
sensitive areas should be considered not only regarding mining but also other economic
activities (forestry, tourism, cattle, infrastructure, etc.) in a larger context. Hence the
project includes the definition of protected areas, which involves the respective coordination
with other agencies and institutions. No mining concessions will be granted in protected
areas until the baseline studies included in PASMA are completed, and future mining
concessions will depend on the results of such studies. The baseline studies will be used to
establish the emission limits for mining activities. Such studies will be done by existing
research institutions or, if they lack the capacity, by hiring consultants.
78.   Public Consultations. As stated, the National Constitution establishes the right of
private parties to participate in the legislative process. The project plans to discuss with the
involved provinces how public hearings can become a productive means of promoting social
participation within the mining sector, and to avoid conflicts of interest. The consultation
process including public hearings relating to important projects would be extended to other
PASMA provinces based on their particular characteristics and the Mendoza experience.
However, proper institutional capacity and regulations at the provincial level are a
prerequisite for this process, in order to achieve meaningful results. Appropriate screening
criteria will have to be defined in order to provide differentiated treatment according to the
size (e.g. small or large) and type (e.g. use of chemicals or not in the process) of the mining
operations under consideration.
79.   Indigenous Populations. Of all PASMA provinces only Salta has indigenous
populations, and there are no conflicts of interest between them and the mining sector and
related activities.
Public Consultations Undertaken During Preparation of the SEA
80.   The following institutions related to the mining environment were formally and
informally consulted:
*   At the National Level: The Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human
Environment, and the Argentine Wildlife Foundation (ONG);
*   At the Provincial Level: The Provincial Secretariats of Mining and other public
institutions related to the environment (OP) and the non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs).
81.   The process included sending the SEA to the Provincial Coordinators of PASMA who
were asked to provide it to the above institutions and to request their comments, in order to
analyze and include them in the Environmental Subcomponent of the Project. Only partial
responses were received, although more may be forthcoming.

ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
ANALYSIS OF FISCAL REGIME FOR MINING
1.    The Mining Investment Law No: 24.196 passed in 1993 provides for several
incentives for mining investments. These include, inter alia:
- tax stability for 30 years (excluding VAT tax)
- double deduction for exploration and feasibility work
- accelerated depreciation for capital investments
- exemption of capital gains taxation on the value of equity transfers
- exemption from assets tax, due to be abolished in June 1995
- exemption from import duties, taxes, and statistical tax
- provincial royalties maximum of up to 3 percent of "mine mouth" value
- special allowance of 5 percent of operating costs for environmental fund
2.    In most respects, the legislation is consistent with what the Bank would consider
international "best practices": i) no discrimination is made between foreign and domestic
investors; ii) the accelerated depreciation provisions provide for rapid pay-back of capital
invested; iii) production costs are not burdened by excessive import or other taxes; iv) the
VAT tax is recoverable when products are exported; v) provincial royalties are not only
capped at 3 percent but also assessed on "mine mouth" value reducing the effective rate to an
equivalent industry standard of around 1-2 percent of net smelter return; vi) environmental
cleanup costs are properly considered operational costs, and an allowance of up to 5 percent
of operational costs can be deduced in the calculation of income tax to fund environmental
work; vii) tax losses can be carried forward for five years; viii) the basic rate of income tax
(30 percent) and absence of dividend withholding taxes are very attractive by international
standards.
3.    The effects of the tax regime on a mining investment were estimated by the appraisal
mission on the basis of a hypothetical medium sized gold mine. The premises in this
hypothetical example are: (i) production of gold would average seven metric tons per year,
about the same size as the El Indio mine across the border in Chile or the planned Cerro
Vanguardia mine in Patagonia; (ii) the yearly value of production would be US$85.8 million
at an international gold price of US$380/ounce; (iii) production costs are an international
average of US$225/ounce, the mine would have a life of 20 years; and (iv) the initial capital
investment required would be US$200 million. It is stressed that this analysis is based on
current understanding of the new mine tax regime and is used for illustrative purposes only.

4.    The fiscal revenues accruing to federal and provincial governments are summarized in
the following table:
Income Tax over the mine life              US$200 million
Mine Mouth Royalty over the mine life      US$37 million
VAT taxes over the mine life (possibly      US$81 million
refunded to the producer if product is
exported)                              I_I
| Total government taxes over life of mine  US$237 - US$318 million  ;

ANNEX 5
ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF MINING
1.    The gross value of minerals produced currently in Argentina is about US$450 million.
Of the total value of production, approximately 90 percent is of industrial minerals (borates,
feldspar, mica, bentonite, barytine, kaolin, salt, diatomite, semi-precious stones) and
application minerals (marble, aggregates, etc.). Production of metallic minerals is small;
only lead, zinc and silver are produced in sizeable quantities. About one metric ton of gold
is also produced. There are a number of projects in an advanced feasibility study stage
which could be developed by the private sector over the next ten years. In addition,
numerous foreign and domestic companies have active exploration programs (expenditures of
US$40 to 50 million/year) which could easily result in the discovery of a new major
orebody.
2.    According to Bank estimates, the value of current mining production represents about
0.25 percent of Argentina's gross domestic product of US$200 billion. In other countries the
sector contributes more: Bolivia (2-3 percent), India (2 percent), Thailand (3 percent),
Mexico (4 percent), Peru (10 percent), and Chile (13.5 percent). The government wishes to
increase the contribution of the sector to 1 percent by the year 2000. But, measuring the
contribution of mining to the overall economy as a percentage of GDP may not be the most
appropriate benchmark. Argentina's total exports in 1992 were US$12.3 billion. Only
US$70 million of mineral products, representing 16 percent of its total minerals, were
exported. Most of the planned expansions will be in the metallic metals, and the majority of
this production would be exported. This would generate foreign exchange or the metals
would be consumed locally, saving on foreign exchange required to import metals. In
addition to the metallic minerals, reasonably good potential exists in neighboring countries
and/or international markets for selected Argentina industrial minerals (bentonite and kaolin,
for example). The effect of Mercosur on Argentina's mineral exports is difficult to
determine. On the one hand, removal of various tariff and non-tariff barriers could
significantly enhance the penetration of certain mineral commodities in neighboring countries.
On the other hand, access to Argentina's domestic market of cheap foreign imports could
weaken certain local producers burdened with high cost structures (marble, for example),
whose productivity would have to improve significantly to compete.
3.    Other economic benefits of mining include the development of support industries
(manufacture of mining equipment, provision of consulting services, development of capital
and commercial markets), transfer of technology and management know-how, and limited
direct job creation. These benefits have not been calculated.
4.    To test the reasonableness of the possible contributions of mining to the economy,
three scenarios (low, medium, and high case) have been constructed. These are based on
projects currently in an advanced planning stage as well as assumptions about new



- 98 -                             ANNEX 5
discoveries and developments. Present levels of GNP and total exports have been increased
by 4 percent per annum over the ten-year projection period (this is the government's
estimated GNP growth). The results of this analysis are as follows.
Table A5.1: Argentina Mineral Production and Export Projections in the Next Ten Years
Gross Production Value             Gross Export Value
Scenario     pesos million        Percent of GNP  pesos million   Percent of exports
Current              496             0.25%             70              0.5%
Low Case            1,040            0.35%            457              2.5%
Medium Case         1,657            0.56%           1,032             5.6%
High Case           2,056            0.69%           1,312             7.2%
Low Case Scenario
5.    The Salar del Hombre Muerto (lithium) and the Cerro Vanguardia (gold) projects are
developed by 2000. In addition, one new medium sized gold project and one new small-
medium sized base metals (copper-lead-zinc) mine are opened by 2005. Existing non-
metallic production increases in tandem with overall GNP growth at a rate of 4 percent per
annum. As most of the production from the new projects will be exported, mineral exports
as a percentage of total Argentine exports increases four-fold to 2.5 percent of total exports.
Medium Scenario
6.    By the year 2000 the Salar del Hombre Muerto, Cerro Vanguardia, Potasio Rio
Colorado, Bajo de la Alumbrera, one new medium sized gold mine, and one medium sized
base metals mine enter production. By the year 2005, in addition to these mines, El Pachon
copper mine, two medium sized gold mines (US$50 million each), and one base metals mine
(US$100 million) are opened. Nearly all of this metallic mineral production would be
exported. Certain of Argentina's non-metallic minerals such as borates, bentonite, kaolin,
and soda ash could expand slightly faster (5 percent) than average GDP growth (4 percent);
in addition, the percentage of exports of industrial minerals of total production is increased
from the present 16 percent to 18 percent. This would be probable if Mercosur succeeds in
lowering tariff barriers between the member countries The value of mineral exports in ten
years would be US$1,032 million, and would account for 5.6 percent of total exports.
High Case Scenario
7.    Given the right policy environment to encourage investment and vigorous internal and
external markets for Argentina's mineral products, the high case scenario is plausible.
However, some of the specific projects are indicative, as it is unlikely that all of the projects
in the feasibility study stage will reach fruition. Over the five-year time horizon, Salar del
Hombre Muerto, Cerro Vanguardia, Potasio Rio Colorado, Bajo de la Alumbrera, San Jorge,
two new medium sized gold mines, and 1 medium sized base metals mine would be opened.
Over the ten-year time horizon, in addition to these mines, Cerro Vanguardia increases
production by 50 percent, to 16 tons of gold per year, and 2 new medium gold, 1 medium



- 99 -                            ANNEX 5
base metal, and 1 large base metals mines would be opened. Production of non-metallic
minerals grows faster than overall GDP (6 percent per year), and industrial mineral exports
as a percentage of total production of industrial minerals increases to 20 percent as Argentina
takes advantage of new export markets. Exports are US$1,312 million in 2005, or 7.2
percent of total projected exports.
Conclusions
8.    The contribution of mining to the Argentine economy will undoubtedly increase from
today's presently low levels. But, in order for it to increase, the mining sector reforms now
underway must be continued and deepened. In addition, the growth of the sector will depend
on continuing present macro-economic policies, renewed overall economic growth, access to
export markets, international market factors and, above all, the luck of the mining companies
presently exploring in finding major new orebodies. The potential contribution of mineral
exports to foreign exchange earnings is a good measurement of the sector's contribution to
the economy. Under the high case scenario, by the year 2005 exports of minerals could be
14 times greater than they are at present, over US$1 billion (7.2 percent of total exports)
versus US$70 million (0.5 percent of total exports) currently.

ANNEX 6
ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
MINING CADASTRE - PROPOSED TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS
1.    There are two sets of issues which diminish the efficacy and reliability of the mining
cadastre, and hence of the provincial administration of mineral rights. They can be
summarized as problems of cartography, and of procedural reliability and speed, or
administrative processing. This Annex describes the solutions proposed through the Project's
Cadastre Program for each of these problems, as well as the implications and practical
matters related to the application of such solutions, indicating the most urgent needs in order
of priority.
A. CARTOGRAPHIC ISSUES
2.    Argentina has a serious cartographic problem in those sectors that require a precise
geographic positioning. Mining activities are specially subject to this problem. The best
solution would be to have a new national cartography. Yet, while this may be achieved in
the future, the urgent need of a reliable cadastre to support Argentine mining activities
cannot wait until reliable cartography becomes available in the future.
3.    A faster, operative solution, sufficiently precise as to guarantee the geographic
location of existing mining rights, will be used. Modern teledetection techniques provide the
proper alternative. Such techniques allow the provision, relatively quickly, of:
-   an updated "real image" of the area where mining concessions are located, and
-   the geometric correction of such image, generating an "ortho-image" in the desired
projection system, which would hence be cartographically valid.
4.    The Gauss-Kruiger coordinates are used in Argentina, and they will be used in the
cadastre, since they now provide the best geodesic coverage at a national scale. Image
processing systems allow for the automatic exchange of coordinates to more frequent systems
(UTM, geographic, Lambert, etc.). To carry out such an exchange, a series of control
points are selected whose real coordinates are obtained directly from maps. However, it
would not be possible to use this methodology in Argentina, since the geometric
imperfections in the existing cartography would be transferred to the images. Alternatively,
the coordinates of the control points will be obtained through direct field measurements made
with Global Positioning Systems (GPS).
5.    Another topographical problem is the lack of linkages between the different geodesic
networks that are available. The most effective solution to this problem is also the
application of the modem GPS systems, complemented by a total topographical station. The
following simultaneous activities will be undertaken in order to address these needs:



-101-                               ANNEX 6
(a)  positioning and measurement of "fixed points": there are various triangulations
done by national and provincial entities in the provinces, in addition to the IGM
(Military Geographic Institute) chains and networks. Such important networks of
points are the basis used to date regarding mining rights, yet they have not been
calculated in a single system and may or may not be linked to the national geodesic
network. The solution is to use the GPS measurement technology, since it allows
excellent precision and operating speed as well as related cost reductions. Through
GPS instruments, the existing networks can be revised and complemented, by placing
support points measured by GPS that are linked to the area's network and which, by
being in strategic or salient locations (ideally the center of an area with significant
density of mines), will permit the mines' corner markers to be linked. Once the
demarcation and field measurements are completed, a final calculation and adjustment
stage will follow in order to keep information in a unified coordinate system, linked
to the national geodesic network. Also, first-order measurements of from 15 to 20
points must be made for each of the satellite images, in order to proceed with the
corresponding geometric corrections. This work will provide an updated and reliable
topogeodesic-cartographic framework in the future, that will help ensure the
permanence of mining rights and geographic references.
(b)  corner markers for mines: only those mines with approved measurements, up-to-
date license payments (canon) and that are not being legally questioned in ways that
permit cancellation of the holder's license will be reconsidered and marked in the
field. Corner markers will be installed on a priority basis in areas under active
exploration or that are densely covered by exploration permits, in order to clarify as
soon as possible the cadastral situation in areas where there may be conflict between
the location of mines and that of exploration activities. The new cadastre will respect
the order in time in which mining rights were originally requested. Each mine or
mining right will be linked to the national geodesic network, and the Gauss-Kruger
coordinates of each corner marker will be recorded. This will permit filing in a
digital format of the cartographic details of all mining rights, accelerating the start-up
of the system.
Operative Sequence
6.    Given the urgency of carrying out the above activities, the following operative
sequence is proposed in order to shorten the processing time needed:
(a)  simultaneous acquisition of the satellite image in two formats: paper ("hardcopy")
and digital;
(b)  photointerpretation and sketching of the image;
(c)  field measurement of control points and their linkage to the geodesic network.
Simultaneously, the digitalization of the graphic document (sketch) carried out through
photointerpretation would be done in the workshop;
(d)  based on the control points already measured in the field, real coordinates will be
assigned to them, and the digital image geometrically corrected; and



- 102 -                             ANNEX 6
(e) the same correction algorithm used in the image will be applied to the graphic file
that was obtained by digitalizing the sketch.
7.    As a result of this process a geo-referenced orthoimage will be obtained, which can
be used as a "map" and a sketch, also geo-referenced, that can be superimposed on the
image, both of them in a digital format. In parallel, the linkage between triangulation
networks will have been made, and hence the lack of a uniform cartographic coverage and of
a linkage in a geodesic network, which are the two most serious cartographic problems, will
have been solved. This method has the following additional advantages:
(a)  it allows access to cartographic documents in a digital format with all the related
advantages;
(b)  it provides the possibility to automatically reconvert in the future, all the cartography
to the new national cartography; and
(c)  it completes the conventional cadastral information.
B. PROCEDURAL RELIABILITY AND SPEED
8.    A slow-moving concession administration has negative effects, and it generates
insecurity. Juridical and technical measures are needed to solve this issue. The project's
Cadastre subcomponent will include the later ones (its Policy Development Component will
contain the improvements to the legal framework). Once the cartographic problems have
been solved, the system's potential inefficiency may be due to:
(a) the lack of a systematic filing system that allows prompt data consultation; and
(b)  the use of traditional techniques, both in field work and workshop tasks.
9.    The above situation would be corrected through the:
(a)  development of a cadastral file after systematically and thoroughly reviewing, and if
necessary revising, the information pertaining to existing mining rights in each
province;
(b)  introduction of new tools to speed up all procedures and processes, such as the use of:
(i) alpha-numeric databases; (ii) conventional word processors; (iii) digitalizing tables
to capture and store graphic information; (iv) plotters to generate graphics; (v)
computers and computation tables to automate the topographical and geodesic
calculations; (vi) a GPS, total topographical stations and portable computers to do the
topographical mapping, geodesic checking and measurements; and (vii) a local
network to transmit information between the different units that participate in the
process.
10.   Also, to do this work, the existing physical facilities need to be upgraded so the
required equipment can be installed (facilities upgrading is included in the project's
Institutional Programs).



- 103 -                             ANNEX 6
Start-Up and Application
11.   The proposed change in methodology requires a sharp change in the traditional way of
operating. This makes it necessary to plan a balanced change involving the different
equipment and technologies that must be introduced, as well as a gradual preparation
regarding the different techniques that must be adopted. The following is necessary to
achieve these objectives while maintaining the administrative functions in operation:
(a) the administrative units should remain open to the public during the transition period,
even though their productivity may fall during the period;
(b) the provincial administration staff training process should begin right at the start of
the project (on-the-job training);
(c) the training process should be given priority, although it will not be complete until the
appropriate equipment is in place. This constitutes an unavoidable "bottleneck";
(d) the different information technology processes and techniques should be integrated
into the administrative processing at the same time as the quality of the results being
obtained are tested and verified, and the staff team that will be responsible for
running them gets trained;
(e) the provincial administration staff will join (on a part-time basis) the working teams
set up by the private firms hired to do contract work, in order to: (i) verify that the
required technical norms are being complied with (independently of any control
measures and quality guarantees that may be established); and (ii) familiarize
themselves with the techniques being used.
Equipment Selection (Topography, Hardware and Software) and Description
12.   The equipment (hardware and software) must be capable of reading and geometrically
correcting satellite images, and of superimposing georeferenced vectoral information
(cartographic sketches and polygons that mark the limits of the mining concessions). It is
necessary to adopt the simplest and most universal (preferably ASCII) storage formats. This
will guarantee: (i) ease of data and information import and export; and (ii) the capacity to
use the stored information in the future, without having to depend on a specific commercial
brand.
13.   Within the existing market supply and among the equipment that complies with the
above mentioned requirements, those easiest to handle should be selected (avoiding any over-
dimension of the system). A correct selection will: (i) shorten the time required to set up the
system; and (ii) allow the administrative staff--without a sophisticated academic background--
to handle (simple) equipment. The procurement of the necessary equipment calls for a
careful assessment of the guarantee offered by the provider, as the risks involved in
equipment failures are great, and would endanger the cadastral system's productivity and
reliability. The maximum technical guarantee should be demanded and obtained.



- 104 -                           ANNEX 6
Description of Equipment
14.   An administrative unit in charge of the mining cadastre should have the following
equipment:
(a) Satellite Images: Band 4 (near infrared) of the TM sensor incorporated into the
LANDSAT satellite is considered optimal for use by the mining cadastre. Hence it is
recommended that the Landsat TM be acquired as a base system. In case that, locally, for
specific reasons, its resolution and precision are not sufficient, the TM images can be
complemented with those of other sensors. An additional advantage of the TM images is
that given their medium and near infrared spectral component (Bands 4, 5 and 7), they are
an ideal tool to do geological cartography and for mining exploration purposes (although
these are different needs from the cadastre's).
(b) Topographical and Geodesic Equipment (for each province):
-   2 double frequency, 8 channel geodesic receptors for GPS positioning, including the
related software;
-   2 manual, portable GPS 5 channel (minimum) receptors;
-   total station (reading 1"), with a minimum reach of 3,000 meters, fully equipped;
-   6 hand-held VHF receivers;
-   specific software for topogeodesic data processing and calculations.
(c) Hardware (for each province):
-   one 486 computer (8Mb RAM, 500Mb disc, 16" color monitor, A3 size continuous
paper matrix printer) to be solely dedicated to the graphic component, both at entry
(digitalization) and exit (plotter). In periods when it is not being used for these
purposes, the computer can be used to enter information (data base) and to do
topographical/geodesic calculations;
-   one 486 computer (8Mb RAM, 500Mb disc, 16" color monitor) with graphic software
(without image processing) to be used in the cadastre office counter which is open to
the public, where applicants can check the situation of concessions and exploration
requests;
-   one Pentium computer with the following configuration:
*    16Mb RAM
*    4Gb rigid disc
*    high resolution graphics card
*    CD-ROM DAT ribbons unit
*    Magnetic-optical disc unit (CD-ROM)
*    high resolution monitor (1024 x 1024)
-   one portable computer, black and white monitor, capable of being integrated with the
GPS system, to be used in the measurement and geodesic works. When the computer
is in the office it would be used to enter information in the data base and to do
topographical-geodesic calculations;
-   one 8 pencil pen plotter; and
-   one digitalizer table size AO (its precision should be specified).



- 105 -                           ANNEX 6
15.   Besides the equipment mentioned above, the mining rights administration process
requires that additional equipment be available in the adjacent or related Registry or Mining
Secretariat areas, to which the cadastre must be also connected. To this effect, each
province will need to have installed in its Mining Registry a 486 computer (standard
configuration, 4Mb RAM, 200 Mb rigid disc, 16" color monitor and a size A4 black and
white laser printer).
16.   Software: each province should have software to do the following:
-   word processing (ie: WORDPERFECT);
-   data base (ie: DBASE);
-   digitalizing software (ie: MICROSTATION and AUTOCAD);
-   local area network (ie: NOBEL and WINDOWS NT);
-   image processing and geometric correction (possibly ERDAS, as it is easy to handle
and is already installed in the SM and in the provinces of San Luis, San Juan and La
Rioja; however, this selection depends on the digitalizing software that is selected).
17.   Other equipment required:
-   electricity stabilizers and uninterrupted power supply facilities (UPS), in order to
protect the equipment, the processes and the changes in data feeding;
-   map files, to store maps and sketches in an orderly, easily accessible form.
18.   The estimated cadastre costs for each province (total costs between provinces will
vary mostly as a function of the procurement costs of topographic and geodesic works). For
a standard configuration as expressed, such costs average about US$1.1 million.

ARGENTINA - MINING DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
LESSONS LEARNED
1.    There have not been any prior projects in Argentina dealing specifically with mining.
However, there are applicable lessons from other countries in which the Bank has financed
projects to develop mining, including the Mining Sector Rehabilitation Project (MSRP) in
Bolivia, the Environment and Mining Technical Assistance Loan (EMTAL) in Peru and the
Mining Development and Environmental Control Technical Project (MDECTAP) in Ecuador.
2.    Previous projects, including the ones mentioned above, have revealed: (a) rigidities
in the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to mining, which discourage private
operators and investment, and have fostered the inefficient expansion of public entities;
(b) weaknesses in line agencies charged with administering mining rights and establishing and
enforcing environmental provisions (including among other aspects, unclear responsibilities,
misuse of administrative discretion and lack of attention to the environmental screening,
monitoring and control functions); (c) lack of resources and appropriate planning in agencies
charged with producing geological information or providing other support services to mining
activities; (d) unrealistic expectations regarding the time frame of mining activities and their
fiscal potential; and (e) the mushrooming of informal mining activities which involve social,
environmental, health and other risks that are seldom properly assessed and addressed.
3.    The implementation of Bank projects in the sectors shows that the issues mentioned
above are resilient, they take significant time to solve, and their difficulty is often
underestimated, particularly in cases where mining activities have started and expanded under
inadequate policies, a restrictive legal and regulatory framework and institutional
arrangements that allow improper administrative discretion and insecure tenancy of mining
rights.
4.    More recently, Bank projects in the sector have addressed issues associated with the
changing role of the State, from that of owner, developer and operator of mines and manager
of related activities and line agencies that mainly support its own mining activities, to that of
a facilitator of environmentally sound private activities and investment in the sector. This
includes: (a) a new, subsidiary role for the government in ensuring an appropriate legal and
institutional framework that provides the security of tenure sought by investors and required
by the usually long-term nature of the activities; in Ecuador and Bolivia, for example, the
Bank has provided assistance to the governments in drafting a new CM and its regulations;
(b) establishing and/or restructuring sector institutions so they can administer mining rights
and establish and enforce environmental provisions in transparent, fair and effective ways; in
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, the strengthening of the Mining Cadastre Office as well as the
development of a new Mining Environment Office represent major components of the Bank-
financed mining projects; and (c) developing or fostering the services that provide mineral
information useful to potential operators and investors in the sector; in Bolivia and Ecuador,
important resources have been allocated to the development of a modern and reliable



-108 -                              ANNEX 8
geological information infrastructure, including regional mapping, mineral resources
assessments, airborne geophysics and the setting up of a computer-based national mining
information network.
5.    The proposed project is designed along these lines. It develops the capacities, at the
federal (policy) and provincial (administrative) levels to carry out the new catalytic role of
the State, as established through a revision of the legal and institutional frameworks and
defined in the planned implementation of the project components. Also, its Environmental
analysis will determine the potential impacts of mining expansion and establish mechanisms
and tools to address it (legal provisions norms and standards).
