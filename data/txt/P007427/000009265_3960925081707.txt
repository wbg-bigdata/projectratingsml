PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Project in Jamaica, for which Loan 2017-JM in the amount of
US$7.5 million was approved on September 21, 1981. The loan was closed on
June 30, 1985. At the closing of the loan, a total of US$3.8 million had
been disbursed and the balance of US$3.7 million was cancelled. The last
disbursement was on January 29, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department 3, Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office and is based, inter alia, on the Minutes of the Board Meeting, the
Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; consultants reports; correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; and a Project Completion Report
prepared by the Borrower.
This PCP. was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 28, 1989, for comments by
September 8, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATIOPN PROJECT
(LOAtl 2017-JM)
HIGHLIGHTS
The fundamental objective of the Petroleum Exploration Project was tc
reduce the increasing cost of petroleum imports to the Jamaican economy through
promotion of exploration for and development of the country's hydrocarbon
potential. Although no commercial discovery was reported, the project partially
achieved its objectives in increasing knowledge of the prospectivity of the Pedro
Bank area offshore and of northern and western parts of onshore Jamcica. The
interpretations if the surveys data enhanced the understanding of the offshore
and onshore areas and identified areas such as New Bank on the South Coast Shelf
where further exploratory work was warranted.
The project scope changed with time and not all the funds earmarked for
exploration activities were used. The negative outcome in exploration activities
slowed down disbursement as decisions were being made about alternative uses of
funds. In January 1986 the loan was closed and about 502 of the approved funds
were canceled.
The Technical Assistance component contributed significantly to developing
the Borrower's manpower and strengthened it as an institution. However, the
recommendations from the study on haulage and distribution of petroleum products
were not implemented.
The Borrower made appropriate use of the loan proceeds and exercised
prudent financial management before and during development of the project. It
carried out its supervision responsibilities in a satisfactory manner but it
lacked some effectiveness in attracting private investors to develop further
exploratory tasks.
The geological and geophysical studies conducted under the loan made a
significant contribution to the Borrower's data-base. However, it is the
Borrower's view that the complex geology of Jamaica warrants further
investigation. The Bank agrees that additional detailed studies would throw
light on the prospective areas, particularly the offshore prospects.  However, no
further effort has been justified since loan closing, given the continuing fall
in world crude oil prices.

PR.OJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2017-JM)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1     This report is aDout a petroleum exploration project supported by Loan
2017-JM fcr US$7.5 million as provided by the Bank to the Petroleum Corporation
of Jamaica (PCJ). This was the Bank's first loan for the Jamaican pEtroleum
sector.
1.2     Jamaica is the largest of the English-speaking Caribbean islands, with a
total area of 4,244 square miles, a population of 2.4 million and a GNP per
capita of US$ 890 (1986). The economy depends mainly upon the bauxite/alumina
and tourism industries. With the decline in the importance of agriculture in
Jamaica and the growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors, the country
became one of the more energy intensive economies in the region. Due to the lack
of exploited energy resources, imported petroleum products are the backbone of
Jamaica's energy supply and represent 90X of commercial energy while at the same
time contributes to an increased balance of payments vulnerability. About 39Z of
total petroleum products are used by the bauxitelalumina sector, 22Z by power
generation, 8Z by international aviation and bunkers and the balance in the
domestic sector. As a result of this dependence on petroleum, the oil price
increases of 1973-1974 and 1978-1979 and the lack of known exploitable energy
resources, caused widespread disruptions in the economy, created the need to
explore and exploit the country's oil and gas reserves.
1.3    Numerous statal and parastatal agencies are involved in the energy sector
- including the Ministry of Mining, Energy and Tourism (MMET, energy policy,
pricing, conservation and studies), the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSC,
electric power generation and distribution), the Ministry of Public Utilities and
Transport (MPUT), and the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ), the agency
implementing this project - but each institution is operating in isolation
without an appropriate coordinating link to a single agency which determines the
overall energy sector priorities. Although the Energy Division within the MMET
is supposed to be the lead organization, it has been unable to execute its
mandated role. Regulatory functions within the energy sector are fragmented, and
some of the parastatals such as PCJ are self-regulating and effectively
controlling important policy instruments such as the refinery's pricing
structure.
1.4     PCJ is an autonomous, wholly owned government institution whose main
functions have been the supply and operation of Jamaica's only refinary, the
exploration, development, and marketing of petroleum and other energy sources,
and investment studies of various energy related projects. PCJ is a well-managed
and well-organized institution. Since its formation in 1979, PCJ has been
pursuing an active petroleum exploration program both onshore and offshore of
Jamaica. This has been made possible because of the financial assistance
received primarily from: the Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
PetroCanada International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC), and from the
Governments of Norway and the U.K.

1.5     This Completion Report is based on information obtained from the Minutes
of the Board of Directors meetings, LAC Information Center, Report and
Recommendations of the President of the Bank, supervision reports, consultants
reports and a Completion Report prepared by the borrower.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
2.1     Jamaica depends for the bulk of its energy needs on costly imports of oil
which account for nearly 90Z of the energy supply; indigenous resources
constitute the remaining 10X. Substitutiin of oil by indigenous energy resources
has been minimal and even if proven reserves of peat, hydropower and bagasse were
developed to their optimum capacity, only a minor contribution to future energy
supplies can be expected. Peat is available in relatively significant quantities
but its economic viability is still to be proven. Energy consumption in the
country is comparatively high (about 12.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in
1985), primarily because of the requirements of the bauxite/ alumina industry
which accounts for nearly 30? of the energy use. The remaining 702 is consumed
by other industries, the household sector, and transport.
2.2     Developments in the energy sector in Jamaica significantly affect the
overall economic performance and prospects, due not only to the energy intensity
of the economy but also to the weak balance of payments position. As a
consequence of the damaging effects on the economy of the increases in oil
prices, the government found it imperative to intensify efforts to increase the
supply of domestically-produced energy resources, and initiated, as early as
1977, a comprehensive energy sector plan that served as basis for developing a
number of projects -including those covered by this loan-  with the p-arpose of
accomplishing the following objectives:  (i) to search for and develop domestic
energy resources; (ii) to improve energy efficiency in the energy intensive
sectors of the economy; and (iii) to upgrade technological and institutional
capabilities within the sector.
2.3     By 1980, limited oil and gas exploration had been undertaken since the
miid-1950s. Only seven wells were drilled between 1950 and 1977 (6 onshore and 1
offshore) which were found dry, with one producing gas. However, a comprehensive
study of Jamaica's petroleum potential, completed in 1977 by a U.S. consulting
firm, cor.zluded that these wells were poorly located and recommended further
exploratory drilling after additional seismic data had been obtained. Based on
this recommenddtion, a new program of acquiring, processing and interpreting both
on- and offshore geological. geochemical, and geophysical data was initiated in
1978 with the financial assistance from the Norwegian and the U.K. Governments.
The information collected under this program led to the conclusion that Jamaica
might have oil and gas, but that additional exploration was required to gain
firmer knowledge of these sources.
2.4     The project was identified during a visit of a Bank mission to Jamaica in
February 1980 and appraised in January 1981. The fundamental objective of the
project was to reduce the increasing cost of petroleum imports to the Jamaican
economy through promotion of exploration of the country's hydrocarbons potential
and to provide the basis for further exploration and private investment in the
sector.



.2.5    To achieve the above %bjectives the project included the followings
(a)     Exploration:   Exploration by PCJ of the offshore Pedro Bank as an
equity partner of private oil companies (i.e., the financing of Its
carried equity interest) or, under certain circumstances, by zxercising
a sole risk option for activities such as well sidetracking, deepening,
testing end shooting of seismic lines.
(b)     Technical Assistance. Training and Equivment:  PCJ would acquire
laboratory equip _rt and hire needed consulting expertise in Xeophysics,
geology, micropaloontology, petroleum economics end engineering, to
train its staff, to monitor exploration work undertaken by companies and
to undertake its other responsibilities, including the import and
distribution of petroleum products in Jamaica.
(c)     Offshore Seismic Surve:   About 2,300 line-km of seismic data would be
acquired and processed, covering the shelf between Jmaica's southern
coast and 200 m water depth line, en area that was les known
geologically.
(d)     Oil Recovery Studvs  Feasibility study for a project to recycle imported
lubrication o41..
2.6     Since this was an Engineering and Technical Assistance loar, no Staff
Appraisal Report was prepared.
2.7     Negotiations were held in Washington in Hay 1981 and the loan was
approved by the Board of Directors on June 16, 1981. The loan wts signed
September 21, 1981.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Offs4ore Exploratorv Drillina
3.1     The contract for exploration of Block D of the Pedro Bank was awarded to
a US/Italian consortium, also holding Block C, with PCJ having a 30S carried
interet rather than 101, as they had on Block C. The American-Italian
consortium completed the first exploratory well (Arawak No.1) on Block C in
April 1982 reaching a final depth of 15,050 Ft. From 12,005 Ft. to final depth,
drilling costs of US$ 2 million were borne by PCJ using proceeds of the loan
through the exercise of their sole risk rights under the contract. At the end
of 1983, the consortium decided to relinquish their contract area (blocks C and
D), apparently as a result of lack of interest by third parties in a farm-in
agreement.
3.2     Although the well did not have any shows of commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons, the deepening of the well provided valuable information. The
correlation of the newly acquired subsurface geological data with existing data
was useful for the location of new structural or stratigraphic traps in the



- 4 -
Pedro Bank area where condition3 for oil generation exist. The results however,
did not change the impression that Jamaica lies within a hith-risk area for
petroleum exploration.
3.3     Exploration activity in late 1983 and 1984 was mach reduced in
comparison with the extensive work of the preceding period. The drilling
progrm was suspended in late 1984, primarily because of high cost and the need          L
to evaluate the areas, following the geopiyateal and seismic surveys.
Geolorical Studies
3.4     The geological studies under this project were conducted by geologists
of PCJ and foreign consultants and covered mainly the offshore ar&as on the
Pedro Bank, although in the final phase of the project studies were also
conducted for onshore areas.
3.5     The offshore geological studies evaluated the Pedro Bank and South Coast
Shelf areas. Prior to this phase of exploration, one exploratory wall -Pedro
Bank #1- had been drilled on the Pedro Bank. It wa dried and did not penetrate
any Cretaceous section, consequently it gave little geological data for
evaluation of the area. The Arawak t1 well, drilled in 1981-82 to a deoth of
15,053 feet, provided results that were radically d4fferent from previous
Interpretations of the stratigraphy of Pedro Bank. i '5 led to a re-
Interpretation of the geological data from this area. 1 e stratigraphy and
velocity data from the well assisted in understanding tho variations in the
Tertiary stractures with improved accuracy.  No Cretaceous section was
encountered in either of the two wells drilled on Pedro Bank.
Geoggvsical Surveys
3.6   Geophysical surveys were the main exploratory tool used in the study of
the offshore areas of Jamaica. In 1978, approximately 4068 line kilometers of
geophysical data were acquired by a Norwegian firm on the Pedro Bank. This was
followed in 1980 by the acquisition of 1,100 line kilometers of seismic data
from central and southwest Pedro Bank by the American and Italian firms who hkd
the production sharing exploration contract with PCJ.
3.7     In 1982 PCJ accepted an offer from an American firm to carry out the
southern coast shelf seismic survey. Some 4,165 line-km of seismic, gravity and
magnetic data were collected on the shallow water shelf between Jamaica's
southern coast and the 200 meter water line. The survey was conducted at no
lrediate cost to Jamaica, under a non-exclusive, speculative-type agreement.
As a result of this free of cost service, PCJ wanted to utilize the funds
allocated for this purpose (US$2.6 million) for the financing of additional
consulting services and studies related to the troject.
3.8    A U.S. consultant prepared an interpretation of the seismic data on the
Western and Central Pedro Bank areas. This report noted that several types of
trap in the west central Pedro Bank area remained untested.



3.9     Another U.S. consultant was contracted to conduct the inte.pretation of
the data from the South Coast Shelf, and to integrate these data with other
offshore and onshore data that were available. This interpretations were
completed and many areas of interest identified, such as New Bank, were further
exploratory work was warranted. These studies were the first overall technical
attempt to decipher the tectonic, structural and stratigraphic conditions
existing between mainland Jamaica and Pedro Bank. The studies conclude that
there are structural and stratigraphic anomalies and traps which, if present in
any other basin known to be oil-bearing, would doubtless justify an extensive
drilling effort, although the analysis suggests that gas is more likely to be
discovered than oil.
3.10    The presentation of the interpretation of the data was detailed enough
for PCJ's and Bank staff to get a clear understanding of the complexities of
Jamaica's onshore and offshore areas. The studies were found by the Bank and PCJ
to be of the highest technical and scientific caliber.

3.11    On June 2, 1983 PCJ signed an agreement with an American firm for the
conduct of a Marine Hydrocarbon Profiling System using "Sniffer" -a technique
which detects hydrocarbon gases seeping from the sea floor-, over sections of
the Pedro Bank and South Coast of Jamaica. The purpose was to locate areas of
high or anomalous hydrocarbon concentration which would indicate the presence of
petroleum in the subsurface. The survey took place in late July 1983 and
consisted of about 2,500 line-kilometers of continuous measurements over an area
located offshore southern Jamaica. The recorded data were processed and
interpreted by the contractor. The results indicated no areas of significant
concentration of seafloor hydrocarbons in the samples taken. Results were
totally negative. No major problems were encountered during the survey.
Technical Assistance
3.12    Loan funds were used to pay overseas training courses of PCJ employeea,
expenses of employees who were attached to overseas companies for on-the-job
training, and consultants were hired to conduct training courses in Jamaica. A
training component, either by secondment or hands-on experience during
particular exercises, was also part of each consultant's work program. These
training programs assisted PCJ in developing its manpower requirements for the
oil and gas exploration program.
3.13    The Petroleum Products Pricing Policy Study was undertaken by a German
firm. The Study presents some important recommendations on the measures needed
to create a more competitive market on the haulage ana distribution of petroleum
products. At the time of this report no action has been taken to implement the
consultant's recommendations.
3.14   Due to the availability of more attractive financing (2z IDB loan) PCJ
decided to acquire only a small quantity of the initially included laboratory
equipment with World Bank loan funds under this component.

Waste Oil Recovery Study
3.15   PCJ decided to utilise a liquid/liquid extraction process under an
agreamnt with an American firm who provided PCJ with a detailed design of a
pilot plant. The plant with a capability of 5 gpm was installed a*s the
refinery. Due to the aforementioned agreement, it was not necessary to
undertake a feasibility study of alternative processes. This component of the
project was considered completed and the Bank agreed with PCJ's proposal that
the US$ 150,000 allocated to this Study be reallocated to the Technical
Assistance component, to finance further consulting services for Institutional
development.
On-shore Seismic Survey
3.16   Approximately 500 line kilometers of seismic geophysical data were
acquired in eight selected areas of Jamaica during a survey conducted by an
American consultant in 1985. The Government of Norway, under a grant of 9
millon Norwegian kroners to the Government of Jamaica, funded the conduct of
this survey in the first four areas that were selected. After a careful
analysis of the work produced, the Bank approved PCJ's request to use US$ 1.0
million from the loan funds to extend the survey for an additional three months
using the origlinl Norwegian contractor. Only some US$ 0.8 million were used.
The purpose of this extension was to develop further oil prospecting sites for a
possible drilling program, end to optimize the presence of the contractor in
Jamaica, and further utilize a low cost contract fee. The survey va
satisfactorily completed. The Interpretation was contracted and financed by the
Canadian Government from a grant to Jamaica for petroleum exploration. The
survey identified some attractive prospective structures which PCJ may wish to
develop further, and eventually drill in another phase of onshore exploration.
3.17   The data acquired were of good quality and showed to PCJ that a seismic
survey is the most cost effective and reliable means of obtaining satisfactory
sub-surface geological data from several areas of Jamaica.
3.18   On the basis of the results of the geophysical surveys conducted on the
New Bank area and on the Pedro Bank area, the results of the geochemical survey,
and the overall geological end geophysical interpretation of these areas, it
appeared that two prospects, one in each area, had good hydrocarbon trapping
characteristics from the geophysical-geological point of view. With the purpose
of attracting private industry participation for the drilling of these
prospects, PCJ made a presentation on the project to the oil industry in
Houston, Texas in early 1984. Initial interest was shown by some international
oil companies. However, no significant commitment of funds for participation in
the drilling or exploration of the Jamaican prospects materialized. In view of
this discouraging response, as well as the negative results of the marine
geochemical "sniffer' survey, PCJ decided not to try to reactivate offshore
explorat.on during 1985. The plan was to wait until the market conditions
changed sufficiently to once more motivate the oil tompanies to look at higher-
risk areas like Jamaica and at the same time refocus its exploration strategy in
the best onshore prospect in the hope that 6 discovery onshore would rekindle
International interest in the offshore.



IV. PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENT
4.1    A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in Table 2.
The final cost of the project was US$ 3,780,645.68 or 55? below appraisal
estimate. The last disbursement was made in January 1986. The significant
underrun was due mainly to the elimination of the P-ophysical survey from Bank
financing with no immediate cost to Jamaica.
4.2    The allocation of funds was revised once, as shown in Table 1, in order
to assign the funds from the Oil Recovery Study to Consultant Services.
4.3    The negative outcome in exploration slowed down disbursements as
decisions were made for alternative uses of funds. By January 1986 only about
502 of the loan was disbursed. At that point decision to cancel the balance was
agreed between the Bank and PCJ.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1    PCJ has exercised prudent financial management. It has allowed a margin
of profit in its operations which has made it a financially strong entity.
Comparison of actual and planned financial results are shown in Tables 4,5 and
6. They indicate that, although the Corporation did not meet its profit
projectiona over the period, it operated profitably and maintained its financial
strength. The major factor affecting PCJ's performance over the period was the
successive dev luation of the Jamaican dollar, which moved from US$1 = JA$1.78
in 1982 to US$1   JA$5.50 at December 31, 1985, as shown in Table 3.  This had a
significant adverse impact on the crude oil prices faced by Jamaica and on PCJ's
debts.
5.2    The Borrower's compliance with the loan covenants was in general
satisfactory, although PCJ's current ratio did not reach the expected level of
2:1 to be complied with under the Loan. However, it always remained above one,
indicating its ability to meet current obligations. In 1982 and 1983 these
ratios deteriorated as a consequence of the purchase of the Kingston refinery in
October 1982. The purchase was financed by a short-term loan guaranteed by the
Government of Jamaica and was repaid in full by 1984. By 1985 PCJ reflected a
sizeable net working capital position. PCJ is now quite liquid with almost all
its current assets accounted for by cash, short-term deposits and accounts
receivable.
5.3    The debt/equity ratio of PCJ moved from 0.2 in 1981 to 1.54 in 1985.
This rise is largely attributable to devaluation the Jamaican dollar. PCJ was
unable to reduce its foreign exchange debts and it was not allowed to hold
assets in foreign currency. The Government did not contribute to the capital of
the company, so all of PCJ's equity derives from accumulated revenue reserves
held in local currency
5.4    Except for 1982 which saw an expenditure of almost US$ 14 miilion for oil
exploration and development, PCJ's operation were profitable. Net profit margin
and retu.rn on assets have declined based on changes in the oil market. As the
price of crude oil moved upwards, greater pressure was exerted on earnings.



- 8 -
5.5    ICJ generated sufficient funds internally to finance its growth. Major
vuss of-funds were investment in fixed assets, in exploration, and In other
projects. There were increases in Working Capital each year except in 1982 when
significant expenditure on oil ezploration proj-ets occurred.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1    PCJ, with a dynamic management and a body of well qualified professional
staff, Is one of the most effective organizations in the country. At the
Government's request, PCJ has progressively diversified its functions outside
petroleum, including development and implementation of power projects.
6.2    PCJ carried out its project supervision responsibilities in a
satisfactory manner, made timely and economic decisions concerning the hiring of
consultants and using the proceeds of the loan. However, it lacked some
effectiveness in attracting private investors and commercial banks.
VII* ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
7.1    Unfortunately, no commercial hydrocarbon discovery was made under the
exploration component of the Project that would relieve Jamaica from the burden
of petroleum Imports. The main benefit to Jamica arising from this loan is the
imroved knwledge of the country's sedimentary basins, and the probabilities of
future eploration efforts. The benefit from the seismic survey is that the
Information obtained puts the Government in a stronger position to negotiate
eploration contracts with private investors.
7.2    The technical assistance component helped PCJ to strengthen
Institutionally and In developing and training its manpower for oil and gas
eploration.
7.3    Because this is an Engineering and Technical Assistance project, no
Economic Rate of Return was calculated either at appraisal or ex-post*
VIII* BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1    The Bank contributed significantly during project identification and
preparation by interpreting the Borrower's priorities based on the results of an
analysis of the oil needs and cost to the country; and based on a positive
assesment of the hydrocarbon potential in Jmaica. The project was timely and
well selected,  ince it represented a high priority concern of the Governmen. at
the tim.
8.2    The Bank had a close relationship with PCJ during the conduct of
operations under the loan. The Bank offered valuable technical and financial
advice, and the response to PCJ's requests, as demanded by the operations, was
always prompt. Such was the case with the extension of the contract to the
consortium doing offshore exploratory drilling in Block C. Acknowledgment of
this attitude was given to the Bank -by the Borrower.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND P"ErCMNDATIONS
9.1     Although Jamaica's oil exploration efforts have not been successful and
the result of dry holes as well as the geologic complexities of the country have
not produced any evidence of hydrocarbons, the project was successful in
significantly increasing knowledge of the prospectivity of the Pedro Beak area
offshore and of northern and western parts of onshore Jmaica.
9.2     The geological snd geophysical studies that were conductecd undor the
loan made a significant contribution to the development of PCJ's data base and
the evaluation of the areas studied. PCJ is now able to identify the most
prospective offshore areas and in another phase of offshore exploration,
mphasi  and effort would be placed on these aroas.
9.3      PCJ was not very effective in attracting private capital investment in
oil eploration and financing by conaercial banks to complement grants from
other governments. After analytical research and reevaluation of existing data
are carried out as planned by PCJ, additional xploratory drilling should be
undertaken by the private sector alone or by private sector risk participation.
A more aggressive and informative approach should be planned.
9.4      The training programs assisted PCJ in developing its manpower
requircaents for oil and gas exploration and helped its institutional
strengthening. The substantial know-how transfer that resulted from the
technical assistance demonstrates that the success of this type of exercise is
critically dependent upon the establishment of a working relationship between
expatriates and their local counterparts that require the latter to be active
participants in achieving the objectives.
9.5      It is PCJ's view that the complex geology of the offshore shelves
warrants additional investigation. The Bank agrees that additional detailed
studies of the offshore would throw further light on the proepective areas,
particularly the offshore prospects, by undertaking the following:
(a)     structural defirition of reef margin lead in the Negril area at
the west of Jamaica;
(b)     further definition of source rocks and reservoir rock
development in greater Jamaica and the area's tectonic activity and its
Impact on the hydrocarbon prospects; and
(c)     a detailed stratigraphic and faces analysis of all the
recognized sedimentary formations including bio-stratigraphy,
geochemical and lithologic analysis.
New seismic surveys and further interpretation of existing data for the
offshore should not be undertaken.
9.6     Since no significant oil reserves were proven and the crude oil prices
have continued declining after the loan was closed, no offshore drilling has
been really justified during this period.
