GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to finance
part of the costs of developing a large rubber estate near Grand Bereby in
the sparsely populated and undeveloDed southwest of the country. The prin-
cipal objectives of the project are to increase and further diversify agri-
cultural production and exports, and to establish a focus of development in
the hinterland of the new port of San Pedro.
ii.       The project comprises the first phase of development, 1972 through
1979, of a 13,500 ha rubber estate. In this first phase all 13,500 ha would
be planted but another 5 years would be required until all the rubber came
into production. Full development would be completed in 1988 with the final
expansion of processing facilities to meet project production needs. Fonds
Europeen de Developpement (FED) and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econ-
omique (CCCE) of France have agreed with Government to participate in project
financing. The project would entail the seventh loan made by the Bank for
agriculture in the Ivory Coast. Five loans are for oil palm and coconut de-
velopment, these projects are proceeding most satisfactorily and on schedule
although disbursements have been slow. The sixth loan is for cocoa produc-
tion; this project has got off to a slow start but is now improving.
iii.      The Grand Bereby estate would be owned by SOCATCI (Societe des
Caoutchoucs de Cote d'Ivoire). SOCATCI would be a state-owned company
charged with industrial rubber development in the Ivory Coast. SOCATCI
would sign a technical assistance and management contract with Michelin,
the French rubber manufacturer, to manage the project wlhich would be
SOCATCI's sole operation at present.
iv.       Estimated project costs from 1972 through 1979 total CFAF 6,758
million (US$29.1 million). The foreign exchange component is CFAF 3,220
million (US$13.9 million) or 48%. Interest paid during the development
period would amount to CFAF 922 million (US$4.0 million). A financing plan
has been agreed and under this co-lenders and Government would contribute
25% each of total project requirements, including interest during the de-
velopment period. A Bank loan of US$8.3 million is proposed. The estate
would not be developed completely until 1988 although after 1985 self-
generated funds would be sufficient to meet investment costs. In the
interim period 1980-1985 additional funds of CFAF 4,650 million (US$20.0
million) would be required to complete project development. The strength
of the economy of the Ivory Coast is such that the Government is likely to
be able to obtain these funds.
v.        The Bank loan would be made to SOCATCI.  FED and CCCE have agreed
that all procurement would be through international competitive bidding in
accordance witlh Bank guidelines. Disbursements of FED, CCCE, and Bank loans



- ii -
would be pari passu against all project development expenditures. It is
estimated that the value of goods and services procured through international
competitive bidding would have a value of about US$6.0 million. This amount
is comparatively small and reflects the large component of project costs that
comprise labor and management.
vi.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 13.2%.  In a sense this
is a "regional" rate of return since about 80% of project employees are ex-
pected to come from Mali and Upper Volta, countries with poor development and
employment prospects, and a shadow rate has been used in assessing the oppor-
tunity cost of this labor. Costing labor fully, the rate of return is esti-
mated at 11.5%. Net foreign exchange benefits over the life of the project
are estimated at US$330 million. The project would employ about 4,500 work-
ers, representing as many as 15,000 people in all. Workers would receive
average annual incomes of about CFAF 116,000 (US$500) per annum, more than
twice those they might expect in the Upper Volta and Mali; per capita incomes
of project families would average about US$165 compared with an average per
capita GDP of US$342 and an average rural per capita income of about US$120
in the Ivory Coast.
vii..     Some land clearing and other preliminary work was undertaken in
1971, financed by a grant from FAC. In order to avoid further delay in
starting the program, Government agreed to finance 1972 operations until
financing by co-lenders would be forthcoming, but requested that these
expenditures be included in project costs. FED and CCCE have agreed to the
retroactive financing of payments made after June 30, 1972. It is proposed
that the Bank would participate in such retroactive financing provided that
expenditures and procurement are made in line with agreed procedures. Proj-
ect cost estimates include anticipated 1972 Government expenditures on the
project.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.3 million.  The
Bank loan would be made to SOCATCI; would be disbursed during the period
1973-1979; and would be repaid over 20 years from 1983.



IVORY COAST
GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to finance
part of the costs of developing a large rubber estate near Grand Bereby in
the sparsely populated and undeveloped southwest of the country. The prin-
cipal objectives of the project are to increase and further diversify agri-
cultural production and exports, and to establish a focus of development in
the hinterland of the new port of San Pedro.
1.02      The project covering the 1972-79 period, comprises the first phase
of a three-phase development program ending in 1988. During the second phase,
from 1980 through 1985, 13,500 ha of rubber planted during the first phase
would be brought into production and processing facilities would be estab-
lished. For this phase outside financing is contemplated, but not yet deter-
mined. During the third phase (1985-88) additional processing facilities
would be constructed, financed from self-generated ftmds. Fonds Europeen
de Developpement (FED) and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE) have agreed with Government to participate in project financing.
1.03      The Program was prepared by the Compagnie Generale des Etablisse-
ments Michelin (Michelin) of France, assisted by Institut de Recherches pour
le Caoutchouc en Afrique (IRCA) and by the Bank's Permanent Mission to West
Africa (PMWA). This report is based upon the findings of a Bank mission
which visited the Ivory Coast in October/November 1971, and whose members
were Messrs. Losson, Elz and Tillier, Palein (P1WA) and Durand (consultant);
Messrs Schott and Suratgar were with the mission part time. The mission
worked closely with FED and CCCFE evaluation teams which visited the country
at the same time.
1.04      The Bank has made six loans for agricultural development in Ivory
Coast.  Three totalling US$17.1 million in 1969, and another two totalling
US$7.0 million in 1971 are for oil palm and coconut development, and one of
US$7.5 million in 1970 is for smallholder cocoa production.  The latter proj-
ect ran into initial difficulties, essentially administrative in nature, and
as a result the 1971 development program fell short of targets.  The project
is now on-course and progress is satisfactory.  The oil palm and coconut proj-
ects have proceeded most satisfactorily. Disbursements of all six Bank loans
have been much slower than estimated, principally because of the availability
in the Ivory Coast of cheaper short-term funds, the slow start of the cocoa
project, and because high palm produce prices provided the entities carrying
out the oil palm and coconut projects with very favorable cash flow positions.
When the last two oil palm and coconut loans were negotiated in 1971, agree-
ment was reached between the Bank and the borrowers on a schedule for claims
for reimbursement that would speed up the disbursement of loan funds. While
the 1971 international currency crisis delayed implementation of this agree-
ment the pace of disbursement has since quickened. Details of the projects
and their progress are at Annex 1.

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Ivory Coast has a regular topography rising gradually from the
Atlantic in the south to about 500 m in the north. The country is divided
broadly into two ecological zones. Bordering the sea is a tropical rain
forest zone suited in particular for the cultivation of tropical tree crops
- cocoa, coffee, rubber, coconuts and oil palms. To the north, the forest
gradually diminishes and is replaced by savannah; here cropping patterns
are based on such crops as maize, rice, cassava, sorghum and various beans
and peas. Trypanomasiasis is endemic throughout the country and generally
livestock production is limited to poultry and goats, a few of which are
maintained by most farm families. Manufacturing is of growing importance
in the environs of Abidjan the capital, but the economy is dominated by
agriculture.
2.02      Population in 1971 was estimated at 5.3 million including about 1.0
million non-lvorian Africans (mostly Voltaics and Malians) and 40,000 non-
Africans. The yearly growth rate is 3.5% of which about 0.7% is from immi-
gration. Overall population density is 16/km2 but variations are wide. The
southwest, site of the proposed project, with an average of 4/km2 has the
lowest density of any region (see Map 1), One of Government's policies is
to achieve a more equal distribution of population through regional develop-
ment programs.
2.03      GDP amounted to CFAF 405 billion (US$1.746 million) in 1971 of
which agriculture accounted for 28%. During its first decade of independence
(1960-1970) Ivory Coast experienced an average annual economic growth rate of
7.5% in real terms - one of the highest in the world. In the same period aver-
age per capita GDP grew from about CFAF 30,700 (US$132) to CFAF 79,300 (US$342).
A rough estimate indicates rural per capita income, including the value of
subsistence production at CFAF 28,000 (US$120) in 1969. However, annual
rates of growth have fluctuated widely from year to year, usually in close
relation to fluctuations in export earnings, which account for about 34% of
GDP. In 1970 exports were valued at CFAF 138 billion (US$595 million) and
three commodities - coffee (33%), timber (23%) and cocoa (21%) accounted for
75% of the value of total exports. To a large extent fluctuations in GDP
result from dependence on these three products. Government's major agricul-
tural policy objectives are to increase agricultural output in general, to
become self-sufficient in food production except for livestock, to reduce
disparities in regional income distribution by emphasizing development in
the less developed regions, particularly the north and southwest, and to
achieve a broader mix of agricultural ex-ort crops through diversification
into oil palm, coconuts, cotton and rubber. Expansion of production of the
first three crops is already well underway, and the proposed project would
be the first step in accelerating the growth of rubber production.



-3-
B. The Rubber Sector
2.04      Rubber production on any scale started in 1962 when plantings made
in 1955 first came into bearing. The total planted area has grown at a modest
rate, reaching about 13,000 ha in 1971. Of this, 10,500 ha were in produc-
tion in 1971 although only a small proportion had reached peak yield. Some
100 ha are smallholder plantings, and the remainder comprises three estates.
A French company owns and operates 3,200 ha, Government in partnership
(55:45) with another French company 8,200 ha, and Government itself 1,800 ha
(see Map 2). Total production amounted to 10,750 tons in 1970, all was ex-
ported and accounted for less than 0.5% of world natural rubber production.
The industry is well advanced technologically since it has taken advantage
of the experience gained in other producing countries and is supported by
effective research.
2.05      Rubber research is carried out by IRCA, a French non-profit insti-
tution sponsored by the French Government. Its main station is in the Ivory
Coast where the local costs of its operations are financed jointly by the
Ivory Coast Government and France. IRCA's principle activities in the Ivory
Coast have been the selection of high yielding plant material, trials concern-
ing fertilizer and other production techniques, and advising Government on
rubber development. IRCA operates also in Cameroon and carries out consul-
tancy work in several other African countries.
2.06      Government Rubber development plans involve:  (a) the establishment
of about 700 ha of smallholder rubber in association with IRCA and the
Anguededou estate, and (b) planting of 2,500 ha at Bongo estate in the south-
east, and development of two large estates in the southwest. Of the latter,
one is the proposed Grand Bereby project - subject of this report; the other
is a development to be sponsored by the Goodyear Company in the Lower Cavally
area. This latter project could amount to about 15,000 ha, some of which may
be smallholder operated. If the planned rubber development program is com-
pleted in full it would increase the country's rubber area to about 45,000 ha
by 1980. This area would have an annual production potential of nearly
100,000 tons by the turn of the century although by 1985 production would
amount to only about 20,000 tons most of which would be exported. This ton-
nage would represent less than one percent of projected world natural rubber
exports for that year.
2.07      Preliminary work on the Grand Bereby project was carried out by
Societe d'Etat pour le Developpement et l'Exploitation de l'Hevea (SODHEVEA),
a Government controlled company which has since been dissolved. A new Gov-
ernment controlled corporation has been created to own and operate the proj-
ect. The new corporation has been named Societe des Caoutchoucs de Cote
d'Ivoire and in this report is referred to as SOCATCI. Further details of
SOCATCI are in Chapter V and at Annex 2.

III. THE PROJECT
A. The Project Area
Physical Characteristics
3.01      The project area lies about 15 km west of the coastal town of
Grand Bereby and about 60 km southwest of San Pedro, a recently completed
deep sea port (see Map 1). A detailed topographic and soil survey has iden-
tified and mapped 15,000 ha of land suitable for rubber lying about 50
meters above sea level on free draining light to medium sandy soils. Na-
tural vegetation is tropical rain forest. The forest contains few large
trees since it has been logged-over in the past. Soils are acid and have
rather low available phosphorus and potash contents - deficiencies which
will need to be corrected with fertilizers during the establishment period.
Rainfall is well distributed and averages about 2,300 mm, ranging between
2,000 mm and 2,500 mm annually. Dry months are January and February when
precipitation is about 30% of the monthly average. Temperatures average
about 26C, and the range is small. Winds of an intensity to cause sig-
nificant damage to rubber tress are rarely experienced.
3.02      In general, climatic and soil conditions are very favorable for
rubber production and at least equal to those of the major rubber producing
countries of the Far East. A disadvantage is the topography of the estate
site which is broken up by low lying swampy areas. However, this should be
only a minor constraint.
Communications and Utilities
3.03      A good unpaved road connects the estate site with the small town
of Grand Bereby. The site is linked with San Pedro, from which the rubber
would be shipped, by about 60 km of unpaved road which needs minor improve-
ment, particularly the section between the Nero and Dodo rivers. The costs
for such improvement works are not included in project costs. The proposed
work forms part of Government's infrastructure development plans which were
drawn-up before the project was identified. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that Government would undertake all necessary repairs and
improvements. Government plans to build a road to link Grand Bereby with
Tabou in the southwestern corner of the country. This road would traverse
the estate site providing additional communication facilities. The road is
part of the general development program for the southwest, but its financing
has not yet been secured. The site is not served by power, telephone, or
water utilities, and self-contained facilities would be installed under the
project.
Land Tenure
3.04      The site is Government owned.  During negotiations assurances were
obtained from Government that all facilities and title to or rights in re-
spect of land required for the carrying out and operating of the project
wo.ld be promptly provided to SOCATCI.



-5-
Labor and Social Services
3.05      Labor is virtually non-existent in the project area, a typical sit-
uation in the sparsely populated southwest. Labor for the estate would have
to be recruited from outside the region. Some 4,500 laborers would be re-
quired, and including family members for many of these a minimum of 15,000
people would have to move into the area. It is estimated that about 80% of
the work force would be immigrant labor mainly from Upper Volta and Mali.
Experience elsewhere in the Ivory Coast indicates that the native Ivorian
prefers to work his own farm or to become an urban dweller rather than to
take paid employment on estates. So far the recruitment of foreign labor
has not been a constraint on large scale plantation development (SODEPALM
has successfuly established 40,000 ha of estate oil palms under this sys-
tem); and such labor is commonly used on Ivorian owned small plantations
and farms. There is therefore no reason to believe that labor recruitment
would be a problem for the SOCATCI rubber estate. Mali and Upper Volta will
derive major benefits from the project since the immigrant labor would remit
part of their wages to their families at home, and the exodus would assist
areas where many people are forced to live at almost sub-subsistence levels.
Estimates indicate that in 1969 about 800,000 persons from neighboring African
countries were employed in the Ivory Coast, and that gross private transfers
from this work force amounted to about US$26 million. Such labor is readily
assimilated in the Ivory Coast and many workers eventually settle down to
farm land on their own account.
3.06      The social infrastructure of the project area is inadequate to ac-
commodate SOCATCI workers and their families. Consequently, labor housing,
villages, schools, and a small hospital would be constructed under the proj-
ect. Serious medical cases would be able to receive treatment at San Pedro.
3.07      Workers on the estate would receive the official minimum wage to-
gether with incentive payments. The minimum wage is CFAF 198/day (USJ 85),
but skilled workers especially rubber tappers, would earn CFAF 252/day
(US$1.09) plus a premium on the quantity and quality of rubber they collect,
see Annex 3.
B. Project Description
3.08      The project comprises the first phase of establishing a 13,500 ha
rubber estate astride the Dodo River near Grand Bereby. It would involve
clearing and planting with rubber some 13,500 ha of forest land, the instal-
lation of power and water; construction of roads, staff and labor housing,
stores, workshops and offices; and provision of health and educational fa-
cilities. The project would be carried out in the 8 year period, 1972-1979,
but progress would be reviewed by the colenders at the end of 1975 at which
time between 4,500 and 5,000 and 5,000 ha would have been planted or prepared
for planting (see para. 8.02). It would be owned and operated by SOCATCI a
government corporation which would employ Michelin, a French rubber growing
and manufacturing company to manage the project. For organizational details
see Chapter V.



- 6 -
3.09      Further phases of development would be as follows:  the period
1980 through 1985 in which earlier plantings would come into production and
processing facilities would be constructed. During this phase self-generated
funds would be inadequate to meet costs and additional loan or equity capital
would be required. In the final phase, post 1985 all planting would be in
production and the factory would be completed. In this phase, estate gen-
erated revenues would be sufficient to cover operating costs and debt serv-
ice. After 1987, revenues would be sufficient to cover debt service and
permit the generation of surpluses. Financial results are discussed in
Chapter VI.
C. The Planting Program
3.10      Land would be cleared one year in advance of planting.  Plantings
would start in 1973 and be finished in 1979 in line with the following sched-
ule. Further details are at Annex 4.
Land Cleared and Planted
Hectares   1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   Total
Cleared     600  1,200  1,800  2,400  3,600  3,600  3,000    -    16,200
Planted      -      500    750  1,250  2,000  3,000  3,000  3,000  13,500
The 2,700 ha that would be cleared but not planted are necessary for roads,
housing sites and boundaries.
3.11      In view of the labor shortage in the project area and the lack of
labor specialized in large scale clearing of forest by hand, the land wo,uld
be cleared mechanically on force account. Clearing would be by heavy crawler
tractors fitted with land clearing equipment. This method has been used suc-
cessfully in the Ivory Coast for large scale land clearing.  The same tr actors
would be used for road construction and other civil works, thus ensuring their
economic utilization.
3.12      Following clearing and burning operations, planting lines - each
about 2 m wide and 8 m apart - would be cleared of logs, stumps and other
debris by a combination of hand and machine work. Following this, a ripper
would be used to cut a furrow 100 cm deep along the center of the planting
line. The rubber plants would be set out in the trench 2.1 m apart providing
for an initial stand of 595 plants/ha.
3.13      Planting material would be produced by the estate which would es-
tablish its first nurseries and budwood gardens in 1972 (see Annex 4). No
problems are expected in obtaining adequate supplies of rubber and cover
crop seed and of budwood. These are available at IRCA and other rubber



-7-
estates in Ivory Coast. Six clones 1/ would be used to plant the estate -
GT1 (25%), PR 107 (25%), PB 86 (15%), RRIM 600 (13%), AV 2037 (12%) and
PB 5/51 (10%). In the first three years of planting clone GT 1 would be
used almost exclusively in order to take advantage of the precocity of this
clone. In Ivory Coast, GT 1 comes into bearing at the end of the fifth year
after planting compared with at the end of the sixth year for most clones.
3.14      In order to extend the period of the year in which planting would
be made, three types of planting material would be used. Budded stumps
grown in plastic bags (polybags) and planted out with a ball of earth and
thus less susceptible to planting shock, 18 months old budded stumps which
would be set out with bare roots and which would be planted only at the
optimum time, and germinated seeds which would be planted on site in the
field and budded when the seedlings had reached 8-10 months of age.
3.15      Following planting of the rubber and cover crop, further operations
would be the maintenance of the plantings - by hand weeding and slashing and
chemical herbicides, and the thinning out of the plantings. Each site would
be planted with two budded plants, the worst of which would be removed within
the first year. This selection process should guarantee a full initial stand
of 595 of well growm and high yielding plants per ha. It is estimated that
by the time plantings come into bearing natural losses and further thinning
out would have reduced the stand to about 450 plants/ha. Further details of
the agricultural techniques that would be practiced are at Annex 5.
D. Utilities, Housing and Infrastructure
3.16      Construction of a central village would start in early 1973 and
provide accommodation for managerial staff and labor. Offices and stores
would be built at this location together with two schools and the project
hospital. Development of the central village would continue through 1979
in line with the increase in staff and labor numbers (see Annex 6). Rubber
processing facilities would be sited eventually close to the central village.
3.17      The central village would be equipped with a treated water supply
using the Dodo River as a source, an electricity generating plant, and radio-
telephone. In 1975 development of the first of 16 satellite villages would
start and proceed through 1979. The satellite villages would use wells for
their water supply, and would not be supplied with electricity. Details of
village development are at Annex 6.
1/   A clone is a group of plants with an identical genetic makeup.  It is
propagated by grafting buds from trees of proven yield and quality
characteristics onto young seedling plants. The graft is made about
3 cm above ground level. When the top of the seedling is cut off at
about 5 cm above the bud graft, the bud begins to sprout. It then
grows into a tree with the same characteristics of all members of
the clone.



3.18      About 300 km of plantation roads would be built in the period
1972-79, with the first 14 km being constructed in 1972. The road construc-
tion program is at Annex 4. Since the roads would not bear heavy traffic
until the rubber comes into production, they would be lightly constructed
initially and improved as traffic warranted. Provision for such improvement
is made in project cost estimates.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
4.01      Project costs from 1972 through 1979, are estimated to total CFAF
6,758 million (US$29.1 million) with a foreign exchange element of CFAF 3,220
million (US$13.9 million) or 48%. Interest paid during the development period
would amount to CFAF 922 million (US$4.0 million).
4.02      The development program would not be completed physically until
1988 and between 1980 and 1988 would require a further investment of CFAF 4,511
million (US$19.4 million). Thus total costs of bringing the 13,500 ha estate
into production would be CFAF 11,270 million (US$48.6 million).
4.03      Project costs (1972-79) are detailed in Annex 7 and summarized in
the following table:

4.04      Project costs are based on recent experience in the Ivory Coast.
They exclude import duties, and value added and other taxes on imports. It
is the usual procedure in Ivory Coast for Government to waive these taxes.
Confirmation that project imports would be free of such taxes were obtained
during negotiations, and also that export taxes on project produced rubber
would be waived duiring the full development period 1972-1988. Project costs
include a physical contingency equivalent to 5% of estimated costs in each
year, and a contingency of 5% compounded annually on both local and foreign
costs to cover price escalation. Over the past ten years price escalation
in the Ivory Coast has averaged about 3.5% annually.
A.  Proposed Financing
Project Development Period 1972-79
4.05      Three financial institutions, in addition to Government, would be
involved in financing the project. The Bank, Fonds Europeen de Developpement
(FED) lending through Banque Europeenne d'Investissements (BEI) and Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France lending through Banque
Nationale de Developpement Agricole (BNDA) an Ivorian institution. A finan-
cing plan has been agreed. Under this plan, each of the four institutions
would finance as closely as possible the equivalent of 25% of total project
requirements including interest during the development period, 1972-79. The
interest rates on the loans would be: Bank 7-1/4%, FED 1/2%, CCCE 4-1/2%.
Each institution and Government would provide funds in an amount of CFAF
1,920 million (US$8.3 million). Government's contribution would be made
in equity from its development budget and the Budget Special d'Investissement
et d'Equipement (BSIE). Conditions of effectiveness would be that: an equity
contribution of CFAF 250 million has been paid; that the SOCATCI authorized
capital has been increased to CFAF 1,950 million; and that SOCATCI's Board of
Directors has called for the paying in of the unpaid equity in accordance with
a schedule acceptable to the Bank. To ensure that adequate working capital
would be available assurances were obtained from Government during negotia-
tions that SOCATCI's cash and bank balances including undrawn bank overdraft
facilities would at all times be not less than US$1 million (about CFAF 232
million at the current exchange rate), or sufficient to cover the next six
months debt service, whichever is higher, and that any interest and other
charges due would be borne by Government. The proposed financing plan is sum-
marized below:

CCCE 4.5%                        1,920             8.27              25
FED 1/2%                          1,920            8.27              25
Total              5,760           24.81              75
Total Share Capital and Loans    7,680             33.08             100
In addition to the foregoing financial requirements Government would need to
provide working capital to bridge gaps between actual expenditures and sub-
sequent reimbursement by the co-lenders and to cover operating expenses prior
to sales of produce. Some CFAF 760 million (US$3.3 million) is assumed to
be required for this purpose in the seven year period 1972 through 1979.
This would be recovered from self-generated funds post 1979 and would be
fully recovered in 1986. Further details of the proposed financing arrange-
ments are at Annex 8, Table 1.
4.06      It is proposed that a Bank loan of US$8.3 million be made to SOCATCI
for a term of 30 years including a grace period of 10 years for principal.
These are the minimum terms justified by the project cash flow, see Annex 8.
The CCCE and FED loans would be on similar terms. Government's contribution
including that applied to interest charges, would be in the form of equity in
SOCATCI (see para 4.05).
Retroactive Financing
4.07      The Bank and co-lenders appraised the project in late 1971.  Work
on the project started in 1971 financed by a grant of CEAF 60 million
(US$260,000) provided by Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) of France which
was exhausted at the beginning of 1972. Government has asked that any expen-
ditures that it incurs in addition and prior to signature of the external
loans should be financed retroactively. During negotiations Bank, FED and
CCCE agreed in principle to finance retroactively expenditures incurred after
June 30, 1972 provided that all expenditures were made in line with the re-
quirements discussed in para 4.09.



- 12 -
Completion of Program - 1980-1988
4.08      While both FED and CCCE are sympathetic to participating in finan-
cing completion of the estate post-1979, neitner, like the Bank, can make an
advance commitment. Consequently, during negotiations assurances were ob-
tained from Government that in the period post-1979 it would provide all
finance needed to bring project plantings into production, No maintain these
in production, and to provide adequate processing facilities and managerial
services for the estate as a whole and to cover debt service. SOCATCI would
implement the program subject to review in 1975 (see para. 8.02). The first
plantings of rubber would come into production in 1979, but until 1985 funds
self-generated by rubber sales would be inadequate to fully meet additional
investment costs, operating costs and debt service on the Bank, FED and
CCCE loans. Thus, between 1980 and 1985 a further capital inflow of CFAF
4,650 million (US20.0 million) would be required for project development.
Economic progress in tie Ivory Coast is such that obtaining funds of this
magnitude should be feasible.  Post-1985 self-generated funds would be ade-
quate to meet all expenses and debt service.  Estimated finarcial statements,
balance sheets, and cash flows for SOCATCI are at Annex 8 and are discussed
in Chapter VI.
B. Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      All procurement would be through international competitive bidding
under the Bank's guidelines except for individual contracts not exceeding
CFAF 12 million (US$52,000) which would be let locally under competitive
bidding procedures that would be agreed with the Bank. Goods and services
so procured and largely machinery, vehicles, equipment and fertilizers are
estimated to cost US$6.1 million'. This amount is comparatively small and
reflects the large component of project costs that comprises labor and man-
agement. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. Dis-
bursemernt of Bank, FED and CCCE loans would be pari ssu and in line with
the respective financing shares of each institution. Disbursements would
be against contracts, completion certificates and other documents certified
by SOCATCI. Control would be made by the local FED controller who would ap-
prove documents presented by SOCATCI on behalf of the three lending institu-
tions before disbursement.
C. Accounts and Audit
4.10      SOCATCI would maintain project accounts, which would be audited
by the Government Audit Department and by commercial auditors. Such an ar-
rangement is practised by the oil and coconut palm development companies
financed by the Bank in the Ivory Coast. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that a firm satisfactory to the Bank would be employed to
audit SOCATCI accounts, that the form of audit would be agreed with the
Bank, and that such audited accounts would be made available to the Bank
within four months of the close of each financial year. SOCATCI's finan-
cial vear would be January 1 to December 31.



- 13 -
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Societe des Caoutchoucs de Cote d'Ivoire (SOCATCI)
5.01      SOCATCI, a state corporation (Societe d'Etat), which was formed on
January 12, 1973 (decree 73-12) with an initial subscribed capital of CFAF
30 million, is governed by its statutes and by State Corporation Law No. 70-633
of November 5, 1970, The initial subscribed capital is to be increased by
CFAF 250 million to CFAF 280 million and the authorized capital to CFAF 1950
million (see para 4.05). SOCATCI's main objects are the creation and exploi-
tation of industrial rubber estates in the Ivory Coast and all related commer-
cial, industrial and financial operations. Its Board would have ten members,
two from the National Assembly, one from the Conseil Economique et Social, one
from the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs, one from the Ministry of
Planning, two from the Ministry of Agriculture, one from the Ministry of
Scientific Research, one from the Authority for Southwest Development (ARSO),
and a representative of one of the leading rubber producers.
5.02      SOCATCI would be managed by a Director General and a technical
deputy director whose experience and qualifications would be satisfactory to
the Bank. During negotiations assurances were obtained to this effect. The
Director General would delegate a substantial part of his powers to the es-
tate management (see para. 5.03). Government control would be assured by a
State Controller designated by the Minister of Economics and Financial Affairs
and by a Government Commissioner appointed by the Minister of Agriculture.
These officials would have the right to attend Board meetings with powers
similar to those of Board members. Under Law No. 70-633, Government retains
the power to fix salaries and conditions of service of personnel employed by
State Corporations including controlling the hiring and firing of such per-
sonnel. However, in this respect the SOCATCI statutes permit the corporation
to operate on the same basis as a private company. Further details of SOCATCI
including the opening balance sheet are given in Annex 2.
B. Estate Management
5.03      The estate would be managed by a Project Manager, who would be
responsible to the SOCATCI Board. Under the management contract the Project
Manager would have full autonomy in dav-to-day operations and in the appoint-
ment and dismissal of all project staff. SOCATCI through its General Manager
and Board would exercise control by retaining responsibility for approval of
annual budgets; long term and annual development plans; project accounts and
approval of certain personnel. The Board would be kept informed of project
developments through monthly progress reports and financial statements sub-
mitted by the Project Manager. Details of the responsibilities of SOCATCI
staff are at Annex 9.



- 14 -
5.04      Personnel sufficiently experienced to manage and staff the project
are not available in the Ivory Coast where rubber cultivation was started
only recently and is still on a relatively small scale. To overcome this
problem, and also to ensure the technical and administrative back-up re-
quired for the project, SOCATCI would enter into a technical assistance
and management contract with Michelin. Under the contract, Michelin would
provide five people, including the Project Manager and Administrative Manager
and in addition, inspection from Michelin headquarters and technical and
managerial know-how. Further details and a draft form of contract are at
Annex 10. Under the contract, Michelin remuneration is based on the salaries
of staff provided by Michelin, a fee for each hectare planted, and a small
annual lump sum. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Govern-
ment that at all times the post of Project Manager would be occupied by a
person whose qualifications and experience were satisfactory to the Bank and
that SOCATCI would consult with the Bank prior to appointing persons to the
posts of Administrative Manager, Technical Manager, Agricultural Field Manager
and Chief Agronomist.
5.05      Below the project manager and his headquarters staff, the unit
would be divided into four departments. Administration, in charge of ac-
counting and administration (see organization chart); technical, which
would manage and maintain all mechanical equipment, buildings, and at a
later stage, the factory; and agricultural, responsible for the planning
and execution of land clearing and establishing and maintaining the rubber
plantings and an Agronomic Department incharge of all research including
topography and pedology. The agricultural department would be organized
into 7 sectors (cantons) each under a chief and which eventually would com-
prise about 2,000 ha of rubber and employ 600-800 workers. The sectors would
be subdivided into 2-3 divisions comprising about 800 ha of rubber and 200
workers.
C. Staff, Labor and Training
5.06      Project staffing schedules, together with job descriptions are at
Annex 9. Supervisory staff would increase from 12 in 1973 to 38 by 1979.
Professional and experienced staff likely to be supplied from outside the
Ivory Coast (including those supplied by Michelin) would increase to 23 by
1977 and thereafter decline gradually. In the analysis of the project, it
is assumed that 4 expatriates would be retained until 1992. Ivorian staff
would initally fill division chief posts, for which they would receive on-
the-job training, and thereafter graduate to more senior positions. This
would require a sustained training effort which could be only of the on-the-
job type, the system practised by all successful plantation companies. No
problem is anticipated in recruiting Ivorians to fill division chief posts.
In view of the importance of ensuring that Ivorianization proceeds at a
satisfactory pace and in line with the increase in their expertise, assur-
ances were obtained from Government during negotiations that a schedule of
Ivorianization would be reviewed and agreed upon with the Bank not later than
December 31, 1975.



- 15 -
5.07      The number of junior staff and workers would increase from about
350 in 1973 to about 4,500 in 1988. Apart from clerical staff, most of the
work force would receive on-the-job training. Experience in the Ivory Coast
is that Voltaics and Malians are adaptable to plantation work, and that they
can be trained to be excellent tappers, the most important workers on a rubber
estate. Tappers would be organized in teams of 16, each worker tapping 800
trees daily and using the polybag system. This would be equivalent to one
tapper per 5 ha.
5.08      The estate would provide and pay a doctor and assistants for the
project medical services. Teachers for the project schools would be pro-
vided by the Ministry of Education; assurances to this effect and that the
Ministry would pay such teachers were obtained during negotiations.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RETURNS
A. Yields and Production
6.01      Project yield estimates are based on actual results obtained in
the Ivory Coast and other countries from plantings of the clones that would
be used by SOCATCI. A project yield and production schedule is at Annex 11,
Table 1, and actual clone performance data at Table 3. At peak yields dur-
ing the 1990's yearlv output is estimated at about 30,000 tons.
6.02      Yields are estimated to increase gradually from 1,000 kg/ha in
the first year of tapping (year 6) to 2,300 kg/ha after 10 years; to remain
at the latter level for a further 8 years; and thereafter to decline to
2,000 kg/ha by the end of the tapping period (year 34). The estimated
yields are high by present day standards but should be achieved given the
technology that would be employed and the management that would be assured
through the technical assistance and management agreement with Michelin.
B. Marketing and Prices
6.03      It is assumed that project production would be exported as block
rubber. Block rubber has the advantage that its technical qualities can be
specified accurately; because of this it is in demand by manufacturers.
Other types of rubber could also be prciuced but a decision on this would
be taken at a later stage in project development when market demand for
special types of rubber could be evaluated better. A final decision would
not be needed until 1978.
6.04      Michelin has agreed to purchase all project produced rubber offered
by SOCATCI on the basis of a draft contract which form part of the management
contract and at a price in line with future world prices but with a guaranteed
minimum. The sales agreement would be renegotiable every two years. A con-
tract of this type would be of value to SOCATCI although it would not be



- 16 -
essential for the disposal of project production in view of the anticipated
world growth in demand for natural rubber. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that the Bank would be given the opportunity to comment by a
date not later than December 31, 1977 on any marketing agreement with Michelin
or other entity prior to its conclusion.
6.05      Annex 12, which was prepared by the Bank's Economics Department,
analyses the world market supply and demand for rubber. It concludes that
over the next eight years actual rubber prices will begin to rise from their
early 1972 depressed levels of about US$16/lb cif New York for RSS 1 (the
current price is about USi 24/lb cif) reflecting the impact of inflation
on the costs of producing synthetic rubber, especially those of new synthetic
plants, energy, raw materials and labor, and a generally more buoyant market
demand. Synthetic rubber is directly competitive with natural rubber for the
bulk of uses and consequently for all practical purposes the price of natural
rubber would move in sympathy with the price of synthetic rubber. The analysis
predicts that by 1980 (when project rubber is first produced) the price of
natural rubber, cif New York should be about US4 19/lb which corresponds to
a price of USJ 17/lb in constant 1972 dollars. This latter price is used
in calculation of the project's economic rate of return. These rubber prices
are before the 1973 devaluation of the US dollar and it is assumed that the
projected prices will be increased proportionately. Annex 13 gives details
of the transportation and marketing margins between ex-factory Grand Bereby
and cif prices.
C. Financial Results
6.06      A project cash flow is at Annex 8, Table 1.  Costs up to 1980
include an annual 5% physical contingency, plus a 5% compounded price con-
tingency on investment costs, and a 2% compounded price contingency on op-
erating costs. Beyond 1980 costs and benefits are expressed in terms of
1980) prices (thus investment costs are 55% higher than 1972 prices, and
production costs 20% higher).  The cash flow assumes that Government would
subscribe additional share capital and that further loan funds would be
obtained to meet project development costs between 1980 and 1935 totalling
CFAF 4,650 million (TJS$20.0 million). The cash flow shows that annual
operating surpluses (after loan interest and repayment costs and provision
for working cipital) before tax or dividend distribution would arise first in
1985 and amotnt to CFAF 60.9 million (US$263,000).  This surplus would increase
to about CFAF 1.3 billion (US$5.6 million) in 1996 subject to debt service on
loans negotiated after 1979 to complete the program when production reaches
its maximum. Surpluses would further increase to ye:Ir 2004 reflecting comple-
tion of loan repayments, thereafter declining witir production. Over the life
of the project surpluses would be more than sufficient to permit the replant-
ing of the estate if conditions so warranted.
6-7       The financial rate of return is estimated at 7.7', and the return
on Covernment equity contributions at 12.4% taking into account not only SOCATCI
suroluses bult also direct taxation revenues, see Annex 8, Table 2.

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed project would have a substantial impact on the agri-
cultural development of the Ivory Coast, particularly that of the southwestern
region. One of the major objectives of the national development plan is the
further diversification of agricultural exports which are now heavily concen-
trated in lumber, coffee and cocoa. Export expansion of lumber faces natural
production constraints especially the limited size of the forest estate and
the long graoth cycle of tropical hardwoods. Coffee exports are limited by
quota, and cocoa production is being expn-1e-i as fast as is prudent in the
light of the relatively inelastic future world demand. Production of the
country's other export crops - oil palm products, coconuts, pineapples and
other fruits also is being expanded. Natural rubber, for which the market
is expanding, albeit at low prices, offers one of the few opportunities for
the further large scale diversification of exports.
7.02      The economic rate of return of the project over its 41-year life is
estimated at 13.2%. Details of the analysis are at Annex 14. Major assump-
tions employed include (a) the rubber price discussed at para 6.05 and the
yields at para 6.02; (b) exclusioni from the cost stream of the construction
costs of schools and hospitals on the grounds that these would have been in-
curred anyway and the benefits of these at least equal their costs; (c) ex-
clusion from the cost stream of 50% of labor housing cost since they would
have been incurred anyway and because project housing would be at least 50%
superior to the housing which the labor force would enjoy without the project
and these additional benefits are also excluded: (d) a shadow rate of
exchange for the CFAF; and (e) a shadow wage rate equivalent to
50% of the cash wage rate; this has been used on the basis that 80% of the
labor force comes from neighboring countries where the opportunity cost of
labor is at least 50% below wage rates assumed for the project.  Consequently,
the rate of return of 13.2% is a "regional" rate of return. The "region"
being Ivory Coast, Mali and Upper Volta all of which countries would benefit
from the project. Seen in a country context, a shadow wage rate possibly
should not be used since the opportunity cost of labor probably is close to
the going wage rate. If full wage rates are used, the economic rate of return
would be 11.5%.
7.03      At peak production, the project would generate about CFAF 2.9
billion (USS12.5 million) annually in net foreign exchange earnings.
7.04      The project would have a number of substantial secondary benefits.
It would contribute to the opening of the southwest through the establish-
ment of a focus of development and have a large employment effect. About
4,500 workers( As many as 15,000 people in all including family members,
would be affected) would gain direct employment; and rough calculations
indicate that about another 1,500 farm families would benefit from produc-
ing the 2,000 ha of grain, 500 ha of root crops, 500 cattle, 1,000 sheep
and goats, and 150,000 poultry needed annually to supply the basic food
requirements of project employees and their dependents.



- 18 -
.05~    4Workers on the estate would receive satisfactory wages.  The aver-
age aanual wage of a laborer (at 1971 prices) would be about CFAF 116,000
(USS500) and the per capita income of project families about US$165. Tnis
is somewhat above rural per capita income in the Ivory Coast (including sub-
sistence) which was estimated at CFAF 28,000 (US$120) in 1969; it is much
higher than rural per capita income in Upper Volta and Mlali, US$40 and US$50
respectively: but well below the per capita average income of the Ivory Coast
population as a whole of about US$340.
7.06      Project employees would pay income taxes estimated at about CFAF 105
million annually (US$450,000). There are no statistics on indirect taxes, such
as sales tax, but a rough estimate suggests that these taxes would generate
annual Covernment revenues of about CFAF 240 million (US$1.0 million).
Sensitivity Analysis
7.07      The economic rate of return analysis is based on a number of assump-
tions concerning shadow rates for foreign exchange, wages, and housing con-
struction costs. If the analysis were based on the current rate of exchange,
full wage rates, and full construction costs, the economic rate of return
would be 10.42.
7.08      As the period before significant benefits accrue from the project
is long, it is necessary to examine the risks involved and the sensitivity
of the rate of return to changes in costs and benefits. The major concern
is whether the projected rubber price will materialize. It appears highly
unlikely that the market for natural rubber will disappear during the life
of the project (rubber, whether natural or synthetic, has qualities that are
not likely to be challenged by other materials for the purposes for which it
is now used); on the other hand, there is a possibility that a break through
in synthetic rubber production technology could cause natural rubber prices
to fall below those forecasts. Wnile it is difficult to conceive a signif-
icant decline in the cost of producing synthetic rubber in view of rising
costs of labor, energy and raw materials, the rate of return has been tested
for its sensitivity to changes in rubber prices as well as in costs. Thus
if rubber prices were to fall 10%, 20%, and 30% below those now predicted
the rate of return would fall to 12%, 10.7% and 9.2% respectively. If in
addition to a fall in benefits of 10%, costs were to rise by 10%, the rate
of return would fall to about 11.0%. Conversely, an increase in price by
10% would raise the rate of return to 14.4%.
7.09      The possibility that planting would be terminated at an earlier
stage than contemplated should also be considered (see para 8.03). This
situation would arise if in the next two or three years either costs or
anticipated rubber prices were to prove to be, or to be forecast, so far
above or below estimated levels to seriously impair the economic and finan-
cial viability of the project.  The same situation would arise in the unlikely
eveat that physical constrainL7- uch as limitations in labor supply would make
completion of the full project impossible. The impact of terminating the



- 19 -
planting program at 5,000 ha has been tested. In case physical constraints
were the sole cause of termination, the rate of return would be between 5%
and 6% reflecting the loss of economies of scale. These eventualities are,
however, regarded as most unlikely.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACTIED AND RECONEENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiation, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a) Government would undertake all necessary repairs and improve-
ments of the San Pedro-Grand Bereby road (para 3.03);
(b) SOCATCI would receive title to or such rights in the land for
the estate site as would be necessary for execution of the
project (para 3.04);
(c) SOCATCI would be exempted from paying export duties on rubber
through 1988 and import duties and taxes during the project
development period (para 4.04);
(d)  SOCATCI cash and bank balances including undrawn bank over-
draft facilities would at all times be not less than US$1
million or sufficient to cover the next six months debt
service, whichever is higher, and that any interest and
other charges due would be born by Government (para 4.05);
(e) In the period post-1979 SOCATCI would implement and Govern-
ment would finance an agreed program to bring project plant-
ing into production, to maintain these in production, and to
provide adequate processing facilities and managerial services
for the estate as a whole (para 4.08);
(f) All procurement except for individual contracts not exceeding
CFAF 12 million (US$50,000) would be by international compe-
titive bidding and local competitive bidding procedures would
be agreed with the Bank (para 4.09);
(g)  A firm satisfactory to the Bank would be employed to audit
SOCATCI accounts, that the form of audit would be agreed
with the Bank and that audited accounts would be submitted
to the Bank within five months of the close of each finan-
cial year (para 4.10);
(h) SOCATCI would appoint a Director General and a technical
deputy to the Director General whose experience and qualifica-
tions would be satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.02);



- 20 -
(i) At all times the post of Project Manager would be occupied
by a person whose qualifications and experience were satis-
factory to the Bank, and that SOCATCI would consult with the
Bank prior to appointing persons to the posts of Financial
Controller, Technical Manager, Agricultural Field Manager
and Chief Agronomist (para 5.04);
(j) A schedule of Ivorianization would be agreed upon and re-
viewed with the Bank not later than December 31, 1975
(para 5.06);
(k) The Ministry of Education would provide teachers to staff
project schools and would pay such teachers (para 5.08); and
(1) The Bank would be given the opportunity to comment by a date
not later than December 31, 1977 prior to the conclusion of
any marketing agreement with Michelin or other entity (para
6.04).
8.02      In view of the high cost of developing the 13,500 ha project to
maturity it would be essential that in the event of circumstances occurring
in the development period likely to jeopardize the economic and financial
viability of that project that planting should be terminated. It has thus
been agreed with the co-lenders that, in addition to routine supervision a
reappraisal of the project should take place by the end of 1975 at which time
between 4,500 and 5,000 ha would have been planted or prepared for planting.
The three co-financers and Government will take part in the reappraisal, and
it has been agreed with SOCATCI that if circumstances so warrant project
planting would be terminated at 5,000 ha. Available funds would be deployed
to bring the plantings already made into production. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from SOCATCI that it would accept the findings of
such a reappraisal and implement the recommendations made.
8.03      Conditions of effectiveness would be that the initial subscribed
capital of CFAF 30 million has been increased by CFAF 250 million to CFAF
280 million; that SOCATCI has authorized the capital has been increased to
CFAF 1,950 million; and that the SOCATCI Board of Directors has called for
the paying in of the unpaid equity in accordance with a schedule acceptable
to the Bank (para 4.05).
8.04      With the foregoing assurances and arrangements the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.3 million repayable over 30 years after
ten years of grace for principal.

GRA4D BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
PROGRESS OF PROJECTS FINANCED BY LOANS IVC-611, 612, 613, 686, 759 AND 760
A.   Loan 611-IVC - Palmivoire US$3.3 Mlillion Equivalent
The project consists of establishing and bringing into production
4,000 ha of oil palms at Ehania estate and to complete an estate of 10,000 ha
oil palms. The loan became effective on December 30, 1969. Planting was
completed in 1972 and plantation maintenance is satisfactory. Planting costs
have been slightly lower than estimated at the time of appraisal.
B. Loan 612-IVC - Palmindustrie US$4.3 Million Equivalent
The project comprises the construction of a palm oil mill to service
the 10,000 ha Ehania estate and some outgrowers. The loan became effective
on December 30, 1969. The mill has been constructed with a capacity of 40
tons/hour ffb and the final planned capacity is 60 tons/hour. The mill is
functioning satisfactorily and costs were within appraisal estimates.
C. Loan 613-IVC - Sodepalm US$9.0 Million Equivalent
The project consists of the establishment and bringing into produc-
tion of 12,000 ha of outgrower oil palms, the establishment and maintenance
until 1974 of 3,500 ha of estate coconuts and 3,000 ha of outgrower coconuts,
the provision of credit and supervisory services for oil palm and coconut
outgrowers and the necessary infrastructure associated with the 3,500 ha
of estate coconuts. The loan became effective on December 30, 1969. Project
oil palm estate plantings were due to be completed in 1971. Due to shortage
of planting material because of disease, the Bank agreed to extend the planting
period to 1972. All estate plantings have now been completed. At the request
of the Borrower, the Bank also agreed to extend the outgrower program planting
period, initially scheduled to be conpleted in 1970, to 1972 to permit more
rigorous selection of outgrowers.
The above three loans were being disbursed very slowly until 1972
principally because the sub-borrowers had cheaper sources of funds available
to them in the Ivory Coast in the form of low interest short-term credits.
On the other hand, in the physical sense, the projects are proceeding well.
Recently agreement has been reached with the company that the disbursement
of these loans would be accelerated and they are now generally in line with
appraisal estimates.



ANNEX 1

D.   Loan 686-IVC - Cocoa Project US$7.5 Million Equivalent
The project consists of the planting of 18,800 ha of cocoa and
the rehabilitation of about 38,000 ha existing cocoa plantation. Due to
management problems, only 6,250 ha of new cocoa was planted in 1971 and 1972,
instead of 8,600 ha. Revised development schedules have been agreed and fol-
lowed and while the new planting target remains unchanged, it has been pro-
posed that the rehabilitation program should be reduced to 15,500 ha together
with a reallocation of loan proceeds. Disbursements have been slow US$718,000
at January 31, 1973, because of both the availability in the Ivory Coast of
cheaper short-term funds, and problems in preparing reimbursement claims.
E.   Loans 759-IVC and 760-IVC US$7.0 Million Equivalent
The project consists of (a) planting 4,500 ha outgrower oil palms,
(b) 4,500 ha of outgrower coconut palms, (c) 8,000 ha of coconut palms on
Government-owned estates, and (d) construction of a palm oil mill. The project
is proceeding satisfactorily and on schedule. The loans became effective on
November 15, 1972.

GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
Societe des Caoutchoucs de Cote d'Ivoire (SOCATCI)
Constitution and Financing Arrangements
The Societe des caoutchoucs de Cote d'Ivoire (SOCATCI), a 100%
Government-owned state corporation, was created by decree No. 73-12 of January
12, 1973. The initial capital of CFAF 30 million (US$130,000) was subscribed
by Budget special d'investissement et d'equipement (BSIE) but conditions of
effectiveness are that the subscribed capital be increased by CFAF 250 million
(US$1.0 million) to CFAF 280 million (US$1.2 million) and that the Board of
Directors has authorized the capital to be increased to CFAF 1,950 million in
accordance with a schedule acceptable to the Bank.
Board and Administration
The objects of SOCATCI are the creation and operation of industrial
rubber estates in the Ivory Coast and all related commercial, industrial and
financial operations.
The Board of Directors consists of ten members representing:
National Assembly                    2
Economic and Social Council          1
Minister of Economy and Finance    1
Minister of Planning                 1
Minister of Agriculture              2
Minister of Scientific Research    1
Authority for Southwest Area
Development (ARSO)                  1
Another rubber producer's rep-
resentative on designation of the
Minister of Agriculture              1
10
The appointment of the Chairman and Board members is made in
accordance with Article 4 of decree 72-08 of January 11, 1972. All Board
members would be appointed for three years on a renewable basis. The rules
of procedure of the Board and any amendments thereof must be approved by not
less than two-thirds of the Board members. A quorum would be constituted
when two thirds of the Board members are present. SOCATCI headquarters would
be located in Abidjan. SOCATCI would be managed by a Director General and a



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Technical deputy Director who would be able to transfer appropriate powers
to the project managers. For the time being the Grand Bereby estate would
be SOCATCI's sole operation.
Government Control
According to Law No. 70-633 of November 5, 1970 and to decree No.
70-08 of January 11, 1972, the control of the state would be assured by:
a)   a state controller designated by the Minister of Economics
and Financial Affairs, and
b)   a Government Commissioner appointed by the Minister of
Agriculture.
Both of these officials would have the right to attend Board meetings and
would have powers similar to those of Board members.

IVORY COAST
GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
Responsibilities and Duties of Project Personnel
1.        The professional staff of the project would consist of the SATAC
(Michelin) team, other expatriates and Ivorian professionals. The non-
professional labor force would be sector (canton) chiefs, division chiefs
and skilled and unskilled labor. Selection of members of the Michelin team
would be made by SATAC and subject to the approval of SOCATCI's Director
General, and in the case of the Project Manager, that of the Bank. SOCATCI
and SATAC would also consult with the Bank on the appointment of persons to
the posts of financial controller (administrative manager) technical manager,
agricultural field manager and chief agronomist. Other expatriate and Ivorian
professionals would be selected by the Project Manager. If SOCATCI, on the
basis of the work performance of an individual, had reason to doubt the
ability of any member of the SATAC team it would be entitled to ask the
Project Manager, in writing, for the individual's dismissal. If the Project
Manager did not concur, an arbitration committee consisting of SOCATCI's
Director General and deputy for teclnical matters, Project Manager and two
other persons respectively designated by the Minister of Agriculture and by
Michelin, would make the final decision.
2.        The Project Manager would be in full charge of the project unit
and have overall responsibility for all aspects of the project, particularly
with respect to personnel policy such as recruitment and dismissal of staff
(see above) and for the determination of wages and other compensation. The
Project Manager would report directly to the "Directeur General" of SOCATCI.
Re would establish a plan for Ivorianization of project staff and would conduct
appropriate training programs as outlined in the provisional technical assist-
ance and management contract at Annex 10.
3.        The technical manager would head the technical department of the
project. His main responsibilities would be to manage and maintain mechanical
equipment, processing facilities, vehicles, workshops and stores and implement
the building construction program.
4.        The agricultural field manager would head the agricultural services
department and be charged with carrying out all agricultural works such as
land clearing, nurseries, planting, fertilizer programs and other rubber
cultivation and harvesting operations. Included in his work assignment would
be the maintenance of yield and production records. The chief agronomist
would be in charge of all experimental work.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
5.        Up to 35 other expatriates would be required during the project.
They would include an accountant, a medical doctor, two mechanical engineers,
a building engineer, six sector (canton) chiefs and seven division chiefs.
These people would work under the supervision of the three department heads
as indicated in the organization chart.
6.        Ivorian professional staff would fill mainly division chief and
assistant mechanical engineer and storekeeper posts. Eventually they would
be expected to advance and to fill canton chief and other more senior positions.
Annex 9 indicates the expected growth of Ivorianization. Sector or canton
chiefs would be responsible to the agricultural field manager, and each would
eventually be in charge of the work of 600-800 workers engaged on about 2,000
ha rubber. Each canton would comprise 3-4 divisions each under a chief re-
sponsible for 700-800 ha of rubber.

processing methods and preparation of the rubber for marketing, but also
of its experience as a world user continually informed regarding the techni-
cal quality standards to be met by the product, and in addition of the
full range of its experience regarding the organization and preparation of
the work, and in general of all its processes, patents, technital know-
how, methods and inventions relating to hevea cultivation and collection
of the latex;

of hevea cultivation and processing of natural rubber for industrial use,
and that the company desires to provide the requested assistance and to put
its experience and knowledge in this field into practical application in
Ivory Coast;
- That the parties are agreed in considering, in the spirit of the Protocol
signed on November 10, 1971, by the Ministers of Agriculture, Finance and
Planning and by MICHELIN, that the assistance in question can only be
furnished under three separate contracts, namely:
(a) a contract for the provision of know-how,
(b) a contract for the establishment and management of the pro-
ject, and
(c) a marketing contract,
the three contracts being closely interconnected and constituting one single
Agreement.

IVORY COAST
GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE
Notes on the Annexes to the Technical Assistance
and Management Contract between SATAC,
Michelin and SOCATCI
1.        Annex I to the SATAC Technical Assistance and Management contract
details technical data on which the project calculations were made, the plant-
ing methods to be used, and detailed cost tables of various operations. It
comprises:
a)   the detailed project description, land clearing and planting
program, infrastructure and construction program and provision
for the factory;
b)   project cost;
c)   technical support and relations with IRCA (Institut de recherche
sur le caoutchouc en Afrique);
d)   tables and provision for future tapping systems and technical
data on clones to be planted on the grand Bereby estate;
e)   reporting procedures and proposed pattern of inspection reports.
2.        Annex II to the contract deals with marketing arrangements including
the procedure for monthly price determination; the principle for establishing
a guaranteed floor price to be agreed for two-year periods and the rebates
when prices exceed agreed floor prices; and determination of the annual quan-
tity of rubber that Grand Bereby estate wishes to sell to Michelin. If unanti-
cipated circumstances occur which would jeopardize the agreement both parties
would meet to amend the contract as necessary.
3.        As no substantial quantities of rubber would be produced before the
1980's this agreement is, in effect, an undertaking by Michelin to buy, at
SOCATCI's request, any amount of rubber produced on the Grand Bereby estate,
without a corresponding obligation to SOCATCI to sell rubber to Michelin and
at a floor price initially to be set at US4 17/lb for two-year periods but
renegotiable if there are major long-term changes in the market. The contract
would be valid only so long as Michelin continues to manage the plantation.

1/ About 161 tons are projected to be produced in 1978 but the projection
is too uncertain to be included in the income analysis. It is estimated
that 70% of the 450 trees would be tapped in year 6.
2/ Of which 90% would be tapped.
3/  Refer to 1972 planting as an examiple.

NATURAL RUBBER: TRENDS AND OITLOOK
1.        Natural rubber is among the most important primary commodities
exported by the developing countries. Its production, of which only small
amounts are consumed in producing countries, is highly concentrated in
Southeast Asia. Mrore than 90 percent of natural rubber exports originate
in four Asian countries - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Ceylon: the
first two alone account for about three quarters of the total trade.  The
rest is supplied by some fifteen countries in Asia and Africa, of which
India, Liberia, Nigeria, Khmer Republic and Zaire are significant producers.
(See Table 1.)
2.        The bulk of natural rubber is used in the manufacture of tires
and other automobile parts. Other uses include surgical appliances,
household goods and toys. Demand for these goods has expanded quite rapidly
in the postwar period, averaging 7% per annum, but the supply of natural
rubber expanded only at ar average annual rate of 2.6%. The deficiency
in the elastomer supplv was met by the development of synthetic rubbers,
of which the most widely used are styrene-butadiene, poly-butadiene and
poly-isoprene rubbers. Over the years the producers of synthetic rubbers
have not only improved their quality, but have also succeeded in reducing
their costs of production, and as such have come to actively comnete with
(and sometimes even displace) natural rubber.
3.        The tardy expansion in natural rubber suDplies relative to the
total elastomer supply has naturally led to a decline in the share of the
former in the market. In countries other than those conventionally classed
as centrally planned, this share has declined from 65% in 1950-52 to
around 32% in recent years. In the UJnited States, which is foremost in
the research in and production of synthetic rubber, the share has dropped
to 23%, while in most other consuming countries it ranges from 35 to 45%.
Some researchers in the field believe that about a quarter of the elastomer
demand, under the existing technology, is specific to natural rubber, but
there is a wide difference of opinion in this respect.
4.        Natural rubber is particularly threatened by the expansion of
production of poly-isoprene, which is so far the closest (still not a
perfect) synthetic analogue to the natural product. It is generally
believed that poly-isoprene could stuccessfully replace natural rubber under
the existing conditions in the remaining uses, provided it could be produced
more cheaply, and/or the price of RSSI variety of natural rubber were to
exceed 20 1/ cents per pound. While the search for a more economic process

devaluation.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
for producing poly-isoprene goes on in the developed and centrally planned
countries, the natural rubber supplies are expected to increase at a
particularly fast rate and it is itnlikely that the long-run price of natutral
rubber would exceed that limit in the current decade.
5.        It will be seen from Table 2 that, disregarding enornous vearlv
fluctuations, the price of natural rubber has shown a declining trend.  'I'he
price hlas been particularly low in recent years, reaching a level. of 18
cents per pound (RSS1, New York) in 1971 as compared to 26 cents in 1969.
The price in recent months has centered around 17 cents, but this low
level is more due to short-run economic factors (e.g., economic recessions,
uncertainty about the U.S. dollar, etc.) than due to the long-run nmarket
forces.
6.        With the development of high yielding clones, the productivity
of rubber lands has been enormously increased. Recent researches in Malaysia
promise yields of 3,000-4,000 pounds per acre (withl a possibility of even
reaching 6,000 pounds eventually) as against the ctirrent average of 1,200
pounds in that country. Under current ctultural practices, yields of up
to 2,000 pounds are fairly common in lands planted with the new material.
Thus it is replantin,- old rubber lands with the high yielding clones that
promises a much more rapid expansion in rubber supplies.1/
7.        The yields of the existing crop of trees can also be increased
by the use of yield stimulants.  Of these Ethrel 2/ is particularly important.
Extensive experiments have been carried out at the Pubber Research Institute
of Nlalaya and elsewhere to test the long-term effects of EFthrel use.  Al-
though there still exists some conflict of opinion ariong the researchers,
there is a fair degree of consensus that in the short run the use of Ethrel
will have far-reaching implications from the point of view of rubber
output and the tappers' productivity.  Recent experiments lhave shown that
yields can be increased by 40-100%, particularly if the chemical is
applied to older but wqell-looked after trees. In addition, it may make
natural rubber supply more responsive to the short-run market forces,
and hence may reduce the extent of price fluctuations.  However, on the
negative side, while Ethrel has the advantage of easy application to the
tree, its cost to the farmer, estimated at about US$13 per acre, is
regarded as rather high for its extensive use by smallholders.

Market Outlook
8.        Table 3 gives the probable course of natural rubber supply and
elastomer demand in the current decade. As a result of extensive replanting
and new planting of rubber areas with the new high yielding clonal material
rubber output has expanded much more rapidly in the last few years than
in the 1950-65 period. OutDut of natural rubber increased from 2.4 million
metric tons during 1964-66 to 2.6 million tons in 1968 and 2.9 million tons
in the following two years. This rate of expansion is expected to he further
stepped up in the next few years, wqhen, according to the estimates prepared
by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSC), output would reach 3.9
aillion tons in 1975 and 4.8 million tons in 1980. These estimates exclude
the possible effect of an extensive use of Ethrel, which, if successfully
applied, would probably add another 100,000 tons and 500,000 tons respectively
to the supply in the two benchmark years.
9.        The growth in elastomer demand in the cutrrent decade has been
estimated on the basis of growth of the industrial activity in the OECD
countries. It has been observed that the growth of industrial output and
the growth of elastomer consumption in major consuming countries, as well
as for the world as a whole, are very closely associated. This is
explained by the fact that the single most important source of demand for
elastomers is the automobile and other transport-related industry, which
in turn is highly correlated with the growth of industrial output.
10.       The results of a regression on 1951-69 data showed that 98%
of the variation in elastomer consumption outside the centrally planned
countries was explained by the growth in Industrial production and that,
on an average, 1% increase in industrial production was associated with
1.13% increase in the demand for elastomers. Similar relationships have
been observed to hold also for certain individual consuming countries, such
as the United States, the EEC and Japan.
11.       The estimates of elastomer demand in 1975 and 1980 in Table 3
are based on the above-observed relationship between the growth in rubber
consumption and industrial output. On the basis of projections of the
GNP and industrial output in OECD countries, world consumption of elastomers
outside the centrally planned countries is expected to reach a level of
9.2 million metric tons per year by 1975, and 12.2 million tons in 1980.
In addition, according to the IRSG, net imports of natural rubber into the
centrally planned countries are projected to reach 800,000 metric tons in
1975 and 1 million tons in 1980.
12.       In view of the very rapid expansion in natural supplies and a
virtually unchanged rate of growtl oE elastomer demand, the declining
trend in the share of natural rubber in the rubber market will be arrested:
the share in recent years has remained arouncr 32', but is expected to rise
to 34% in 1975 and will decline once again to 31% in 1990.  The disposal
of large additional supplies in the market would obviously necessitate



ANNEX 12
Page 4
aaintaining natural rubber prices comnetitive with the prices of svnthletic
substitutes.  Broadly speaking, the rubber market seenms to be characterized
by the following features:
(a) Supply of natural rubber in the short run is quite price
inelastic. Output cannot be expanded significantly because
of the limnits imposed by the existing tree capacity.  On
the other hand, a decline in rubber price does not result
in a significant reduction in output since resources devoted
to rubber production are quite "use-specific" and for most
producers not many alternatives are available. Furthermore,
where producers do have a choice to move to more profitable
pursuits, the decline in supply is compensated for by an
increase from intensive tapping by those producers who lhave
no such alternatives available to them but wish to maintain
their subsistence income from rubber. 1/
(b)  Supply of synthetic rubber is highly price elastic.
Not only are the synthetic producers able to respond
to price signals more quickly, as the gestation period
in the industry is relatively short, but also a fairly
substantial excess capacity usually exists in the synthetic
industry. The normal production level is estimated not
to exceed 75% of the rated canacity. 2/
(c)  Since almost the entire elastoner demand is in the nature
of derived demand, it is not very price elastic. Leaving
aside speciality rubbers, there does seem to exist a fair
degree of price competitiveness among various types of
rubber, particularly between polyisoprene and natural
rubber, though there is not a general consensus on the
actual area of competition. A change in the price of
natural rubber relative to the prices of such substitutes
as styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR), polybutadiene and
polyisoprene does encourage substitution within certain
limits, but the extent of shift depends also on the length
of time for which the particular trend in the price persists.
Over the long run, the price of natural rubber has to be
such that it competes effectively with the substitutes,
although in the short run it frequently diverges from this
trend.
13.       The implications of these featurEs are that synthetic producers
as a group more readily adjust their supplies to the existing state of
1/  Futr (Jetails, see TPRT up. Cit., Clhaper TT.

ANNEX 12
Page 5
elastomer demand and supply of natural rubber. Natural producers, on the
other hand, manage to dispose of their supplies at a price which is largely
determined by the synthetic producers, although many other factors, such
as market expectations, obviously also influence the state of the market.
According to this model, therefore, the producers of natural rubber
behave as if they were the "price-takers", and it is for this reason that
the price of natural rubber has been projected in this note on the basis
of the expected trends in the costs of production of the main synthetic
substitutes rather than being a result of simple demand and supply forces.
Since data on costs of production are available only in current dollar
termis, an attempt is made to project first the current actual price, and
theni to allow for the possible inflationary effect.
14.       Since the most important single el-ement of cost of production is
the cost of the basic monomer, the synthetic producers have devoted most
of their research efforts to finding means of reducing its cost. This has
been successfully realized in the past and some further decline in this
element of cost is anticipated in the case of the butadiene-based synthetic
rubbers, that is, polybutadiene and SFR. The status of butadiene is
expected to change from being a product primarily produced for synthetic
rubber conversion to a by-product of another major chemical product,
ethylene. Cost reduction in the raw material input of Dolyisoprene, which,
as stated above, is the closest synthetic approximation to natural
rubber and hence competes most directly with it, may also result from
economies of scale in the manufacture of isoprene. The net effect of such
technical ir,mprovements, on the one hand, and the effect of anticipated
inflationary pressures, on the other, is expected to be such that the price
of polybutadiene would decline to around 15 cents per pound and that of
polyisoprene to around 18 cents per pound by 1975. Some cost reduction
is expected to take place also in the case of SBR, but the rate of decline
would be considerably smaller than that recorded in the early sixties.
The price of oil-extended SDR is lilely to be in the neighborhood of 13
cents per pound.
15.       The price of natural rubber in 1975 is expected to lie somewhere
in tlhe middle of the 15-18 cents range, based on the above-mentioned
prospects for polybutadiene and polyisoprene prices. In particular, the
price of polyisoprene will serve as a ceiling, since protracted movements
of natural rubber above that ceiling would lead to an accelerated expansion
of capacity in polyisoprene. The projected price (in current dollars) of
natural rubber is therefore estimated to be around 17 cents (c.i.f. New
York) per pound for RSS1 grade in 1975.
16.       The cost of nroduction of synthetics has so far remained con-
spicuously unaffected by the increases in capital and labor costs as well
as by the recent increase in the petroleum price.  Since labor costs are
a relatively small portion of cost and since substantial excess capacity
in the synthetic industry is known to exist, it is expected that a
mfoderate rate of inflation in developed countries would affect the forecast



ANNEX 12
Page 6
price to a smaller extent thian in the case of manufactured goods generally
which are expected to rise at an annual rate of 2% per annum during much
of the 1970's.
17.       For the period 1975-85 - during which new and replanted natural
rubber installed after 1970 would be maturing - it is assumed that the
price of natural rubber could rise to around 19 cents per potnd, given the
anticipated inflation and technical developments in the field of synthetic
rubber. This price is equivalent to 17 cents per pound 1971 price. 1/ The
current excess capacity in the synthetic industry is likely to be fully
utilized by the mid-seventies, thus necessitating installation of new
plants. Labor costs, although small, are continuously rising and the cost
of fixed capital is also likely to be considerably higher in the future.
In addition, concern with pollution-free plants will also add to the cost
of producing synthetic rubber. Some reduction in cost due to technical
improvements is bound to occur, but on balance the costs are expected to
rise as in the case of other manufactures.
18.       This price forecast could be substantially altered if some way
of producing polyisoprene more cheaply is discovered. Currently, research
efforts are being made by the industry to adjust the petro-chemical
production stream so as to derive isoprene, the major raw material input,
as a by-product. The history of success in solving technological problems
in the butadiene-based rubbers suggests that this aim might be achieved
though for the present no such technical breakthrough is in sight.
Global Implications of the Project
19.       The project in question is the largest rubber project to be
undertaken in Ivory Coast, and is expected to make a substantial addition
to the output of that country.  It would talke Ivory Coast a more prominent
supplier in the world market and would diversify the sources of 'iorld
natural rubber supplies.
2,.       Since planting will be spread over seven years be,inning in 1973,
the full impact of production would bc felt only in the 1990's, when it
will reach a level exceeding 30,000 tons. The addlitional outpult would be
only 1,375 tons in 1990 and 19,325 in 19°5. This increment in output is
unlikely to have a significant effect on the worlc! market during the period
covered by the projections since, according to the International Rubber
Study Group, 4.8 million tons of natural ruhber Would he suppliedI in 1930.
21.       Furthermore, it has been assumed that the forecast price is
insensitive to the amount of natural rubber Droduced but will, be determined
by the cost trends in the synthetic industry. It is therefore not expected

that this project would have any disruptive effects on the world rubber
market. On the contrary, such diversification of sources of supply may
make supply of natural rubber more independent of the localized natural
and political factors, thus making natural rubber supply more stable for
the consumers in the developed countries.

GRAND BEREBY RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
1.        The economic rate of return calculation is expressed in CFAF; how-
ever, since the impact on future rubber prices of the February 1973 UU-$-
devaluation is unknown, an exchange rate of US$1 - 256 (the rate prevailing
before February 1973) has been used where it has been necessary to convert
between the CFAF and US dollar, e.g. in valuing output. The table shows the
calculation of the economic rate of beturn of the project. The following
assumptions have been used in the calculation:
(a)  Prolect Life
The life of the project including clearing, planting and
exploitation is 41 years. Tapping starts in the sixth year
after planting (the seventh year after clearing). It is
assumed that the trees will be tapped for 28 years.
(b) Shadow Price of Foreign ExchanRe
All foreign costs and benefits are shadow priced at a
rate of CFAF 320 - US$1.
Costs are based on recent experience in the Ivory Coast:
i.   Labor:  For labor wages a shadow rate of 50% is as-
sumed. About 80% of the labor force will be re-
cruited from neighbouring countries, mainly Upper
Volta. Most of this labor is only engaged in sub-
sistence agricultural production. The estimated
income (not cash) from this production is calculated
at CFAF 80/day which is about 40% of the minimum
wage for project labor. For the remaining 20% of
the labor force who are Ivorians, full wage costs are
charged and this together with the 40% for Upper Volta
labor amounts to 50% of the labor cost. Thus the
shadow rate of 50% was assumed. This puts the project
ir a regional context. On a country basis, full labor
costs are charged, since the benefits would accrue to
Upper Volta and not the Ivory Coast.
ii.   Marketing costs:   The full costs of moving project-
produced rubber from factory to FOB San Pedro are
taken into account. These costs are shown at Annex 13.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
iiM.   Road construction:  Road construction costs are
charged fully to the project.
iv.   Hospital and schools:  These costs are not charged
to the project since it is assumed that the benefits
from these social provisions are at least equal to
their cost.
v.   Housing:  For labor housing only 50% of the cost is
charged to the project since the opportunity zost of
the present housing of the labor force is only 50%
of that which would be constructed under the project.
For staff housing full construction costs are charged.
(d) Benefits
i.   Yields:are based on experience gained with high yield-
ing plant material in the Ivory Coast and countries
with similar growing conditions.
ii.   Prices:  An FOB price equivalent to a New York cif
price of USJ 19/lb is used. 1/
Ce) Contingencies
Economic costs include a 5% yearly physical contingency through-
out the project life. In the financial analysis a price contin-
gency of 4% compounded annually for the period 1972-80 has been
used resulting in 1980 costs 42% above 1972 costs. For the
period 1980-88 no price contingency is applied, and costs are
kept at constant 1980 prices, i.e. 42% above 1972 costs.
(f) Taxes
The economic rate of return analysis is net of all taxes. The
financial rat? of return analysis excludes import duties and
taxes until 1988 and includes them thereafter. This is in line
with Government practice to grant import tax and duty exemption
during the establishment period. All other taxes during and
after the establishment period are included in the financial
analysis.
1/ This price is before the 1973 devaluation of the US dollar and it is
assumed that the projected price will be increased proportionately.



ANNEX 14
Page 3
(g) Export Duty
An export duty of 4.42 is applied on all rubber exports. In
the economic rate of return analysis, export duty is treated
as a benefit. In the financial rate of return it is assumed
that no export duty would be paid until 1988, but would be
paid thereafter. Government grants private and public in-
vestors exemption from export duties during the establishment
period of an enterprise.
