A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
(i) To mitigate the effect of the economic crisis by:
*  maintaining primary and junior secondary enrollment rates and transition rates from primary to
junior secondary for the poor;
*  preventing quality from deteriorating further by ensuring that schools can meet essential
operational and maintenance costs; and
*  realizing efficiency gains wherever possible.
(ii) To support recovery and return to the medium-term education strategy of:
* improving quality of basic education (grades 1-9); and
* decentralizing educational planning, management and implementation effectively to districts
and below.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 18963-IND   Date of latest CAS discussion: March 9, 1999
The project supports the short-term strategy of reinforcing social safety nets:
* delivering basic education services to the poor by supporting poor students and schools through
a successful back-to-school campaign (para. 36).
It also supports the medium-term:
* emphasizing institutional strengthening in support of human resource development, greater
decentralization of education management and increased autonomy of schools (para. 49); and
* improving basic education quality (para. 49).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy.
Main sector issues
* Effect of the economic crisis on the education sector. The current economic crisis is expected to
have a significant negative impact on education participation by the poor, as well as the ability of schools
in poor areas to operate. Higher food and transport prices coupled with increased unemployment and
under-employment are likely to threaten the living standards of many. Initiatives to ensure that access of
the poor to basic education in the short run is not jeopardized and that quality of basic education does not
suffer even more, are necessary. Past experience in Indonesia (1986) has shown that the combined effects
of reductions in public expenditure on education, increases in school fees, and declines in private incomes
resulted in a decline in school enrollment for the poor at the basic education level (Education in
Indonesia: From Crisis to Recovery, 1998). Recent survey work suggests it is happening again.
* Ineffective institutional arrangements. A major constraint to achieving more and better high-
quality basic education are the current institutional arrangements. The most important constraints are: (i)
the splitting of responsibility for delivery of primary education among various government agencies
which results in a lack of accountability for results; (ii) overly centralized management at the junior
secondary level; (iii) little autonomy for principals and lower level managers and ineffective school
management; (iv) a fragmented and rigid budgetary process; (v) civil service incentive structures that do
not reward good teaching practices and lead to an uneven allocation of teachers in schools; and (vi) little
community involvement partly as a result of crowding out by the public sector. (Education in Indonesia:
From Crisis to Recovery, 1998).

Unsatisfactory quality of basic education. Graduates are leaving basic education with low
numeracy, reading and reasoning skills. In addition to the institutional factors identified above, the
following factors contribute to unsatisfactory student outcomes: (i) a large stock of poorly trained
teachers; (ii) inadequate time-on-task in all grades, but especially in grades 1 and 2; (iii) insufficient
resources, particularly for schools in poor communities and for the large number of private junior
secondary schools; (iv) low levels and quality of textbooks and materials; (v) ineffective curriculum
implementation and lack of student learning assessment tools; (vi) dilapidated and unsafe primary school
buildings; and (vii) insufficient monitoring and evaluation of quality. (Education in Indonesia: From
Crisis to Recovery, 1998).
* Low demand for junior secondary education by the poor and low primary completion rates.
Even before the crisis, primary school completion rates in the project provinces were low (see Annex 4;
Statistical Attachments); they are expected to decline because of the economic crisis . Factors
contributing to low completion rates are late entry and high repetition in the early years. Similarly, junior
secondary net enrollment rates were low (Annex 4) and are particularly low for the bottom income groups
because of high direct costs and indirect costs of schools. Households' uncertainty about the benefits of
junior secondary education in the labor market also reduces participation. In addition, from the public
finance side, there are high resource costs for the government to expand access to junior secondary
schools without private schools continuing to satisfy a large portion of the demand; in addition, there are
also inefficiencies related to teacher allocation and incentives, which make delivery of basic education
more costly than it need be. All these constraints are exacerbated by the current economic crisis.
Government Strategy
The Government of Indonesia's (GOI) objective at the basic education level is to have a system where: (i)
all children successfully complete 9 years of education; (ii) management and delivery for basic education
is in the hands of the local government (Bupati and her/his staff) but with strong monitoring and oversight
by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC); (iii) schools have more autonomy over their budgets
and staff; (iv) teacher allocations and distribution would be more equitable and reflect actual needs,
especially in rural areas, and would be supported by teacher incentives that reward good teaching; (v) an
ongoing in-service teacher training program of high quality is available for all teachers, including those in
religious and private schools, and is strongly linked to the books and educational materials that are used in
the classroom; (vi) a planning process is active based on school mapping; and (vii) parents and
communities actively participate in the schools in their area where they would be responsible for the
maintenance of their schools and would receive adequate rehabilitation funds.
The severity of the economic crisis has slowed down the achievement of these objectives. GOI has
responded by formulating the following "crisis strategy" for the coming 1-3 years:
Crisis Strategy:
* Sustaining investments in basic education and shielding the poor from adverse consequences of
the economic crisis. The Government has launched a five-year national "Back-to-School" program
($390 million) to provide scholarships for the 17% poorest junior secondary school-age children and
school grants to 60% of primary and junior secondary schools serving poor communities starting July
1998. The program is supported from funds provided by the ADB ($86 million) and the Bank ($296
million). This project is expected to contribute $30 million of the World Bank share.
At the same time, GOI has revised the 1998/99 budget (June program) to include significant reallocation
of public spending to basic education. The 1998/99 basic education budget has been preserved in real
terms to 1996/97 levels. A caveat is whether such levels of funding will be actually disbursed.



4
Medium-term Strategy:
D Decentralizing delivery of basic education and enhancing interagency cooperation. GOI's
institutional strategy is to put the responsibility for service delivery closer to the community. This is part
of an overall strategy to decentralize functions of central government, including education, to the district
level. In the districts piloted for the strategy starting in 1997 (through the Daerah Percontohan, DP,
program), offices of line ministries were abolished and staff and resources transferred to the dinas (local
government office). In the case of education, kandep (MOEC office at district) was transformed into
inspection offices called Kantor Inspeksi or Kanin. The responsibility of implementing the basic
education program was given to the Bupati (head of district) or Walikota (city mayor). At the Special
Assembly of Parliament at the end of 1998, a Decree of MPR (RI No. XV/MPR/1998) was issued
delegating wide autonomy to the Regions and paving the way for further steps toward decentralization.
The implementation of this decree is now under further, intensive discussion in Parliament.
* Improving quality. In addition to the provision of free textbooks for all primary and junior
secondary schools and quality improvements, GOI has adopted various policies and implemented
activities for upgrading the quality of its teachers since the mid-i 980s with varying degrees of success:
pre-service training of primary teachers has been increased to a two-year postsecondary diploma (DII)
and junior secondary teachers to a three-year postsecondary diploma (DIII). For junior secondary
teachers, an extensive in-service training program has been implemented with regular training and school
visits by core teachers in each province. For primary schools, several pilots for in-service training are
now in operation (primarily in the Primary Education Quality Improvement Project). GOI has also
piloted some efforts to foster community participation in basic education. These efforts, while producing
some gains, require further improvements and must now be rethought in terms of resource availability in
the coming few years of economic recession.
* Increasing access to junior secondary. In addition to abolishing fees and building additional
schools, GOI's pre-crisis strategy included: (i) providing scholarships to needy students; (ii) expanding
alternative modes of junior secondary education (SMP terbuka and Paket B); and (iii) providing
assistance to private schools in the form of matching grants, teacher secondments, and books and
materials. The pace of the expansion will be slowed down now and resources are instead redirected to
maintain enrollments and transition rates through targeted scholarships.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Of the sector issues discussed in Section 2, the project will address the following to varying degrees and
at different time periods: (i) the adverse impact of the economic crisis on poor households' investment in
education and poor schools' ability to operate; (ii) ineffective and overly-centralized institutional
arrangements; and (iii) unsatisfactory quality of basic education.
A schematic view of the structure of the project is provided in Attachment 1 of Annex 2. Initially, the
project would focus on crisis-relief activities, and gradually phase in the pre-crisis agenda as the
economy recovers. During the first two years, the focus will be on keeping poor children in school and
schools in poor communities operational. Hence, almost all project funds during the initial years would
be allocated to scholarships and school block grants.
At the same time, the crisis should not deflect attention from the medium-term agenda of institutional
reform. In addition to the long-term benefits of these reforms, many do not require large amounts of
resources to implement, hence can be undertaken in this resource-constrained environment. The main
institutional issues addressed by the project are: (i) the splitting of responsibility for delivery of primary
education among various government agencies; (ii) the overly centralized management at the junior
secondary level; (iii) the fragmented budgetary process; and (iv) little community involvement in
education and ineffective school management.

In addition, the issue of inefficient use of resources from the overabundance bof primary school facilities
(due to declining school-age group since the early 1990s) will be addressed through the school
consolidation program required of every project district. Indeed, given the efficiency gains which such
consolidation will achieve, this activity will be included among the priorities at the outset of the project.
Beyond these reforms, additional ones are unlikely since these already constitute significant changes for
the education sector and it is important to focus on their successful implementation before introducing
additional changes.
Quality enhancing activities will be phased in as the economy recovers (expected by the second year of
the project) and as districts show their readiness to implement these more complex and skill-intensive
activities. Only a selection of quality issues will be addressed including: poor training of teachers
(through in-service cluster-based training); poor conditions of primary schools (rehabilitation of schools
by the community); low levels and quality of materials (additional financing and provision); ineffective
school management (selective training of principals and supervisors); problems with appropriate
distribution of teachers (contract teachers and incentives for rural areas, changes in teacher allocation
formula, redeployment of teachers); lack of resources and teacher quality in private schools (through
matching grants and teacher upgrading programs).

The project components are based on district-prepared plans reflecting issues and priorities in the
districts. Even though all provinces in Indonesia will receive crisis-relief interventions, the distribution of
the scholarships and school grants are based on the incidence of poverty in each province and district.
The project will finance crisis-relief interventions in seven provinces (Sulawesi Utara, Sulawesi Tengah,
Sulawesi Selatan, Sulawesi Tenggara, Maluku, Irian Jaya, and Timor Timur). However, institutional and
quality components will be supported in Sulawesi Selatan and Maluku only.

1. Crisis Relief
Poverty rates in the four Sulawesi provinces are below or at the pre-crisis national poverty rate of 11%.
They are significantly higher, however, in Maluku (20%), Irian Jaya (22%), and Timor Timur (32%).
Hence, about 12-14% of Sulawesi junior secondary students will receive scholarships compared to a
national average of 17%. In Maluku, Irian Jaya, and Timor Timur, the respective proportions are 30%,
30%, and 60%. For school grants, a similar above national average allocation is provided in Maluku,
Irian Jaya and East Timur.
2. Institutional Development
The project supports inter-agency district-based planning, management, and implementation of basic
education in order to address the issue of scattered responsibilities and overly centralized operations. At
the district levels, five-year and annual plans are prepared which integrate and coordinate the activities of
MOEC, MORA, BAPPEDA and Dinas P&K. Responsibility for implementing the plans rests with the
Bupati who heads an inter-agency implementing unit which he appoints. The project is funded through
one source of funds only (for more details on institutional arrangements, see Section C.4 below). Below
the districts, the sub-districts are the focal point where location maps of primary and junior secondary
schools are prepared for use in school consolidation and better distribution of teachers. At the school
level, increased resources are provided in the form of block grants to encourage school autonomy
including the functioning of school committees. The latter will particularly be important in selection and
administration of student scholarships and school grants (Component 1). Furthermore, communities will
be responsible for the rehabilitation of primary schools with funds going directly to them. Finally, this
component supports the carrying out of organizational, staffing and other assessments of the capability
and capacity of the different agencies at provincial, district and kecamatan levels to plan, budget and
implement basic education programs. Results of the assessments will be used to determine reallocation of
staff between agencies with a view of strengthening local government agencies (Dinas P&K, BAPPEDA).
3. Quality Improvements
Teacher Training Program. One of the key elements for quality improvement is the in-service teacher
training program. The teacher support system in mainland areas works with the school clusters,
consisting of groups of closely located schools, where regular teacher meetings are held after school
hours, to develop teaching materials, discuss problems, and prepare class activities. This model does not
work well in remote and scarcely populated areas, such as in most of Maluku, or some of the districts in
the mountainous regions of South Sulawesi. A pilot "island training model" is being supported in
Maluku, with teacher tutors visiting island schools, supported with more in-depth teacher training once a
year in the district capital. For private religious schools, most schools do not have qualified teachers, and
the project will support teacher up-grading and certification.
School Consolidation, and Rehabilitation. A primary school rehabilitation program will be supported
which provides funds directly to communities to utilize.
Teacher Deployment. The project will support the provision of approximately 800 contract teachers for
junior secondary schools in remote rural areas. In addition and on a limited basis, incentives such as
teacher housing, relocation costs and other such programs will be supported to relocate teachers to remote
rural areas. At the national level, a Policy Reform Working Group on Teachers will be supported which
will evaluate current teacher workforce issues, including deployment policies and incentives, and propose
alternatives to the current system.



7
Private School Grants. Based on proposals from schools, matching grants will be provided to private
schools for rehabilitation of school buildings, and provision of equipment and furniture.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
* A substantial increase in support to the poor in the community, to ensure enrollment of their children
in basic education. A substantial expansion of the school grants for the poorest schools, where
parental financial support is minimal. Involvement from communities and NGO's in the delivery and
monitoring of these programs.
* A decentralized institutional framework for the management and delivery of basic education, with
integrated planning by the different agencies involved in basic education, and increasing
implementation responsibilities by local government. One implementing unit only will be created at
the district level drawing from the different relevant agencies and headed by Bupati. Only one source
of funding is used in the project. Involvement by parents and communities is actively sought.
*  A long-term plan for a more efficient and effective teaching force. For the short-term, some
important prerequisites would be addressed in this project such as changing the teacher allocation
formula from one that is school-based to a pupil-based allocation ratio, and incentives offered for
teaching in rural and remote schools.
* Increase of support to private schools to ensure an increase in their quality in the form of matching
grants.
* A school rationalization plan based on school mapping activities, to ensure that underused schools are
streamlined and consolidated if possible, and that new school buildings are optimally placed.
3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits:
(1) Crisis Relief
children remaining in school (through scholarships to 140,000 junior secondary school
children and school fee relief to 600,000 primary school children)
-   schools remaining operational (through grants to 4,000 primary schools and 700 junior
secondary schools);
(2) Institutional Reform
*   greater ownership of basic education by the local community;
* a more integrated and better run education system;
* more efficient and equitable distribution of teachers;
(3) Quality Improvement
* more effective schools, with increased student achievement;
* more effective and skilled education personnel;
Target population:
*   school-age children, especially poor children, who would be able to remain in school during
the worst crisis period and have better quality schooling subsequently;,
*   teachers, principals, supervisors, tutors and other education personnel at the district level and
below who would gain increased skills and resources;
*   Communities and parents who would become more closely involved with the schools in
their areas.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project would be implemented in phases in the project provinces. During the crisis period, the
scholarships and school grants program would be implemented in all districts in all seven provinces. The



8
other project components would be implemented gradually during subsequent years as economic
conditions improve in Sulawesi Selatan and Maluku, and depending on the readiness of each district.
Most project activities would be implemented at the district level, although the province would also carry
responsibility for certain project activities (e.g., design and development of the teacher in-service training
program, monitoring and evaluation).
(a) For the Crisis Relief Component
For the scholarships and grants program, the financing will come from several World Bank projects
(junior secondary education and other basic education projects) and from the ADB. For this component,
the project would follow the organizational arrangements of the overall scholarships and grants program.
This includes a Central Coordination Project Unit (CPCU) responsible for overall program coordination
and represented by the three main implementing agencies (MOEC, MORA, and MOHA) and reports to
the Central Steering Committee. Province and district-level Coordination Committees (PCCs and DCCs),
chaired by Bappeda, will be responsible for selection and targeting, training of educational staff in the
program and program administration. School Committees will be responsible for selection of scholarship
recipients. These Committees will be represented by heads of various agencies (MOEC, MORA, MOHA,
MOF, MOSA, Sekwilda, Post Office, Dinas P&K, KESRA, BKKBN, and PU) and members of civil
society and NGOs.
(I) For the other Components
A joint ministerial decree (SKB) has been agreed upon and signed by MOEC, MORA, and MONA
providing the organizational structure for delivery of basic education at the district level. The SKB brings
the various players together under one umbrella for planning, budgeting and implementation of basic
education. This process begins at the district level, with each district preparing its medium-term
investment plan (5 years) based on analysis of its education problems and identification of priorities. In
addition, the SKB calls for the rehabilitation of primary schools to be carried out by school committees
(with community representation).
For project implementation, a single District Project Implementation Unit (DPIU) is established drawing
upon staff from the three concerned implementing agencies (Dinas P&K, Kandep Dikbud, Kandep
Agama) and in adequate numbers to provide the necessary technical expertise to implement the project.
The Bupati appoints the three main heads of the DPIU (project manager, treasurer, secretary), one from
each agency, by signing and issuing their letters of appointments, thus ensuring that this unit reports to the
Bupati and he/she is accountable. The three main heads and the technical staff of the DPIU will be
chosen from the three implementing agencies based upon recommendations from heads of the
departments. The Minister of Education and Culture delegates to the Bupati the authority to appoint the
project staff, thus reinforcing the role of local government, while at the same time not relinquishing the
role of the central government (if Bupati does not deliver, the Minister has the authority to withdraw the
delegation).
At the provincial level, a Provincial Project Implementing Unit (PPIU) is established in the Kanwil with
staff appointed by the Ministry of Education. It similarly draws upon staff from the three concerned
agencies in adequate numbers.
At the central level, a Central Coordinating Project Unit (CPCU) is established for overall program
support, technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation, and financial management.
At all three levels, Coordination Committees are established (PCC, DCC, and CSC) for policy making,
guidance, and coordination. These units are the same as those already established for the national
scholarship and block grants program (see above).



9
Only one source of funding (the DIP), which goes directly to the DPIU, PPIU, or CPCU (as needed), will
be utilized in the project.
For Planning and Budgeting, overall project plans and annual plans would be developed at the district
level, under the coordination of the Bappeda II, integrating the different agencies involved in Basic
Education: kandep MOEC, kandep MORA, Dinas P&K II and Bupati's office. The plans would be
reviewed and signed off by the Bupati in each district, who would be responsible for ensuring that
implementation is carried out adequately. At the provincial level, plans would be reviewed by each of the
agencies at Level 1, and the integrated plans sent through the Governor's office to the national level.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection.-
* A crisis-relief only project. One alternative is to design a project only for crisis-relief and wait until
conditions are starting to return to normal before initiating a quality and access expansion project.
The decision on one project which includes both crisis interventions and other programs will allow
greater flexibility during the project to phase in activities, as they are needed. It also maintains the
strong district and province focus.
D Different financing options to mitigate the impact of the crisis. Cross-country experience
indicates that scholarships can be an effective means of enabling the poor to attend school (Demand
Side Financing, World Bank 19971, while school grants are more effective in increasing school
participation and autonomy. In the project, block grants to schools have been chosen as the prefered
option to maintain enrollment at the primary level, while at the junior secondary level, a combination
of scholarships and school grants have been selected. A scholarship program for primary students
was rejected since the scale of such a program would quickly become too unwieldy to manage,
implement and monitor. Instead, schools are given guidelines that include allocating a certain
proportion of the block grant to defray the costs of education for those who cannot afford it, thereby
promoting the school's autonomy and flexibility to find local solutions.
* Planning, budgeting and implementation at the national instead of district level. While project
preparation may seem more manageable if carried out at the national level, it creates a lack of
ownership at the lower levels. Moreover, as project design is expected to reflect local needs, district
level involvement is essential. There are, however, costs to this preferred approach. There is a high
learning curve for the districts since they have no prior involvement in processes of this kind. Other
country experience, as well as Indonesia's experience in other sectors indicate that the potential
benefits of decentralization, however, outweigh the potential costs.
*  Involvement of one sectoral agency instead of multiple agencies. A single agency project could
result in easier implementation. However, it would strengthen the divide between the Ministries of
Education and Culture, Home Affairs, and Religous Affairs, which has been a deterrent to achieving
good quality basic education. For the preferred alternative to work effectively, clearly allocated
responsibilities among different agencies and levels of government is critical. Mechanisms and
incentives for coordination should also be built into project design.
*  Excluding private schools. There are a large number of private schools (muhammadyah, pesantren
and catholic), especially at the junior secondary. Quality in these schools is low, with more severe
teacher shortages and low teacher skills, poor building construction and maintenance and a severe
lack of books and materials. Maintaining the viability of these schools is important because they are
attended by children from low-income families and are often the only alternative available in rural
and remote areas. To raise the quality of private schools, and to serve the poor, these schools have
been included in the project, with some targeted programs for quality improvements.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
From Indonesian Education and the World Bank: An Assessment of Two Decades of Lending (OED
Doc. No. 9752, 1991):
*   Decentralized institutional capacity building is basic to the long-term goal of increasing the
self-sufficiency of the education system.
*   Previous projects, mainly national in scope, were either overly complex or underestimated
absorption capacity, resulting in unsatisfactory implementation.
From the Primary Education Quality Improvement Project (PEQIP, Loan 3448-IND)
* The main elements for quality improvement are: a decentralized and participatory in-service
teacher training program; reliance on school clusters and mutual support of teachers;
significant community participation; sufficient quantity of textbooks with increased teacher
use of books and materials; and close MOEC-MOHA cooperation.
From the Village Infrastructure Projectfor Java and the Second Village Infrastructure Project (VIP
VIP and II, Loan Nos. 3888-IND and 4100-IND)
* Though varied, community capacities are nearly always higher than official sources initially
believe.
* Effective use of local organizations require giving them resources and responsibilities.
* Most Indonesian communities can satisfactorily manage simple administration, procurement,
and bookkeeping, and can comply with national standards provided they are given formats.
- There are benefits to be gained in giving higher credibility to local governments, provincial
and district administrations.
Efforts to enhance institutional capacity of local governments need to be coupled with efforts
to enhance human resource capacity.
* Although there may be in principle a strong commitment to decentralize on the part of the
central government, the actions of central government are often not in line with the
principles underlying decentralization.
* There is a need to ensure that decision-makers at the local level have access to education
ability and competence, and make decisions accordingly, rather than as a result of political
considerations.
From the Indonesia Secondary Education Project (Loan No. 2472-IND) and the Second Secondary
Education and Management Project (Loan No. 3158-IND)
* Changes and improvements to schools are very difficult to manage from the central level,
because they tend to be global solutions and are often not appropriate to local conditions.
* Local communities contribute significantly to the development of education in their own
areas. Stakeholders and clients are also well placed to evaluate project outcomes. They know
when children are learning and how investments in schools are being used. Stakeholders
involvement is critical to fully measure project outcomes, to understand how a project is
unfolding and to help develop appropriate corrective measures when necessary.
From the Community Participation In Planning and Management of Educational Resources Project
(COPLANER) (UNDP)
* There are advantages to be gained from an expanded role of local government in the
provision of and support for educational services, especially in the Indonesian context,



12
where cultural and ethnic differences are best taken into account when action is closer to
home.
*   There is considerable evidence that community organizations substantially increased the
extent and character of community contributions to education,
* Project activities successfully brought together local government and non-government
community leaders as member of the community organizations. This enabled the
development of common goals and actions.
4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
Commitment to Crisis Relief. The national "Back-to-School" Program, which was launched by the
President on June 29, consists of a coalition of Ministers from Education and Culture, Religious Affairs,
Population, Home Affairs, Bappenas, and is led by the Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare. This is
a strong indication of GOI's commitment at the highest levels to mitigate the impact of the economic
crisis on the poor. In addition, GOI's agreement in the revised June budget to preserve allocations for
basic education to the 1996/97 levels in real terms is another sign of its support for crisis relief programs.
Commitment to a more decentralized and multi-sectoral system to deliver basic education is
demonstrated through the preparation and signing of the joint decree (SKB) between MOEC, MORA and
MOHA on October 27, 1998 prior to project approval.
Over the medium term, GOI is committed to achieving universal enrollment for basic education as soon
as conditions return to normal and to ensure a good quality basic education for all.
S. Value added of Bank support in this project:
-  The Bank has been the driving force behind the National "back-to-school" prograrn bringing together
other multi-lateral and bi-laterial donors.
*  This project is part of an overall program for crisis relief, quality improvements and basic education
access, supported by the Bank.
* The Bank can act as an effective catalyst in improving coordination between govermment agencies.
*  The Bank will bring to Indonesia's benefit our experience in decentralized, district-based education
project design, implementation, and evaluation in other large and populous Asian countries (India and
China).
* Technical experience and lessons learned gained from other education sector capacity development
projects, especially in planning, evaluation and improving primary school quality.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis
The reverse-switching method of cost-benefit analysis indicates that the benefits of the primary
quality component far exceed the combined effect of the fiscal costs and opportunity cost yielding a
social return of at least 10 percent in both Maluku and South Sulawesi. In the case of the junior
secondary quality component, social returns of at least 10 percent can be enjoyed when graduates
switch out of the agricultural sector into other sectors. See Annex 4 for assumptions, methodology
and estimations.

[X ] Other: Economics of scholarships and school grants
2. Financial (see Annex 5): Fiscal impact analysis



13
3. Technical:
* The scholarships and school grants program requires adhering to a selection and targeting
mechanism for poor students and poor schools. The mechanism needs to be simple to follow
and effective in reaching the poor. District Committees and schools throughout each
province need to be trained annually. Public awareness needs to be raised in a media
campaign. Effective monitoring needs to be in place. These issues have been discussed and
agreed upon with GOI. (see Annex 4 on design of selection and targeting, and monitoring
and evaluation).
*   Special programs for remote schools in rural areas needed to be developed
such as a different teacher training model for schools on remote islands,
employment of contract teachers, and incentives for teachers in these areas.
(see Annex 8 for Guidelines developed for each program).
*   In order to ensure more local accountability and involvement in education,
primary school rehabilitation is to be carried out by communities.
Guidelines spelling out rehabilitation procedures and a system of support
from field engineers have been developed (see Annex 8 for Guidelines for
rehabilitation of SD/MI schools).
4. Institutional:
*   An institutional framework for education management at the district level was developed for
implementation in the project, with agreements reached between the key agencies involved.
This framework will be tried out and adjusted if needed (see Annex 8).
* Existing financial systems and internal controls at the CPCU and provincial and district
levels will be reviewed. Results of the review will be used in the design of appropriate
systems, including development of documented procedures for project accounting and
reporting at the CPIU, PPIUs, and DPIUs. There is limited experience and possibly
inadequate staff skills to carry out the financial management of the project. Appropriate
training is provided under the project.
* Based on assessments done during project preparation (see Annex 8. Building Institutional
Capacity Working Paper) district-level capacity for project implementation was found to be
mixed. The capacity building programs in the project will be responsive to the weaknesses
found.
5. Social:
* To maintain the pre-crisis gender equality in enrollments at the basic education level,
approximately 50% of the recipients of the junior secondary scholarships would be girls.
*   Other social risks relate to consolidation of schools which will necessitate transferring of
teachers and principals and will likely generate resistance. Incentives will be awarded to
transferring to rurallremote areas.
*   While the areas covered by the project include some vulnerable isolated groups, the project
is not establishing new schools and hence no particularly negative impact from the project is
expected on these groups. Quality improvements in schools can only provide positive
impact.

7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; if
participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable]:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Parents Associations, school managers and school committees (consisting of at least 50% civil
society) are involved in implementation: they will continue to be consulted and participate in the
rehabilitation and maintenance programs of primary schools.
Institutions at the local government level (MOEC, MOHA, MORA, and Bappeda) whose
contribution and involvement in planning and implementation was largely executive, will take on
greater planning and management responsibilities.
Private school Yayasans (Associations) will be actively participating and implementing the
project activities intended for private schools.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Civil Society representatives including NGOs will form 50% of the district committees which will
select scholarship and block grant recipients. They will also be involved in the monitoring of the
scholarship and block grant programs.
Teacher training institutions (IKIPS and FKIPs) will contribute staff and resources to the in-
service teacher training programs.
Other donors (OECF, GTZ, ADB) who also work in basic education have been extensively
consulted and their staff are participating in project preparation. For the scholarship and school
grants program, the Bank is leading a multi-donor effort, including the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), UNICEF, UJNDP and bilateral agencies (AusAID, ASEM and the British Council).
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The fiscal impact analysis (Annex 5) indicates that even though during project lifetime, the fiscal
impact reaches as high as 50 percent of provincial education budgets, after the project is completed its
recurrent cost implications are not high (as a percent of the provincial education budgets of Maluku and
South Sulawesi, recurrent costs are 6 and 7 percent, respectively). This is because: (i) crisis-relief
activities are not expected to continue beyond project lifetime at such high levels of coverage (17% of
junior secondary students, 40% of primary and junior secondary schools); and (ii) maintenance levels of
teacher training programs will be much reduced.

Annex 2
Sulawesi and Eastern Islands Basic Education Project
Project Description
Initially, the project will focus on crisis-relief activities, until the worst of the economic crisis has
passed, with a gradual return to the pre-crisis agenda, as the economy recovers. (See attachment 1 to this
Annex). During the first year, the project focus will be as follows:
support to the junior secondary school scholarship program, covering from 12% to 17% of
the students;
* support to the school grants program for primary and junior secondary schools;
* continue to support the medium-term agenda of institutional reform, to the extent possible.
These reforms may not require large amounts of resources to implement and will lead to a
more efficient and cost-effective delivery of education in the long term.
Starting from the second year, issues of quality in basic education will gradually be introduced:
community support activities;
* teacher training, especially of low-cost in-service training programs, and procurement of
limited teaching materials;
* primary school rehabilitation; and
* programs to improve the distribution of teachers.
Project Component 1 - US$30.1 million (total cost of component including contingencies)
Crisis Relief
Poverty rates in the four Sulawesi provinces are below or at the pre-crisis national poverty rate of 11%.
They are significantly higher, however, in Maluku (20%), Irian Jaya (22%), and Timor Timur (32%).
Hence, about 12-14% of Sulawesi junior secondary students will receive scholarships compared to a
national average of 17%. In Maluku, Irian Jaya, and Timor Timur, the respective proportions are 30%,
30%, and 60%. For school grants, a similar above national average allocation is provided in Maluku,
Irian Jaya and East Timur.
The program is based on a set of principles that have been agreed between the Government, the Bank and
the ADB. These principles will guide the implementation of the program.
* scholarships would be provided to poor students and families;
* special assistance funds would be provided to schools serving poor communities
* funds would be available by the beginning of the new school year;
* the Program should be implemented with the lowest overhead possible;
* the Program should be financially sustainable, bearing in mind the competition with other
poverty programs and shrinking budgets;
* scholarships and special assistance funds should be entirely in the form of money and no part of
it should be in kind;



24
*  scholarships and special assistance funds should flow directly from the center to the recipient by
the most direct route possible;
*  the Program should be as simple as possible, to be easily understood by everyone and be easily
explained in a media campaign; and
*  the Program must be monitored judiciously.
The program is supported by an intensive and repeated training effort of head teachers and provincial and
district officials, to ensure knowledge of the scheme and of the procedures; by a national media campaign,
to ensure that parents are aware of the program and do not withdraw their children out of ignorance, and
by a monitoring and evaluation program. The project would also partly support these costs. Items
eligible for financing under the school grants are specified in Annex 6.
Project Component 2 - US$ 7.5 million (total cost of component excluding contingencies)
Institutional Reform
Districts, subdistricts and schools should be able to manage their responsibilities for delivery of basic
education more skillfully. This means: (i) being able to plan more effectively the education activities
within their district; (ii) manage the education program in an integrated way between the different
agencies; (iii) be skilled in and use appropriate techniques for planning and implementation; (iv) assign
staff according to needs and skills, transfer if required, and retrain if needed; and (v) carry out targeted
activities, involving communities, to make them more aware and participating in school affairs.
Some project activities will be implemented by all districts; they are: (i) based on school mapping,
development of a multi-year plan of school rationalization and consolidation in each district, that would
result in a better organization of staff and functions, including needed staff transfers; and (ii) capacity
assessment of staff at district level in the offices of MOEC, MOHA, MORA and Bappeda, with an
evaluation of training requirements and determination of staff reallocation between agencies with a view
of strengthening local government.
Some project activities will be implemented, as needed by the districts and will be financed upon
approval of satisfactory proposals: (i) District-level training proposals, based on annual budgets. The
training proposals would be presented for the district as a whole, in an integrated way. (ii) District-level
support for project planning and implementation, if required, to strengthen the districts in those areas
where they are weak. Technical assistance would be available, if needed, but would not automatically be
assigned. (iii) Activities to support and instigate community participation, in the form of awareness
raising meetings and workshops, and seed support to start new initiatives that bring schools and
communities together.
This component would also include support for project management and implementation of the integrated
plans and would support the establishment and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system,
operating at district, province and central levels. This M & E system would be implemented for all basic
education projects, to be adapted to the provincial situation as needed. Each of the basic education
projects would support implementation in their own provinces and would carry a portion of the central
cost.
For the districts that are already well advanced and have shown a substantial degree of capability during
the preparation of the project, capacity assessment can start immediately at project implementation;
districts with less capabilities will be provided with technical assistance to carry out the assessment;



25
districts that have not yet started with project preparation will be provided with the necessary resources
(including technical assistance) during the first and second year of the project.
Project Component 3 - US$27.0 million (total cost of component including contingencies)
Quality Improvements.
Each district provides a proposal for implementation during the project reflecting district needs. The
proposals will contain quality improvement components, depending upon the needs of the district and the
existing capacity. It is expected that in districts where capacity building has to happen first, the quality
components will be carried out in the later years. In addition, in all districts, quality components will be
significantly reduced or postponed until at the earliest the third year of the project, due to the economic
crisis and budget constraints.
Districts will select quality components from a positive list, in the amount and mix needed depending
upon the conditions of the district The full list of activities for financing is: (i) primary school
rehabilitation and maintenance, with funds given to the community to manage the school improvement,
including procurement of basic school furniture; (ii) teacher-training programs for primary and junior
secondary education teachers, principals, library teachers and supervisors including special programs for
remote areas; (iii) procurement and distribution of teaching and learning materials and equipment; (iv)
teacher deployment in rural, remote areas through teacher incentives to teach in remote areas and hiring
of contract teachers for rural schools; (v) support to private schools through provision of matching grants
for rehabilitation of school buildings and provision of equipment and furniture; and (vi) upgrading of
religious school teachers.
Districts can submit for quality improvement, packages of interventions in a coherent proposal. Proposals
must present a balance between primary and junior secondary schools, and must include school mapping
and school consolidation as a prerequisite.
For primary schools the school quality improvement activities are based on the lessons of the Primary
Education Quality Improvement Project. For junior secondary schools, they are in keeping with the
activities as carried out in the ongoing JSE projects. It is expected that very few quality improvement
activities will be carried out during the first two years of project implementation. During this crisis
period, the emphasis for financing will be on ensuring that children remain in school and that schools can
continue to operate. The quality improvement component, as a result, will be minimal during these years,
and be focussed on providing low-cost teacher training only.
The project would also support and further improve private junior secondary schools. While these schools
are numerous especially in the rural areas, they are often of poor quality and, serving the poorest, many of
them are underfunded. The project would provide matching grants to these schools, which they would
use for needed quality improvements, which could range from construction and rehabilitation, to hiring of
extra teachers, school materials, or participation in teacher training programs.
At the national level, the project would support the establishment of a national-level Policy Reform
Working Group on Teachers to evaluate current teacher workforce issues and propose alternatives.

Economic Analysis
In the last year, the economic situation in Indonesia has changed rapidly. After a long period of strong
economic growth, the economy is on the brink of collapse with a declining GDP of about 8.5% in the first
quarter of 1998 and an expected reduction of about 7.5% in the second quarter (World Bank, 1998). The
projected growth rates are -12, 0 and 3 percent for FY98/99, FY99/00 and FYO0/0 1 respectively and
inflation is projected at 80, 20 and 7 percent for the same years (Table 1).

The impact of the economic crisis on educational outcomes is twofold. The first is the reduced ability of
schools, especially those in poor areas to function as a result of reduced government budgets and parental
contributions. The second is declining enrollments as household incomes decline and many households
will no longer be able to afford school expenditures.
In an effort to prevent the erosion of human resource gains which Indonesia has enjoyed over the past
few years, GOI and the donor community have initiated a national scholarship and school grants program.
This project, as part of the larger initiative, will support both these interventions. In addition, longer-term
goals have to be sustained but interventions to address them need to be judiciously phased in. With these
issues in mind, the economic analysis focuses the following:
I. Economics of scholarships and school grants;
II. Cost-Benefit of Quality;
III. Cost-effectiveness;
IV.Fiscal Analysis (Annex 5)
I.   ECONOMICS OF SCHOLARSEIPS AND SCHOOL GRANTS
Introduction.   Indonesia's economic crisis is expected to severely impact the poor as a result of
reduced incomes, increasing prices, and higher unemployment and underemployment. The poors' ability
to invest in human capital will be impaired as parents face higher prices of schooling and lower incomes
to pay for schooling. In addition, schools serving poor communities will no longer be able to provide
even a basic quality of education as public funding is reduced and income from parents and the
communities dwindles. As has happened during the past economic downturn in Indonesia a decade ago,
the combined effect of reduced public funding for education, higher prices of schooling, and lower family
incomes, is expected to be a decline in primary and junior secondary school enrollments among the poor.
Experience from Latin American countries during the 1980s and 1990s shows that not immediately
maintaining support for core education services risks irreversible losses in human capital in the long run.
In order not to jeopardize its long-term investment in human capital, the Government has rapidly
launched a five-year national program to provide scholarships for poor children in basic education and
block grants to schools serving poor communities starting this school year (July 20). A coalition of
Ministers, consisting of the Ministers for Education and Culture, Religious Affairs, Population, Home



29
Affairs and The National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), and led by the Coordinating
Minister for Social Welfare, has been formed to support the program. GOI requested the Bank to lead a
multi-donor effort, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNICEF and bilateral agencies --
AusAID, and Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) -- to support the Program. Total cost of the five-year
program is approximately US$ 382 million, with an ADB contribution of US$ 86 million, and the
remaining from the Bank. Bank financing is provided partly from restructuring of current education
projects (US$ 177.2 million) and partly from Basic Education projects under preparation for FY99
(US$119.1 million) including this project.
Impact of the Crisis. Estimating the impact of the economic crisis on enrollment is a complex matter as
the crisis is unprecedented in terms of magnitude and depth. Different methodologies have been used to
estimate the likely changes in school enrollments as a result of a fall in income. Results vary
considerably. Econometric techniques have yielded relatively low impact effects ranging from an
additional 115,000-260,000 7-12 year olds, and 173,000-270,000 13-15 year old children dropping out
over time as a result of a 10 percent fall in per capita income.1 Estimates from GOI (Table 2) point to
much larger effects of an additional 890,000 and 640,000 children dropping out of primary and junior
secondary schools, respectively in just one year.

While it may not be possible to reach closure on precise figures, there is agreement among policy-makers,
donors, teachers, principals, parents, NGOs and other stakeholders that the impact of the crisis on poor
children will be severe. The strongest evidence available comes from the well documented experience of
the impact of a much smaller economic shock in 1986/87 than today where education expenditures were not
maintained and special efforts were not made to keep children in school. During that period, gross
enrollment rates fell precipitously from 62% to 52% at the junior secondary level (Figure 1), and it took
almost a decade for enrollment to regain its previous levels. Income data from SUSENAS confirms that all
the decline was due to the drop out of children from poor households (Figure 2).
1 The models estimate the elasticity of enrollment with respect to per capita income (or its proxy, per capity
consumption) using 1996 SUSENAS (Filmer, Pradhan, 1998)

Focus group discussions and school visits conducted in April 1998 (when the crisis was in its sixth
months approximately) indicate that already poor schools and children were feeling the impact of the
crisis. Most principals reported more parents having difficulties paying the parent association fees (BP3)
on time or at all; student absences were higher this year than last; some students appeared to be eating less
in the morning; students were reported having more problems purchasing required books; and some
reported lateness of teachers as they switched to cheaper but slower and less reliable forms of transport.
Financing options. Various options were considered to maintain access to basic education for those
children expected to be adversely affected by the economic crisis. These include vouchers
stipends/scholarships, or targeted grants (which can be per capita, matching, etc.). Vouchers and
scholarships, given directly to students, are intended to offset the costs of schooling (books, tuition,
transport, fees, uniforms, etc.). In some countries, they have also been used to compensate families for
the loss of the child's labor (opportunity cost). This mechanism has been effective in other countries in



31
enabling disadvantaged groups such as the poor, girls and rural children to attend school (Demand Side
Financing, World Bank 1997). Cross-country experience indicates that scholarships can be an effective
means of enabling the poor to attend school while school grants are more effective for increasing school
participation and autonomy.
For this program, block grants to schools have been chosen as the preferred option to maintain enrollment
at the primary level, while at the junior secondary level, a combination of scholarships and school grants
have been selected. A scholarship program for primary students was rejected since the scale of such a
program would quickly become too unwieldy to manage, implement and monitor. Instead, schools are
given guidelines that include allocating a certain proportion of the block grant to defray the costs of
education for those who cannot afford it, thereby promoting the school's autonomy and flexibility to find
local solutions.
Complementing the scholarship and block grants program is a nationwide TV, radio, and print media
campaign to ensure that parents and communities are aware of the program and to facilitate transparency
in the use of funds and selection of recipients.
Estimated Costs. Attachment 1 provides the cost of the full five-year US $382 million program.
Annually, the cost of the program is equivalent to approximately 24% of the 1998/99 basic education
development budget.
Given the difficulty in estimating needs accurately, projections in increases in poverty rates were used as
the basis for estimating the number of students needing scholarships. Recent estimates of poverty
increases indicate that if real GDP declined in 1998 by 12%, the incidence of poverty could increase to
about 14% with that in rural areas reaching 17% (Indonesia in Crisis: A Macroeconomic Update, World
Bank, 1998). Hence, approximately 17% (nationally) of junior secondary students will be awarded
scholarships in the first three years, and 11% and 5% in the fourth and fifth years of the program,
respectively. Scholarships will be distributed according to the poverty incidence of each district (see
Selection and Targeting). Each student will receive a scholarship of Rp 240,000 (US$ 30 equivalent) in
voucher form at the beginning of the school year. This is intended to cover school costs such as
notebooks, uniforms, transportation costs, and school fees. Nationally, 2.6 million junior secondary
students will receive scholarships.
For primary block grants, Rp 2 million (US$ 250 equivalent) will be provided per school per year to 41%
of all primary schools serving the poorest communities. For junior secondary schools, Rp 4 million (US$
500 equivalent) will be provided per school per year to 40% of all junior secondary schools serving the
poorest communities. In total, 82,000 primary and junior secondary schools will benefit from block
grants per year.
Unit costs of the scholarships are derived from cost of schooling for households in the poorest quintile
from SUSENAS 95 (Rp 93,000) inflated to current prices.

Unit costs for block grants to schools are roughly based on estimates of BP3 payments per student that
school received before the crisis.
Project Beneficiaries. Table 3 provides the total number of scholarship and grant beneficiaries in the
project provinces. Due to the higher than average poverty rates in Maluku, Irian Jaya and East Timor, a
high proportion of students and schools will receive funds.

Selection and Targeting. Two main sources of data are available in Indonesia for poverty targeting both
of which are useful for targeting of the scholarship and school grants program but which cannot be relied
on solely. The SUSENAS (socioeconomic household-level survey) which collects a large number of
welfare indicators including education variables (enrollments, household expenditure, etc.) is not
representative at the sub-district level, and therefore can be used to provide a ranking of districts only by
poverty incidence. The PODES (village census) collects a range of data on physical, environmental,
social and economic infrastructure of every village in Indonesia. The selection of poor villages (IDT
villages) from the PODES is based on a score of variables which are biased towards infrastructure
availability. IDT villages are selected from the poorest third villages in each district with no harmonizing
across districts. Hence, the lowest third in a rich district may be better off than the top third in a very poor
district.
Given these considerations, the approach underlying the targeting mechanism selected for the scholarship
and school grants is one which uses quantitative information coupled with local knowledge and the
participation of NGOs and other members of civil society in the selection at the local level. More
specifically:



33
Nationally, the poorest 17% of JS students will be awarded scholarships and the poorest 40% primary and
junior secondary schools will receive block grants. District (and city) allocation of available scholarships
and grants have been determined on the basis of poverty incidences from the 1996 SUSENAS. Within
each district, a District Project Committee (DPCs) with equal representation from civil society and
government, will (i) allocate a scholarship quota to each junior secondary school; (ii) determine which js
schools will receive a grant; and (iii) allocate a proportion of the district's primary school grants to each
sub-district. A similarly composed sub-district committee will identify those primary schools that will
receive grants. For junior secondary scholarships, at each school, a school committee, chaired by the
head teacher and consisting of teachers, community members and students will identify those students
which will receive scholarships.
Scholarships: DPCs will rank all JS schools in the district based on four indicators; (i) the poverty of the
community served by the school (as measured by PODES/SUSENAS data), (ii) the percentage of poor
households in the community served by the school; (iii) the average per child parent-teacher contribution
received during the 1996/97 year, and (iv) the physical condition of the school. Based in this ranking, the
poorest 50% of the schools will share 75% of the available scholarships and the remaining 50% of
schools will share the remaining 25% of the scholarships. This is to account for the issue that even rich
schools have some poor students attending. In each case, the scholarships will be proportionally
distributed among schools on the basis of their 1996/97 enrollment (pre-crisis). School committees will
subsequently distribute scholarships to those students that have already, or are most likely to drop out of
school for economic reasons, and to those primary school leavers who would otherwise continue their
schooling but will not do so for financial reasons. At least half of the recipients will be girls.
JS Grants: Using the same four indicators above, the DPCs will rank all JS schools in the district,
excluding only those schools that are considered unviable (based on enrollment, location, and registration
criteria). Based on the DPC's ranking of all JS schools, the poorest schools in each district will be
awarded the available grants.
Primary School Grants: In each district, the DPC will proportionally distribute all available grants to the
sub-districts based on the percentage of IDT villages in each sub-district. Subsequently, the poorest 50%
of the sub-districts will share 65% of available grants and the remaining 50% will share 35% of the
grants. The grants will be proportionally distributed among sub-districts based on the number of schools
in each sub-district. Each sub-district committee will subsequently rank all primary schools in the sub-
district according to the indicators listed above. Based on the sub-district committees' rankings of all
primary schools, the poorest schools in each sub-district will be awarded the available grants.
Monitoring and Evaluation. A comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and supervision program is being
developed for management of scholarships and school grants. While the Government will monitor the
day-to-day operation of the program, a third-party will carry out quarterly monitoring of the selection and
targeting process, and the use of funds. Representatives from civil society and NGOs will be utilized in
the monitoring of the program. In addition, a database will be maintained by Bank Rakyat Indonesia to
track all aspects of flow of funds. Throughout the program, the Government, the Bank, and the ADB will
evaluate the impact of the program on school enrollments and transition through focused surveys and the
use of SUSENAS.

Returns to a Junior Secondary Scholarship
Providing a scholarship of Rp240,000 per year for a junior secondary student yields a high return as the
estimation below demonstrates:
We assume that an additional year of junior secondary education yields a productivity gain of 10 percent.2
At an annual total income/product of $700 per capita in Indonesia, a 10 percent gain produces $70/year.
The present value of this amount, over a 30 year time period of lifetime production, is $602 (discount rate
of 10%). When compared to the cost today of a scholarship per child of Rp300,000 (Rp240,000 plus 25%
administration/training cost), or US$38 (exchange rate of Rp8,000), it is clear that the investment is
worthwhile.
In the table below we present the above PV calculation (Column 1) and repeat it varying some of the
assumptions. In Column 2, we assume the exchange rate improves to Rp2000. In Column 3, we assume
the economy takes another nose-dive and annual income falls to $400 and the exchange rate weakens to
Rpl 0,000. In all cases, the return from today's investment in a junior secondary scholarship is remains
profitable.

1/ The PV formula is corrected for the fact that the impact will be one year later (i.e. after the additional year of
schooling).
2/ includes 25% administration and training cost.
2 Rates of return studies for Indonesia have shown returns to junior secondary even higher than 10%. Further we
can assume there are other non-wage benefits such as better health, productivity gains in home production, etc.).

II. COST-BENEFIT OF QUALITY
Introduction. Low quality basic education has been identified as one of the main problems faced by the
education system in Indonesia (Education in Indonesia: From Crisis to Recovery, 1998). This is
reflected in unsatisfactory schooling outcomes (high drop-out and repetition), low levels of skills and
inadequate preparation for post-basic education and a lifetime of learning and employment that many
graduates possess. Evidenc& indicates that the main (non-institutional) factors precipitating this problem
are poorly trained teachers, the lack of adequate levels of resources, curriculum overload, shortage of
teaching staff, and an inadequate supply of text-books and materials, among others. As part of the overall
quality enhancement program of basic education, this project, as well as the West Java and Sumatra Basic
Education projects, includes large quality components that aim to address some of these issues. In
Maluku and South Sulawesi the quality component is the single largest component making up about 48
and 59 percent of province project costs, respectively. The specific interventions include school
rehabilitation, provision of contract teachers, provision of educational materials, cluster in-service
teacher training, matching grants to private schools, and incentives to teachers in remote areas.
The Reverse Cost-Benefit Method-Estimating Switching Values. To calculate the returns to the
quality component we employ the use of the reverse switching method. This method determines the
feasibility of an intervention based on a comparison of the cost of the intervention with the minimal
productivity differential required to make the intervention profitable to society. It asks: Given the cost of
producing a higher quality graduate, what productivity differential is required to make the investment in
quality profitable to society? The required differential is estimated according to the following equation4:
D =/s_] F (t. (C5 + Ws-_)
where
D   l = the required productivity differential between a graduate of
school level S and a graduate of school level S-1
F  =   discount rate
t, =   number of year required to complete level
C, = per student direct resource cost (government cost and household
expenditure)
W,V1 = earning forgone during each year of investment.
A discount rate of 10 percent is assumed. The methodology uses both the direct costs to the government
and households, and the costs to the individual in the form of opportunity cost of schooling (i.e. foregone
wages).
Data. The analysis utilizes data from Labor Force Surveys (1994 and 1996 SAKERNAS), household
socio-economic survey (1995 SUSENAS) and budget data. The SAKERNAS details information
pertaining to sector and occupation of employment, wages and number of hours worked in addition to
general demographic information. The labor force data is used to impute the average weekly wages for
individuals who have not completed primary school, primary school graduates and junior secondary
graduates in various employment sectors. The surveys sort employment into 10 main sectors (Table 4).
A descriptive analysis of employment by sector and level of education indicates that primary school
graduates are mainly employed in the agriculture sector (Table 4). At the junior secondary level, there is
some movement out of agriculture into other sectors such as trade and manufacturing. More than 60
percent of primary graduates and 50 percent of junior secondary graduates are employed in agriculture

and 37 percent of junior secondary graduates are employed in trade, services and manufacturing. It is
only at the senior secondary level that employment beyond agriculture begins to increase significantly.

The data necessary to estimate D 5X5,l is wage data for graduates at three levels: incomplete primary,
primary graduates and junior secondary graduates. Wage data was obtained through the estimation of a
basic OLS using the 1994 Sakemas. The sample included individuals between the ages of 14 and 65.
Wages for three groups of agricultural workers and junior secondary graduates employed in the non-
agriculture sector was imputed for each province (Table 5).

Estimation of Returns for Primary Quality Component. We assume that benefits from the quality
component lead to higher student achievement which reduces repetition and increases school completion
rates. Hence, the benefits can be measured as the differences in wages for a primary school completer to
a less-than-primary school completer.
Costs per student per year are derived from the total costs of quality interventions (school rehabilitation,
teacher cluster training, and provision of educational materials) averaged across the total population of
primary school students in each province.
5 Evidence of this relationship is available from the impact evaluation of the Indonesia PEQIP project, where
similar quality interventions in 6 provinces led to a positive effect on student achievement (DHV, 1997).

Opportunity cost
Note: Household expenditure only includes cost of uniforms, books, transportation and allowance.
The results suggest that the investment in primary quality in both provinces satisfies the 10 percent rate
of return test. The return in Maluku is significant at about one and a half times more than the required
differential. The returns in Maluku are also much higher than those in South Sulawesiwhere the observed
wage differential is exactly equal to the wage differential required to achieve the minimum 10 percent
return on the investment.
Hence, if the primary quality interventions are implemented well, and result in higher student completion,
the benefits exceed the opportunity cost of schooling and the direct cost of the interventions. It is
worthwhile to keep in mind that these estimates of benefits reflect a minimum given the other expected
benefits to school rehabilitation, for example (see Section below).
Estimation of Returns for Junior Secondary Quality Component. The junior secondary quality
interventions differ from the primary component in that it includes contract teachers and excludes school
rehabilitation. The unit costs used in the analysis again reflects the aggregated costs of all the above
interventions averaged across the population of junior secondary students in each province. The
household cost added to the analysis includes transportation, allowance, expenditure on uniforms and
equipment and books.
Two scenarios are modeled to examine the benefits of the junior secondary quality component,
namely: (i) an inter-sectoral effect (where the wages ofjunior secondary graduates who enter a non-
agricultural sector upon graduation are compared against the wages of primary school graduates who
enter the agricultural sector); and (ii) an intra-sectoral effect (where the wages ofjunior secondary

graduates who enter the agricultural sector are compared against the wages of primary school graduates
who enter the agricultural sector). This analysis takes into account the benefits of increased employment
opportunities in non-agricultural sectors for junior secondary graduates.
Inter-Sectoral Effect
When junior secondary graduates are able to switch out of the agricultural sector, the benefits to a quality
component is rather large. As illustrated in Table 7, in both Maluku and South Sulawesi, the observed
wage differential is more than 3 times larger than the required differential to achieve a 10 percent return
on the investment. Hence, in this case, the quality component does accrue a good return to the
investment.

Intra-Sectoral Effect
Remaining in the agricultural sector, however, is not as beneficial for junior secondary graduates. The
wage differential between primary and junior secondary school graduates who enter agriculture is so
small that it is nearly completely offset by the opportunity cost of staying in school for the additional 3
years. This result is the same for both the South Sulawesi and Maluku provinces where the observed
wage differential is only about a fourth of the required wage differential and therefore does not meet the
minimum 10 percent return on the investment (Table 8).

Comparing the inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral results indicate that unless junior secondary graduates are
able to move out of agriculture, the returns to the investment in junior secondary quality will not be
socially profitable. While the probability of this move is low during the economic downturn in Indonesia,
as the economy resumes its pre-crisis growth patterns, opportunities for junior secondary graduates in
non-agricultural sectors will begin to expand again.
Conclusion. The reverse-switching method indicates that the benefits of the primary quality component
far exceed the combined effect of the fiscal costs and opportunity cost yielding a social return of at least
10 percent in both Maluku and South Sulawesi. In the case of the junior secondary quality component,
social returns of at least 10 percent can only be enjoyed if the graduate is able to switch out of the
agricultural sector into other sectors.

m. COST EFFECTIVENESS
Facing extreme budgetary constraints, GOI has to employ cost-effective strategies in its delivery of
education services. This analysis proposes several cost-effective strategies that could be adopted under
the project. The first focuses on the school consolidation process and associated savings. The second
looks at the need for adequate maintenance budgets for schools.
School Consolidation. There are currently (140,000) primary schools in Indonesia. Many of these
schools were built to support large cohorts of children in the late 1970's and throughout the 1980's. As
the fertility rate has stabilized at a lower level, the cohort of school aged children has fallen resulting in
the under utilization or abandonment of many primary school buildings. In an effort to conserve
resources, the project supports a school consolidation program where primary school buildings located
within close proximity to each other (less than 1 km) are consolidated. In some cases, it is feasible to
convert one of the primary school buildings into a junior secondary school. Using the unit construction
costs as present in Table 9 the analysis focuses on the economic benefits or costs that are derived from a
school consolidation program.

Source: Unit cost from BAPPENAS, 1997/98
The comparison is the cost of consolidation against non-consolidation where:
*  there are two primary schools within a 1 km radius of each other that are consolidated. Thus,
since one building is now vacant, the cost of rehabilitation and maintenance has been halved.
* the two primary schools are not consolidated. Since both buildings are occupied GOI will
have to rehabilitate and maintain both these primary school buildings.
The underlying assumptions of the model are: school buildings last for 15 years after which total
reconstruction has to take place, maintenance is about 2 percent of base construction cost and inflation
over the period is normalized to 7 percent.

Maluku                      179,921
The analysis shows that consolidation is extremely cost effective and will accrue to GOI substantial
savings. The savings are the result of a possible reduction in the total budget required for school
rehabilitation (if schools are consolidated one of the consequences could be a reduction in the number of
buildings that need to be rehabilitated for use) and a reduction in the maintenance budget. In total, GOI

can save up to an estimated Rp152 million per school in the province of South Sulawesi and Rpl 80
million in Maluku (Table 10).
Preventive MaintenancefRehabilitation.'0 If school buildings are to maintain their value and provide
their pupils and teachers with a satisfactory learning and teaching environment, regular school
maintenance is essential. Frequently maintenance budgets are limited.
The construction budgets used by the government for estimating the cost of construction of new or
renovation of existing schools are more than adequate for the construction of good quality facilities if they
are properly built. Unfortunately, because of the generally low standard of construction, the full potential
of the building is never realized. Thus, combined with the fact that very little money is spent on
maintenance, the useful life of most school buildings is very short.
The full cost of maintaining a building against not maintaining a building over a period of 21 years is
examined in the Table below. If this building is well constructed and maintained, it should have a useful
life of at least 20 years and probably much longer. However, if the building is badly constructed and
poorly maintained, its life could be shortened to 10 years and possibly much less. To illustrate this point,
we use the case of Maluku. The initial cost of constructing the building at current rates will be RpI99.4
million in Maluku (See table above). If we assume that annual maintenance costs are a fixed rate of 2
percent of the initial construction cost in the first case, this will result in a maintenance cost of Rp3.9
million for the first year after construction. In the second case we use a maintenance rate of about 0.5
percent per annum which allows for approximately Rp997,000 per year per school. This is comparable to
the current allocation that schools currently receive. Both the cost of maintenance and construction
increases at an annual inflation rate of 7 percent.

The above data indicate that spending higher amounts of money on school maintenance today saves GOI
over Rp200 million per school over the long-term in both project provinces (Table 12). This implies that
on average between 17 to 21 percent of funds that would have been spent on construction and
maintenance can be saved if GOI increases the per school maintenance allocation. This is because the
cost of construction is high and buildings that are not well maintained deteriorate rapidly eroding the
value of initial construction. An illustrative example using current construction prices from Maluku is
present in Table 11. The total cost of constructing a 4-classroom building primary school, maintaining it
regularly and reconstructing it after 20 years is Rpl .19 billion. The total cost of constructing the same
building, but, not maintaining it resulting in two necessary reconstruction activities after 10 years is
Rpl .43 billion, resulting in savings of Rp242 million per building over a period of 21 years. A similar
exercise was conducted for the province of South Sulawesi and the estimated savings was Rp265 per
school over a period of 21 years.

Annex 5
Sulawesi and Eastern Islands Basic Education Project
Fiscal Analysis
The objective of the fiscal analysis is to examine the budgetary implications of the project on the
provincial budget. The fiscal analysis begins at the macro-level, looking at the implications of a
contractionary economy on the budgetary outlook for the education sector with linkages established to the
respective provincial budgets. Drawing on historical data, we begin with the projection of the overall
education budget envelope. We assume that despite falling government revenues, development
expenditure budget for basic education will be maintained in real terms relative to 1996/97 levels for the
next 2 years at least, after which it would increase. The assumption for maintaining the budget is based
on what was achieved this year in the July program and GOI's commitment to protect basic education
during the crisis. The assumption for increasing the education budget after the economy recovers is based
on the pre-crisis strategy to increase allocations for education.
Historical Situation
During the last structural adjustment period, the education sector was not protected and experienced a
rapid decline in the education budget by about 12 percent in real terms between 1985/86 and 1989/90.
Similarly, real expenditure for basic (primary and junior secondary) education also declined by 71
between fiscal 1985/86 and 1989/90 with the single largest drop occurring in the second year of the
adjustment when the budget fell as much as 56, from Rp583 billion to Rp258 billion. Education
expenditures as a percentage of GDP fell from 4.13 to 2.74, while the share of Government expenditures
for education fell from 17.6 to 13.

Current Situation
The most recent revised budget (July program) shows an allocation of Rp8,800 billion for the education
sector (11 percent of the total development budget). The allocation for basic education amounts to
Rp.4,663 billion which is equivalent to Rp2,000 billion in real FY96/97 terms and represents an
equivalent level of budgetary allocation as in FY96/97.
The Model
To estimate the level of provincial budgets for the necessary fiscal years, we use FY95/96 and FY96/97 as
the base. We project two growth paths for the provincial education budget.
In the base case, growth is assumed at 0 percent for the first two years of implications, 2 percent for the
subsequent two years and 4 percent for the last 2 years of the project. For the second model (high case
scenario), growth is projected on a higher path where in the first year the basic education budget will
grow at a rate of 1 percent, followed by 2,4,5 and 6 percent in the subsequent five years. (See Table 1)

The issues of institutional capacity, the provision of counterpart funds and program sustainability are
examined using the following indicators: fiscal burden of project cost on the basic education budget, and
fiscal burden of recurrent cost (of project) on the basic education budget after the project is completed.
We analyze the two provincial budgets for Maluku and South Sulawesi.
Fiscal Implications for Maluku
Maluku is a relatively small island in the eastern part of Indonesia. The education budget for FY96/97
and FY97/98 was Rp35.6 billion and Rp4l.6 billion respectively. In FY96/97 and FY97/98, more than
50 percent of the provincial budget was allocated to primary education and about 48 percent was allocated
to junior secondary education. In the following analysis, we examine the impact of the project on the
province.

3/Recurrent costs during implementation represents GOI's counterpart fanding for project. Recurrent cost after
implementation includes 20 percent of training, scholarships and school grants, and 100 percent of contract teachers.
The analysis shows that the burden of the project on the total education budget for Maluku is high. The
ratio of project costs and total education budget increases to as much as 50 percent during the third and
fourth year of implementation. (Table 2). The implication of this finding is that the institutional capacity
aspect of the project in Maluku ( a relatively small province in the archipelago) is of considerable
importance. Technical assistance has to be provided to key government agencies for implementation
purposes.
The second issue examined is that of recurrent cost implications of the project. During the project period
this is represented by the amount of counterpart funds GOI has to provide. After the project the recurrent
cost implications are assumed at: 20 percent of training, scholarships and school grants, and 100 percent
of contract teachers.
The ratio of recurrent costs over total project costs is relatively low and constant over the period (Table
2). It rises to as high as 5 percent during the project period but not more. Hence, because it is so low,
financing the required counterpart funds should not be a problem.
Upon completion of the project, the recurrent cost to the government represents 6 percent of the total
provincial budget. In both cases, recurrent expenditure is sufficiently low and should be easily financed
during implementation in the form of counterpart funding and absorbed after the completion of the
project.

Under the high scenario, where assumptions of real increases in the basic education budget are introduced
as early as FY99/00, the total project cost as a percentage of the basic education budget remains high. It
increases from between 8 and 44 percent in the fourth year of the project (See Table 3). In the case of
recurrent costs, since the basic education budget is projected to increase by 5 percent in the period after
the project, absorbing these additional costs will not be difficult.
Fiscal Implications for South Sulawesi
The South Sulawesi basic education budget for FY96/97 and FY97/98 was Rp66.0 billion and Rp63.3
billion respectively. In South Sulawesi, the majority of the basic education budget is used to finance
primary education. In FY96/97, 64 percent of the provincial budget was used to finance primary school
education and 29 percent was allocated for junior secondary education. In FY97/98, primary education
received a larger proportion of the budget (70 percent) while junior secondary school received 25 percent
of the provincial budget. In the following analysis, we examine the impact of the project on the province.

The analysis shows that the burden of the project on the total education budget for South Sulawesi is high.
It increases dramatically from a low of 6 percent to as high as 50 percent over the period (Table 4). Thus,
the institutional capacity aspect of the project in South Sulawesi is also of great importance. Technical
assistance has to be provided to key government agencies for implementation purposes.
The ratio of recurrent costs over total project costs, however, remains relatively low and constant over the
period. It rises to as high as 5.0 percent during the period but not more. Upon completion of the project,
the recurrent cost to the government represents 7 percent of the total provincial budget. In both cases,
recurrent expenditure is sufficiently low and should be easily financed during implementation in the form
of counterpart funding and absorbed after the completion of the project.

Under the high scenario, where assumptions of real increases in the basic education budget are introduced
as early as FY99/00, the total project cost as a percentage of the basic education budget remains high. It
increases to as much as 47 percent in the third year of the project (See Table 5). In the case of recurrent
costs, since the basic education budget is projected to increase by 6 percent in the period after the project,
absorbing these additional costs will not be difficult.
Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the issues of program sustainability and the provision of counterpart funds in
Maluku and South Sulawesi provinces is not expected to be a significant problem. However, due to the
relatively heavy burden of the project on the provincial budgets, adequate technical assistance to key
government agencies will be of prime importance.

Organization and management of Procurement. The procurement plan reflects the
decentralized nature of the project's activities and will be carried out by the 28 project districts and by
Sulawesi Selatan and Maluku provinces throughout the project implementation period. For Component 1
(Crisis Relief), covering scholarships and primary and secondary school grants, the provinces of Irian
Jaya, Sulawesi Tengah, Sulawesi Utara, Sulawesi Tenggara and Timor Timur are also included in the
project. The institutional arrangements for the project are charted in Attachment 1. Most of the
procurement for the project will be in small contracts. The District Project Implementation Units (DPIUs)
in each district will be in charge of procurement for the activities in the respective districts. Since
districts have little or no experience with procurement under Bank-assisted projects, guidance will be
provided by the provincial Project Implementation Units (PPIUs) in respective provinces, which will be
provided with appropriate technical assistance. The PPIUs will be in charge of procurement for the
project-related activities at the provincial level. Assistance of a specialized nature, such as for selecting
and appointing international consultants, will be provided by CPCU in Jakarta, which is the agency
currently implementing all Bank-financed basic education projects. The staff of the CPCU will be
augmented to address the requirements of this project, in addition to its already existing workload.
In the event of any conflict between the Bank guidelines and Keppres 16/1994 or any other GOI
regulations, the requirement of the Bank guidelines will govern. The Government has waived such
unacceptable procedures in a supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement.
Civil Works (US$ 8.2 million equivalent for school rehabilitation, including contingencies).
The work will be small in size and scattered over the 28 districts in Sulawesi Selatan and Maluku
provinces. Rehabilitation works for primary schools including provision of water supply and toilets and
repair of school furniture, will be procured under lumpsum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required
completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where
applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the
required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully. The
contracts will be managed by the school committees, established under the project.
Equipment and Furniture (US$ 0.8 million equivalent including contingencies). Procurement
of furniture and office equipment will be carried out by the 28 DPIUs and two PPIUs for their respective
activities. Each package of goods is not expected to exceed US$200,000, but packages valued at
US$50,000 equivalent or more would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Furniture and equipment costing less than US$50,000 per contract would be purchased on the basis of
national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank up to an aggregate of US$19 million equivalent.
Quotations must be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers on the basis of a detailed description
and quantity of goods, as well as the desired delivery time and place.
Educational Materials (US$ 4.4 million equivalent including contingencies). This would
consist of books for school libraries, teachers reference books, training materials, charts, maps, and other
teaching aids, including kits for purposes of demonstration. The procurement will be based on item lists
agreed with the Bank and through direct contracting of proprietary items with prior Bank agreement or
through national shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. Quotations must be obtained from at least
three qualified suppliers on the basis of a detailed description and quantity of goods, as well as the desired
delivery time and place.
Training (US$ 14.9 million equivalent including contingencies) for education managers and
staff, project managers and staff, school principals, supervisors, and teachers will be carried out by



52
trainers who will receive their own training from consultants who will be hired following procedures set
forth in the Consultant Guidelines (above). The trainers would conduct training activities in accordance
with Government administrative procedures (including those governing staff travel and subsistence
allowances, honoraria, provision of consumable materials, and other training-related activities) acceptable
to the Bank and based on the agreed annual work program. Similarly, the training of management and
staff of the district and provincial agencies will be carried out by consultants who will be hired in
accordance with the above Consultant Guidelines and who will conduct training under plans agreed with,
and Government procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Consultants' Services (US$ 4.2 million equivalent including contingencies). These contracts
would cover technical assistance for capacity building, training programs, monitoring and evaluation,
project implementation, and impact evaluation studies. Recruitment would follow procedures prescribed
in the above Consultant Guidelines. Letters of invitation and terms of reference for all consultancies and
single source contracts will be subject to prior review by the Bank for contracts valued at US$100,000
equivalent or more awarded to firms or US$50,000 equivalent or more awarded to individuals. The
consultants would be chosen based on QCBS (Quality- and Cost-Based Selection) procedures. Consulting
assignments valued at more than US$200,000 equivalent will be advertised in Development Business. The
Standard Request for Proposals, including standard contracts, dated July 1997 and revised in April 1998
will be used for all consultant assignments. The short list of consultants for services for field engineer,
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract, may consist entirely of national consultants. Table
Al provides the breakdown of consultant contracts.
Scholarships (US$ 13.0 million equivalent including contingencies) for secondary school
students will be awarded in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank, following Government
administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Contract Teachers (US$ 1.1 million equivalent including contingencies) would be selected in
accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank, following Government procedures and under contracts
acceptable to the Bank and appointed by the head of district (Bupati/Walikotamadya).
Primary and Secondary School Grants (US$ 14.0 million equivalent including contingencies)
for selected primary and junior secondary schools will be awarded based on the agreed criteria with the
Bank, following Government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank. The Grants would cover
expenditures for instructional materials (including supplemental reading books, teachers' guides, library
books, reference books, atlases, charts and posters), consumable materials (including students' notebooks,
chalk, pencils, and supplies for practical subjects), minor repairs and maintenance at schools (including
painting and repair of windows, doors, classroom desks and chairs, roofs, toilets, water drainage and
footpaths), provision of public transportation to teachers attending KKG training, and formal and informal
school charges (including new students entry fees and examination fees).
Private School Grants (US$ 2.0 million equivalent including contingencies) for selected private
schools for rehabilitation of school buildings, equipment and furniture will be awarded upon submission of
acceptable proposals from private schools, based on agreed criteria with the Bank, following Government
administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank. Grants will be a maximum of Rp 30 million equivalent and
the works will be carried out following community participation procedures, agreed with the Bank. Proposals
should be matched with at least 25% of the total cost of the works to be provided by the community.
Fellowships (US$ 0.7 million equivalent including contingencies) for teachers would be
awarded in accordance with annual plans agreed with the Bank and following Government administrative
procedures acceptable to the Bank.



53
Project Management (US$ 6.9 million equivalent including contingencies). Support for project
management activities including travel and subsistence allowances, honoraria, office support, meeting
support and provision of consumable materials would be provided in accordance with Government
administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.

the Bank whereas all other contracts would be subject to random ex-post review. The Bank would do random ex-
post review of a sample of approximatelv 10 percent of these contracts. All terms of reference of consulting
firms and consultants, all single-source selection of consultants and consulting firms, and all consultant contracts
costing at or more than US$100,000 for firms and at or more than US$50,000 for individuals would be subject to
prior review by the Bank. All other consultant contracts would be subject to random ex-post review. Contracts
for fellowships, training, and services of contract teachers will be subject to random ex-post review.

the project expenditures in accordance with the agreed budgets under the existing government procedures.
They will submit their payment requests to their respective MOF Treasurer (KPKN) who will issue
payment remittance orders (SPM) to Bank Indonesia to credit payees' accounts at the latter's respective
banks and to debit the project Special Account. For expenditures in small amounts and for activities

district levels will be reviewed to: a) determine the extent to which existing systems and procedures can
be used and relied upon, b) determine the extent to which supplementary systems and procedures will be
required, and c) identify the address any shortfalls in existing systems which may be appropriately
addressed within the scope of the project. Additionally, the result of this review will be used in the design
of appropriate systems, including development of documented procedures for project accounting and
reporting at the CPCU, PIPUs, and DPIUs. The review and the design of financial management systems
will be carried out in accordance with the Guide for Review and Design of Accounting and Reporting

involved under the project have been reviewed. The limited experience and possibly inadequate levels of
staff skills for carrying out project activities, which has been observed in some districts agencies, will be
addressed before project implementation through: (i) assignment of skilled staff, operational and
financial, to the district agencies concerned from other, cooperating agencies; (ii) issuance of technical
implementation guidelines (Juknis); (iii) provision of training on project administration and financial
management; and (iv) deployment of consultants who will provide guidance during project
implementation.
