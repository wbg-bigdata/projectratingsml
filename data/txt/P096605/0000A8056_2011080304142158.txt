                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objective is to support the Borrower in improving the employability of: (a) poor at-risk youth by building their work experience and life
                         skills and expanding second-chance education programs to complete their formal education, and (b) poor low-skilled long-term unemployed people between the
                         ages of 18 and 65.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an ISR based on the findings of a ex-post procurement review carried out in April 2011, an implementation support mission for the Second Chance education component

                         Component 1 that supports the youth employment training courses for youth-at-risk delivered under the Juventud y Empleo Program (PJE). At as of end of May 2011 over 29,000 at

                         risk-youth have participated in the program, well above the project target. Savings under the component will allow to increase the number of trained youth even further. The
                         INFOTEP, the national training agency has co-financed 241 special training courses for extremely vulnerable at-risk youth (out of a target of 400 courses) thus increasing the
                         likelihood of sustainability beyond the life of the project. Initial evidence from the program#s experimental impact evaluation where applicants were randomly assigned to either a
                         vocational training and life-skills course or to a life-skills only course suggest that the #soft# or life-skills component of the program plays a central role in improving the employment
                         outcomes of young women, who approximately 12 to 18 months after the program experience a higher likelihood of having a job, higher wages and higher job satisfaction. The
                         program also has an important effect on reducing pregnancy in young women.

                         Component 3, implemented by the Ministry of Education (ME), continues to show steady physical implementation progress since the supervision of September 2010, despite the
                         recent changes of high-level authorities in the ME. The proposed new model for EBA as well as the competencies for each of the 4 curricular areas for each one of the 3 cycles
                         included in EBA were developed and validated in the field since the last supervision mission. The consultation/awareness-raising about these competencies and of the proposed new
                         model of EBA with teachers, school principals and regional and district education authorities has been an ongoing process since October 2010 including a total of 34 three-day
                         workshops that have benefited about 2,000 people. If the new authorities continue supporting this awareness-raising effort among teachers, the training could be completed by next
                         August including the carrying out of 18 pending three-day workshops. The National Education Council (CNE) recently at the end of June gave its approval to continue with the
                         curricular reform. In parallel, this component is starting to discuss the learning assessment scheme and possible instruments to be used when the new EBA model is gradually
                         implemented, in early 2012.

                         Under component 4 the pilot Temporary Employment Program is making good progress overcoming some of the deficiencies present in the first round of selection and
                         implementation of community projects. In the second round, the municipalities increased their contribution and included their community projects in the #participatory budget# and
                         more experienced NGOs have presented proposals.
