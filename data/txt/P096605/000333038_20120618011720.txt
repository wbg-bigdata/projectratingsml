                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
  1. The proposed changes are: a) to reallocate US$1 million from Component 3
     (implemented by the Ministry of Education) to Component 1 (implemented by the
     Ministry of Labor); and b) to extend the closing date of the project for a second
     time from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The reallocation of the Loan proceeds
     will allow the Government of the Dominican Republic (GoDR) to make effective
     use of project resources. The extension of the closing date will enable the
     Ministry of Labor (MoL) to make use of the reallocated resources to train at-risk
     youth, as well as to complete the final survey of the impact evaluation. A previous
     12-month extension from June 30, 2011, to June 30, 2012 was approved on
     August 10, 2010.

B. PROJECT STATUS
  2. The Dominican Republic Youth Development Project is comprised of four
     components. Component 1 is intended to “Consolidate and expand the Programa
     de Juventud y Empleo to provide increased access to a first work experience for
     youth at risk? and is rated as Highly Satisfactory. Component 2 is designed to
     “Build capacity in the Ministry of Labor and INFOTEP to more effectively focus
     on at-risk youth? and is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Component 3 supports
     effort to “Strengthen and expand the 'Second Chance' education programs EBA
     and PREPARA? and is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Finally, Component 4
     supports a “Pilot Temporary Employment Program? and is rated Satisfactory. All
     the ratings provided here correspond to the latest ISR from February 2012.
  3. The project’s rating with respect to achieving the project’s development objective
     is moderately satisfactory, as is the rating regarding overall implementation
     progress. As of April 2012, 76 percent of the loan had been disbursed. The
     project’s key development objective (training at-risk youth) has been achieved
     and the target (32,000 youths trained) set in the project development objective key
     results indicators was exceeded eight months prior to the current closing date (a
     total of 34,500 youths were trained as of February 2012).
  4. The main activity to be carried out using resources from Component 2
     (institutional strengthening) is the impact evaluation of the youth training
     program. The disbursement pace of Component 3, or Basic Adult Education
     (EBA) as implemented by the Ministry of Education (MoE), has been sluggish
     due to the failure of the competitive selection process to select a firm to elaborate
     and publish the textbooks of the new EBA curriculum. The MoE plans to
     complete this task with the help of individual consultants. The temporary
     employment program “Santiago Trabaja,? implemented as a pilot program under
     Component 4, has overcome initial implementation delays and is planning to
                                           6
      reach 3,400 beneficiaries by June 2012 (85 percent of the initial target). With the
      extension of the closing date, the target is expected to be met.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
  5. Two changes are proposed in this restructuring paper: a) reallocation of US$1
     million from Component 3 (implemented by MoE) to Component 1 (implemented
     by the MoL); and b) extension of the closing date of the project from June 30,
     2012 to June 30, 2013.
  6. The reallocation of the Loan proceeds will allow the GoDR to make effective use
     of project resources. Moreover, the MoL has proven to have the capacity to reach
     its stated development goals in an efficient manner, saving sufficient resources so
     as to permit the introduction of a fourth component (temporary employment
     program) in 2010. The reallocation of proceeds originally intended for use by the
     MoE implies that some of the activities falling under Component 3 will not be
     financed by the proceeds of the loan. According to the action plan presented by
     the MoE, the production and printing of the textbooks will be financed with the
     proceeds of the loan, while the dissemination of these materials will be done
     afterwards using other sources of financing,
  7. The extension of the closing date will enable the MoL to make use of the
     reallocated resources to additionally train three thousand at-risk youth, as well as
     to complete the final survey of the impact evaluation. Moreover, the MoL will be
     able to launch a fourth call for proposals to select sub-projects for the temporary
     employment program. All such sub-projects would be completed in advance of
     the new proposed closing date.


     Financing
         o Reallocation: The overall project cost remains unaltered (US$25 million).
             The component cost structure is modified by the reallocation of
             US$1million from Component 3 to Component 1.

         Closing date. The closing date of the project will be extended for 12 months, until
          June 30, 2013. This is the second extension of the closing date. A previous 12-
          month extension from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012 was approved in August 1,
          2010.

      No changes will be introduced in the project’s development objectives, results
      indicators, component structure, or safeguards, nor will this reallocation affect the
      implementation and the fiduciary arrangements (procurement and financial
      management).


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

      8. The project’s nature remains unaltered, thus the Appraisal Summary of the PAD
         remains unchanged. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the reallocation of
         resources from Component 3 to Component 1 implies a higher risk in the
         achievement of the target goals set for the MoE since these would only be
         partially achieved. The MoE has initiated a curricular reform of the Adult
         Education program, which requires the production of training materials for both
         students and teachers. Two competitive processes aimed at selecting a firm
         capable of producing these materials have failed. Consequently, the MoE decided
         not to franchise the production of materials in order to consolidate curricular
         reform, choosing rather to produce them in collaboration with individual
         consultants. The Bank project team believes that this will result in the successful
         production of training materials in advance of the new proposed closing date.
      9. The extension of the project closing date would allow the MoE to complete the
         production and printing of the training material. The 12 modules are organized in
         three cycles, which are to be elaborated in chronological order to ensure their
         quality, given the logical capacity restrictions involved in carrying out an activity
         that the MoE will perform for the first time. Once the modules of each cycle are

completed and printed, the Directorate for Adult Education will train teachers in
the new curriculum as part of the final implementation stage of the reform. The
MoE has already communicated to the World Bank that it will finance the
activities that cannot be completed within the project timeframe. These potential
delays in spending have been internalized by the MoE, allowing the GoDR to
reallocate part of the proceeds originally assigned to this ministry. Allowing MoL
to provide more training courses to at-risk youth will allow the GoDR to make
better use of those resources that have proven to be effectively and efficiently
implemented by the MoL.

1. The closing date for Dominican Republic, Dominican Republic Youth Development
   Project, IBRD-73710, P096605 will be extended from June 30, 2012 to June 30,
   2013.
2. The proposed extension is necessary to allow the MoL to provide additional training
   courses to at-risk youth, as well as to complete pending activities, such as the final
   survey of the impact evaluation, which will be carried out at the household level. The
   MoL will also be able to achieve the targets of Component 4, which provides
   temporary employment to unskilled and long-term unemployed workers. The MoE
   will be able to elaborate and print the training modules of the new Adult Education
   curriculum.
3. This will be the second extension of the project. A previous restructuring and
   extension was processed in 2010 to extend the closing date from June 30, 2011 to
   June 30, 2012 and to introduce the pilot temporary employment program that is
   financed with the resources allocated to Component 4.
