                         The Project development objective is to support the Borrower in improving the employability of: (a) poor at-risk youth by building their work experience and life skills
                         and expanding second-chance education programs to complete their formal education, and (b) poor low-skilled long-term unemployed people between the ages of 18
                         and 65.

                         The project’s main component (training at-risk youth) has been implemented quite efficiently, allowing the implementing agency (Ministry of Labor, MoL) to save $2.7m. which were

                         reallocated to include a new fourth component in 2010. The main activity carried out with the resources from component 2 (institutional strengthening) is the impact evaluation of the
                         youth training program. Although the vast majority of the planned activities (co-financed with trust funds) have been finished already, the final impact evaluation could not start the
                         data collection phase due to a) difficulties with the signing of the contract with competitively selected firm and, b) time limitations.

                         Component 3 (Basic Adult Education, EBA), implemented by the Ministry of Education (MINERD) has had a sluggish disbursement pace due to the failure of the competitive selection
                         process carried out to select a firm to elaborate and publish the textbooks of the new EBA curricula. MINERD plans to complete this task through individual consultants.

                         The temporary employment program ‘Santiago Trabaja’, implemented as pilot program in component 4, has recovered from initial implementation delays and is planning to reach
                         3,400 beneficiaries by June 2012 (85% of the initial target). The new Minister of Labor has expressed his interest in strengthening, expanding and improving the current pilot program.
