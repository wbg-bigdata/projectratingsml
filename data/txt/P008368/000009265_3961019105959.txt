IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Loan No. 2684-CY)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Republic of Cyprus' Fourth
Highway Project, for which Loan No. 2684-CY in the amount of US$20.0 million was approved
on April 4, 1986 and made effective on August 18, 1986.
The loan was closed on March 31, 1994 and the last disbursement took place on May 5,
1994. A total of $18.52 million was disbursed; $300,000 were cancelled on June 24, 1988 and
a final balance of $1.18 million was cancelled at closing. Cofinancing for the project in the
amount of $12.8 million was provided by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
This report was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of Country Department
I, Europe and Central Asia Region. The borrower provided comments that are included as an
appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR is based on the Bank's final supervision/completion mission, July
18-30, 1994 as well as on material in the project file.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Loan No. 2684-CY)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1. This project was the sixth transport project financed by the Bank in Cyprus and the fourth
in the highways subsector.  It was cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED) who had previously participated in Bank financed transport operations
in Cyprus. Earlier highway projects beginning in 1974 had focussed on upgrading the highway
system to cope with ever increasing traffic, the introduction of new technologies in road
maintenance and construction, and placing road investments on a sound basis of economic
evaluation. The other two projects were in the ports sub-sector and addressed the need to
develop the port of Limassol as a competitive container port through investment in new
technologies, institutional improvements and placing port operations on a commercial basis.
Progress was made in all these areas, although attempts to rationalize employment practices in
the ports sector encountered many difficulties and is only just beginning to make headway.
2. The Bank, during this time, developed good relations with the Cyprus authorities and the
project has continued to make important contributions to the growth of the Cyprus economy
through the alleviation of transport bottlenecks on key main roads and the improvement of access
to agricultural and tourist areas. At the same time, close cooperation with the relevant ministries
has led to a better understanding of the need to integrate the transport system into macro-
economic policy if optimum use is to be made of resources. In particular, it is now accepted that
properly funded and executed road maintenance leads to lower public and private costs, and
that an appropriate cost recovery program is essential.
Project Objectives
3. The objectives, which remained valid throughout the project, were a continuation and
expansion on the ones set in the three earlier projects. These focussed on promoting economic
growth by easing critical bottlenecks and by encouraging the integration of transport planning
and investment with the Government's macro-economic policy. In addition, since at the time
of appraisal Cyprus was approaching the point of graduation from Bank lending, it was
recognized that special attention should be paid to ensuring project sustainability through sound
financial and institutional actions. These concerns including preparation and implementation of
Road User Charges reforms, are being followed up in the ongoing Transport Sector
Development Project (TSDP) (Loan No. 2906-CY), that was approved in February 1988 and that
is at an advanced state of implementation.



iii
4. To support the achievement of these objectives the project components were:
(a)    a four year program  of rehabilitation and strengthening of sub-standard roads
especially those serving agricultural areas;
(b)    highway improvement schemes on roads where commercial and tourist traffic were
leading to major congestion problems;
(c)    a program  to improve periodic and routine maintenance based on a Road
Maintenance Management system, the provision of equipment and materials and
enhanced funding by the Government; and
(d)    the provision of consultancy services to (i) update the transport master plan; (ii)
review the road charging system; (iii) design regional traffic control measures; (iv)
design and implement a road safety program; and (v) provide general assistance in
project evaluation, design and management.
Inplementation Experience and Results
5.  The project was successful in achieving its objectives. In particular, transport bottlenecks
have been eased, thereby stimulating commercial activity and tourism. The travel time between
Larnaca and Nicosia has been reduced to 40 minutes from 1 '/2 hours. The road maintenance
backlog has been reduced, and all road projects now have to meet strict economic criteria. This
progress is reflected in the results of implementing various project components as follows:
(a)    the improvement of 43.5 km of rural roads and the rehabiilitation and strengthening
of 68 km of other priority roads was successfully carried out;
(b)    major construction to relieve the congestion on the important Larnaca/Nicosia and
Larnaca/Kophinou roads was completed;
(c)    the level of resources allocated to routine and periodic road maintenance has
reached satisfactory levels; and
(d)    most studies planned under the technical assistance component were concluded and
road safety measures and regional traffic control systems are being implemented:
the road user charges study will be carried out under the ongoing TSDP.



iv
6.  The delay of one year in completion was not excessive. This delay could possibly have
been avoided if final design and approval of a major component (Larnaca -Nicosia road financed
by the KFAED) had been cleared at local levels. The cost overrun, which was about 42%, was
partly due to delays in procurement, but mainly to increasing the quantity of works on the
Larnaca - Kophinou road and the addition of the construction of the Kophinou interchange and
the Government's decision to significantly increase the resources allocated to clearing up the
backlog of road maintenance. These decisions were sound, and the Bank agreed to them.
Finanlcing from the Bank loan was adequate although US$300,000 was cancelled due to
misprocurement and US$1,179,855 remained undisbursed at closing and was cancelled. Despite
tile Gulf War the Kuwait fund had no problems in meeting its financing obligations in a timely
manner and the Cyprus Government was consistent in the provision of local finance.
7.  Strict comparisons cannot be made between the appraised project and the project at
completion due to changes in the project components (particularly as a result of design changes
of the Larnaca/Nicosia and Larnaca/Kophinou roads). Consequently, it was decided that a more
realistic assessment of the achievement of project targets would result from the calculation of
the First Year Rate of Return (FYRR) of each component, based on actual costs and actual
traffic. With the exception of five roads, which are expected to yield rapidly increasing benefits
as traffic grows, the FYRR of all components exceed the ERR estimated at appraisal. The total
project FYRR was calcuiated at 58% compared with the appraisal ERR estimate of 44% and the
eventLial ERR is normally expected to exceed the FYRR. These excellent results were mostly
due to the gradual but increasing Bank/Borrower cooperation in the sector, continuity of
personnel and Government commitment to the project objectives, and the establishment of
limited targets within a realistic time frame. The outcome of the project was more than
satisfactory.
Sununary of Finidings and Key Lessons Learned
8. As might be expected with a mature borrower, the lessons learned do not point to
shortcomings in the Borrower's institutional setting nor in project implementation. As far as the
Governm-ient of Cyprus is concerned, the primary findings of the report are that (i) the
cumbersome procurement procedures of the Government not only lead to delays but also to a
waste of personnel resources, both the Borrower's and the Bank's; and (ii) the Planning Bureau
should give the executing agency much greater autonomy over technical matters once a program
of works has been agreed. As regards the Bank, two conclusions stand out: (a) simplicity in
project design seems to be among the main reasons for project success, and (b) project objectives
and the plans for achieving them should be fully discussed during preparation and should be
contained within a realistic time frame. While the project has been mostly successful in
achieving its physicai objectives, a closer adherence to these points would have further improved
physical implementation of the project.
9. The ongoing TSDP is the last operation in the sector and was approved just before Cyprus
graduated from Bank lending. As such, it is building upon the achievements of earlier projects
and, relying on Government support and commitment, should lead to sustainable project
objectives and sound performance of the sector.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Loan 2684-CY)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Review From Bank's Perspective
1.   Project Objectives
1.01    This project, with parallel cofinancing by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (KFAED),' was the Bank's fourth lending operation in the highway sub-sector and
the sixth in the transport sector, the other two being ports projects. The objectives defined at
the time of appraisal were:
(a)  the establishment of a planning and policy framework and methodology for the
transport sector; this included the updating of a Transport Sector Master Plan
(TSMP) and the continued development of a Ministry of Communications and
Works (MCW), Public Works Department (PWD)  capability to undertake
economic evaluation and supervision of projects;
(b)  the design and introduction of a sustainable and cost effective road maintenance
management and highway maintenance system (RMMS) and, in association with
the RMMS, to increase resource allocation to road maintenance, to study and
reform the method of levying road user charges and to control vehicle loading;
(c)  the upgrading of low strength and limited capacity roads to better serve traffic
generated by rural development and the rapidly growing tourist industry; and
(d)  the design and implementation of a highway safety program.
1.02    The objectives, which remained valid throughout the project, were a continuation and
expansion of objectives in the previous three highway projects. They focussed on easing critical
traffic bottlenecks caused by the increasing pressures on the road and transport system, and by
encouraging the integration of transport planning and investment with the Government's macro-
I A statement of Kuwait Fund loans during the same period is attached as Appendix A.

economic policy. Traffic growth was high, about 8% p.a., generated by Cyprus' economic
growth record (5.8% p.a. between 1980 and 1989) in a small and heavily populated island (114
people per sq. km. in 1989, excluding the large annual influx of tourists). In addition, Cyprus
was approaching the stage of economic growth when it would no longer be eligible for Bank
financing. Consequently, the wish to raise the level of project analysis, implementation and
management prior to "graduation" in order to support project sustainability. Furthermore, at
the time of project preparation and appraisal the pressures on the country's environment,
especially antiquities and a very fragile eco-system, were becoming obvious and the Bank
introduced the concept - strengthened and developed under the ongoing Transport Sector
Development Project (TSDP) (Ln. 2906-CY) - of environmental impact studies for all major
road development projects.
1.03   In order to achieve these objectives the project comprised and financed:
(a)   a four year tranche of rehabilitation and strengthening sub-standard roads
especially those serving rural areas;
(b)  highway improvement schemes, in particular those linking major population and
tourism areas and those roads connecting with Larnaca International Airport;
these schemes were the subject of KFAED parallel cofinancing;
(c)  a four year program of improved routine and periodic highway maintenance
including paving equipment and materials; and
(d)  the provision of consultancy services to (i) undertake transport sector planning
studies including updating the Transport Master Plan; (ii) review the road user
charging system; (iii) study of regional/area traffic control; (iv) undertake a
study of road accidents and to implement a road safety program; and (v) to
provide general assistance in project evaluation, design and management.
1.04    As noted earlier, this was the fourth highway sub-sector project and sixth in the
transport sector. Consequently, the Cyprus authorities were well aware of Bank and KFAED
procedures and requirements. However, the Borrower still failed to accept in its entirety the
Bank's procurement procedures and this led to delays and, in one case, cancellation of part of
the loan. Also, due to the Government's policy of financial stringency during much of the period
it was not possible to recruit the additional staff necessary to strengthen the project
implementation unit and, consequently, staff was overstretched; nonetheless, the PWD treated
project objectives seriously and despite delays they were largely fulfilled. Two main issues
remain and these are the very cumbersome procurement procedures of the Government and the
day-to-day involvement of the Planning Bureau in what are essentially technical matters, which
are not conducive to efficient operations.



3
2.      Achievement of Project Objectives
2.01    The project was successful in the achievement of its objectives. Transport bottlenecks
have been eased (journey time between Larnaca International Airport and tourist resorts and
Nicosia have been reduced from 11/2 hours to 40 minutes), the maintenance backlog has been
reduced and all road investment projects now have to meet strict economic criteria. This is
reflected in the satisfactory completion of project components:
(a)   The updating of the Transport Sector Master Plan (TSMP) was carried out
satisfactorily and provides a sound basis for future investment and strategy in the
transport sector. However, the Government has yet to undertake a thorough
review of the TSMP and to provide the necessary links between the TSMP
recommendations and macro-economic policy. This is particularly important as
regards commercialization/privatization and cost recovery. Action on this issue
is important and should be a priority objective of the Planning Bureau and the
planning units of the individual transport modes including the private sector. It
is probable that technical assistance will be required to help in this activity. The
Planning Bureau should be more concerned with this than with the minutiae of
day-to-day operations of the individual transport agencies.  The Project
Management Unit of the PWD has, with its limited resources (poor computing
facilities and limited staff who also have a need for skills enhancement),
performed well, but it should be given an active project, program and policy
initiating role as opposed to its current passive position.
(b)  The Road Maintenance Management System (RMMS) has been designed and
introduced and is working satisfactorily as a basis for planning and budgeting
routine and periodic expenditure.  Road maintenance resources have been
steadily increased at an average rate of almost 12% pa compared with the
construction price index of 4% pa. The 1994 maintenance allocation for roads,
administered and maintained by the PWD, amounted to L CYP 5.05 million or
about US$5,000/km. Whilst it is recognized that there is some backlog of
maintenance still to be addressed and that this figure also includes bridges,
US$5,000/km is not an unreasonable figure for the network as a whole,
considering that much of it consists of lightly trafficked roads. The RMMS has
consistently given figures 30%-50% higher than those actually allocated,
suggesting that RMMS coefficients might need to be recalibrated.
(c)  The level of control of vehicle axle loads has been improved and there are now
five high speed/low speed weigh-in-motion (WIM) facilities operational in key
locations. One low speed WIM site is under construction and five more are
planned; most of the equipment for these has been procured. Records of vehicle
weighing and prosecutions require improvement to make analysis easier and this



4
should be addressed. However, a sample examination indicates that, on main
roads between 4 % and 5 % of vehicles weighed exceeded the legal limit of which
60% were prosecuted and 40% given written warnings; fines vary from
LCyplO to LCyp400 and once parking areas at the weighing facilities have been
enlarged, a policy of compulsory off-loading of overweight vehicles will be
introduced. On District roads, where portable weigh-bridges are used, the
percentage of overweight vehicles is nearer 20%, probably due to the older and
smaller two axle vehicles being operated - especially during the harvest periods;
80% of the operators of these vehicles were prosecuted. On the whole, these
findings are quite good.
(d)  The study and reform of the method of levying road user charges was not
undertaken under the project. This was due to the procurement of consultancy
services being delayed and it was agreed between the Bank and the Borrower
that it was not necessary to extend the loan closing date for this component, but
that it would be undertaken under the ongoing Loan 2906-CY. 2
(e)  At Appraisal it was proposed to improve and rehabilitate approximately 100 km
of rural and secondary roads and at loan closing work on 111 km had been
achieved. In addition, the major upgrading of the Larnaca - Nicosia road and
the Larnaca - Kophinou road (financed by the KFAED), although experiencing
a significant cost overrun, was successfully completed. All of these components
were subjected to an economic analysis satisfactory to the Bank.
(f)   As a result of mis-procurement, the proposed Road Safety Study was removed
from the project and US$300,000 cancelled from the loan. However, the
Government proceeded with the study which was satisfactorily completed and its
recommendations are being implemented. Monitoring of the results of remedial
actions needs to be expanded and strengthened.
3.   Implementation Record
3.01    The loan closing date was originally scheduled for the March 31, 1993. In the event
this was postponed until March 31, 1994. The original cost estimate was US$68.9 million and
the final cost estimate (not all final contract payments have yet been made) is US$98. 11 million.
The cost overrun has been met by the Government and KFAED.
3.02    The delay in project completion was occasioned primarily by slow and cumbersome
procurement procedures and problems in obtaining agreement on an economically and
2      Proposals have been invited.

environmentally acceptable alignment for the Larnaca - Nicosia road. Although design of this
road was "substantially complete" at the time of appraisal by both the Bank and the KFAED,
it had not been cleared with Parliament or the local population and, as a result, major changes
had to be made after the loans became effective which led to delays and higher costs. This is
an issue which should be paid special attention in all projects and should, perhaps, be tackled
within the context of an environmental impact study. This was a timely lesson for MCW that
the public now expect to have input into major alignment decisions and during the same period
the climate towards environmental factors was developing fast. These problems have been
avoided in subsequent alignment decisions. The cost overrun was due to a number of factors:
(a) contract award delays and alignment changes on the Larnaca - Nicosia road, which led to a
significant increase in earthworks and compensation; (b) the decision to reconstruct the entire
Larnaca - Kophinou road and to construct the Kophinou interchange (KFAED-financed); (c) the
Government's decision to undertake a larger program of periodic maintenance; and (d) in the
case of the rural road improvement program and the rehabilitation and strengthening program,
an underestimate of the program cost. It is clear that the Government could obtain savings
through improving procurement procedures. This could be achieved by streamlining the
operations of the Tender Board and also by providing the executing agencies with greater
autonomy, especially by limiting the authority of the Planning Bureau over day-to-day decisions.
3.03    Procurement of goods and services, although slow (typically contract review, approval
and award takes 5-6 months if there are no unusual features) and with the exception of one
case of misprocurement (paragraph 5.02), experienced no major problems. It had been feared
that the Gulf War and its aftermath would seriously affect project implementation but the
commendable speed with which the KFAED relocated its operations to London prevented these
events leading to delays in disbursement of the KFAED loan.
4.   Project Sustainability
4.01    The implementation of this, the fourth, project in the highway sub-sector has shown
a strong commitment by the Government and executing agency to the agreed objectives. This
view is supported by the actions being taken under the ongoing TSDP (Ln. 2906-CY) to (i)
promote road safety; (ii) enforce vehicle axle load legislation; (iii) revise the road user charging
system; (iv) relate the road maintenance budgeting procedure to the RMMS; and (v) implement
the recommendations of the regional/area traffic control study. Furthermore, all proposed
projects are now subjected to conventional economic analysis and the Highway Design and
Maintenance Model (HDM3) is routinely used in maintenance decisions and road rehabilitation
and upgrading programs. Consequently, there is a reasonable expectation that the project,
supported by earlier Bank participation in the sub-sector and the ongoing TSDP, will have the
expected long-term impact on the performance of the highway sub-sector.
4.02   It is of course necessary to recognize that external economic forces may from time to
time have a significant effect upon the performance of the highway system and the agencies
directly concerned. However, the authorities now seem to accept fully the need to maintain the
road system, and it is to be hoped that in times of financial stringency road maintenance will
continue to be accorded adequate priority. The introduction of a revised road user charging
policy should assist in keeping maintenance on a stable and consistent footing. The only issues
to raise concern are:



6
the limited resources allocated to the project management/planning unit which 3
could make long- and medium-term planning and monitoring difficult;
less than adequate autonomy of the executing agency, especially in day-to-day
decision taking; and
-   continued delays in the procurement of goods and services.
These should continue to be addressed under the ongoing Transport project and in the executing
agency's Operational Plan for the future.
5.   Bank Performance
5.01    The project was a continuation of previous Bank activity in the sub-sector but with
greater emphasis on supporting Government macro-economic policy. This involved controlling
public expenditure and giving priority to infrastructure improvements that would clearly support
economic development, particularly tourism  and agriculture.  Project identification and
preparation developed jointly by the Bank and the Borrower addressed these issues.
5.02    Relations between the Bank and the Borrower during preparation and implementation
were satisfactory and such problems as arose concerned procurement. However, these problems
did not substantively affect project performance. In the one case where the funds for the road
safety study were cancelled due to misprocurement, the Cyprus authorities proceeded with the
study using their own finance. Where a delay in procurement made it impossible to carry out
the road user charges study under the loan, the Bank agreed that the study could be undertaken
in the ongoing Transport Sector Development project.
6.   Borrower Performance
6.01    Taking into account the several changes in political representatives and senior civil
servants and the extent to which these personnel participate in procurement decisions, the
Borrower's performance at all stages was satisfactory. There is still a need, however, to make
the procurement process more efficient through definition of clear and relevant procedures and,
consequently, a reduction in the number of personnel involved. The Bank, during preparation,
had prepared a report on this matter but the Cyprus authorities took no action.
6.02    Despite the delays in procurement, and the interference of the Planning Bureau
(paragraph 3.02), the project achieved its objectives and was only delayed by one year. The
executing agency performed satisfactorily and should be able to sustain the progress generated.
It is, nonetheless, necessary to strengthen the resources of the Planning Unit and to review the
results of the RMMS and the response of the road maintenance budgeting procedures.
3      The unit is being strengthened under Loan 2906-CY.

7.    Assessment of Outcome
7.01    Despite the one year delay in project completion and the cost overrun, the project is
considered to have been more than satisfactory. Physical objectives were achieved contributing
to continued growth of the economy whilst taking account of environmental needs. At the same
time significant progress was made in most institutional and policy initiatives such as project
evaluation, axle load control, road maintenance planning and allocation of resources to road
maintenance and road safety measures.
7.02    The most significant deficiencies lay in the failure to implement an improved road use
charging system and to speed up procurement procedures. The former is being addressed under
the current TSDP and the authorities recognize the need to rationalize procurement procedures.
7.03    Table 9 summarizes the economic re-evaluation of the project. Several changes were
made to project components during the course of implementation and the various construction,
improvement and maintenance components started at different times. Also, in several cases post-
investment traffic data were insufficient to establish clear trends. For these reasons a strict
comparison could not be made with the economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at the time of
appraisal. Consequently, it was considered that it would be more realistic to calculate first year
rates of return (FYRR) for each component for which actual costs and actual traffic flows were
available. It is reasonable to assume that the eventual ERR will be greater than the FYRR.
These individual actual FYRRs are given in the final column of Table 9 (Re-evaluated First Year
Rate of Return) and compared with the appraisal estimate of the ERR. From this it can be seen
that with the exception of five components the FYRR exceeded estimated ERRs. The five roads
mentioned all have high traffic growth rates and are expected to become economically viable in
the near future. An overall project FYRR was calculated by taking the average of the individual
component FYRR weighted by the cost of each component investment: this shows that the
project as a whole had a FYRR of 58% compared with the project ERR estimated at appraisal
of 44%. The project clearly is exceeding the appraisal target.
8.   Future Operation
8.01    The Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) has prepared an operational plan
attached as Appendix B setting out criteria to be monitored and reporting frequency which is
satisfactory. The ongoing Transport Sector Development Project (Loan 2906-CY), which is
expected to close on December 31, 1995, will provide a vehicle for the initial monitoring of
continuation and sustainability of the Fourth Highway Project's achievements and objectives,
through the use of this plan.
8.02    The long relationship between the Bank and the Cyprus authorities in the transport
sector has steadily led to the Government adopting sound planning procedures and a basic
institutional framework to support them.  It is upon this that the future operation and
achievement of objectives will depend. The Government's commitment appears assured and,
as the Banks lending role ceases with Cyprus' graduation from lending, it is upon this assurance
that project sustainability will rely. A further influence will be Cyprus' wish to become more
closely associated with and, eventually, a member of the European Union which will require
adherence to sound economic policies.



8
8.03    The most important issues to focus upon are the:
(a)  impact of road works and traffic upon the environment, especially the rich
historical and cultural heritage and fragile eco-system which is under great
pressure. The Bank, through the TSDP, is already participating closely with the
Government in the protection of mosaics in Paphos and has persuaded the
Government to include environmental assessments in all feasibility studies;
(b)  design and introduction of an improved road user charging policy to provide
adequate finance for road maintenance and improvement and to optimize the use
of transport resources: the Government has agreed to undertake this as part of
the ongoing TSDP;
(c)  continuation of the implementation and monitoring of road safety measures: this
is receiving the full support of the authorities (MOC, Police, Ministry of
Education etc) but requires an increased allocation of resources to the MOC
Planning Unit responsible;
(d)  overall strengthening of the Planning Unit so that, although responsible to the
Director of the PWD and cooperating with other Government planning
departments and Ministry of Finance, it may operate with technical autonomy
without the frequent requirement to consult non-technical departments or to get
clearance on the minutiae of already agreed policies or projects; this objective
should be discussed and agreed with the Government in the context of the TSDP;
and
(e)  the Roads Department also has to consult too frequently with organizations such
as the Planning Bureau on day to day technical matters and low level
procurement issues which leads to delays in project planning and
implementation: again this should be taken up urgently with the Government in
the framework of the TSDP.
9.    Key Lessons Learned
9.01    This project was the fourth highway project and, during the Bank's involvement in the
sub-sector a satisfactory relationship was developed with the Borrower: also there was
remarkable continuity among most of the Bank's and executing agency's personnel.
Consequently, there were very few problems and as in many other Bank projects, a lesson is that
continuity of personnel is a major advantage in project implementation. However, project
implementation was delayed and gives rise to the following lessons:
For the government:
(i)   Procurement procedures in Cyprus remain cumbersome and slow: too many
people and agencies are involved and many of these are not familiar with the
Bank's procurement process.



9
(ii)  The other key issue to be highlighted is the need for the executing agency to be
given professional autonomy for project implementation. Once a program or
project has been cleared by the Government non-technical agencies should not
participate in day to day design and implementation measures. This is not the
case in Cyprus and it leads to delays or failure in meeting project objectives.
For the Bank the lessons are as follows:
(i)  implementation success is linked to simplicity and clarity of the project
objectives; and;
(ii)  it is essential that the project's objectives and provisions be fully discussed with
all parties likely to be involved during the preparation and appraisal process.

*        Estimated first year rate of return assuming vehicle operating cost savings averaging US$0.12 km.
**       Design changed to completely reconstruct the Larnaca/Kophinou road and to build the Kophinou interchange:
it has not been possible to calculate specific benefits of the interchange or to separate construction costs and,
thus, the rate of return is underestimated.
The Government undertook a larger program of periodic maintenance than originally conceived but, bearing
in mind the backlog in maintenance (see Appraisal report), there is no reason to suspect a significantly lower
rate of return.

The Fourth 1iiihway Projccl was a natural continualion) of the Third Highway
Project, also fimanced by Ihe World Bank, and which was conipleted In 1990, I'he project
was started in 1986 and conprised of a good balance betweeen road conslirtctioi) and rond
relaed Atudles crried out by consultants.
2.     lho  wanik's satafT memibers have contributed significantly to the identlifcation,
proparadon, appraisal, negotiation, and implementation/supervision or the Priojec,, by
focusing attontion on issues and procedures of impornance, bolli at senior and lower levels or
adininistration. This was done tactfully and by exemplit'ing caso of ac1ion taken in similar
Oircumstancea a3 set out in 1he Rank's guidelines. The exetpIona1 level of cooperation
attalied between the PWL) and the Bank's stafr during the course of the Third liighway
Project was taken fiLrther along throughout the dura(ion ofl the Fourth Highway Project.
Principles of collaboration established in the former Project were continuccl in tlie latter. in
addition to these, the following concepts were futilter established:
(a)      flvaluationi of proposals. The two level evatuationi of bids (tec.hnical and financlal
evaluation) was fwurher adjtusted ilt orcler to isprovC tl]he quality or tlhc proposals.
More specillcally, tic additional requircmont that only ror those finns whose
techatcal evalualomt score lUeu witlin x5%o of the tup scoring finn the finrncial
proposals wouild be considered, was addod. Furthermore, the expected disciplines
oreapoitlsc provided by the consultants tojoilhcr with the oplimunu  and rni'iiiunu
perton-month requIremeni for the successful completion of a Btudy were
stipulated, and these were used an weights in the evaluntion ol the calibre of the
porsonnel proposed by each competing finn. This ensured that, on the one hand,
proposals wort more balaaced in terms of their staflT iiputs, while on the otlier
hand, the basis of evaluation was more unrfonn.
(b)      A goater cmphasis was placed on environmcntl impact analysis as an integral
part or any study conducted by consultants on behalr of the Department. 'I'he
teias ortererence oxplicitly stated laIt an UIA was required as a separate chapter
in tlie Final Repozt and that this was to be asi additional criterion, beyond the
econolmic evaluation, in vctablishing the feasibiliiy or a project or delcmrintag the
optimum alternative solution.
(c)      l'he economic evaluAtion of road projects lias become an integral part of the
Department's project appraisal process, even for small projects not Onanced by the
World Bank or other financing agencies. 'o this purpose, a simple cost bcneflt
computer model was developed by the Dcparinmit's staff, which was and still Ls

extensively used Ini order to dotormina O1c feasibility and pcglng  order ur
proposed road suhemrs.
(d)       Road sLfety has becomo an increaiing considcralion in plinning new roads. T he
executioni of a Road Safety Study under the auspices or the Fourth Iiighway
Project and the subsequent establishment of a computerised Road Accident
Management Systen) has been instiumnental in anilysing and moiiitoring all road
accidents in the country.  or particular Importance has been the itbility to
detemine black spots, tlius establishing end prioritising low cost remedial
nieasures. The involvement of the Police in this systenu has resulted in closer
c)Opefibion betwecn the Traffic Unit of the Plolloc and thy IPWD, and a conmmon
language orreforcnce was established with reference to road accidonts.
(e)       *Ihe Regional rTraflic Control Study was one or the most ambitious projccts ever
undertaken by our Department. 'he subsequent Urbaii Traffic C'ontrol Systenm,
which was developed and constructed in accordance to the findings of this study,
has greatly enhanced the niobility of vehicles In urban areas, by minirni6ing
delays at signalised intcrsections. The perpetual trend ol cvcr increasing traMc
congestion due to the growth in oar ownerslhip was flisally arrested aned in tIle
short-term at leau  reversed,
,-.    'thec  uccessfil discipline, of regular reporting as part of the admlninistration and
management or the projects, established in the course of the I hird I iglivay Project, was
sinillarly pronmotcd during the Fourth Iighway Projecl with equal suocess. l'hese quarterly
reporls together with the Iwilck't aide memoires providod a very fortuitous forunm  or
conmunication between the two pats. The regular visits or tlhe D3ank's staff, tO rollow up
the projects, further cemented this association, while additionally served the purpose of
establishing a warm and persona1 rclailonship between the persons involved thus inducing a
ct;nmale or trust and cooperation.

.FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 2684-CY)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
WORLD BANK MISSION (JULY 23-30. 19941
AIDE MEMOIRE
In accordance with terms of reference dated the 12th July, 1994, I visited Cyprus to
initiate the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report on the Fourth Highway
Project, the closing date of which was 31st March, 1994. I wish to record my thanks to the
Cyprus authorities for the warm welcome and extensive cooperation received during my
mission. At this stage the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), who
provided parallel cofinancing, has not participated in the report preparation.
During my mission I collected relevant project information and discussed project
implementation with a range of personnel who had been involved in the design and execution
of the project. It was not possible in the time available to obtain all the data necessary and it
was agreed that the balance would be faxed to me during the first half of August. I also
explained to the authorities the objectives and methodology of the ICR. In particular, the
preparation of the project's Operation Plan was discussed, and a summary of this briefing is
annexed to this Aide Memoire. It was agreed with the Public Works Department that the
Operation Plan, together with the borrower's Part II of the ICR, would be prepared and
faxed to the Bank before the end of September, 1994.
The project, despite an unused loan balance of nearly US$1 million, generally
achieved its objectives of improving the road system, providing greater resources for road
maintenance, introducing regional traffic control and providing a long term strategy for
transport planning. However, institutional issues still need to be addressed and these should
be tackled in the time remaining under the ongoing Transport Sector Development Project
(Loan 2906-CY) and the proposed Operation Plan. Priority issues include:
-     shortening procurement procedures and giving the Public Works Department
greater autonomy;
-     avoiding time consuming day to day interference in, primarily engineering
decisions by the planning authorities;
-     revising the road user charging policy;
-     allocating increased personnel and equipment resources to the Planning and
Road Maintenance units, including more senior staff and a computer based
data base system covering all PWD responsibilities;



Appgndix D

providing closer and better coordination among the roads and town planning
authorities in order to ensure that investments, such as the Limassol by-pass,
provide a long-term solution to traffic problems and are not overtaken by
largely uncontrolled building development; and
instituting and carrying out close monitoring of the impact of actions taken to
alleviate road accident black-spots.
The need to respect the target dates for providing the balance of the data requested
and the ICR Part II and Operation Plan in order to complete preparation and review of the
ICR by the scheduled date of December 31st, 1994 was emphasized to the Cypriot
authorities.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 2684-CY)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
PROJECT OPERATION PLAN BRIEFING FOR PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT
The Borrower should prepare his own project evaluation report and submit this to the
Bank by the end of September, 1994. This is similar to Part II of the old Project Completion
Report (PCR) and should cover the project's execution, initial operation, costs and benefits,
the Bank's and Borrower's performance of their obligations under the loan agreement and the
extent to which the purposes of the loan were achieved.
The main difference between the old PCR and the ICR is that the Borrower must also
prepare a Project Operation Plan acceptable to the Bank covering the continued operation of
the Project. This plan, which may be prepared in a table form if desired, should focus on
those measures which will be taken to ensure the sustainability and development of project
objectives beyond the loan closing date. It should also establish monitoring criteria and
procedures for the achievement of the Plan.
In the case of the Fourth Highway Project, which should also be related to the
ongoing Transport Sector Development Project, the Operation Plan and monitoring should
play special attention to, although not be limited to, the following topics:
(a)   continuation of an economically justified rural road improvement program;
(b)   allocation of adequate resources to road maintenance based on the Road
Maintenance Management System;
(c)   implementation and expansion of the road safety program;
(d)   continued use and improvement of economic and environmental evaluation
techniques including the strengthening of the relevant units;
(e)   updating the Transport Sector Master Plan;
(f)   development and implementation of an improved road user charging system
that provides adequate funds for road maintenance and investment and which
adequately reflects the costs imposed by different categories of road user; and
(g)   improvement of the structure and staff capability of the Roads Department of
the Public Works Department.



Appendix D
Page 4 of 4
This Project Operation Plan should be described in sufficient detail and, if possible,
summarized in a table of the following form:
SUMMARY OF POLICY  MONITORING                     REPORTING
OBJECTIVE  AND PROCEDURES       CRITERIA      RESPONSIBILITY  SCHEDULE
It would be useful to prepare the Project Operation Plan and update it in the form of a
six-monthly report which should also have annexed to it information on (a) previous, current
and next year's budgeted road expenditure by category; and (b) previous, current and next
year's estimated revenue from road user charges.
