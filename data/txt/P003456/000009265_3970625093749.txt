IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2958)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Phosphate
Development Project in China, for which Loan 2958-CHA in the amount of $62.7 million
was approved on January 31, 1989, and made effective on April 28, 1989.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1995, following two one-year extensions to
the original loan closing date of December 31, 1993. Final disbursement took place on
February 22, 1996, following provision of a four-month grace period.
The ICR was prepared by Christopher Wardell, Industry and Mining Division,
Industry and Energy Department, Finance and Private Sector Development and reviewed
by Mr. Austin Hu, Acting Chief, Environment and Municipal Development Operations
Division, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, and by Mr. Yo Kimura, Project Advisor,
EA2DR. The Borrower provided inputs to the ICR that are included as Annexes.
Preparation of this report was begun during the Bank's ICR mission in January
1996. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by exchanging views on the project preparation, procurement,
implementation and initial operations' experience and related issues; by preparing its own
set of evaluations on the project's preparation and execution; and by commenting on the
draft ICR.

CHINA
PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2958-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Phosphate Development Project was one of four fertilizer projects financed
by the Bank in China to assist in implementing the three top priorities that the
Government had set for the sector, which the Bank agreed with, namely: (a) expansion,
rehabilitation and energy saving in nitrogen production; (b) rapid expansion of phosphate
fertilizer capacity using locally available phosphate rock; and (c) development of
domestic potash resources. The first project-the Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy
Saving Project (Loan 2541 -CHA) dealt with four large- and medium-sized ammonia/urea
plants. The second project was the Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan 2838-CHA),
which was to improve efficiencies at five plants, expand phosphate production at one of
them, and improve institutional capacities through the introduction of modem financial
and operational management.  The third and fourth projects were the Phosphate
Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA)-the subject of this ICR-and the Hubei
Phosphate Project (Loan 3066-CHA), both of which were to expand phosphate supplies
both in their own right and as demonstration projects for further development of the
country's phosphate resources.
Project Objectives
2.    The project was to assist China in achieving its priority goals for the fertilizer
sector, especially in reducing the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by expanding
production of phosphate fertilizers from domestic phosphate resources. The project was
to devise appropriate strategies including an optimal investment program to meet
phosphate needs in a least-cost manner; develop the first major mine in the investment
program; and strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Chemical Industries (MCI) to
plan development of chemical subsectors, including phosphates.
3.    During project preparation, a Phosphate Subsector Study was carried out jointly
by MCI and the Bank, which defined an investment program to develop local phosphate
deposits. The phosphate deposit at Wengfu was chosen as the first major investment as it
would demonstrate efficient development of domestic phosphate deposits using modem
mining and beneficiation technologies. There were also consultancy services to install
and further develop the computer-based phosphate investment optimization model and to
improve management and operations/maintenance practices at the Wengfu project.

Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Although project implementation was delayed, and the independent project for
construction of the triple superphosphate (TSP) fertilizer plant' that was originally
expected to use the project's output is even further delayed, the project is likely to reach
and sustain the main development objective of supplying additional phosphate
concentrates to the fertilizer market and thus help decrease the nitrogen-phosphate-
potassium (N-P-K) imbalance in fertilizers-an important aspect of sector policy;
physical objectives will be met by early 1998 when the TSP fertilizer plant is completed
(para. 7); substantial institutional development at the Wengfu Mining and Fertilizer
Development Group (WMFDG), the implementing agency, has taken place (para. 11);
environmental protection has been integrated into the project (para. 12); the financial and
economic rates of return at 13.9 and 10.2 percent, respectively, although lower than
originally forecast, are acceptable; and prices for the project output are based on market
conditions (para. 13). The beneficiation plant performance and reliability tests were
successful and a strong and experienced management and operations team has been
developed at WMFDG. On the basis of these developments, the project is considered
sustainable
5.    The technical assistance component of the project dealing with subsector
investment optimization was partly successful as preliminary runs of the computer model
gave clear signals for the priority investments in the phosphate sector-including
Wengfu. However, the transfer of the subsector optimization model to MCI was not
achieved, although computer facilities were established at MCI and are in use on
statistical and planning tasks.
6.    The project was completed at a cost of $243.3 million, compared to the forecast
cost of $221.8 million (Part II, Table 7A). Financing arrangements were essentially as
planned (Part II, Table 7B) with central and provincial governments covering the major
part of the financing not covered by the Bank loan. However, due to an initial shortage of
central government funds, the implementing agency was obliged to take short-term and
relatively high-interest commercial loans from local banks. The project construction was
completed in March 1995 compared to the planned construction completion date of June
1994, a delay of some nine months. The commissioning of the beneficiation plant was
finished in September 1995.
7.    Certain key factors affected the achievement of the project objectives in a timely
manner. Government approval of the project was delayed, which in turn delayed
agreement on  local funds  to  commence  construction.    Throughout  project
implementation, delays continued in the Government's mobilization of funds for
The TSP plant will be completed three years late at end-1997. It is outside of the scope and financing of the
Bank-financed project but is an important part of the operation as most of the phosphate concentrate is planned
to be used in the TSP plant.



- vi -
construction. These delays were caused in part by the increased local currency costs due
to higher-than-expected local rates of inflation and the credit squeezes implemented by
Government during the project period. During the initial procurement phases, WMFDG
incurred delays in finalizing technical specifications for equipment and plant items to be
procured by international competitive bidding. The most serious delay was in the
agreement between the Government and bilateral agencies for funding the TSP plant,
which is now scheduled for completion in late-1997. WMFDG has done well in
identifying alternative domestic and export markets for its phosphate concentrate
products, but limited rail transportation capacity to export ports could constrain the
operation from achieving the full physical objective of 1.8 million tons per year (Mtpy)
phosphate concentrates until the TSP plant comes on stream. The implementing agency
handled construction management and supervision well but did not fully utilize
construction management, scheduling and monitoring tools. The Bank could have done
better during project implementation by providing more appropriate and extensive staff
resources at regular intervals to support implementation by identifying key
implementation issues, and then defining action plans.
8.    Due to the remedial measures taken, however, the major development objective is
likely to be met. The project represents the first, large-scale, high-technology phosphate
mine and beneficiation plant built in China and has thus provided a sound basis for
subsequent subsector developments.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
9.    Domestic market constraints required WMFDG  to identify export market
opportunities pending completion of the TSP plant. Since constraints in rail transport
capacity out of Guizhou province have imposed limitations on exports, Government has
committed itself to assist WMFDG to gain access to an increasing share of available rail
capacity until the TSP plant is commissioned. Thereafter, marketing of products should
not present an issue. The presence of strong and experienced WMFDG management and
operations personnel should ensure project sustainability (Section D).
10.   There are three key lessons to be learned from the project implementation
experience. First, it is essential to ensure that all components that are important to the
project are integrated and proceed simultaneously. If one component is missing or
delayed (the separate TSP plant project in this case), the project cannot reach its
objectives in the original timeframe. Second, no matter how much care is exercised
during project preparation and appraisal, implementation issues will arise and the Bank
can provide greater assistance in resolving these issues by assigning the necessary
supervision resources. Finally, it is important to earmark funds for technical assistance
components in a more precise manner. This was not done for the implementation of, and
training for, the subsector investment optimization model and affected the development
of skills in MCI (Section I).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2958-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    The project was to assist China in achieving one of its priority goals for the
fertilizer sector under the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans, namely to correct the
nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by expanding the production capacity for phosphate
fertilizers, particularly for high-grade products such as triple superphosphate (TSP) and
Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP), based on domestic phosphate resources.
2.    More specifically, the project was to help Government:
(a)   devise appropriate strategies for developing an efficient phosphate
industry, including an optimal investment program to meet phosphate
needs in a least-cost manner;
(b)   implement the first major mine development of the investment program;
and,
(c)   strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Chemical Industries (MCI) to
plan the development of the chemical subsectors, including phosphates.
3.    During project preparation, considerable progress was made in meeting points (a)
and (c) through the Phosphate Subsector Study to define an investment program to the
year 2000 to develop local phosphate deposits. The Study was carried out jointly by MCI
and the Bank.
4.    Wengfu was chosen to be the first major investment to be implemented as it
would provide a demonstration model for the efficient development of domestic
phosphate deposits using modern mining and beneficiation technologies. The project was
expected to increase China's local supply of phosphate rock by about 25 percent.
5.    The project had two major components:
(a)   Wengfu Mine Development-namely, to start up and operate: (1) an
open-pit mine at Wengfu in Guizhou Province; (2) a modem beneficiation



plant to produce concentrate at the mine site; and (3) a slurry pipeline to
carry the concentrate some 50 kilometers (km) to the rail siding; and,
(b)   technical assistance, which included:
(i)   consultancy services for project management and mine workshop
maintenance; and,
(ii)   technical assistance for developing a computer-based sector
investment optimization model; the model was to be installed,
maintained and further developed by MCI to strengthen its
subsector planning capability.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    Sector Policy Improvements. During project preparation, the important sector
policy issue of correcting the imbalance in fertilizer nutrient use, as regards phosphates,
was examined in detail by the Bank and MCI in concert. Methodologies for identifying
the most cost effective solutions were developed, and specific investment
recommendations were made that have formed the basis for other projects in the sector.
7.    Physical Objectives. The project was designed to produce 2.5 million tons per
year (Mtpy) of phosphate ore for processing in the beneficiation plant designed to yield
1.8 Mtpy of phosphate concentrates starting January 1994. The major portion of the
concentrates (1.2 Mtpy) were to be supplied to a TSP fertilizer plant to be constructed at
the terminus of the slurry pipeline adjacent to the rail loading facilities, the balance
(0.6 Mtpy) to be supplied to five compound-fertilizer plants under construction across
China. Project construction commenced in November 1990, approximately 18 months
behind the original plan of June 1989, due to delays in Government approval of the
project design and in the mobilization of local funds and in procurement. Construction
was completed in 53 months in March 1995, somewhat faster than the original forecast of
60 months. Beneficiation plant load tests were successfully completed in April 1995 and
performance tests in September 1995. All performance indicators were reached or
exceeded. Preproduction operations continued through April 1996, after which full
commercial operation commenced. The annual production of phosphate concentrate and
its sale in domestic and export markets are presented in the Operations Plan attached to
the ICR mission Aide Memoire (annexed to this report). This indicates that all the
physical objectives will be met in 1998, following startup of the TSP plant in late 1997.
8.    Technical Assistance Objectives. The technical assistance directed at improving
project management and workshop maintenance was carried out in a number of phases
over the project implementation period. It included visits by international specialists to
China and return visits of Chinese managers and engineers to the specialists' offices in
the United States. The project management assistance was successful in helping the
Wengfu Mining and Fertilizer Development Group (WMFDG) upgrade and strengthen its
management structure and team. Although a number of maintenance training workshops



- 3 -
were conducted by international specialists, WMFDG recognizes that additional training
in this area will be important in order to lift maintenance and materials management
practices to standards necessary to ensure the efficiency and security of the project. This
additional training should be paid for from the cash flow from operations.
9.    The technical and financial assistance directed at the computer-based sector
investment optimization model was generally successful, on the basis that preliminary
runs on the model carried out jointly by MCI and the Bank gave clear results for the
priorities of the next investments in the phosphate sector, including the selection of
Wengfu as the first major investment. It also pointed to the subsequent selection of the
Dayukou and Huangmailing integrated phosphate mine, beneficiation and fertilizer
operations that were financed by the Bank under the ongoing Hubei Phosphate Project
(Loan 3066-CHA).
10.   Less successful was the technical assistance for installation and development of
the model to strengthen MCI's subsector planning ability. The computer purchased by
MCI under the project for installing the model was never used for this purpose, although
it has been put to good use in statistical applications for MCI. Incompatibility between
the hardware and the software, General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), for running
the model was a problem. Toward the end of the project period, there was a revival of
interest in installing the model but the necessary resources could not be made available
and the model has not yet been installed.
11.  Institutional Development. The original implementing agency for the project
was the Guizhou Phosphate Company (GPC), located in the provincial capital of
Guiyang. Following construction startup, GPC appreciated the difficulties of managing
construction distant from the project site, and so established the Wengfu Mining and
Fertilizer Development Group (WMFDG) at the project area to manage construction.
Throughout the project period, WMFDG has progressively expanded its management and
staffing, and developed a well-structured and competent group solely responsible for
project implementation and operation. Extensive management, operations and
maintenance training has been undertaken under the project, which placed WMFDG in a
strong position to ensure the project's success.
12.   Environmental Protection. No serious environmental issues were foreseen at
the mine site and beneficiation plant and none have developed. Dust at the mine site is
controlled in the usual manner by effective haul-road construction and spraying with
water from tankers procured under the project. Overburden dumps are located close to
the mine site. The natural consistency of the overburden materials provides a mixture of
large and small rocks with a natural sealing tendency. Dust and noise tests undertaken at
the beneficiation plant during performance tests have confirmed compliance with
Ministry of Health and State Labor Bureau standards. The beneficiation plant has been
designed in accordance with Chinese engineering standards, which do not always match
up to international standards, especially in safety features like stairways, headroom and
enclosures for conveyors and operating equipment. WMFDG recognizes that additional



- 4 -
enclosures need to be constructed at conveyor transfer points for better control of dust
emissions. Construction of the initial tailings pond dam has been completed and the dam
will be developed progressively over the project life. Some leaking of solids through the
dam wall is evident, but the dam will self-seal as sufficient solids settle out during initial
operations. Filter press wastewater is fully recycled to the mine site. The effluent from
the tailings dam will pass through a monitoring station to ensure that it will not pollute
the streams into which it will flow.
13.   Economic and Financial Objectives.  Significant economic and financial
benefits were estimated at project appraisal. Although at loan closing these benefits are
lower than originally forecast, they are still positive (Part II, Tables 8A, 8C and 8D) and
can be considered satisfactory. The actual economic rate of return of 13.9 percent
underscores the beneficial impact of the project on the Chinese economy. The forecast
return at appraisal was 26 percent. It is lower now because the revenue will be delayed
due to the delay in startup of production and of the TSP plant. The financial rate of return
is now forecast at 10.2 percent compared with the appraisal estimate of 12.4 percent.
Higher local currency costs and the longer implementation period than considered at
appraisal have been partially offset by increases in concentrate prices that WMFDG is
able to achieve in export markets (Y 374 per ton) and through the freedom to market
outside of the state allocation plan at negotiated prices with domestic buyers, as agreed
under the project. If concentrate prices were constrained to the levels set by MCI for
other producers (Y 230 per ton), the financial rate of return would be reduced to 5.3
percent. The economic rate of return is sensitive to revenue decreases from changes in
concentrate prices, but even with prices decreases of 10 percent, the economic rate of
return at 11.7 percent is satisfactory. The financial rate of return is also sensitive to
revenue changes: decreases of 10 percent over the estimated revenues would result in a
financial rate of return of 7.6 percent, a level which would cause financial problems for
the project. Such a price decrease is, however, considered unlikely as domestic prices can
be expected to rise to import parity prices in the short to medium term, China will be a
net importer of phosphates for the foreseeable future, and WBFDG is free to negotiate
prices.
14.   Public Sector Management. The project was the first in a planned series of
phosphate fertilizer investments to be implemented by MCI to improve domestic supplies
and provide high grade inputs. MCI has been closely involved in all phases of project
planning and implementation, and has benefited from project training programs. MCI
considers that this experience has been of considerable benefit in improving its
management capabilities for future projects.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.   Project implementation has met its primary development objective-the provision
of additional phosphates-and has practically attained the institutional, financial and
economic goals that were set. The factors that impeded project implementation included:
delays in initial procurement; slow mobilization of domestic funds; the delay in the TSP



- 5 -
plant construction; delayed production-and hence revenue-buildup; and the difficulties
in finding interim domestic and export markets until the TSP plant construction is
completed.
16.   Factors not Subject to the Borrower's Control. The availability and prices of
domestic construction inputs (steel, cement, equipment, labor, etc.) foreseen at appraisal
deteriorated significantly during implementation as demand for these inputs grew
markedly under the rapidly developing market economy. This resulted in project
implementation delays and local cost overruns as WMFDG was forced to compete for
inputs and to come to terms with rapidly increasing construction costs. Although the
total project cost was only about 10 percent higher than anticipated at appraisal, the local
cost component of the project almost doubled in current Renminbi terms, placing
considerable strain on local-cost financing.  Delays in securing local financing
requirements were exacerbated by the credit squeezes implemented by Government
during the project period.
17.   Factors Subject to the Borrower's Control. The most serious problems within
the government's control were the slow formal approval of the project design, and the
delays in mobilizing funding for the TSP plant.
18.   Factors Subject to the Implementing Agency's Control. The implementing
agency WMFDG was less effective than could have been expected in a number of areas:
delayed initial procurement due to excessive time taken to finalize technical
specifications for international competitive bidding (ICB) documentation; slow
development of the project management team, and drawn-out preparation of construction
and project master schedules, and critical path identification. Reporting was deficient
throughout major portions of project implementation. The transition from construction to
startup and initial operations was not as expeditious as it could have been. Alternative
marketing arrangements, necessitated by delays in the construction of the TSP plant, were
slow to develop. Focus on the financial implications of delayed project completion, cost
overruns and revised marketing arrangements was inadequate. Concern for the financial
implications of the delay was lacking for some time. Although technical assistance for
project management and maintenance was mobilized as necessary throughout the project
implementation period, some of it was incomplete at the loan closing date.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.   There is a high probability that the project will be financially and economically
viable and will reach and maintain its major objective of producing 1.8 Mtpy of
phosphate concentrates as procurement of all equipment is complete, the performance and
reliability tests of the concentrator were successful, and competent WMFDG
management and operations teams are in place. There may be some further delays
because of marketing and transport difficulties brought on by the delayed TSP plant. The
project should reach its planned production by early 1998, when the TSP plant



-6 -
construction is completed. From that date, the project is considered likely to be fully
sustainable.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
20.   Project identification and appraisal were well-focused but the SAR was of limited
help in procurement, construction, implementation and initial operations. No details were
provided in the SAR of the equipment items scheduled for Bank financing, their
estimated costs and scheduling.  Project performance indicators and the project
implementation schedule, consistent with then practice in the 1980s, were not developed
with sufficient detail and specificity.
21.   Supervision missions provided a focused discussion of key issues, which assisted
MCI and WMFDG to address project implementation delays and difficulties in an orderly
manner, but the frequency of supervision was limited. In all, 65 person-days were spent
in the field on supervision from May 1990 to April 1994, an average of less than 3 staff-
weeks per year (Table 11). A more intense supervision effort might have reduced project
implementation delays. It could also have helped the Government to better understand
the importance of an early commitment to the construction of the TSP plant, and
WMFDG to identify optimal interim marketing arrangements Lastly, more efforts should
have been made to assist MCI/CPI to install the subsector planning model and thus
complete the technical assistance component.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.   First, formal approval for project commencement was delayed due to overall
capital allocation constraints. Second, there were delays in implementation due to
inadequacies in the provision of counterpart funds; however, the borrower made
considerable efforts to deal with the higher-than-expected local costs and completion was
well within the planned implementation period. Third, there were inadequacies in the
provision of counterpart and foreign bilateral funds that have delayed the completion of
the TSP Plant with a consequent negative impact on project financial and economic
benefits.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
23.   On the basis that the major physical (development) objective is considered
reachable and sustainable, that satisfactory sector policy and institutional objectives have
been met, and that financial and economic benefits are likely to be positive and
acceptable, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
24.   The WMFDG corporate plan is focused on production and marketing to maximize
sales revenue in the domestic and export markets pending completion of the TSP plant. It
incorporates discussions with central and provincial governments and other lenders for



financial restructuring that will ensure a healthy financial position for the company. The
recruitment and training of the management team and operations personnel are complete
and future operations should be satisfactory.
25.  Indicators for monitoring and evaluating the future operation of the project were
not identified during project appraisal, but some were devised during supervision. They
refer mostly to the physical performance of the facilities and can be used only when the
plant is operating. They deal mostly with the performance of the beneficiation plant
(product quality, input consumptions, labor productivity, concentrate output) and with
overburden and ore excavation rates at the mine, including equipment and labor
productivity.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   A number of key lessons can and should be learned from the implementation of
this project. First, in designing the scope of a project, care needs to be taken to ensure
that all subcomponents are adequately captured by the project. In this project, the
development of the mine and beneficiation plant, which received World Bank financing,
was disconnected from the construction of the TSP plant, which was to get bilateral
financing. The covenanted agreements that the TSP plant would be built and ready for
operations in accordance with terms of reference and timing agreed between the Bank and
the Company were inadequate to secure the integrated nature of the project. In fact, the
Company had no power to influence the schedule for securing of necessary bilateral
financing for the TSP plant. As a minimum, a Government commitment to complete the
TSP construction to a time-bound schedule should have been obtained and the necessary
foreign financing secured prior to commencement of the project. Even better, the project
design should have encompassed all components in an integrated project.
27.   Second, in order to assist borrowers and implementing agencies to define and
develop corrective action plans when difficulties arise, the Bank must ensure that
adequate supervision resources are allocated and used properly.
28.   Last, care must be exercised in designing technical assistance components to
ensure that adequate funds are specified in the loan agreement so that the components are
implemented effectively. The subsector planning component of the project was not
completed due, at least in part, to inadequate funding allocations.

TABLE 9B: ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS-UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.    Economic capital costs were obtained from the financial base capital costs after:
(a) deduction of duties and taxes on equipment and spare parts; and (b) deduction of
construction of social facilities (schools, hospitals, etc.).
2.    The real prices of inputs and outputs in economic terms were assumed to remain
unchanged at the end-1995 levels over the life of the project. Projected production levels
are described in Table 9E.
3.    The economic price of phosphate concentrates was derived from its current FOB
Morocco export price, delivered to a Chinese port. Import parity prices, at Y 450 per ton,
were calculated by adding unloading, port handling, and economic inland freight from the
port to the main consuming units in the vicinity of the Wengfu plant. Net sales revenue
was calculated after deducting the value added tax.
4.    The economic value of imported tradable inputs was based on their current
international FOB prices, plus marine freight from their point of origin to a Chinese port,
plus economic inland freight to the plant sites in the vicinity of the Wengfu plant.
5.    The economic costs of exportable inputs were derived by deducting from the FOB
export price at a Chinese port the economic inland freight prices between the plant site
and the port.
6.    Nontradable inputs were converted to their economic value by applying specific
shadow prices:
(a)   electricity is valued at its long-run marginal costs in China, and the tariff
was therefore increased to Y 0.37 ($0.044) per kWh;
(b)   no shadow  wage rates were used for labor, since wages plus
nonoperational expenses already reflect the cost to the company of the
social services provided to its labor force, including housing, education,
hospitals, social security (pensions and unemployment, accident and
health insurance), food services and fuel and retail outlets; and
(c)   rail freight tariffs were adjusted from an average of $0.01 per kilometer to
the estimated economic cost of $0.03 per kilometer.

TABLE 9E: FINANCIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS-UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.    Two cases have been considered for the financial rate of return: (i) the situation
where the prices of the project output are constrained to levels set by MCI and the
Provincial Price Bureaus (Y 230 per ton); and, (ii) the price levels that WBFDG is
expected to be able to achieve with its power, as agreed under the project, to market its
output outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices. For this latter case, prices of
phosphate concentrates in China are projected to rise progressively to import parity levels
(Y 450 per ton) by the year 2010; this is considered a conservative assumption. Net sales
revenue was calculated after deducting the value added tax.
2.     Capacity utilization of the Wengfu beneficiation plant is assumed at 35 percent in
the first full year of operation (1996), 75 percent in the second year and 100 percent
thereafter. The TSP plant is expected to come into operation in 1998, at a 50 percent
operating rate, and to operate at full capacity from 1999 on. Exports of ores (valued at
Y 82 per ton) will cease in 1998, while sales of concentrates to outside parties are
expected to decrease from that year on. Sales of concentrates in the domestic market are
expected to decrease from 0.5 Mtpy in 1996 and 1997 to 0.3 Mtpy thereafter, while
export sales are projected to go from 0.2 Mtpy in 1996 to 1.0 Mtpy in 1997, 0.8 Mtpy in
1998 and 0.4 Mtpy thereafter. Export prices for concentrates are projected at the constant
level of Y 373.5 per ton.
3.     Unit operating costs of concentrates at Wengfu are expected to decrease in real
terms as the operating rate approaches full capacity, from Y 183 per ton in 1996, to Y 165
per ton in 1997, Y 149 per ton in 1998 and Y 120 per ton from 1999 on.

ANNEX 1: ICR MISSION AIDE MEMOIRE
January 1996
1.    A World Bank mission (Christopher Wardell, mission leader/Principal Mining
Engineer; Peter Glenshaw, Senior Industry Specialist; Paulo de Sa, Industrial Economist/
Financial Analyst; and Jerry Cape, Phosphate Beneficiation Consultant) visited China
January 15 through February 2, 1996. Together with representatives of the Ministry of
Chemical Industries (MCI) and the Wengfu Mining and Fertilizer Development Group
(WMFDG), the project implementing agency, the mission visited the Wengfu project site
January 18 through 22 and discussed, in detail, all aspects of project implementation and
related issues, the project's future operation, and   focused on review  of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
2.    At the outset of the mission, MCI provided drafts of its contribution to the ICR
including comments on the project implementation and performance, as well as a
document prepared by its Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) on the subsector planning
technical assistance component of the project. On arrival at the Wengfu project site,
WMFDG provided the mission with a comprehensive draft ICR document. At the
wrap-up in Beijing on February 2, MCI provided the mission with a draft Operations Plan
(attached to this Aide-Memoire) prepared by WMFDG, which the mission will review on
its return to Washington.
3.    The mission provided advice and support to both MCI/CPI and WMFDG on the
draft ICR contributions prepared. These inputs were essentially in the form of suggested
clarifications and focus. There was no major divergence of opinion between the mission,
MCI and WMFDG in terms of the project implementation record and related issues or
future operation of the project. Project construction has been completed successfully,
performance tests are complete, and full-load commercial tests are underway. Agreement
was reached that major project implementation difficulties related to delayed start of
project implementation due to tardy government approval processes and delayed
mobilization of local funds, as well as to delayed mobilization of local funds and bilateral
funds for the construction of the Wengfu TSP plant, the market for the major portion of
the project outputs. The latter issue has created a major difficulty for WMFDG that now
faces serious short-term market constraints (exacerbated by rail transportation capacity
limitations), even though concerted efforts have been made and will continue to be made
by WMFDG to export project outputs in the near future. These views were shared and
agreed with the Governor of the Guizhou Provincial Government who met the mission on
January 21. Regarding the Technical Assistance component of the project, agreement
was reached that, for various reasons, it had not been possible to develop this component
as originally planned due to computer hardware and software limitations and
complications, and possibly due also to poor communications between the Bank and the



-22-                      ANNEX I
Borrower. MCI/WMFDG undertook to finalize its ICR contribution and forward it to the
Bank in the near future. The mission confirmed that the Bank's contribution to the ICR
was under preparation and would be forwarded for review by the Borrower and
implementing agency within the coming two months, such that the ICR could be finalized
within the present Bank Fiscal Year.
4.    MCI/WMFDG confirmed that all Wengfu phosphate rock and concentrate project
products were being marketed outside the state allocation system at prices freely
negotiated with domestic and export customers. Consensus was reached also that prices
currently received for project concentrates in the domestic market could be expected to
increase gradually toward a level approaching import parity on the basis that China is and
will likely remain in the foreseeable future, a net importer of phosphate materials. Even
though preliminary mission calculations indicate that the project economic rate of return
is satisfactory at in excess of 10 percent (although lower than originally anticipated in the
SAR) and the financial rate of return is likely to be in the 5-10 percent range and
acceptable. WMFDG will apparently not be able to fully service its debt obligations in
1996 and 1997 and will be unable to meet the financial covenants contained in the Project
Agreement, at least in the short term. As a result, WMFDG have agreed to review and
discuss rescheduling of its debt obligations with central and provincial government
representatives, and with local commercial institutions, and formulate a plan to address
this issue. The mission pointed out that in accordance with Section 4.03 of the Loan
Agreement, the Borrower has undertaken to cover any cash flow deficits of the company
during its first three years of operation. The mission also expressed concern that
WMFDG maintains still a 100 percent debt financial status and urged MCI and the
provincial government to review options to convert a portion of the company's debt into
equity in order to accord with 75:25 debt/equity structure covenanted in the Project
Agreement.

ANNEX 2: OPERATION PLAN FOR THE WENGFU
PHOSPHATE MINE
1.    Because the Wengfu fertilizer project which is a match project of Wengfu
phosphate falls behind the schedule and the railway transportation problems etc., Wengfu
mine which has achieved capacity cannot be operated as plan. We draft the sales plan for
Wengfu mine before 2000 according to the actual situation, detailed as follows (Table 1).

2.    To achieve this plan, there are two key points:  first is to solve railway
transportation problems, second is to add one set of drying facility to reduce the moisture
of concentrate. For the first point, we will send competent personnel to the State
Planning Committee, Railway Ministry, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Chengdu railway
bureau and provincial government to report and try to get the support of all department
concerned in order to solve the problems. At the same time, we will use our self-fund to
install one set of drying facility to reduce the moisture of concentrate.
3.    According to this sales plan, the production plan for Wengfu phosphate mine
before 2000 is as follows (ref. Table 2):

4.   In order to reach the above plan, we plan to use self-fund to buy some necessary
equipment and spare parts to enhance productivity beside enhance management, increase
productivity and make better use of potential capacity of current equipment.
5.    Based on the above production and sales plan, WF Phosphate Mine's financial
situation by 2000 is expected to be that expressed by tables IV, V, & VI. WF Phosphate
Mine is a totally debted project, therefore, its financial situation in a few years cannot be
satisfactory. To meet the financial expectation by 2958-CHA loan agreement, the critical
measure is to increase the proportion of self-own capital fund to total investment.
According to relating new policy of the State, the loan to total debted projects will be
partially transferred to capital fund which is 30 percent for the projects of chemical
industry and raw material sector. We are going to take advantage of this policy to get the
30 percent capital fumd as soon as possible which will improve positives the financial
situation a lot.
6.    Wengfu phosphate mine attaches importance environmental protection while
carrying out the production plan. Strong dams have been constructed for the mine
overburden antiflood wastewater treatment and drainage facility, tailing dam have been
built for flotation plant etc. Thank to these completed facilities, each state related
environmental specification is met in Wengfu phosphate mine.

ANNEX 3: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
A. REVIEW BY MCI
Background
1.    Guizhou Phosphate Development Project focused on the development of an
efficient domestic phosphate fertilizer industry by using indigenous phosphate rock
resources and was the third operation in a series of the World Bank interventions that
aimed at assisting GOC's program for improving overall fertilizer sector performance.
Of the phosphate deposits in China, the Wengfu area in Guizhou offers the best
conditions for large-scale mining of phosphate rock with good quality and a high P205
content. Therefore, GOC will set up a phosphate fertilizer production base in this area,
which would help reduce the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by expanding the
production capacity for phosphate fertilizers. The project consists of the following
components.
(a)   Construction and equipment
(i)   an open-pit mine to produce 2.5 Mtpy of ROM phosphate rock;
(ii)    a beneficiation plan to process the rock into 1.93 million tpy of
high-grade phosphate concentrate (35 percent P205);
(iii) a slurry pipeline (45 km distance between charge and discharge);
(iv)    press filters;
(v)   infrastructure.
(b)   Provision of consultancy services for project implementation and mine
workshop maintenance by providing domestic and overseas training;
(c)   Provision of financial and technical support to MCI for the acquisition of
computer hardware and software at CPI in order for MCI and the Bank to
jointly develop a phosphate subsector planning model and to strengthen
CPI's subsector planning capacity.
Implementation Review
2.    Overall, the implementation and performance of the project are considered very
satisfactory together with project scope optimization and compliance with project
objectives. The project has enabled China to increase its domestic high-grade phosphate



- 30 -                    ANNEX3
concentrate by 1.93 Mtpy, thus greatly raising its domestic production and quality level
for phosphate concentrate. The newly increased phosphate concentrate not only can feed
a downstream 800,000 tpy TSP plant currently under construction, but can also provide
part of the high-grade phosphate concentrate for other domestic phosphate fertilizer
plants.
3.    Final  performance  tests  have  verified  the  international  operational
competitiveness of the new production facilities not only in terms of efficiency, reliability
and product quality but also in human resources as enterprises management standards and
professional skills of staff at virtually all levels have been significantly enhanced by
intensive internal and external training and consulting services provided by
internationally experienced consultants.
4.    The technical assistance component under the project has three elements:
(a) consultancy service for MCI to support project implementation; (b) consultancy
service on the maintenance of mine equipment; and (c) provision of financial and
technical support to MCI for the acquisition of computer hardware and software at CPI to
strengthen MCI's subsector planning capacity. Except for element (c), the technical
assistance program has been carried out successfully and achieved expected objectives.
A large number of senior managerial and technical staff have been trained, hence their
professional skills in managing modem enterprises as well as the overall management
standards for the enterprises have been significantly enhanced. Additionally, timely
maintenance of the imported large-scale mine equipment is ensured through training. As
for the TA element aimed to strengthen MCI's phosphate subsector planning capacity, the
Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) of MCI procured a MV/15000 Model miniature
computer manufactured by DG Company and put it into operation. However, out of
various reasons, especially due to different interpretation on the technical assistance
component from both sides, the Bank failed to supply the GAMS software essential to
establish the phosphate subsector planning model, technical training and spare parts
needed by the computer.
MCI's Role in Project Implementation
5.    Through its Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFUO), MCI's role in the
execution of the project was to coordinate and consolidate the work of all concerned
departments and provide assistance to the project company in resolving project
implementation issues to ensure smooth progress of the project.
Cooperation with the World Bank
6.    During the whole course of the project implementation, the cooperation between
the Foreign Funds Utilization Office on behalf of MCI and the Bank has been
satisfactory. Whenever difficulties or problems arose, they were promptly resolved
through bilateral friendly discussions and consultations. The guidelines and procedures
adopted by the Bank in appraising and implementing the project was concise, scientific
and efficient, and generally Bank requirements and suggestions to the executing agency



- 31-                      ANNEX3
were rational. Bank officials in charge of appraisal and supervision as well as technical
experts were skillful, competent and responsible. Their hard work contributed a great
deal to the successful implementation of the project.
Lessons Learned and Prospects
7.    As an agriculture-oriented country, China needs to continue to import fertilizer to
respond to the increasing demand of its agriculture sector. Most importantly, China will
have to set up a sound and competitive fertilizer industry to support a sustained
agricultural development in an environment that calls for substantial increase in yield and
variety. Particularly, China will have to increase its phosphate fertilizer production to get
a balanced use of the three main fertilizer nutrients (namely Nitrogen, Phosphate and
Potash). In this context, the Bank-assisted Guizhou Phosphate Development Project has
played an important role in the development of China's fertilizer industry. We expect the
Bank to give further assistance, technically and financially, in promoting China's
phosphate subsector development.
8.    Due to various reasons, the mine and the downstream phosphate fertilizer plant
were not able to be constructed simultaneously. The construction for the open-pit mine
and the beneficiation plant has been completed and gone into operation, but the
downstream phosphate fertilizer plant has not been completed yet, thus the project's
economic benefits have been significantly affected. Nevertheless, since there have been
strong demand for high-grade phosphate concentrate and high-quality compound
fertilizers, the economic viability as well as social benefits of the project will demonstrate
after the completion of the TSP plant and the running of the Nanning-Kunming railway.
9.    Strengthening of CPI's subsector planning capacity is of great importance to us.
Unfortunately, due to reasons mentioned earlier, the technical assistance component did
not achieve originally expected objectives. We hope the Bank can supply CPI with the
GAMS software and the phosphate subsector planning model, and will continue to offer
assistance in the development of China's fertilizer industry as before.
B. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT-CPI
10.   During Project preparation MCI and the World Bank carried out a joint Phosphate
Subsector Study (the Study) to help the Government identify appropriate strategies for
the development of an efficient domestic phosphate fertilizer industry. The main
objective of the Study was to prepare an optimal investment program up to the year 2000
that would allow China to meet its rapidly growing demand for phosphate fertilizer in the
most economic manner, given specified market requirements and transport constraints.
11.   As part of the Study, the Bank designed a computer-based mathematical
programming model to facilitate review of the options, using data provided by MCI. The
model covers optimization of investment at the national level as well as at each plant in
terms of location, scale of operations and levels of production in the context of the
constraints associated with the transport of raw materials, intermediates and final



- 32 -                    ANNEX3
products. Selection of optimal strategies was based on a comparison of different options
and scenarios. The model enabled the Government to review in a consistent and
integrated manner the major issues involved in developing the fertilizer industry, such as
(a) domestic fertilizer production versus imports; 9b) optimal mode of transport of raw
materials and finished products; (c) the location of new fertilizer production facilities;
(d) the relative economics of producing different types of phosphate fertilizers; and
(e) priorities in developing the different types of phosphate rock deposits. This model
would be installed at MCI's Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) under the project, and
continuously updated to provide advice to planning and project implementing authorities
on relevant subsector strategies.
12.   The results of work with the model provided strong economic justification for
development of China's domestic phosphate fertilizer industry, based on domestic raw
materials. The analysis suggested that production of high-grade phosphate fertilizers
such as TSP, DAP and MAP near the rock sources in Yunnan, Guizhou and Hubei
provinces can be more economic than reliance on imports. Construction of small DAP
plants that use adaptive technology and local raw materials will also help China meet its
phosphate needs.
13.   The TA component aimed to strengthen CPI's development planning capacity
consists of:
(a)   providing computer equipment and software;
(b)   installing, maintaining and further developing of the phosphate subsector
investment optimization model at CPI;
(c)   providing domestic training by internationally experienced consultants for
CPIIMCI's staff in investment planning and computer programming for
the investment optimization model; and
(d)   providing overseas training for key staff.
14.   The Bank made a breakdown cost estimate for the TA with a total cost of
$400,000. The TA was scheduled to be carried out in between 1988 and 1990.
15.   During the TA implementation period, CPI made a few contacts with the Ban's
officials and specialists involved to discuss the problems encountered. In December
1989, CPI signed the contract with DG Company procuring a MV/15000 Model 8
miniature computer through ICB procedure. The computer, which cost $338,000, was
put into operation in October 1990. However, out of various reasons (and due to the
different interpretation on the TA component of both side in particular), the Bank failed
to provide CPI the GAMS software, the phosphate subsector development planning
model, technical training and some key spare parts needed by the computer (which we
had requested for to the Bank but got no reply).



- 33 -                     ANNEX3
16.   We conducted the following activities by means of the computer:
(a)   a series of workshops on computer application being held, which enabled
50 technical staff to learn how to operate the computer;
(b)   establishment of the following data bases: (i) a correspondence recorder
of China's chemical enterprises for public use; (ii) the statistics of
production capacity, output and imports and exports of China's main
chemical products; (iii) supply and demand trend of the market for the
products in fertilizer, inorganic chemicals and organic chemicals
subsectors; (d) an information base for CPI's charter, rules and
regulations;
(c)   development of the data base application program and software on outputs
versus inputs and economic benefits analysis.
17.   The computer played an important role in assisting CPI's planning and conducting
consulting services. But for lack of the GAMS software, we were unable to establish the
phosphate subsector development planning model with the computer, which should have
been very useful to CPI. We hope that the Bank could provide further assistance so that
CPI can continue its research on this field.
C. GUIZHOU WENGFU PHOSPHATE MINE COMPONENT
Section 1: Project Implementation and Assessment
Project Background
18.   China is a populous country with less farmland. Among the farmland, 70 percent
of them is lack of phosphorous.  Chinese government pays great attention to the
agriculture development in order to meet grain requirement. Because fertilizer is the
basis of agriculture development, so Chinese government decide to construct a batch of
phosphate mines and fertilizer plants to better balance requirement and supply of
phosphate rock and fertilizer. The government also decided to adjust the fertilizer
products structure in order to supply more high grade compound fertilizer for agriculture
and change the status of fannland lack of phosphorous. It is decided to construct Wengfu
phosphate mine in this circumstance. When Wengfu phosphate mine is completed, it can
turn over 2 million tons of high quality concentrate yearly in which 700,000t/y can be
supplied to other fertilizer plant or phosphorous chemical plants except for meeting the
1.3 million tons of concentrate requirement for 800,000t/y of TSP production at site.
Project Content
19.   The project is a newly constructed project which use IBRD loan and investment
of State. Project scale is 2.5 million t/y of ore, 1.9 million t/y of concentrate. Quality
indicators for concentrate is: P205 35.5 percent, MgO (1.5 percent, size 60 percent minus



- 34 -                     ANNEX3
200 mesh). This quality meet the requirement of class 2 products used for wet method
acid production.
Project Identification and Organization
20.   The State Planning Committee approved to use IBRD loan to construct Wengfu
phosphate project in 1985. IBRD assessed and approved above-mentioned project in
1986. The project scale and content are appropriate, construction decision is correct,
project assessment is successful. The Mining Bureau ;of MCI carried out the supervision,
guiding and coordination of the project.  It monitored the progress of project
continuously. The project progressed basically according to the progress schedule. The
project construction group was organized under the leadership of ministries and province.
The organization was further divided depending on major management policies. They
are responsible for the actual implementation of subprojects and finances, which were
accounted  separately.   The transportation, inspection, storage and  issues are
comparatively on time and correct because of the proper organization and worker's effort.
These things ensured the project go on smoothly.
Project Implementation
21.   The total construction time from  the formal startup of construction on
November 11, 1990 to 72 hours load test run (September 8, 1995) is 58 months which is
2 months earlier than the scheduled timetable of 60 months. During construction period,
the construction timetable was influenced by the delay of some imported equipment and
material, bad availability of domestic fund and some other factors. Otherwise the project
would be completed further earlier.
Project Progress Timetable

The Achievement of Project Objectives
23.   Physical Objectives. All installation and adjustment of project were completed
in March 1995. One test leader team was formed which drafted the commissioning
schedule and verification programs. The 72 hours lead test-run was finished on
September 4-8, 1995. All performance indexes were reached exceeded the design
requirements. Load tests are ongoing and are expected to demonstrate commercial
production system capacity.
24.   Management Objectives. Because the project imported advanced international
technology and management experience, automatic control, mechanic operation and
computerized management were realized for the whole system. Production efficiency,
working efficiency and management are enhanced effectively. The original fixed staff
number is 1,597 but the actual number is only 1,080. The project organized an individual
mine management system which will run the mine separately and carry out self-
accounting of the mine. This will make the management of mine systematize,
standardize and effective. The financial management of Wengfu phosphate mine was
improved greatly under the consultancy and help of IBRD. As the results, Wengfu can
submits financial reports and other documents to IBRD in time according to IBRD
requirement while it carry out strict internal finance management at the same time.
25.   Economic Objectives. Based on the price level and construction cost before
1987, the economic objectives in primary design are as follows: Total yearly cost,
123.7154 million Yuan; average production value 246.7990 million Yuan; average yearly
profit 113.9191 million Yuan; retained profit during loan repayment period 4.5 million
Yuan. Because of the price inflation, quota adjustment, foreign exchange rate deviation
and interest/investment directional taxes adding into budget, the construction cost has
been adjusted from 718,5312 to 1,415.0312 million Yuan. The currently estimated
economic indicators are as follows based on the prices of various raw material, fuel,
power needed in mining and flotating as well as the sector ceiling prices for concentrate
sales income when mine reaches capacity 477.63 million Yuan average yearly profit
72.16 million Yuan.
Project Result
26.   The Social Efficiency of the Project. The project is the first batch of chemical
mines which use IBRD loan. When the project is completed, it will supply 1.9 million
tons of high quality concentrate to the State which can be used to produce 1.2 million
tons of high grade phosphate fertilizer or compound fertilizer (among which 0.8 million
tons by Hongfu itself and 0.4 million other enterprises). This will speed up the
development of high content compound fertilizer in China and improve the imbalance of
NPK between the production and requirement. It will have a strategic importance in
supporting agriculture development. According to the estimate of agriculture sector, it
will increase rice production by 2,550 million tons or 5,400 million tons of maize or
4,350 million tons of wheat if 1.2 million tons of high grade fertilizer are used for



- 36 -                    ANNEX3
farmland which is lack of phosphorous. This will save more than 600 million precious
US dollars which would have to be used to import this quantity of grain. Farmers will get
more than 1.5 billion Yuan income increase and 400 million Yuan will turn over to the
state as taxes and profits. This will speed up the prosperous of local economy.
Performance of Bank
27.   During the project implementation, IBRD takes great responsibility for the
completion of the project. The Bank manage and supervise the project strictly and
seriously. The Bank sent several missions to jobsite to check and direct the work from
the preparation of project to completion of the project. All the missions showed rich
experience, strong working ability and responsibility. They all worked very hard and
propose a lot of constructive opinions from the proper use of project fund, project
implementation, equipment/material procurement to the site construction management
which pay great role on the success of the project.
Performance of Borrower
28.   Wengfu mining and fertilizer development group was organized at the beginning
of startup of construction of the project which is responsible for the project construction,
coordination, production management and loan repayment after project is put into
production. The group selected some experienced management personnel, engineers and
divided them into groups according to their majors and make them responsible for the
actual implementation of subprojects. The project was carried out smoothly under the
direct and help of central ministries, provincial government and department concerned.
29.   High effective construction management system was formed which carried out
effective quality control, investment control and construction period control to ensure the
project progress smoothly according to the schedule. The project was planned to start
construction in June 1989 and complete on June 30, 1994 with a 5 years construction
period. Because the construction time of the project was delayed to November 11, 1990,
the project should be completed by November 1995. But the project was completed
actually in September 1995 with all staff's efforts which was 2 months earlier than
schedule. Projects qualified rates are 100 percent and the rates for good and very good
quality exceed 80 percent.
30.   The project was accounted separately to avoid financial confusion which is also
useful to the project arrangement. The financial reports and project progress reports were
prepared according tot he requirement of World Ban, although with fund source delays.
Consultancy Service Assessment
31.   Engineering and technical consultancy service men arrived at jobsite basically
according to our requirement which benefited the project a lot.



- 37 -                    ANNEX3
32.   The bid consultancy was carried out immediately after contract effectiveness. We
are lack of experience of ITB at the beginning. Our staff were trained under the guide of
central ministries and with the help of CNCCC. The working efficiency was improved
greatly. The equipment procurement and technical import are comparatively successful.
33.   The project progress goes on smoothly because of the management consultancy
service, especially the financial management to domestic consultancy service which
played great role on the application of construction fund and construction cost
management.
34.   Consultancy service of maintenance gave us good suggestions for preventive
maintenance and maintaining method. As the result, Wengfu maintenance work was
carried out very good. Good base has been formed for the maintenance system. The
additional maintenance management training is recognized as a requirement during the
operation phase.
Operation Status
35.   According to the original products allocation and operation plan, Wengfu
products are supplied to the following plants: Wengfu 800,000t/y TSP plant, Tonglin
240,000t/y DAP plant, Jilan 70,000t/y nitric fertilizer plant, Kaifong 90,000t/y nitric
fertilizer plant, Guixi 480,000t/y DAP plant, Dongting 200,000t/y MAP plant. Among
the above-mentioned plants, Wengfu TSP plant was delayed for 3 years, the plants in
Jilan, Kaifong, Guixi and Dongting did not construct. So the project cannot achieve the
original products allocation plan.  Furthermore because of the tight transportation
capacity, Wengfu project which has formed capacity cannot transport its product outside
as planned. As the result, the project cannot operate according to the original plan and
the estimated economical efficiency cannot be achieved before Wengfu TSP plant is put
into production.
Project Sustainability
36.   All estimates prove the sustainability of the project. The efficiency is not good
currently because of the above-mentioned reasons.  But it is just a temporary
circumstance. China will further develop phosphate fertilizer sector according to the
actual requirement of agriculture and state sectors policies. The local government will
also develop small- and medium-size phosphorous projects. So the need of phosphate
rock will increase steadily. At the same time, the international fertilizer prices keep on
increasing currently which will force the domestic phosphate price go up. So the
financial circumstance of the project will be improved. There is great difference between
the current phosphate rock price and assessment price. The concentrate price than was
138 Yuan/t, the sector price decided by MCI in 1994 was 195 Yuan/t, and the actual sale
price now is 230 Yuan/t. When the raw material bureau of State Development Bank
assessed the project, it used 195 Yuan/t. Various performance indicators would be better
is 230 Yuan/t was used. The price for phosphate rock will go up steadily in the near
future. The railway from Lanting to Kunming will be open to traffic soon which will



- 38 -                    ANNEX3
improve the transportation problems. The sale, transportation and price of phosphate will
be improved greatly. The financial status will also be improved. So the project is
obvious sustainability.
Section 2: Project Expenditure
37.   The original budget approved was 718.5312 million Yuan including IBRD loan
62.7 million US dollars, domestic loan changed from allocation 466.57 million Yuan and
self-raised fund by the province 18.5312 million Yuan. But because of the inflation
foreign exchange rate deviation and interest and investment directional taxes adding into
budget, the approved budget was adjusted to 1,415.00 million Yuan (equivalent to
162.6474 million US dollars, including IBRD loan 57.1735 million US dollars), details as
follow:

Section 3: Conclusion
38.   The decision of the project is correct, successful and conformed with the actual
situation. Through the importing of equipment and technology, the technical level was
enhanced and efficiency improved. The project will also supply good raw material for
high grade fertilizer producing which will reduce the transportation quantity and cost.
39.   The World Bank gives great help from the project assessment to project
implementation and completion. The Bank perform its supervision, checking and service
obligation good.

40.   The procurement of equipment and import of technology are successful. They are
conformed wit the requirement of project quality and process. Contract parties performed
their duty strictly.
41.   The project quality control, investment control and construction period control are
good.
42.   The social and economical efficiency of the project are good.
43.   The startup of the project construction was delayed because of the delayed project
approval by the Chinese side and slow mobilization of local fund.
44.   The project is completed but it cannot be operated per the projected plan to realize
the expected economic performance, because of the delay of the downstream project, i.e.,
TSP project, and the difficult availability of railway transportation, which have had
impact to the marketing of this project.
