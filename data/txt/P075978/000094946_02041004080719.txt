*1.0 BACKGROUND
1.1   Introduction
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Education in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, See
Fig.1, engaged the Department of Environment to carry out an Environmental Impact
Assessment of the proposed site for the Secondary School at Saddlers Village. This
document describes the environmental implications of the proposed development,
recommends the necessary mitigation measures and the areas requiring further study.
The development includes the construction of a Secondary School at Saddlers Village to
serve the feeder primary schools from Dieppe Bay to Lodge Village. At present this area is
being served primarily by the Cayon High School and the Sandy Point High School. It is
expected that the new development will accommodate up to 400 students and will reduce the
present overcrowding at the two previously mentioned schools.
1.2   Project Location
The area identified is located in the village of Saddlers, the fourth largest community on the
island. The site is located in a primarily farming area and has been earmarked by the new
physical development plan as a likely area for school expansion. The site occupies some
15.51 acres of farmland and savannah with phase 1 of the project (the school) to incorporate
some 3.12 acres. See Fig 2.
1.3   Project Description
Phase I of the project involves the construction and furnishing of a secondary school on the
site. See Fig 3. The new school will accommodate four hundred and fifty (450) students from
the ages of 12- 18, that is, the secondary education level. Five blocks housing twenty five
classrooms, human resource center/library, eight science and technical laboratories,
gymnasium/auditorium, home economics center/cafeteria and computer room will be
constructed. Each block will accommodate six bathrooms. An administrative block including
six bathrooms will also be constructed. The Ministry of Education is seeking to have the
new school serve as a pilot project where the facility is being designed to serve for the next
25 - 30 years without the need for significant additions/upgrades.



* 2.0 EIA APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
The approach and methodology followed the following steps:
A.    Scoping Exercise
Visits were made to the site along with discussions with relevant departments in an effort to
identify the significant issues related to the development and the individuals likely to be
affected.
The following areas have been determined to be of potential concern to the development and
surrounding area:
Drainage/storm water management;
Waste water and sewage management
Soil Conservation /Erosion
The final report covers:
A detailed description of existing conditions;
An evaluation of likely impacts
Mitigation measures
B.    Methodology
The ELA will address biophysical and socio-economic impacts and effects of the project. An
assessment of the state of the existing environment was conducted and includes the
following:
* Review of existing site data;
* Review present resource use;
* Identify environmental features or ecosystems requiring attention and/or protection.
3.0   BASELINE CONDITIONS
Prevailing baseline conditions for the 15.51 acres site are as follows. The following
categories were used in assessment:
Climate and Rainfall
Geology and Soil Type
Terrestrial Ecology
Socio-economic Environment
Infrastructure
-2-



* 3.1  Climate and Rainfall
The site under consideration experiences a tropical marine climate, which is influenced by
the North East Trade winds. This is typical of the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.
Atkins (1983) shows that the average annual rainfall for the area is 69.9 inches. The months
of September, October and November are periods of highest rainfall - 8 inches. February and
March each has less than 4 inches. Each of the remaining months has an average rainfall in
excess of 4 inches
3.2   Geology and Soil Type
A geology map of St. Kitts, See Fig.4, shows that the soil at the proposed development site is
relatively young and formed from volcanic activity. Atkins (1983) reported that this soil is
coarse textured and deep See Fig. 5, 6 and demonstrates the characteristics of a highly
absorptive sandy loam.
On examining the site, the sandy loam nature of the soil was confirmed. No extensive digging
was done by the analyzing team to determine the exact profile of the soil at the site.
Further examination of the site revealed a significant gully or ghaut (dry river) bordering the
site. The ghaut runs the entire length of the proposed site and forms the eastern boundary of
the development. The ghaut drains the Saddlers mountain area and only flows in times of high
rainfall.
3.3   Terrestrial Ecology
The site was mainly scrubland with a couple of vegetable farming plots and grazing land for
cows. The predominant vegetation identified was Panicum maximum or "guinea grass".
There is no known faunal species that is unique to this site.
Because of the nature of the proposed project, it was not necessary to compile an inventory of
the weed species or micro flora and micro fauna that inhabit the site.



3.4   Saddlers Infrastructure
The infrastructure available in the village of Saddlers, along with the neighboring
communities, is modem and up to date. A breakdown of the critical services available is as
follows:
Electricity- a reliable source of electricity is provided by the Government owned power
plant.
Water- Portable water is clean and available. To the South of the site bordering the southern
most boundary is a reservoir with the capacity to hold 200,000 gallons of water. This
reservoir serves the village of Saddlers. No ground water has been located in the Saddlers
area and drilling continues in an effort to alleviate the shortages that occur during the dry
season. Shortcomings during the dry season are accommodated by the well in Dieppe Bay
and surface water from the Phillip's area. It is expected that further water demand can be
met by the wells at Dieppe Bay.
Telephone - Saddlers is serviced by an excellent fibre optics telephone system.
Health Services - The Saddlers Village area has a community clinic which is capable of
treating minor injuries with serious cases referred to the general hospital in Basseterre.
Roads - The roads in Saddlers Village and to the site are in excellent condition which makes
the site readily accessible by vehicle and foot.

PART 2
4.0 PROJECT EVALUATION
This stage involves an assessment of the effects or likely direct impacts of the project. The
assessment includes:
* Land use assessment
* Erosion impacts/construction related impacts
* Impacts on vegetation
* Impacts on Infrastructure
* Operations related impacts - water use, wastewater/sewage
4.1   Land use compatibility
In St. Kitts, the Ministry Planning and Development has the responsibility for land use
planning and development control. The Government owns approximately 78% of the land in
St. Kitts. See Fig. 7.
The proposed development will occupy acres of land on 15.51 acres set aside for this
development. The school will be located South of the Village of Saddlers. It is adjacent to the
Saddlers playing field and South East of the Saddlers Park Housing Development.
The site for the school is presently occupied by two large farming plots. The Ministry of
Education and Agriculture have agreed to relocate the Farmers to appropriate sites.
Mitigation
* Farmers are relocated to site that are equally accessible and comparable to present
plots. Communication between all parties involved is essential to prevent
dissatisfaction.
-5-



4.2   Potential Erosion Impact
The site is located adjacent to a steep sided ghaut whose highest point is approximately 30ft.
The development has made provisions for a 1 00ft buffer zone between the school site and the
edge of the ghaut.
The ghaut in some areas, mainly those on the far side of the development, has exposed steep
sided surfaces. On the side that abuts the development site, although steeply sided, the
slopes are covered in vegetation. The riverbed shows no evidence of flowing water
extending beyond the floor of the river. Though steep sided, the river course is wide and
meanders gently, evidence which indicates that this is not a youthful river.
The development is sited on gently sloping land. The highest point relevant to this phase of
the project is 228 feet and the lowest is 202 feet above mean sea level. During construction,
excessive disturbed soil due to excavation will be prone to erosion, especially during heavy
rainfall. It is expected that some erosion will occur during the construction phase.
Generally, the highly porous, free draining sandy loams existing throughout the island and in
particular on slopes are susceptible to wind and water erosion. The exposed position and
aspect of the site adds to the potential of this impact.
A primary source of dust and noise will be construction site traffic. The sight sits on a slope
that faces the North East Trade winds and is in fairly close proximity to the sea. Wind blown
excavated and general construction material improperly stored will have the potential to
generate dust.
Mitigation
*  Place dust screens and buffer boards around the area being constructed, particularly
in the areas closest to the Housing development and playing field, to confine much of
the construction related dust.
*  Wetting back fill material.
*  Phase removal of vegetation will prevent huge areas becoming exposed to the wind.
4.3   Effects on Vegetation and Landscape
The main vegetation that may be destroyed during excavation work for building is the
"guinea grass" This may be considered a tolerable impact as this plant is not unique to the
project site. It should be noted here that guinea grass has been used widely on the island to
counteract erosion. Wherever possible this plant should be replaced by more appropriate
grasses to maintain soil cover.
-6-



4.4   Operations Related Impacts
Direct demands for potable water will increase as a result of the new secondary school. The
Water Department will, in its estimation, be able to meet the increased demand for water that
the new school will bring. As a contingency to the 200,000 gallons of water being provided
by the reservoir at Saddlers, extra water can be obtained from the wells at Dieppe Bay.
The school is proposed to have 36 individual bathrooms. It is expected, as is the common
practice, that a septic system with leach-field will be employed. As the project is still under
design, sewerage information was unavailable.
Mitigation
* The collection of rainwater off the various buildings into cisterns to serve as reserves
in times of drought.
* A proper sewage system be designed, and incorporate the future demands of the
development. This system should take into consideration the present drilling plans of
the Water Department and the need to prevent contamination of the ground water.
Percolation tests will be required to inform this process.
* A proper drainage system be designed to prevent occurrence of erosion on the site
during and after construction.
-7-



5.0   Environmental Guidelines for Establishment of Schools in the Federation of
St. Kitts-Nevis.

submission to the Development Control Planning Board (DCPB).
*  In some instances where sewage disposal is by absorption pits (soakaway) or
septic tanks with absorption pits or tile fields, percolation tests may be required
by the DCPB. These tests are described in the St. Kitts Building Guidelines.
* Treatment of sewage can be accomplished satisfactorily through a septic tank and
soakaway pit or tile field. Where septic tanks are being used the design of the
tank should include a grease trap.
-10-



* The effluent from the septic tank can be channeled to an absorption pit or to a tile
field. All absorption pits or tile fields shall be located so as to allow adequate
protective distance to the boundaries of the lot and to the building.
* No absorption pit or tile field should be located in the vicinity of an actual or
potential well or source of domestic water supply. The disposal of solid waste
must be carried out in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Ministry
of Health.
* All construction sites should store solid waste in a specific area on site that is
maintained in a sanitary manner. A proper schedule for disposal should be
developed to avoid accumulation of waste.
* A solid waste collection plan should be established in conjunction with the Solid
Waste Management Corporation. This plan should include onsite storage,
collection times and a recycling plan if applicable.
Construction Guidelines
* Consultation has to be sought from the Ministry of Health and Environment
before constructing in an area deemed to be an historical/archaeological site or of
historical/archaeological interest.
* Approval for development has to be granted by the Development and Control
Planning Board when constructing on a historical site.
* Access to dwellings and businesses should be guaranteed for both the
construction and operational phases.
* Alternative solutions and final designs should be subject to public and
community consultation with special emphasis on the property owners directly
affected, local NGOs and CBOs and private sector organizations.
* To minimize public nuisances, construction activities should follow strict
environmental guidelines. Construction schedules and the timing of necessary
interruption of public utilities (electricity, water and telephone) should be
informed to the affected community.
