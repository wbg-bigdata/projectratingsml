INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COlIPANY LIMITED
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
1.        I submit the folloTwmg report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies ecuivalent to $30 million to the
Tanzania Electric Supply Company, Limited (TANESCO) to be guaranteed by
the United Republic of Tanzania.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In February 1966 the Government of Tanzania requested Bank
Group assistance in financing the 1966-1975 development program of
TANESCO, a Government-owned company responsible for public power supply
in mainland Tanzania. After having considered ten hydroelectric and
several thermal alternatives, the Government had focused its attention
upon two possible projects, Kidatu and Wami, and it contracted consul-
tants to undertake a comparative study of these two major schemes. The
study, which was completed in July 1968, concluded that the Kidatu Projeot
would be the more economic alternative. The Bank received the full
feasibility report for the Kidatu Project in December 1969, and the
project was appraised in the field in April 1970.
3.        In November 1967, the Bank made a $5.2 million loan to TANESCO
(Loan No. 518 TA) to finance the installation of 21 megawatts (NWr) of
diesel generating facilities and the extension of its transmission and
distribution systems, as part of an interim expansion program which was
intended to help meet the demand for power in the main coastal region of
Tanzania until a major station could be commissioned. This project is
being implemented according to schedule.
4.       Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in 'Jiashington
in mid-September 1970. Negotiations were held concurrently for the
provision of an additional $12 million for the project by the Kingdom
of Sweden. The Tanzanian delegation consisted of: Yessrs. E. A. lMayisela,
Commissioner for the Exchequer and Budget, Treasury; G. F. Mbowe, Com-
missioner for National Industries and Power, Ministry of Commerce and
Indastries; J. E. Borneo, Legal Consultant; A. M. Maalim, Chairman,
TANESCO; F. S. Batty, General MIanager, TANESCO; J. M. Sneddon, Chief
Accountant, TANESCO; T. J. Kasella, Assistant Secretary, Treasury; and
P. A. Nordstrom and J. M. Vedin, Consulting Engineers, the Swedish
Consulting Group (SIECO). The Kingdom of Sweden was represented by
Messrs. G. Westring, A. Aastrup and A. Trydell of the Swedish Inter-
national Development Authority.

5.        The proposed loan would be the third Bank loan to Tanzania,
which has also received eight IDA credits.  The position of these loans
and credits as of October 31, 1970 is summarized below:

1/ This credit, originally $8.0 million, was increased to $15.5 million
in November 1969.
6.        The Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 80 TA) encountered
initial delays, principally due to staffing shortages and organizational
problems affecting the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA), the
channel for credit under the project. Action to resolve these diffi-
culties has been taken, and performance has since improved. In light of
this improvement, the Association agreed to postpone the closing date
for the Credit from December 31, 1969, to June 30, 1971. Further steps
to strengthen NDCA's staff and structure have recently been taken in
connection with the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No. 217 TA), for
which NDCA is again the channel for credit to participating farmers and
agencies.
7.        The Tanzania Government has advised the Association that it
proposes to establish a new Rural Development Bank which would incorporate
NDCA. The structure of this new bank is under consideration by the
Government, and the timing of its establishment has yet to be determined.



- 3 -
The Tanzania Government is fully aware of its obligations under Credit
No. 217 TA and Credit No. 80 TA with regard to replacement of NDCA and
has confirmed that action to implement its proposal to establish a Rural
Development Bank will be taken only after mutually satisfactory arrange-
ments have been agreed.
8.        The Ranch Development Project (Credit No. 132 TA) started
slowly, mainly because of a reorganization of parastatal organizations
in Tanzania, which necessitated amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement, and delays in obtaining satisfactory land titles for the
project ranches.  Both these difficulties have now been resolved and the
rate of disbursement of the Credit has recently improved significantly.
9.        Implementation of the Second Education Project (Credit No. 149 TA)
was held up for some time by a Government request for amendments to the
project, to which the i:ssociation agreed in May 1970 (IDA R70-8 dated
March 19, 1970). Frepcvation of architectural drawings and other necessary
preliminary work for tile execution of the amended project are now pro-
gressing satisfactorily, and it is expected that construction of school
buildings will begin during the first half of 1971 in accordance with
the revised schedule.
10.       Delays occurred in recruitin6 experts to be financed under the
Supplementary Highway Project (Credit No. 115 TA) for a staffing and
training program in the Roads and Aerodrome Division of the Ministry
of Co=munications, Labour and WIorks, but arrangements for the recruitment
of the required experts have now been made. Actual construction work
on the roads being financed under this Credit, and also under the Second
Highway Project (Credit No. 142 TA and Loan No. 586 TA), is proceeding
satisfactorily.
11.       Further projects in Tanzania under active consideration include
an Agricultuoal Education Project, for which I expect to seek the Executive
Directors' approval of a Credit of $4.25 million shortly. A proposed
Third Highway Project is now being appraised.
12.       In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 5 above, the
B.ank has made six loans for cormon services in East Africa.  All of these
loans are guaranteed jointly and severally by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda;
the United Kingdom is also a guarantor for the first loan for the East
African Railways.  The following is a summary statement of Bank loans for
coimmon services as of October 31, 1970.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED LOAN
14.       BORRO!W.ER:              - Tanzania Electric Supply Company
(TANESCO)
GUARANTOR:               - The United Republic of Tanzania
PURPOSE:                 - To assist in financing the develop-
ment of hydroelectric generating
capacity at Kidatu on the Great
Ruaha River, the extension of an
exis-ting diesel ge:nerating station,
the constiruction of tr,ansmission
facilities, and consultants' services
AMOUNT:                  - Various currencies equivalent to
$30.0  -illion
A4ORTIZATION:            - In 25 years including a 5-year
period of grace, through serii-
annual installments beginning
August 1, 1976 and ending
February 1, 1996
INTEREST RATE:           - 7-4.per arnum
CONIIITVJENT CHARGE:     - 3/4 of 1% per annum
RATE OF RETURN:          - Incremental financial rate of
return estimated at 16%
15.       The proposed Swedish credit of $12 million will be extended
on IDA terms to the United Republic of Tanzania and will be relent by
the Government to TANESCO on terms similar to the terms of the Bank
loan, except that no conmitment charge will be levied.
PART III - THE PROJECT
16.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the iidatu Hydro-
electric Project of Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd." (PU-48a) is
attached. The proposed project, which would be by far the largest power
project so far undertaken in Tanzania, is intended to meet the rapidly
growing demand for power through 1980 in the coastal region of the country
where most commercial and industrial activity is concentrated. The
main items in the project are:



- 6 -
(a) construction of the first stage of a hydroelectric
power complex at Kidatu on the Great Ruaha River,
including a dam creating a reservoir and an under-
ground generating station with a capacity of 100 NWlJ
and with provision for the addition of two more 50 1W
units when required;
(b) extension by about 15 nW of an existing diesel generating
station at Ubungo, near Dar es Salaam, to provide addi-
tional power needed before the commissioning of the
Kidatu Project;
(c) construction of a single circuit 220 KV transmission
line from Kidatu to Ubungo and related step-dowm
substation at Ubungo; and
(d) consulting services required for implementing the
project and to study and make recommendations for
dealing with the ecological effects of the project
and subsequent stages of development.
17.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $59 million,
excluding interest during construction. The foreign exchange component
is $42 million, which would be financed by the $30 million Bank loan
and the $12 million Swedish credit. The $17 million local currency
component would be provided by the Government in the form of a subscription
to TANESCO's equity capital. Interest during construction, estimated
at $6.5 million, would be financed out of TA.UESCO's own internal cash
generation. Reimbursement of expenditure of up to $1 million incurred
for consultants' services in preparing the project and for the construction
of an access road to the Kidatu site will be made out of the Swedish
credit. Thereafter disbursements from the Bank loan and the Swedish
credit will be made so as to maintain a 2½ to 1 ratio.   The procurement
of goods and the award of construction contracts to be financed by Sweden
and the Bank would be in accordance with the Bank's normal international
competitive bidding procedures.
18.       The growth of electricity consumption in the coastal region
of Tanzania has been relatively high, averaging more than 12% per annum
since 1961: in 1969 it was 13%, and it is expected to reach a peak of
about 19% in 1972 with the commissioning of new industrial plants now
under construction. Thereafter the rate of growth is expected to be
about 10% per annum. On the basis of these projected growth rates, the
incremental financial rate of return is around 16%. A sensitivity
analysis shows that the incremental financial rate of return could vary
between 10% and 19% depending on the rate of load growth and other factors.



- 7 -
19.       TANESCO, which is the only licensed public electric generating
and distributing authority on the mainland of Tanzania, is well managed
and its financial position is sound. Since 1966 the Company has achieved
an annual rate of return in excess of 10% on net fixed assets in operation.
It was agreed during negotiations that in the future the annual rate of
return will continue at not less than this level, except during the years
1975 through 1981, when it should not be less than 7%, and that TANESCO
will make no reduction in its presently prevailing tariffs through 1981.
The lower rate of return expected during the seven-year period reflects
the substantial increase in TANESCO's rate base due to the commissioning
of the new station at Kidatu and is typical of investments in hydroelectric
facilities involving large dams. In order to ensure that adquate funds
are available during the construction period of the proposed project,
assurances have been obtained that there will be no increase in the present
dividend rate of 6-2/3% paid by TANESCO to the Government on Ordinary
Shares during the years 1970 through 1976. It was also agreed that
TANESCO will not incur any new debt unless its internal cash generation
is at least 1.4 times the maximum future consolidated debt service
requirements on all the debt of the Company and its subsidiaries.
20.       As indicated in paragraph 16(a) above, provision has been
made in the proposed project for the installation of an additional
100 MI of generating capacity at Kidatu when this is required. Such
an extension would require the construction of a second dam upstream,
but it would cost only about one-third the cost of the initial power
project. Assurances have been obtained from Tanzania that TANESCO would
continue to install additional generating capacity at Kidatu so long as
it could be demonstrated that this is the most economic means of producing
additional power for the coastal system.
21.       Particular attention has been focused on the siting of the
transmission line which passes through the Nikumi National Game Park,
and agreement has been reached on a location where the line will not
detract from the esthetic and scenic qualities of the park. A general
ecological reconaissance of the area affected by the proposed project
was completed in September 1970, and an in-depth study of some of the
points which it raised is already under way. The proposed project, like
any major hydroelectric project, will have ecological side effects, some
harmful and others beneficial. However, it is believed that if these
side effects (for example, vegetation and hydrologic changes, health
problems, the need for population resettlement, new fishing and game
opportunities) are identified during the early stages of project imple-
mentation, they can be dealt with. Accordingly, the findings of the
on-going study will receive close and careful attention.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and TANESCO, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Republic of Tanzania and
the Bank, the draft Joint Financing Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Bank and TANESCO, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. An Administrative Letter from the Bank and IDA to the Kingdom
of Sweden, which is the basic agreement governing all joint financing
operations with the Kingdom of Sweden, was distributed to the Executive
Directors in connection with Loan No. 605 ET (R69-82-L).
23.       The legal structure of the loan documents is designed to take
account of the Bank loan to TANESCO, guaranteed by the United Republic
of Tanzania, a development credit by the Kingdom of Sweden to the United
Republic of Tanzania, for onlending to TANESCO, and the joint financing
of the project by the Kingdom of Sweden and the Bank. The Bank Loan
Agreement and the Swedish Development Credit Agreement each contain the
financial terms and covenants that are of interest to the individual
respective lenders (although incorporating by reference the covenants
contained in the Joint Financing Agreement). In addition the Bank Loan
Agreement provides in Section 4.o5 for the deletion of certain sections
of the Loan Agreement in respect of Loan No. 518 TA (see paragraph 3
above) which have been superseded by new provisions in the Joint Financing
Agreement and the extension by TANESCO of the mortgage already created
in favor of the Bank to cover the proposed new Loan.
2h.       The Joint Financing Agreement deals with the disbursement of
the Bank Loan and the Swedish Credit and contains covenants relating to
the project which conform to the general pattern of covenants used for
power projects. It includes the covenant by the United Republic of
Tanzania referred to in paragraph 20 above.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
25.       An economic report entitled "The Economic Development and
Prospects of Tanzania" (Report No. AE-7 in two volumes) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on I4arch 24, 1970 (R70-43). The principal
findings of this report were briefly summarized in the Report and Recom-
mendation of the President to the Executive Directors (Report No. P-805
dated May 1, 1970) in connection with a loan to the East African Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation. Updated Basic Data are attached.



- 9 -
26.       Tanzania's Second Five-Year Plan, launched on July 1, 1969,
provides for investment of Sh 8,055 million. The Bank's economic mission
which reviewed the Plan considered that it generally reflected the appro-
priate priorities in Tanzania, although the total size was somewhat
ambitious, since it represented about twice the investment which was
actually achieved during the previous Plan. However, the mission concluded,
in the light of Tanzania's growing capacity to prepare and implement
development projects, that a target of Sh 7,430 million would be within
Tanzania's reach and would deserve the support of aid donors and that
Tanzania should be able to provide a substantial proportion of the
necessary resources itself, although some 30 percent would be required
from abroad. In view of the substantial capital inflow into Tanzania
which is expected in the coming years, the country is regarded as eligible
for IDA assistance. However, since Tanzania's present debt service ratio
is approximately 6.7%, it is in a position to undertake some further
borrowing on conventional terms. A Bank mission is currently in the field
to review recent economic developments in Tanzania, and it is hoped to
circulate its report to the Executive Directors in the first half of 1971.
PART VI - OOMLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
