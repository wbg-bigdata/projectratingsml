PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UNION OF MYANMAR
TANK IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1315-BA)
Evaluation Summary
ObJectives
1.          The main objective of the project was to provide storage for the
surplus wet season runoff in two streams: (a) the Kinmundaung River in the Magwe
division of the Central Myanmar dry region to protect the monsoon paddy crop from
the vagaries of rainfall and to promote the non-paddy crops; and (b) the Az,n
River in the Mon State in the Southern coastal wet region to promote a second
paddy crop, to plant irrigated orchards on a pilot basis, and to supply municipal
water to a town of 40,000 inhabitants. The Kinmundaung subproject included an
earth dam 82 ft. high, rehabilitation of a diversion weir about five miles
downstream and improvement and extension of the irrigation system for 5,000
acres. The Azin subproject included an earth dam 92 ft. high, irrigation system
for 2,000 acres of paddy and 850 acres of orchards directly fed from the combined
irrigation and water supply sluice on the dam, and water treatment plant and
distribution network for the town supply. Both the subprojects included support
for agricultural extension and research activities, including local and overseas
training for Myanma Agriculture Service (MAS) staff for improving extension work.
The project also provided for the strengthening of the Irrigation Department (ID)
in investigation, testing, and preparation of feasibility studies through
training in che country and overseas. Individual consultants were to be provided
for an expert review of the designs and implementation procedures of the two dams
and appurtenances, and for review of the final designs and drawings for the town
water supply.
Implementation Experience
2.          Actual project implementation took about eight years compared with
the planned six-year period. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1990, after two
extensions of one year each. The delay was mainly due to national shortage of
construction materials, diesel and lubricants; increase in the quantities for the
foundation excavations and dam fill; slow procurement of construction equipment;
and political unrest during the latter part of the project period. By October
1988, the Kirunundaung subproject works were completed as defined at appraisal and
further refined as a result of the individual dam expert review. Azin subproject
works were completed on June 30, 1990, though water was stored to the full-supply
level in monsoon 1989. The planting of orchards (both government 250 acres and
private 600 acres) was completed during the 1989 monsoon. These orchards were
irrigated in the following dry season.   Extension and research staff were
mobilized early in full strength, but shortage of diesel affected the farmer
contact   sessions.       Trials   were   carried   out   at   research   farms
established/strengthened under the project, and at farmers' demonstration plots,



- iv -
but definite findings, w'-ich could be used for extension, were not available
until project closing.  With assurance of irrigation, the utilization of the
Myanmar Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (MAB) credit facilities improved,
and the farmers increased fertilizer use, although not at the desired level due
to shortage of fertilizer in the country. Appointment of the consulting firm for
strengthening ID and the individual consultants for review of water supply
drawings was delayed by nearly one year but the independent dam expert was
contracted in time.  At completion, the project cost of US$30.78 million was
about 13% higher than the appraisal estimate of US$27.10 million. The IDA Credit
of SDR 17.90 million was utilized, except for about SDR2.82 million, which was
cancelled.
Results
3.          Overall, the project was marginally satisfactory, having achieved
many of its objectives. Irrigation commenced in the Kinmundaung subproject in
1986. Though irrigated cropping intensity has not increased during these four
years due to continued lower than anticipated inflow into the reservoir and delay
in obtaining results from the efforts at good water management by the farmers and
government staff the trend for increase in HYV paddy and stabilization of sesame
can be noticed. A cropping intensity of 130% is anticipated (paddy 60%, sesame
30%, other crops 40%) a-ainst SAR anticipation of 150%. The farmers are not
likely to put in cotton (SAR expectation) due to shortage of chemicals and
fertilizers. Area under pulses would increase instead. At the Azin subproject,
the irrigation of orchards and intercrops commenced from November 1989.  The
irrigation of the second paddy crop was initiated in about 20% of the area in
November 1990. The drinking water supply also started about the same time. At
full development, double crop of paddy is expected on 2,000 acres, fruit
producing orchards on 850 acres and supply of about 1.21 million gallons annually
to the Mudon town.   The work Ly the consulting firm and the review by the
independent dam expert have been very productive  in strengthening ID for
preparation of feasibility studies, improvement of quality of implementation of
tha project and assurances for dam safety.   The institutional impact of the
project was good, especially for ID, 30 ID staff having undergone training within
the country and 17 overseas.  MAS staff could not benefit from the overseas
training as COM did not provide the necessary clearance.  At full development,
Kinmundaung sub-project economic rate of return is estimated at 12.3%, against
SAR estimate of 13.6%; for Azin sub-project, 7.3% against SAR estimate of 12.3%;
and for the project as a whole about 9.2% against SAR estimate of 12.8%.
Sustainabilit 
4.          The project is considered sustainable, but this will depend on saving
of water for the second crop through proper water management and maximum possible
use of rainfall for the wet season crops. Improvement in the availability of
fertilizer and agrochemicals is also necessary to obtain better yields and to
permit further diversification into high value crops.



v 
Findings and Lessons Learned
*    Project implementation suffers greatly when the government does not
allocate sufficient priority to enable access to controlled materials
such as cement, diesel, etc. (PCR paras 5.01, 5.02, and 9.01).
*    Timely  procurement of construction equipment and consultants  is
critical  for  such  projecvs.    Where  the  Borrower's  procurement
procedures ar* known to he ex;raordinarily time consuming, IDA should
give more emphasis to agreements to shorten those procedures and
advance procurement action during the preparation/negotiation stage
of the project (PCR paras. 5.01, 9.01).
*    Formation of farmers groups at the turnout level and their proper
training for water management and for the maintenance of the field
canals as well as extension activity for irrigated agriculture should
be initiated early and pursued actively to assure proper use of
available water for maximizing agricultural production (PCR paras
6.01(a), 7.01, 9.03).

2.   Backgrcund
2.01.     To promote the development of non-paddy crops and to protect paddy
production from the vagaries of rainfall in the Central Dry Zone of Myanmar, as
well as to explore the possibility of a second paddy crop and development of
orchards on relatively poorer soils in the southern high rainfall coastal region,
the Government of Myanmar (GOM) initiated in mid seventies a program for
extending irrigation through storage of surplus wet season flows. At the same
time, a series of agricultural reforms were implemented which included increased
investment in agriculture, an intensified agricultural extension program,
improved availability of inputs, and increased rice procurement prices.
2.02.     Of the major storage projects prepared under the program, IDA approved
in 1980 Credit 1031-BA. for the Kinda (Nyaunggyat) Multipurpose Project for
irrigating about 200,000 acres (new irrigation of 113,000 acres and
rehabilitation of the existing system for 88,000 acres) in the Central Dry Zone,
representing the first phase of IDA assistance. The studies carried out for the
various medium storage projects (Tank projects) in the Yin basin in the Magwe
division of the central region and a number of small valleys in the Mon state in
the southern coastal region resulted in the Tank Irrigation Project (TIP)
comprising one sub-project in each of the two regions. TIP under Credit 1315-BA
represented the second phase of IDA assistance. This was to have been followed
by a Second Tank Irrigation Project (Tank II), envisaging a dam and irrigation
system for about 40,000 acres in the Yin basin, which was prepared under TIP and
appraised in April 1988, but it could not be negotiated due to unexpecteJ
politica. developments in Myanmar.
3.        Project Obiectives and Description
3.01.     Project Objectives: The project sought to (a) increase crop production
and farm incomes through irrigation development for essentially small-holder
cultivation; (b) provide drinking water supply to a small town; (c) undertake
detailed studies of other Tank projects; and (d) strengthen the capacity of the
Irrigation Department (ID) for design and planning and that of the Myanma



-2-
Agriculture Service (HAS) field units for crop trials, extension, and
horticulture.
3.02.     Project ComRonents:  The main project componencs were:
(a) Kirunundaung sub-project comprising an 82 ft. high and 1150 ft. long
earth dam with uncontrolled chute spillway and irrigation outlet on
the left abutment and an emergency spillway on the right abutment,
rehabilitation of an existing diversion weir and extension and
remodelling of the irrigat.on system for 5,000 acres;
(b) Azin sub-project involving a 92 ft. high and 1350 ft. long earth dam
with uncontrolled chute £  llway and irrigation outlet on the right
abutment, irrigation facilities for 2,000 acres of paddy and 850 acres
of orchards, and water treatment plant and distribution system for
supplying water to Mudon town (population 40,000);
(c)  procurement  of  equipment  and  spare  parts  for  construction,
maintenance, extension, research, and strengthening the ID;
(d) training within the country and overseas for (i) strengthening of the
ID for investigations, surveys, planning, and design of irrigation
projects, and (ii) improving extension work by MAS field units;
(e) conducting crop trials/experiments at research stations (to be
established/strengthened  under  the  project)   and  at  farmers'
demonstration farms; and
(f) preparation of feasibility studies for additional Tank projects for
future investment.
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.01.     The project design involved medium earth dams with controlled outlets
and uncontrolled spillways for the storage of surplus runoff from the Kinmundaung
and Azin streams, to balance the inflow with the downstream water requirements;
construction of water conveyance systems to supply water to the expected
beneficiaries; and providing necessary training and institutional development to
assure proper planning and use of water. Earth dams with uncontrolled spillways
were found to be most economical considering the availability of suitable dam
fill materials in close proximity. ID had good experience with such dams and did
not require technical assistance for designs and construction of project works.
4.02.     The inflow estimate (average about 18,000 ac./ft. from 28.5 sq. miles
of catchment) at Kinmundaung dam and reservoir operation studies showed
sufficient water availability for providing supplemental irrigation to field
crops in 5,000 acres during the rainy seasor and a second crop during the dry
season in about 2,500 acres. With this anticipated water supply, the existing
diversion ieir (constructed in 1958), about four miles downstream of the dam, and
main canals serving 5,000 acres (farmed by 1,100 families) were taken up for
rehabilitation with addition of the secondary and tertiary canals and drains (not
constructed earlier).



3 -
4.03.     Soils in the area being suitable, new non- paddy crops (cotton in 30%
of the area, other crops in 30%) were proposed to be introduced while existing
sesame was to be stabilized in 30% of the area.  Trials for the new and the
existing non-paddy crops were to be carried out at a new 50 acre project research
farm. Also demonstration trials were to be carried out at ten farmers' fields
(34 acres). Necessary extension and research was envisaged to masl.mize crop
production from the available water through efficient water management.
Constiuction of one training center, three fertilizer and pesticide godowuls, two
laboratories, and seven staff quarters for MAS was also provided.
4.04.     The inflow estimates (average about 15,000 ac./ft. from 2.32 sq.miles
of catchment) at Azin and reservoir operation studies established sufficiency of
water for double crop of paddy on 2,000 acres (farmed by 450 families), 850 acres
of new orchards (250 acres to be developed by MAS and 600 acres to be developed
by allocation to about 160 orchard grower families), and for supplying municipal
weter to the Mudon town (40,000 inhabitants). The paddy area having heavy soils,
non-paddy crops on these lands were not pla ¶ned. The orchards were to be planted
on lands having no cultiva~tion or very poor rubber plantation.   Gravity
irrigation system, fed directly from the outlet on the dam, was envisaged for the
entire 2,850 acres of command area.  Distribution in the orchard areas was,
however, envisaged by pipes off-t-king from the open canals.
4.05.     A pressure pipe from the outlet on the dam was to deliver raw water to
the water treatment plant near the dam, from where the treated water was to be
pumped to the town. An overhead tank and necessary pipe network was to supply
water up to the boundaries of the houses requesting individual connection and to
stand posts.
4.06.     Trials for improving paddy prroduction were planned by strengthening the
existing 20 acres of paddy research tarm and arranging demonstration at six
farmers' fields (area 39 acres).   Planned orchards being new to the area,
research was to be carried out at the existing MAS horticulture station not far
from the area. In addition, demonstrations were to be arranged at 250 acres of
MAS-managed orchards. Additional extension personnel for horticulture and field
crops as well as for research and field trials were provided. Construction of
one training center, one laboratory, one water tank, three fertilizer and
pesticide godowns, and five staff quarters for MAS was also included.
4.07.     The ID capacity for investigation, design and planning of river valley
projects was to be strengthened by engaging an expatriate consulting firm for
providing training within the country and overseas. To provide training and to
evaluate the viability of future investments in identified Tank projects, the
consultants were to pursue the preparation of feasibility studies with the active
participation of ID staff for basin and site planning, surveys, investigations,
tests, designs, estimation of investment costs and benefits, and evaluation of
the economic impact.
4.08.     Individual experts were provided for (i) the review of the designs and
working drawings for the town water supply prepared by the Housing Department
(HD) of GOM, and (ii) for review of the detailed designs of the two dams and
their appurtenant structures prepared by ID, as well as ID construction
procedures, work quality, and O&M arrangements after completion.



- 4 -
4.09.     Overseas training was also separately envisaged for MAS staff in water
management, development of orchards, and crop technology for specific non-paddy
crops.
4.10.     The project was fairly well preparec  but a few design changes were
considered necessary during detailed designs and implementation:
(a)  Kinmundauna Sub-Project:   The major design changes were:   (i) the
provision of clay blanket on the abutments after easing of slopes,
considered necessary to reduce the seepage through the abutment
formations (hJghly compacted sand); (ii) the deeper excavation in the
river bed to reach acceptable foundations, since buried channels
having timber logs were found lower down; (iii) dropping the emergency
spillway after careful review of the hydrology, but adding a 2 ft.
high solid parapet on the tnp of the dam to provide extra freeboard
for the maximum probable flood; (iv) providing piezometers, relief
wells, drainage blanket, and berm loading to provide safety against
the sand boils in the river bed downstream of the dam encountered
after the first reservoir fill_ng (seepage and residual head has
progressively dropped down to safe levels); and (v) reducing the
expected cropping intensity with the project to 130% (instead of 150%
anticipated at appraisal) considering the low inflows since the
beginning of construction (spillway has not run so far and actual
maximum inflow received since 1983 has been only about 66% of
anticipated average).
(b) Azin Sub-Project: The major changes were: (5) shifting the spillway
further P-co the right hill (excavation increased) and provision of
anchors anu other slope stabilization measures for safety against
slides on the excavated rock face; (ii) increased grouting of the
foundation to form an effective grout curtain; (iii) provision of an
enlarged outlet conduit downstream of the dam axis to accommodate the
control valve at the dam axis and an exposed steel pipe within the
conduit for supplying water to the irrigation canal and to the
treatment plant; (iv) changing the pipe distribution envisaged for the
orchards to open channels due to non availability of sufficient head
and to avoid import of pipes and to reduce costs; and (v) providing
significantly larger number of control structures on the canal system
for assuring better water management.
4.11.     Three GOM agencies implemented the project by force account: (i) ID
procured construction equipment and materials and executed civil works for the
dams and irrigation systems and also procured agricultural and other
equipment/materials for RAS and Mudon Water supply; (ii) HAS provided research
and extension services and established 250 acres of Government orchard; and (iii)
HD prepared designs and working drawings for the Mudon water supply. For the
implementation of the water supply works, ID entered into a negotiated contract
with  the  government-owned  Construction  Corporation  (CC).    The  General
Administration Department (GAD) of GOM was responsible for strengthening the
Mudon Town Development Committee (MTDC) for the additional task of operating and
maintaining the water supply system. Each agency had a clearly defined, although
interlinked, program of work to execute. Necessary coordination and direction



- 5 -
was provided by the Project Implementation Committee( PIC), and this explains the
reasonably good implementation of the project.
5.        Proiect Implementation
5.01.     The project was completed in June 1990, three years behind schedule.
However, the project had a good start, the conditions for effectiveness of IDA
credit having been fulfilled in less than three months of Credit signing.
Construction of camps near the two dam sites and access roads was slower than
anticipated. Procurement processing took significantly longer than planned. The
construction equipment was received at the two project sites during the 1984
rainy season (project implementation schedule anticipated completion of delivery
by December 1983). Construction work commenced simultaneously at the two sub-
projects in November 1984 after receipt of construction equipment, but due to
shortage of cement, reinforcement steel, rubber water stops, diesel oil and
lubricants, a decision was taken to slow down the progress at Azin to fully meet
the requirement of construction materials for Kinmundaung sub-project.   The
selection of the consulting firm for strengthening ID was completed in May 1984
resulting in one year delay in commencement of training. The appointment of the
individual expert for the review of water supply designs was delayed till March
1985 though the implementation drawings were to be finalized by March 1984.
5.02.     Though the quantities  for the excavation of the Kinmundaung dam
foundations increased substantially and additional work was required for
blanketing of the compact sand formations in the abutments, ID could muster
enough resources to make up the lost time at Kinmundaung and storage commenced
during 1986 rainy season, as originally planned.    Additional equipment was
transferred to the sub-project from the ID fleet and the dam was raised to a safe
height initially in a truncated section. The completion of the remaining dam
section and the irrigation system was affected by the acute shortage of diesel,
lubricants, and cement, and the entire work could be finished only by October
1988 (SAR expectation was December 1986).  However, irrigation of crops in a
portion of the sub-project command area started on t.me from August 1986, when
the water was released from the dam for the first time.   Either due to
overestimation at feasibility stage or continued drought over Central Myanmar,
the annual inflow into the reservoir has never exceeded about 66% of the
anticipated average inflow, resulting in lower irrigated areas and no overflow
over the spillway.
5.03.     The slow progress of the works at the Azin sub-project continued .ill
October 1988, when all works were completed at Kinmundaung. The availability of
diesel and lubricants improved soon after import of crude oil by the Government
to meet the acute shortage of diesel.   The Azin dam and appurtenances were
completed and storage commenced during May 1989 rains. Since the outlet was kept
continuously open to keep the reservoir low during the first filling, water rose
to the spillway crest, but did not overflow. During the next rainy season of
1990, the water spilled over the spillway. Irrigation of the orchards and the
intercrops in the orchard area commenced in November 1989 (a three year delay)
and the irrigation of the second paddy crop commenced in November 1990 (a four
year delay).



- 6 -
5.04.     The variation in the quanAities of work occurred mainly due to changes
in designs  for assuring safety.   The excavation for the Kinmundaung dam
foundation and the quantity of dam fill as well as the excavation for the Azin
spillway and concrete for the spillway and outlet increased significantly.
5.05.     Progress of Mudon water supply was initially very slow due to poor
mobilization by CC and delay in issue of working drawings by HD. Later, shortage
of cement and reinforcement bars affected the program. At project closing, the
civil works were complete and the mechanical/electrical equipment and pipe
network was being given trial rurs.  Training of the key staff of MTDC for
operation and maintenance of the water supply component was ongoing.
5.06.     ID attached a team of 30 engineers and technicians to the consultants
for training in the different aspects of planning and design of irrigation
projects. With joint ID staff and consultants' inputs, two ranking studies were
completed in January 1985 for establishing priority among the identified Tank
projects in the Yin basin in Central Myanmar and the coastal region of Mon state,
based on the prefeasibility level assessments. The feasibility studies followed
later for the Yin and Sadon, the first two priority projects in the Yin valley.
The projects in the Mon state were found to be viable only if orchards could be
planted on a large scale. A separate study of the marketability of fruits -tas,
therefore, necessary prior to the preparation of the feasibility study of the
priority projects in the Mon State. MAS undertook to pursue such a study, but
was not able to complete it during the implementation of the project. Both Yin
and Sadon project studies were completed to feasibility level in January 1986 and
March 1987 respectively, and presented to IDA for possible funding under Tank II
project. IDA appraised Tank II in April 1988, but the project could not reach
the stage of negotiations due to unexpected political developments in Myanmar.
The consulting firm arranged lectures, seminars, and instructional field visits
to improve the ID staff competence for specific activities. Overseas training
was arranged by the consulting firm for 17 ID staff, the individual training
period ranging from two to five months.
5.07.     MAS staff did not proceed for overseas training as the government
approval could not be obtained. MAS created the necessary facilities and posted
staff in the full envisaged strength for crop trials, extension activity, and
plantation of Government orchard. The nurseries were established for the planned
fruit trees soon after the commencement of project implementation, but planting
of both the private and Government orchards had to be postponed for a few years
due to delay in the completion of the dam and political unrest in the country.
A portion of the Government orchard was, however, planted earlier by arranging
limited ground water irrigation, mainly to have demonstration effect. About 600
acres of land cleared for the private orchards were allocated to 162 orchard
growers, who completed the planting of seedlings in 1989 monsoon when irrigation
from the dam became available and have since been growing intercrops, mainly
bananas and vegetables.
5.08.     MAS  conducted crop  trials at the newly established/strengthened
research stations at Kinmundaung and Azin and at the farmers' fields.   The
Kinmundaung trials had the objective of determining appropriate crop technology
and optimum requirement of irrigation for non paddy crops.  The studies were
intermittently affected by civil disturbances. Crop trials also failed to attain



the potential yields due to shortage of fertilizer.   Trials at Azin were
generally conducted for the two crops of paday. The possibility of growing non-
paddy crops using residual soil moisture after paddy was also examined.   No
definite findings which could be used for extension, were available till the
project closing at both Kinmundaung and Azin.
6.        Proiect Results
6.01.     Overall the project was marginally successful, having achieved many of
its objectives. The results in the two sub-projects were as follows:
(a)  At Kinmundaung,  irrigation commenced from 1986 but the irrigated
cropping intensity did not increase due to inflow remaining
significantly lower than expected and insufficient ID and MAS efforts
for proper water management by the farmers. Though crop areas varied
over the years 1986 to 1990, there is a recognizable trend for
increase in HYV paddy area, as well as stabilization of sesame area.
Contrary to expectations at appraisal, farmers have not been planting
cotton. The anticipated area under cotton is not likely to be
achieved, mainly due to farmers' preference for other crops and
unwillingness of the farmers to take risks (non availability of
chemicals to prevent diseases, and acute shortage of fertilizer in the
country). Other crops are likely to reach about 2,000 acres. The PCR
economic and financial analysis is based on the revised expectation of
irrigation of 6,500 acres (cropping intensity of 130%; 60% under
paddy, 30% under sesame, and 40% under other crops). The anticipated
yields at full development are expected to reach the appraisal level.
(b) At Azin, the 2,000 acres of paddy land have been cultivated under
rain-fed conditions every year during project implementation, with
practically no second crop. At project closing, the second paddy crop
had not commenced, but about 20% of the area had second paddy in the
following dry season.  It is expected that at full development the
second paddy crop on practically the entire 2,000 acres will be
developed. The paddy yields at full development are also expected to
reach the appraisal level.  Fruits from the orchards would be ready
for the market by 1993.  The orchard growers are, however, already
marketing the produce from the intercrops.   For PCR economic and
financial analysis, orchard yields at full development are expected to
reach the appraisal level. Mudon water supply system was, at project
closing, under trial run. MTDC took over the system in February 1991,
when the consumption was about 0.26 million gallon per day (mgpd).
The water supply is expected to increase to about 1.21 mgpd (24
gallons per head) by the year 2000, which is 90% of the demand
expected at appraisal. MTDC would be paying ID at the rate of Kyat
one per thousand gallons of water supplied, to cover proportional OLM
cost and depreciation of civil works and equipment attributable to the
water supply component.
6.02.     The total implementation cost (US$30.78 million) of the project was
about 13X higher than the SAR estimate (US$27.10 million) mainly due to increase
in the quantities of excavation for obtaining suitable foundations of the



structures and dam fill.   The cost in foreign exchange (US$9.69 million),
however, remained lower than SAR estimate (US$13.12 million) mainly due to lower
than anticipated prices uf the construction equipment. The re-estimated economic
rate of return (ERR) is expected to be about 9.2% for the project as a whole,
compared to the SAR estimates of 12.8%; the Kinmundaung Sub-Project having 12.3%
against SAR expectation of 13.6% and Azin Sub-Project 7.3% against SAR
expectation of 12.3%. The reduction in the ERR is due to: (i) lower rice prices
in the international market; (ii) reduction of anticipated cropping intensity at
Kinmundaung due to lesser inflow; and (iii) higher investment and operating costs
for the orchards than anticipated at appraisal. Economic prices for rice were
derived from bank commodity price projections in constant 1990 dollars.  For
1990, an economic farmgate price for paddy of about Kyats 3,000 per ton was
derived. Financial prices for 1990 for free market sales ranged from Kyats 3,000
to 4,000/ton (Kyats 60-80/basket of 46 lbs.). In financial terms, the incomes
of the Kinmundaung and Azin farming families are expected to increase
significantly at full development (Table 6 C).
6.03.     Cost recovery from the farmers for O&M of the systems is being effected
through land tax of Kyats 3.5 per acre ana irrigation tax of Kyats 10 per acre.
In addition, the dealers trading in farm products have to pay sales/profits tax
(10% of paddy purchased and 5% of other crops) with turnover in excess of K10,000
per month.  These taxes recover fully O&M costs and a small share of capital
costs. The tariffs approved by GAD for Mudon water supply are Kyats 8.5 per
thousand gallons for connected household (minimum monthly charge Kyats 25.5) and
Kyats 6 per family per month for stand post supply.  These are sufficient to
recover MTDC O&M costs, payments to ID for depreciation of the equipment and
civil works directly attributable to the water supply component, and proportional
ID O&M cost, but the tariff for house connection is high and exceeds 4% of the
family's gross income, normally considered as a limit.
6.04.     The training provided under the project has strengthened ID capacity
for investigation and surveys, testing of materials, planning, and design. The
consulting firm provided major input in the preparation of the feasibility study
for the Yin project but the follow-up feasibility study for the Sadon project had
the bulk of the inputs from the ID.
7.        Project Sustainability
7.01.     Overall, the project is considered sustainable but its sustainability
will depend on continuous efforts at improvement of water management. The extent
to which the dry season crops can develop would depend directly on the amount of
water remaining in the reservoirs after the rainy season crop supplemental
requirements are fully met.   Maximum possible utilization of rainfall and
avoiding waste of reservoir water through over-irrigation is, therefore,
important. Formation of farmers' groups to control distribution of water on the
watercourse and its maintenance and availability of extension advice for
irrigated agriculture will have to be actively pursued. Monitoring for safety
of dams has to be effective and carried out at suitable intervals to assure
timely detection of problems, if any, and expeditious action to remedy any
defects. The operation and maintenance manuals have been prepared for both the
projects, which include dam safety monitoring as well.  The Kinmundaung sub-
project has been transferred to the O&M organization of the ID at Magwe, along



- 9 -
with the responsibility for timely detection of problems, if any, and expeditious
action to remedy any defects, and the Azin sub-project to the O&M organization
at Moulmein. The staff proposed to be maintained at the two sub-projects are
adequate for proper O&M. Financing for O&M is also adequate.
8.        Bank Performance
8.01.     The Bank, having the experience of unusual delays in procurement of
equipment for the Paddy II project (Credit 835-BA), insisted on Borrower's
submission of tender documents for key equipment before the Credit negotiations.
As a result, tenders were issued to the bidders before the Credit became
effective. The Bank supervised the project at almost half yearly intervals. The
supervision was very effective in solving both technical and procurement issues
expeditiously.    The Bank agreed to finance procurement  of crude oil and
lubricants and reinforcement bars, though the Credit did not initially provide
for the procurement  of materials.   Also  the Bank agreed  to finance  the
procurement of a few critical equipment items earlier committed by the Borrower
to be supplied under "reserve procurement" by indigenous suppliers.   Frudent
shopping was permitted in many cases with the objective of faster progress on the
works. The Bank established a Project Special Account in January 1987 to enable
the Borrower to obtain quick disbursement against the expenditures incurred on
civil works or overseas procurement through prudent shopping. For many years,
the Bank was unsuccessful in obtaining GOM agreement to import diesel and
lubricants, the lack of which was the main cause of project delays, although
diesel from imported crude (financed under the project) did finally become
available in the last two years of implementation. The main lessons which can
be drawn from the Bank's experience with the Project are:
(a) In future projects in Myanmar, the Bank should continue to insist on
the issue of tender documents before negotiations, and submission of
the evaluation report on the bids received should be a condition of
effectiveness.
(b)  Effective action (including suspension of disbursement) should be
considered when the Borrower does not accord sufficient priority to or
take suitable action to assure the supply of essential materials.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.01.     The  Borr   _.r,  assisted  by  FAO-CP,  prepared  the  project  in  a
comprehensive and thorough manner. However, the farmers at Kinmundaung were not
involved directly in the planning of the project which resulted in wrong
assumptions for crops to be developed.   The Borrower could not process the
equipment procurement fast enough to obtain the deliveries by the initial target
dates. Though tenders were opened in March 1983, the evaluation of the bids was
somewhat delayed and the recommendations for award reached IDA only in July 1983.
After IDA clearance for award of contracts in September 1983, the orders were
placed only in March 1984. GOM could not arrange delivery of the vehicles and
other equipment from the local suppliers, though it was anticipated under
"reserve procurement", and had to approach IDA to procure through ICB instead.
GOM gave low priority to the project which resulted in shortage of construction
materials (cement and reinforcement steel), diesel and lubricants for the



- 10 -
project.  Although the shortage was a national problem, COM did not agree to
import diesel and lubricants, which slowed project implementation, and resulted
in two one year extensions of the closing date. GOM also did not allow overseas
training of MAS staff utilizing IDA funds. The Borrower took an unusually long
time to process the selection of the consulting firm for strengthening ID and the
individual consultant for review of the Mudon water supply designs, but the
selection of an independent dam expert for review of the two dams and
appurtenances was undertaken promptly.
9.02.     The Borrower did not arrange the timely preparation of the monitoring
reports required at two years' interval commencing January 1984 and ending
January 1992. Though MAS submitted its proposal for monitoring in November 1983
(SAR requirement was June 30, 1983) envisaging the formation of a field survey
unit by January 1984, the only monitoring report received was in November 1985.
9.03.     The Borrower paid sufficient attention to the strengthening of the
extension effort and assistance to the farmer.   Seasonal credits to project
farmers increased from Kyats 568,000 in 1984-85 to Kyats 816,000 in 1989-90 (SAR
estimate was Iyats 1.3 million at full development).   Long term credits for
orchard growers (SAR estimate of Kyats 2.9 million) did not materialize till the
project closing. However, MAB had finalized arrangements for providing Kyats
100,000 credit to each of the 160 orchard growers (Kyats 16 million in total).
In spite of fertilizer shortage, urea consumption increased in the project areas
from 41.72 tons in 1984-85 to 73.20 tons in 1989-90, TSP from 3.24 tons to 5.16
tons, and K20 from 1.1 tons to 1.68 tons, but insecticide use was reduced by 50X.
Project Water Management Committees and Water Users Group for each water course
were formed to introduce proper water management but the dedicated effort to
establish proper water management from the very beginning has been lacking on the
part of MAS, ID, and the farmers.
9.04.     Overall, the project was properly managed by the implementing agencies.
The Project Director's personal efforts to push the work in spite of shortages
of diesel were noteworthy.  PIC's coordination of the different implementing
agencies was effective.   Project funding was adequate.   Quarterly progress
reports were regularly submitted. The audit reports on project annua'l accounts
were generally delayed and the disbursement against SOEs was suspended once
during FY 1987-88 both for MAS and ID because of such delays. Although a Project
Special Account was established in January 1987. with an initial deposit of US$
1.7 million, the facility was used very little due to procedural complications.
10.       Proiect Relationships
10.01.    Throughout its implementation, the project was marked by the most
cordial relationship between the Bank and GOM, although there were serious
differences on the issue of sufficient availability of diesel oil and lubricants
until GOM decided to import crude oil and lubricants.



- 11 -
11.       Consulting Services
11.01.    All  the three consultancies  funded under the project were very
effective in assisting the implementation of the project and achievement of its
objectives. The consultancy for strengthening the ID resulted in the improvement
of the ID capacity for preparation of feasibility studies; the expert review of
Mudon water supply resulted in many improvements in the design of civil works and
specifications of equipment; and the independent dam expert review resulted in
many layout and design changes of the two dams and appurtenances for improved
safety.
12.       Project Documentation and Data
12.01.    The appraisal report provided a useful framework fo- both the Bank and
Borrower to review project implementation. Excellent cost accounting system was
maintained by the ID and the MAS to identify expenditure by components. The MAS
properly recorded the irrigated and rain-fed crop areas in Kinmundaung and Azin.
Data required for the PCR was promptly provided by the ID and the MAS, following
credit closing.
