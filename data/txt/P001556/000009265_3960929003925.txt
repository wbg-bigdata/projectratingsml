MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM
1.      The following memorandum and recommendat.on on a proposed development
credit to Madagascar for SDR 19.8 million (US$ 26.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with 40 years maturity and help finance an Environment Program (the Program).
Parallel and co-financing in the amount of US$42.3 million equivalent would be
provided by UNDP, TUNESCO, USAID, French, German, Norwegian and Swiss Aids, RFW
(the Federal Republic of Germany), the World Wide Fund for Nature and
Conservation Internatinal.
2.      Background.  Madagascar has been identified by the international
community as one of the ecologically richest countries of this planet and one
where the heritage of biological diversity is most at risk. At the same time,
Madagascar is one of the economically poorest. This contrast, as in many
similar situations elsewhere in the world, has generated tensiont between the
proponents of conservation and those of development. But It is clear that one
cannot be obtained without the other. Their integration is, in fact, the key
principle at the foundation of the proposed Program. It is in line with the
recommendations of the UN Commission for theo Environment ('Our Common Future')
and with the UNESCO concept of 'Man and Biosphere".
3.      Madagascar is locked in a spiral of environmental degradation that
increasingly threatens sustainable development and what remains of the
country's unique ecological heritage. The protection of Madagascar's
biodiversity is commanding increasing international support and galvanizing,
in tne process, a growing recognition of the fundamental causes of
environmental degradation. As in most of Africa, environmental issues cannot
be Addressed in isolation of the impact of demographic pressure end inadequate
farming methods which lead to the unsustainable exploitation of available
resources. The need to deal simultaneously with a series of interdependent
Issues is another guiding principle of the proposed Program.
4.      To arrest this spiral of degradation, Madagascar has been the first
country in Africa to prepare an Environmental Action Plan (EAP). It has been
a joint enterprise between Government, a group of donors, including IDA, and
NGOs. Government mobilized Malagasy technicians (about 150 have been
involved), and donors provided financial and technical support. Special
efforts have been made to include and give a prominent role to NOOs, and to
integrate the results of their grass roots experience. This proved successful
as reflected in the design of the Program and its evolutive and progressive
approach, especially on the institutional side. Efforts have also been made
to mobilize the population at large through national campaigns. More efforts
will have to continue to be made to include resource users and beneficiaries
in this large scale national and international cooperation effort. As an
essential underpinning of this effort, the EA? is being formalized into the
National Charter for the Environment.
5.      Madagascar still enjoys a very good potential for development in
terms of climate diversity, important irrigation schemes that could be
expanded, land reserves, and minerals. However, despite its resources,
Madagascar, with a per capita income of US$ 225 in 1987, has become one of the



poorest countries in the world in the last decade, largely due to the economic
policies of the 1970's which seriously distorted incentives for production.
In addition, strong demographic pressures and the lack of modernized and
readily available farming methods have led to the extension of traditional
cultivation practices with dramatic environmental consequences (slash and burn
on steep hills poses setious erosion and soil conservation problems). The
impact of tnvironmental degradation is difficult to assess with reliable
accuracy, but economic losses resulting from lower agricultural productivity
due to soil loss, damaged infrastructure, and the reduced life span of
infrastructure are estimated to range from 5 to 15 percent of Madagascar GNP
annually.
6.      IDA has been active in tne Malagasy environment sector through
several environmentally related projects, and as one of the main promoters of
the EAP. The Second Agricultural Institutions Projects (Credit 1709-MAG)
finances an inventory of natural resources; the Titanium Mining Engineering
(Credit 1928-MAG) is helping to carry out an environmental assessment study of
the proposed project; the Energy I Project (Credit 1787-MAG) stresses energy
policy formulation and implementation; the Forests Management and Protection
Project (Credit 1878-MAG) includes conserving four natural reserves, forest
exploitation planning in the Antananarivo region and promoting private sector
in reforestation; and the National Agricultural Research Project (Credit 2041-
MAG) includes programs in soil conservation, watershed management and
development of technologies for sustainable exploitation of natural forests.
Two projects, soon to be submitted to the Executive Directors, also address
environmental questionss the Pilot Agricultural Extension Project and the
Antananarivo Plain Development Project. Other donors are also currently active
in environment (e.g. USAID and WWF in the management of parks and reserves and
the French, German and Cooperation in soil conservation and reforestation).
7.      Rationale for IDA involvement.  It is important for environmentally
related activities to be: (i) fully integrated in the macroeconomic program of
the Government to ensure their long-term sustainability and (ii) compatible
with the Government's complementary efforts to address the social dimension of
development. IDA's involvement will help to ensure these essential links and
to bridge the potential gap between conservation and development. It will
also assist Government in coordinating the many donors interested in
protecting Madagascar's threatened environment. The successful donor meeting
held in Paris on February 14-15, 1990 which resulted in the full funding of
the Program and the donors' willingness to channel their contributions through
the Program's framework are good examples of the coordinating role played by
IDA.
8.      Program objectives.  Long-term objectives are to reconcile the
Malagasy population with its environment by starting a long-term processt
first to conserve threatened sites of world-renowned biodiversity while
providing support to the surrounding communities to make them partners in
conservation, to impr-ve their living conditions and to help them develop
sustainable farming systems; second, to stop, or at least to slow down, soil
losses and sedimentation in priority areas where erosion has the most
destructive impact; and third, to establish the institutional and legal
framework, the policies, and the incentives conducive to environmentally
sustainable development. In this context, immediate objectives will be: (i)
to establish solid bases for WAP implementation by developing human resources,



progressively building new institutions and strengthening existing ones,
establishing sound environmental methods and procedures, and reinforcing
management tools; (ii) to begin operations of an urgent nature, namely,
protecting the patrimony of biodiversity, fighting erosion by protecting most
notably the country's major economic infrastructure, and better defining and
improving land security; and (iii) to prepare the second slice of the EAP
through studies and pilot operations.
9.      Program descrittion.  The pr-gram would cover implementation of the
first five years of the EAP, the completion of which would stretch over 15
years. It would consist of seven components under the overall coordination of
the National Office for the Environment (ONE): (i) protecting and managing
unique ecological systems together with the development of peripheral zones
(including the execution of field activities by NGO's under contract with the
Association for the Management of Protected Areas -- ANGAP -- within the
framework of policies approved by the responsible ministries); (ii) promoting
soil conservation, agroforestry, and other rural development activities in
priority zones, including several large watershed areas (mostly through mini-
projects involving the full participation of local communities financed by a
private -- NGO run -- National Association for Environmental Actions, ANAE);
(iII) developing maps and geographic information on Program areas; (iv)
Improving land security through the establishment of clear boundaries for
protected zones and land titling in priority areas; (v) ti ining environmental
spocialists and promoting environmental awareness and education at all levels
of Malagasy society; (vi) launching environmental research programs on land,
coastal and marine ecosystems to better protect and manage natural resources
on a sustainable basis; and (vii) developing support activities, composed of
institution building, the adoption of environmental assessment procedures (and
the provision of adequate funding for environmental assessments),
strengthening the environmental data base, monitoring and evaluation of the
different components of the program, and studies. Total costs have been
estimated at US$ 85.5 million equivalent, of which US$ 37.9 million (44
percent) in foreign exchange. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Madagascar are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No.8348-MAG of March 19, 1990 Is being distributed
separately.
10.     Monitoring and coordination.  Perhaps more than any ether development
activity, this Program does not lend itself to a rigid imple entation
blueprint; by its very nature, it will continue to be a joint learning process
with permanent adjustments. The Program does provide monitoring and feedback
mechanisms to do so. A Steering Committee is to be established under
Government's chairmanship with donor participation and that of NGOs and
representatives of beneficiaries to guide Program implementation. This
Committee will provide a joint forum to review implementation and draw
lessons; to review and approve proposed annual plans of the Program's various
components; and to agree on funding. Furthermore, donors have decided to
create a Multi-Donor Secretariat (MDS). It is being established at IDA
Headquarters, with USAID support. MDS is an attempt to deal with a large
number of donors, international and bilateral agencies, NGOs, universities,
museums, zoological and botanical gardens. MDS will aim to ensure



- 4 -
coordination and the circulation of information. It will also hblp ensure
that funding is planned in advance, meets priority needs in Madagascar, and is
delivered on time. UNDP is also financing a local consultant to help monitor
program implementation in Madagascar.
11.    Actions a"reed at negotiations: Three types of agreements have been
reached: (a) Institution buildinat (i) a draft decree for the creation of
ONE and draft statutes for ANGAP have been prepared and reviewed. Formal
establishment of ONE and ANGAP will be conditions of effectiveness as will be
operationalization of the recently created National Association for
Environmental Actions (ANAE); (£i) a draft National Charter for the
Environment has been approved by the Cabinet and its legislative text will be
published as a condition of effectiveness; (iII) a Steering Committee is to be
created for reviewing annual action and financing plans for the Program; and
(iv) satisfactory arrangements to delineate the respective responsibilities of
the cartographic (FTM) and the cadastral (DPLA) agencies have been made before
negotiations; (b) land laws and rexistrationS (i) a draft proposal for
cadastral surveys and land titling in common property areas will be presented
to the Association for review; (ii) legislation providing for mandatory
registration of all new land transfers in are"s with a cadaster, for fee
exemption for registration works where systematic eadastral surveys will take
place, and for the transfer of individual topographic surveys for private
properties to the private sector will be a zondition of disbursement for the
mapping and cadastral components; (c) o2erations: (i) a draft legislation for
environment assessment procedures has 'ten prepared and reviewed; it is
expected to be enacted by decree befor the end of 1990; (ii) a timetable for
the legal creation of all par3s and reserves has been agreed; and (iii)
transition arrangements between MPAEFIDEF, ANGAP and field operators have also
been agreed.
12.     Benefits.  The Program will help Madagascar to put in place the legal
and institutional framework and, over time, to develop the skills and tools
needed to manage its environment heritage. Sites of worle renowned
biodiversity will be conserved. Soil loss will be stemmeO  nd environmentally
sustainable programs of rural development will begin.  ,  Program will
generate fiscal revenues through taxes from land, touri&s  nd development of
private enterprises and create jobs, mostly in the private sector
(agriculture, soil conservation, tourism, transport...).
13.     Risks.  As with most innovations, this Program involves substantial
risks. This is the first coherent effort in Madagascar, or indeed In Africa,
to tackle environmental problems and it inevitably starts with a number if
unknowns - institutional, technical and sociological. Several institutions
have to be established or reinforced, new legislation passed, staff with rare
skills found and the public at large, and farmers in particular, have to be
convinced. However, problems need to be urgently addressed in a way that
minimizes inherent risks. To do so, the Program scope has been reduced from
initial proposals. And the implementation strategy provides for a flexible
institutional framework, balancing responsible initiative with coordination; a
progressive implementation rhythm punctuated by periodic reviews (including a
formal mid-term review in 1993); and a supportive policy environment. Not all
questions can be answered in advance, and some others will undoubtedly be
discovered during implementation. But built-in monitoring and implementation
mechanisms should ensure that problems are rapidly identified and tackled as



-5-
implementation proceeds. Flexibility and constant monitoring vill be
particularly important on the institutional side, to avoid creating
bureatucracies and to ensure that resources are used mainly to support field
activities.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the propossed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreements of the Association and recamend that the
Executivo Directors approve the proposed credit.
