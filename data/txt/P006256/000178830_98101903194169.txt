GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
SUMIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the expansion and modernization
of grain storage by the provision of credit to private investors in Brazil's
center-soutii zone, for which a Bank loan of US$30 million is proposed. Short-
a;ge of storage capacity is a major factor hampering growth of production
and export of grains, important for increased foreign exchange earnings and
substitution of foodgrain imports. The situation was aggravated when recent
bumper crops overtaxed facilities. To keep abreast of expected growth in
grain output and market demand, the need for more and better grain storage
facilities is urgent.
ii.       The project would help smooth out grain flows and thus promote
more efficient use of existing transport services.  The project would benefit
from Brazil's dynamic transport development which has been assisted by the
Bank for tne past two decades.  Handling of grains is at present costly as
grains continue to be stored and moved mainly in sacks, rather than in bulk.
Expanded and modernized grain storage would help reduce hlandling costs, raise
marketing efficiency, lengthen marketing seasons and strengthen the bargaining
power of producers.
iii.      The proposed project is consistent with Brazil"s agricultural and
infrastructure growth targets and would be part of Banco do Brasil's (BB)
ongoing lending program for grain storage development. BB is Brazil's
leading commercial bank, in which Government has a majority shareholding
(55%); it is financially sound, managed by competent personnel and provides
banking services, with priority to smaller borrowers, through a vast system
of branches, of which over 500 are in the project area.
iv.       Over 4 years, the project would help finance the expansion and
improvement of storage capacity by about 1.9 million tons; (equivalent to
about 30%-40% of the estimated deficit in capacity by 1975 in the project
area), from whichl would flow annually about 3 million tons of grain at full
operation. Total project cost, based on costs of storage units recently
financed by BB and information and data received from other Brazilian sources,
is estimated at US$75 million. The foreign exchange component would be
small, about 8%, and was calculated on the assumption that contracts would
be placed locally (para vii). Subborrowers would contribute about 20% to
total cost, and BB from its own resources 40%, while the proposed Bank loan
of US$30 million would make up the balance. This would entail local currency
financing in the amount of US$24 million.
v.        The Bank loan of US$30 million would be made to BB, which would
assume the foreign exclhange risk, for a term of 15 years, including a grace
period of 5 years. Supplemented by an equal amount of US$30 million from
its owIn resources, BB would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan over a
5-year period to about 800 qualified subborrowers at not less than 7-1/2%
interest and for periods of up to 8 years, including 1-2 years' grace. The



- ii -
interest rate would fully cover the cost of subloan funds and BB's adminis-
trative expenses. In view of domestic inflation, outstanding subloan amounts
would be charged, in addition to interest, with monetary correction rates
equivalent to the percentage change in the official Cruzeiro/US dollar rate
occuring in the period between successive Monetary Correction Dates (see
para 4.14),
vi.       Based on a storage investment demand survey conducted by BB, the
largest group of subborrowers would be farmers and farmers' cooperatives,
some of which have more than 1(),000 members, followed by grain processors,
general warehousemen and mixed enterprises, All of them would be experienced
in their trade or profession and many would have had previous banking ex-
perience with BB. They would use project funds for the construction of new
and expansion of existing storage units, principally for corn, wheat and
soybean.
vii.      The project would not be suitable for international competitive
bidding procedures because over 800 subprojects would be widely scattered
over the project area and cannot be combined, since every unit has to be
designed to suit requirements of the individual operator or, in the case of
expansions and improvements, has to match existing facilities. Subproject
costs wqould be low, on average about US$100,000. Although foreign bidders
would be allowed to submit bids, it is expected that foreign firms would not
be interesteu and that local firms would win all contracts.
viii.     Brazilian civil works contractors and manufacturers of grain
storage and processing machinery have shown ability to compete internationally.
Thtey are well establishied in tne project area and are keen to expand services
and production; and some of them have foreign affiliations, which would
ensure tlhe inflow of new technology.
ix.       Subprojects would be appraised by B1 branclhes and reviewed at
1BB's iiead office in accordance witli standing instructions, which would be
approved by the Bank prior to issue, and which would include the sublending
conditionis of tihis project.  BB's thorough examination of loan applications
lhas frequently led to cost savings of grain storage proposals and BB would
continue this practice.  Feasibility studies, bid documents and contract
awards of subprojects having an investment cost of more than US$1 million
(according to BB's survey about 3-4 units) would be subject to review by
the Bank prior to approval by BB.
x.        Financial rates of return, ranging from 14% to 50% according to
type of facility, location and commodity, would ensure demand for subloans.
Casih flow projections show that most investors would be able to repay
BB loans without undue difficulty within 8 years at 7-1/2% annual interest
and monetary correction charge.
xi.       The internal economic rate of return of the project would be
about 26,'. The project would contribute to employment (about 4,500 jobs to
operate project units). The project would be suitable for a Bank loan
of US$30 million, for a term of 15 years, including 5 years' grace.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.)I      rhe Government of Brazil is concerned about a large deficit in
gr1in storage capacity and has requested a Bank loan of US$30 million to
help finance a grain storage project in the private sector. It would be
implemented and supervised by the development-oriented Banco do Brasil (BB)
by extending an ongoing lending program for grain storage construction,
with priority to smaller borrowers. BB has been selected, because it is
involved in various grain programs and has technical and lending experience
in grain storage development. The project is expected to increase storage
for corn, rice, wheat, soybean and dry beans by about 1.9 million tons over
a 4-year investment period, equivalent to about 30%-40% oE the estimated
deficit in capacity by 1975 in the project area. There would be need for
a second-phase operation within the next few years which would require the
involvemnent of other banks in addition to BB.
1.02      The project would help even out grain flows and thus promote a
more efficient use of existing transport services.  The project would benefit
from the ongoing and planned transport development, whicil has been assisted
for the past two decades by the Bank, in particular in the proposed project
area 1/. 13razil's agriculture was previously assisted through a livestock
project (Loan 516-BR, 1967, US$40 million), a second phase of which is under
conisideration. Furtiher, a loan was signed in July 1972 for an agricultural
settleinent project in Brazil's underdeveloped northeast zone (Loan 853-BR,
US$b.7 million).
1.03      The urgent nieed for grain storage investments has been emphasized
in diank econotnic reports since 1964 and the Agricultural Sector Survey
Reportt(1970).  The present grain storage project was prepared by BB
in 1970-71, based on an outline provided by the Bank and tnder the guidancd of
a working group, comprising a member each from the Ministry of Finance and
tlhe Central Bank, and 3 members from BB.  This appraisal report is based on
the worKing group's and BB's preparation report and the fiindings of an
appraisal mission, comprising Messrs. G. von Gontard, J. Cerych, A. Stoneham
and J. Zarandin (Bank); and J.W. Howe (consultant), which visited Brazil in
Aovember 1971.

I t.  BACECROUNI)
A. General Economy and Agricultural Sector
2.01      Brazil, with an area of about 8.5 million kmI2, is the fifth largest
country in the world. Population in mid 1970 was 92.3 wiillion, growing at
about 2.7% per year (1960-70). Population density is low, about 11 per km2,
but there are great regional variations, ranging from 3,000 per km in
metropolitan areas to less than one per km2 in the Amazonas. Potential for
agricultural and industrial growth is large, due to vast natural and human
resources. During 1970, Brazil's economy grew by 9.5% (9.0% in 1969 and
8.6% in 1968), and continued annual growth of 8%-9% is expected in coming
years. If present population growth is maintained, per capita GDP would
increase from the current US$396 to about US$490 in 1975.
2.02      Economic growth in the 1950's and early 1960's was mainly
generated by import-substituting industrialization and a continuing develop-
ment of new land in frontier areas. Large-scale deficit financing during
this period resulted in a rapidly accelerating inflation and a balance of
payments crisis which brought economic growth to a near halt in 1963. Since
then Government has introduced policies to bring inflation down to tolerable
levels. By 1971 the annual inflation rate had been reduced from about 90% to
about 20%. 1/
2.03      In spite of rapid industrial growth, Brazilian agriculture still
dominates in national employment and total exports. 2/  In 1970 agriculture
accounted for 20% of GDP and employed 46% of the labor force, and farm
products made up 80% of total exports (Annex 1, Table 1). Following the
long-term trend, overall agricultural output expanded at 4.4% per year in
1968-70; excluding coffee, the growthl was 6.2%. Except for wheat, past
agriculLural growth has been sufficient to meet internal demand and to
provide increasing export earnings.  Annual wheat imports are estimated to
continue at 1.5-1.8 million tons in coming years (Annex 1, Table 2).
2.04      Government has emphasized grain storage development to go hand
in hand with its agricultural growth targets and infrastructure development.
An adequate and efficient grain storage industry is needed to help remove
frequent grain gluts and shortages, geographically and over time, which have
proven to be major factors inhibiting agricultural development.
1/   Further discussion of Brazil's economy is contained in Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Brazil (IBRD Report WH-210a, November 30, 1971).
2/   A comprehensive description of the agricultural sector is contained in
Agricultural Sector Review - Brazil (IBRD Report PA-52a, August 19, 1970).



B. Grain Production
2.05      Supported by incentive-oriented agricultural policies, mounting
Producer confidence, improved technology, availability of new land and three
successive years (1968-70) of favorable cropping weather, a spectacular
increase in grain output was achieved in recent years (Annex 1, Table 3).
Thie growth (52% between 1964 and 1970) was brought about largely through rapid
expansion of cultivated land but also reflects significant intensification,
mainly in areas witil relatively well developed infrastructure (see Maps 3856,
3855 and 3357).  Average yield increases per hectare are modest in view of
the substantial areas of newly cultivated land with weed problems in initial
years and exteinsion of cultivation to marginal lands. Altlhoughi "miracle"
varieties bred elsewhere could not be easily adapted to Brazilian soil and
climate conditions, considerable progress has been made in local breeding
efforts and extension of highi yielding varieties. A detailed discussion of
grain production is in Annex 2.
2. 06     Looking ahead, grain area expansion is likely to slow down as
it advances into less developed regions, but ennanced productivity is
expected to continue to contribute to future grain production growqth.
Continuation of production-oriented government policies, further extension
of new varieties with higher yield performance and better disease resistance,
and improvement of cultivation practices, combined with less rapid expansion
of cultivated area, could lead to further growth of grain production by
60-80% over tsne next 8-10 years. This would be adequate to provide for grow-
ing domestic demand and increased exports, mainly of corn and soyabean.
C. Grain Marketing and Credit Policies
2.07      Development and growth in grain marketing have been mainly through
private and cooperative initiative.  There are many obstacles to efficient
grain marketing:  grain production zones are spread widely and storage
facilities are often inadequate; it involves transportation over long
distances fromi production to consumption areas; and handling is costly,
as grains are stored and moved to a large extent in sacks, rather than in
bulk. Sucih conditions contribute to the development of complex grain
transactions and flows involving a multitude of intermediary agencies. The
complexity of the grain marketing structure is illustrated in Annex 3.
2.03      Three government programs are important to increased grain
output; (i) the farm production loan program of Banco do Brasil (BB) (paras
5.01-5.04 and Annex 4); (ii) the general agricultural minimum price support
program, whiich includes all grains other than wheat; and (iii) the wheat
support program.
2.09      Short-term farm production loans are made by BB just prior to
planting and are usually repayable at harvest.  Advances are a fixed sum
per hiectare, depending on the crop, and are rarely more than 60% of BB's
estimated value of hectare production in different areas. In real terms,



-4-
production loans made in 1970 (over 300,000 loans) were almost double those
in 1966, and at Cr$ 2.3 billion, were equivalent to about US$500 million
(Annex 4, Table 5).
2.10      The general agricultural minimum price support program, which
includes grains other than wheat, is supervised by the Commission for
Financing Production. It publishes minimum support prices, set near world
market levels, for different production areas in advance of grain cultivation
seasons. Under a special Government fund (Annex 4, para 26), BB is required
either to purchase all grain offered to it by producers at ruling minimum
prices or, if producers elect otherwise, to grant commodity-secured loans
in amounts up to 80% of harvested grain valued at minimum prices.  During the
last few years, BB did not purchase any significant quantities.
2.11      Rice production in Rio Grande do Sul has been part of a pasture-
rice rotation based on privately developed irrigation with a significant part
of the production coming from tenants who periodically contract to crop
pasture land belonging to large livestock producers. Rice producers have
been organized into a quasi-public cooperative system which has administered
the relatively effective price support system. Recent increases in rice
production in Goias and Mato Grosso and weak world markets for rice have
increased storage needs for rice as marketing of surplus stocks has become
increasingly difficult.
2.12      Increases in maize production have been based on a rapid spread of
high yielding hybrid varieties and increasing use of fertilizers in Parana
and Sao Paulo combined with a continuing increase in maize area in newly
opened areas in the interior. Maize producer prices have been based on
FOB export prices less transportation and handling costs. This has led to
severe fluctuations in prices received by farmers and consequent fluctuations
in area planted. The situation has been aggravated by bottlenecks at port
and intermediate collection points. Substantial additional storage capacity
is needed to even the flow to export markets and reduce current high costs
involved in moving grain to ports. Moreover, rising domestic feed needs
will call for an increasing amount of storage for the domestic feed market.
2.13      The wheat support program is administered by CTRIN, an autonomous
department of BB, which purchases the entire marketable domestic wheat crop
from producers at support prices published in advance of seasons. Further,
CTRIN arranges imports of wheat and controls the amounts of wheat that can
be purchased by flour millers. The wheat support program, combined with
production credits from BB, enabled farmers to purchase machinery and plough
vast areas of extensively grazed grassland for expanded wheat cultivation
in association with soybean as a follow-up crop. As a result of increasing
domestic production, wheat imports came down and soybean exports went up
substantially (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2).
2.14      The producer subsidy included in wheat support prices (about US$29
above the average CIF price of US$71 per ton in 1971) is passed on to con-
sumers because an average price is charged to flour millers for domestic and
imported wheat, including CITRIN's administrative cost. The subsidy element
of wheat prices paid to producers has declined by 32.5% from 1966 to 1971;



-5-
and it is Coverniment's policy to bring wheat producer prices further down to
world market levels, hopefully by 1975. The wheat support program, including
production costs, is discussed in detail in Annex 5.
D. Project Area
2.15      The project would be mainly located in Brazil's relatively well
developed center-south zone 1/, where about 86% of the country's grain is
harvested (see Map 3856) and the bulk of domestic and imported grain is
consumed. Wiiile corn, rice and dry beans are important crops throughout
the region, wheat and soybean cultivation is concentrated in the southern
part.  Climate in the area is moderate and rainfall is relatively high,
averaging between 1,200 and 2,000 mm per year with a concentration in
summer (December-April). With the exception of rice cultivation in the
soutliern part of Rio Grande do Sul, irrigation does not play a key role
in grainl production. Soils in the region, and farm sizes and structures
are suitable for grain production; existing tenancy systems do not hamper
farn investment; rural labor supply is adequate; and availability of pro-
duction inputs and farm machinery is improving steadily. Because of
favorable conditions and vast land resources, particularly in the northern
part of tile project area, extended and sustained grain output is possible
entirely througlh improvement and area expansion of rainfed cultivation.
Transportation Network
2.16      Compared with other parts of Brazil, the center-south zone has
a relatively developed transportation system, important to viable grain
storage development (see Maps 3855 and 3857). Expansion and improvement of
highlways in the grain belt have been extremely rapid in recent years and
are being continued under a master plan, partly assisted by the Bank
(para 1.02). The railroad system is being reviewed and improvement in
services is expected from a recenitly initiated railway line integration,
new line construction and addition to rolling stock.  The rural road
system has received little attention until recently.  However, a start has
been made on programs for community roads, particularly in Rio Grande do
Sul, involvin,g approximately 10,000 km of rural roads. Also of recent origin
are attempts to improve coastal shipping.  Ongoing and proposed transpor-
tationi development in the project area is expected to help remove regional
disparities in tihe availability and efficiency of transportation services;
improve flow¢s of bulk commodities, sucli as grains, to major consumption
centers in Brazil and overseas; and reduce grain marketing margins.

Parana, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, and parts of Minas
Gerais, Goias and Mato Grosso.



Researchi and Extension
2.17      Grain researclh at the federal level is managed by the Ministry of
Agriculture through regional institutes of which 5 are located in the
grain belt and whiich together have some 30 experimental stations. All of
them are engaged in grain crop breeding, fertilizer response, pest control
and cultivation studies under rainfed conditions. Plant breeding, partly
assisted by international agencies, has had promising initial results toward
evolving higlher yielding strains of grain crops, resistant to a variety of
diseases. To increase supplies of certified seeds in Brazil's southeast,
a 5-year program costing about US$25 million is being started with 40%
financing by the Inter-American Development Bank.
2.18      Two universities in the project area are engaged in grain storage
and processing research and are providing specialized courses in these
subjects. Programs are being implemented to strengthen federal and state
extension services which operate on a cooperative basis with BB throughout
the region and are financed by public and private funds. Advice for the
construction and operation of farm and small intermediate grain storage and
processing units is made available satisfactorily by the extension system
through qualified technicians and would be available to project participants.
III. GRAI!N STORAGE INDUSTRY
A. Structure
3.01      The problem of grain storage became conspicuous when recent
bumper crops overtaxed facilities - in Rio Grande do Sul large quantities
of wiheat were stored in thie open in 1967-69. Similar events in the past
hlave made grain storage a perennial cause of public concern. Since World
War II, this hias led to thie creation of a number of state-owned warehousing
enterprises anid a federally owned storage company, and initiation of
emergency programs by tihem.  Storage capacity expansion by privately owned
general warehousing enterprises was small during past decades (para 3.08),
but larger by private grain processors, traders and mixed enterprises.
Notable, ihowever, is a rapid expansion in storage capacity since 1966, by
whteat and soybean farmer cooperatives in Rio Grande do Sul. As a whole,
the center-south zone of Brazil has about 11.1 million tons' (1971) of
useful grain storage capacity of which about 55% is owned by private and
cooperative enterprises and the balance by government agencies, the latter
not always suitably located. Income of the grain storage industry comes
from fees and charges for services rendered which reflect economic levels
(Annex 6); but satisfactory profits depend on high occupancy rates of
storage facilities. The technical operation of Brazilian storage units is
satisfactory and comparable to management standards elsewhere. Further
details on storage and handling of grain are in Annex 7.
3.02      Private and cooperative storage units have been more fully
utilized in the past than public facilities. Inadequate appreciation of



-7-
realities of marketing and grain flow mechanisms and needs; of producers and
traders, as well as slow response to changing patterns of grain production
and transportation appear to be the main reasons for unsatisfactory occupancy
rates of many publicly owned grain storage units. This has led to idle
capacity in some zones and financial difficulties for most public storage
enterprises. This experience suggests two aspects of future grain storage
developnment in Brazil: (i) public ownership would be best suited for units
in which services to be performed are relatively well defined, such as transit
units atnd terminals; and (ii) detailed studies at the locarl level would be
essential for any major storage project to determine how miany units of what
type and capacity, offering what services, are needed in which locations.
DetaiLed studies of storage subprojects would be undertaken under the project
(paras 4.03 and 4.04).
B. Sources and Availability of Funds
3.03      Short-term financing of grain storage and processing, in
particular for workinig capital, is almost exclusively by commercial banks.
Provision of sliort-term funds has been adequate and according to growth of
grain harvests. BB has to apportion its available funds among many diverse
lending programs and has decided to leave this type of operation mainly to
othier commercial banks. BB has tiherefore made few short-term loans to
general grain storage and processing businesses. In 1970 these were about
Cr$ 22 million (US$4 million).
3.04       Long-term loans for grain storage and processing development are
made by the liational Development Bank (BNDE) and several state development
and commercial banks. BNDE's minimum investment is around Cr$ 10 million
(about US$2 imiillion), and BNDE has thus been concerned only with very large
projects. State development banks are mainly involved in financing state-
owned storage companies.  W4ith the exception of BB, few commercial banks
have made long-tern loans to private and cooperative grain storage and
processing development. Bl3's loans for this purpose have inore than doubled
in real terms over thie past 5 years; in 1970 they were about Cr$ 22 million
(US$4 million), and have grown since in 1971. Under BB's policy for
apportioning its available funds, it has not been able to allocate a larger
proportion of its resources to long-term financing of graiii industries. The
proposed project would enable BB to allocate more funds to storage develop-
ment. BB is further discussed in Chapter V and Annex 4.
C. Investment Needs
3.05      Net grain storage capacity needs by 1975 in the project area have been
estimated, based on: (i) grain production forecasts by 1975 in the project
area; (ii) length and season of harvest by crops and by states; (iii) estimated
storage needs due to double cropping (wheat-soybean, corn-dry beans); (iv)
grain accumulation at the peak of harvest; (v) grain retairLed by farms; and
(vi) the existing storage capacity (1971). Details on the analysis are in
Amnex 8.  To overcome existing shortage and to protect increased grain
harvests, additional grain storage capacity of about 5-6 million tons,



including about 0.9 million tons farm storage, would be needed in the project
area over the period 1971-75. These estimates indicate a vast scope for the
proposed development under this project and the need for a second-phase or
follow-up project within the next few years.
3.06      To help estimate grain storage investment needs of farmers, private
parties and cooperatives, BB, in 1970, completed an extensive survey in the
project area (Annex 9). More than 800 proposals were received, indicating
2.4 million tons' storage capacity requirement. Further, the survey
indicates: (i) about 43% of total investment would be by farmers and
cooperatives, another 43% by grain processors, and the remainder by warehouse
operators and mixed enterprises; (ii) about 90% of total investment would
be in corn, wiheat and soybean facilities (in equal proportions); and
(iii) investment would be about equally divided between new construction
and expansion of existing units. The survey clearly shows the industry
is keen to expand grain storage operations and estimated demand for subloans
under this project has therefore been based on its data.
D. Legislation
3.07      The General Warehousing Law of 1903 stipulates that warehouses which
offer services to the public must be registered under the Law. It is a
conidition of registration that no other storage or business activities would
be conciucted on premises registered under the Law, except keeping in custody
clients' produce in identifiable lots. In other countries warehousing and
trading operations are usually combined in enterprises, which enables them to
earn a reasonable income during bad crop years when warehousing operations
would not provide sufficient income. Because of the restrictions in Brazil,
some registered warehouses experience low occupancy rates, which in turn makes
their financial viability highly sensitive to declining receipts (Annex 10)
and which explains their limited interest in new investment; only 8% of the
total storage investment demand of 2.4 million tons identified in several
states in a 1970 survey would be for construction, improvement or expansion
of registered warehouses (para 3.01 and Annex 9).
3.08      Government is considering repealing the restrictive clause of the
General Warehousing Law, which would help improve the profitability of private
warehousing operations and would also benefit any small grain producers who
cannot afford to set up farm storage units. To avoid financing of unprofitable
subprojects, the financial vaiability of investment proposals would be closely
reviewed by subloan appraisal (para 5.06).
IV. TruE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
4.01      The project is consistent with Brazil's agriculture and infrastruc-
ture growth targets and would be part of Banco do Brasil's (BB) agricultural
development program. It would substantially increase BB's lending for grain



-9 -
storaIge developinent , ailmed at eipanding urgently needcd storage cap)acity by
about 1.9' million tons. Over 4 years, the project would help set up, equip
anid improve grain storage facilities, including supply and installation of
complementary grain processing machinery and ancillary equipment, at farms,
narkets, transit stations and processing centers. The lending program would
be implemented through BB's extensive branch office system, involving about
830) loans to grain producers, farmers' cooperatives, grain processors, general
warehousemen, traders and exporters mainly in Brazil's center-south zone.
Total project cost is estimated at US$75 million (Cr$ 413 million) and the
Banl contribution would be US$30 million (Cr$ 165 million).
B. Detailed Description
Prokect Scope
4.02     BhO has the capability to implement and supervises the project
(paras 5.01 through 5.04), which would involve subprojects costing from less
than US$1,000 to over US$1 million.  All of them would be subject to detailed
appraisal by BB and, in addition, proposals for large subprojects would be
reviewed by the Bank (paras 4.19 and 5.10). Scope for the proposed project
is vast: estimated additional storage capacity requirement would be about
5-6 million tons, by 1975 (para 3.05), while the project aims to provide about
1.9 million tons capacity over a 4-year development period, representing 30%-
40%' of estimated needs. It is expected that demand for project funds would
be strong, as indicated by the industry's keen interest in expanding operations
(para 3.06).  Project funds would be used mainly in Brazil's major grain
production and consumption zone (para 2.15), which has a high deficit in
storage capacity (para 3.05).
Subborrowers
4.03      The largest number of subborrowers under the project would be indi-
vidual farmers and farmers organized in cooperatives.  This group is expected
to invest about 43% of total project costs (Annex 9), followed by grain pro-
cessors (also about 43% of project cost) and general warehousemen and others
(together about 14%). According to BB's survey (para 3.06), almost all
subborrowers would be experienced in their profession and trade and would be
able to operate their businesses effectively, and many of them would have had
previous banking experience with BB. Under BB's rules, investment proposals
of over Cr$ 100,000 estimated cost have to include feasibility studies prepared
by qualified engineers at subborrowers' cost. Preparation of smaller subproj-
ects would be assisted by qualified BB personnel or by extension service
agents (para 2.18), free of cost to subborrowers.
4.04      The principal aim of the project is to assist grain storage
development in the private sector. Some government-owned storage companies,
however, have tentative plans to promote storage development in less
developed areas by setting up units which eventually would be transferred
to cooperative ownership. Provided such proposals are viable, they could
be included in the project. To ensure satisfactory public subprojects
(para 3.02), assurances have been obtained from BB during negotiations that



- 10 -
investment proposals made for project financing by government-owned storage
companies would be subject to Bank approval.
Type of Facilities
4.05      To promote efficient grain marketing (para 2.07), bulk handling
of grain would be introduced under the project whenever feasible. Project
funds would be used almost entirely for the construction of new and expansion
of existing storage units for corn, wheat and soybean, while development of
facilities for rice and dry beans would be less important (Annex 9). Construc-
tion of project facilities would be in brick, concrete, metal, and wood, or
combinations of such materials and by modern methods, including slipform
construction of grain silos. It is expected that construction and supply
and installation of equipment would be by competent Brazilian contractors
and manufacturers (paras 4.16 and 4.17).
Storage Designs
4.06      Whether new construction, expansion, or improvement, each project
unit would be specifically designed to suit the operational and commercial
requirements of the individual subborrower, including his financial, physical
and managerial resources. To avoid financing of idle capacity, the suitability
of proposed designs and equipment would be closely reviewed during subloan
appraisal (para 5.10).
4.07      Farm storage units (about 300 subprojects, Annex 9, para 2.a) would
be warehouses for bulk and sack storage of harvested grain and farm supplies,
such as seeds and fertilizer. Also suitable for farm use would be storage
binls in under-roof or open construction. Possible farm storage designs are
illustrated in Annex 11, Chart 1. Storage facilities suitable for coopera-
tives (about 130 subprojects), processors (about 250 subprojects), and traders
and exporters (togetlier about 100 subprojects) would be sack or bulk ware-
houses or grain silos (Annex 11, Chart 2), while general warehousemen fless
kiian l20 subprojects) would require conventional warehouses of relative -l
simple design. Braziliani engineers have developed cost-saving bulk storage
designs, wlhich have been satisfactorily tested and which would be used
under tile project (Annex 11, Charts 3 and 4).
Lquipment and Complementary Macihinery
4.08      Basic equipment for proposed storage units would be mechanical
grain handling installations, precleaners, grain driers, and weighing and
pest control equipment to minimize storage losses and ensure efficient
operation. Complementary processing machinery and ancillary equipment would
include supply and installation of: corn, soybean and rice mills; oil expel-
lers; vegetable oil refining machinery; polishers for dry beans; cattle feed
mills and mixers; sorting and packing machines; prime movers and power genera-
tors; anid testing and laboratory equipment. Because of excess wheat milling
capacity (Annex 5), assurances have been obtained from BB during negotiations
that financing of wheat flour mills would not be included under the project.

be located in open country where accumulated dust, consisting mainly of

in densely populated areas would be equipped with dust control devices to
minimize possible irritation.  Other environmental problems are not expected
under the project.
C. Cost Estimates

The estimates are based on October 1971 domestic prices converted at the
tzhei official exchange rate.  Due to unknown internal inflation rates during
the project period, costs are expressed in US$. To all costs has been added
a 10k physical contingency; and a 10% price contingency for possible real
price increases in dollar terms of about 3% per year over the 4-year
investment period.
4.11      Project costs have been estimated with the help of 6 subproject
models, which have been prepared for the major investment Itypes, indicated
by BBt5 demand survey (Annex 12, Table 1).  They are based on prices
and costs of grain storage facilities recently financed by BB, and estimates
and data received from Brazilian consulting firms and professional associations.
The foreign exchange component of the project has been calculated on
the assumption that contracts for civil works, machinery and electrical



- 12 -
works would be placed locally (paras 4.16 and 4.17). Foreign exchange
costs, therefore, refer-to estimated costs of imported items used by
local manufacturers and contractors, such as specialized steel, high
quality coke for foundry work, bearings, or parts thereof, alloys and
other specialized items. The expected phasing of the project cost is
shown in Annex 12, Table 2.
D. Financing

Twenty percent of total project cost would be contributed by subborrowers
and 40% by BB from its own resources, while the proposed Bank loan of
US$30 million (40% of total cost) would be equivalent to 50% of subloans
under the project.
4.13      The Bank loan of US$30 million would be made to BB, which would
assume the foreign exchange risk, and would have a duration of 15 years,
including 5 years' grace.  The proposed Bank loan period takes into account
expected lending terms to subborrowers (up to 8 years), the time required for
disbursement of the Bank loan (about 5 years), plus 2 years for possible set-
backs or delays. Brazil has had a continuous period (1968-71) of exceptionally
good grain seasons (para 2.05) which helped foster the industry's keen interest
in grain storage development (para 3.06). However, unfavorable cropping
weather or a succession of unsatisfactory grain harvests could delay invest-
ment decisions by private investors and temporarily impede the lending program.
The 2 additional years included in the proposed Bank loan period would enable
BB to cover a reasonable degree of unforeseen slippage in repayments. BB would



- 13 -
lend the proceeds of the Bank loan as well as an equal own contribution of
US$30 million to qualified subborrowers at not less than 7-1/2% annual interest
and for periods of up to 8 years, including 1-2 years' grace. The interest
rate of 7-1/2% would adequately cover the cost of subloasn funds under the
project (50-50 mix of Bank and BB funds at 7.25% Bank interest and 0.4% cost
of BB funds) and BB's administration cost. Further details on lending
policies and procedures are in paragraphs 5.05 to 5.12 and financial implica-
tions for BB in paragraph 6.06.
Monetary Correction of Subloans
4.14      Mlonetary correction rates, which would be applied to project sub-
loans and would be payable by subborrowers, would be the proportional change
in the Cr$/US$ exchange rate between successive Monetary Correction Dates. 1/
Correction rates would be applied to outstanding amounts from the dates of
withdrawal of each tranche of the subloans until they were fully repaid.
During grace periods, correction would become payable at the Monetary Correction
Dates on which interest payments also became due; and during repayment periods,
correction would become payable at each date on which repayments became due.2/
BB uses this method to correct industrial loans and has experience in its
accounting. Assurances have been obtained from BB at negotiations that,
should the proposed correction lead to negative real interest rates 3/ during
the period of subloan commitment, the method of correction would be reviewed
in consultation with the Bank.
4.15      Working capital required for effective utilization of project
facilities could amount to US$30 million per year at full development, al-
though the average outstanding would be about US$15 million. It would be
provided partly by subborrowers from their own resources, partly by BB, and
mainly by commercial banks (para 3.03). To ensure sufficient working
capital, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that BB would meet
working capital requirements beyond those obtainable from subborrowers'
own resources and commercial banks.
1/   Under Brazil's flexible exchange system, the foreign exchange rate of the
Cr$ is frequently revised by the Central Bank, based on the change in the
general price index, adjusted for the estimated inflation rate in the USA.
Monetary Correction Dates have been agreed for the purposes of this
project and are defined as being June 30 and December 31.
2/   For example, the depreciation ill the Cr$ exchange raite with the US$ was
about 14% in the calendar year 1971, which would have been applied to
the outstanding amount of a subloan with an annual repayment date
December 31, 1971.
3/   Negative real interest means that for any consecutive period of twelve
months immediately preceding a Monetary Correction Date, the average
annual rate of increase in the general prices for such period as stated
in the general price index published by the Getulio Vargas Foundation of
Brazil exceeds by more than the Bank's interest rate the average annual
rate of increase in the Cr$/US$ exchange rate for the! corresponding
period as computed by the Banco Central do Brasil.



E.  Procturemcnit
4.16      Procurement under the project would be through local channels.
International competitive bidding procedures would not be suitable since
there would be over 800 different owners of project facilities and construc-
tion sites would be widely scattered over Brazil's vast center-south zone.
Moreover, investments in subprojects would be almost all under US$1 million
(on average, about US$100,000) and would therefore not attract international
competition. Bulking of the new facilities would not be possible because
every unit would be designed to meet the individual operator's requirements
(para 4.06). Also, over 50% of project funds (Annex 9) are expected to be
used for expansions and improvements, so that new construction and machinery
must watch existing facilities.
4.17      Brazilian contractors and manufacturers of grain storage and
processing machiinery have showm ability to compete internationally; they are
well established in the project area and keen to expand services and produc-
tion. Government allows bidding by foreign firms but, as discussed in
paragraph 4.16, it is not expected that foreign firms would be interested.
however, several foreign contractors and suppliers have local affiliates, and
thiey are likely to participate in project contracts.
4.18      In detail, procurement would be as follows:
(a) subprojects of over US$500,000 estimated investment
cost (30-40 units; Annex 9, para 2.e), involving about
40% of total project cost and mainly new facilities,
would be subject to nationwide competitive bidding,
which would be executed by investors as a condition
of subloan agreements (para 5.12). For these larger
facilities, separate bids would be invited for civil
works, and mechanical and electrical equipment; and
(b)  contracts for subprojects of under US$500,000 estimated
investment cost, such as farm and small- and medium-sized
facilities, and improvements and expansions, would be
based on cost and price quotations obtained by investors
thiroughi local competitive bidding procedures, or direct
orders, which would be carefullly scrutinized by BB.
BB employs its own engineers and also outside consultants to review technical
and cost details of loan applications, in addition to its review of financial
and economic aspects. Its thorough examination of loan applications has
frequently led to cost savings on grain storage development proposals. To
ensure competitive subproject costs, BB would continue this practice (para
5.10).
4.19      Assurances have been obtainee from BB during negotiations that
(i) procurement procedures would be as outlined in paragraph 4.18; and (ii)
feasibility studies, bid documents and contract awards of all subprojects



- 15 -
having an estimated total investment cost of over US$1 mi:Llion would be subject
to review by the Bank prior to BB approval.
F. Disbursement
4.20      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be made against 50% of subloan
amounts paid out by BB for civil works, machinery and its installation,
elecLrical works, and engineering services. The Bank would not disburse
against expenditures for land and feasibility studies. Disbursement requests
would be supported by certified statements and documents of BB's subloan
disbursements. BB's disbursements to subborrowers would take about 4-1/2
years and disbursement of the Bank loan is expected to take 4-3/4 years,
approximatcly as follows:

V.  ORGANIZATION AND IAINAGEMENT
A. Organization of Banco do Brasil
5.01      BB would be the lending channel of Bank funds and would be fully
comr)etent to supervise the project.  Founded in 1833, BB is Brazil's largest
commercial bank (assets almost Cr$ 39 billion, or US$7.5 billion in 1970).
It performied the functions of a central bank until 1964, and still acts as
financial agent for the Federal Treasury and otiher government agencies, and
controls foreign exchange and external trade, but its main objective is to
promote national production, witl priority to smaller borrowers.  Government
Tholds 55% of BB's share capital (Cr$ 1.08 billion or US$215 million, in 1971)
and the rest is held by individuals. The President of the Republic nominates
BB's president and one director, while shareholders elect 111 directors.
Full details about BB are in Annex 4.
5.02      B13 is organized so that decisions of policy and directive nature
are centralized at the head office, while executive responsibility is de-
centralized, ensuring adequate autonomy to branches and a hligh degree of
operational flexibility. Under the president, who is assisted by a technical



- 16 -
and legal adviser, are 12 divisions at head office, each supervised by a
director. Five divisions deal with administration, personnel, foreign
exchange, external trade, and operations. The major task of the operations
division (DENOP) is to issue instructions for loan operations (para 5.05),
while banking operations are divided into 7 regional divisions, supervising
more tnan 750 branches, of which 530 are in the project area (Annex 4,
'I'able 1). Staff (42,900 in 1970) is generally well trained and competent;
and staff training is an important part of BB's operation. BB's accounts
are fully computerized.
5.03      BB's main source of funds is deposits (short-term, sight and
demand), coming from the public, banks, finance institutions, the Treasury
and the Central BanK. In 1970-71 financial charges were 0.4% of average
assets, while income from all operations was 4.2%, mainly from interest on
production and commercial loans; and the 1968-70 average administration cost
was 2.7% of loans outstanding. Sums written off have been rising, but in
1970 were less thlani 0.4%' of loans and advances outstanding at the year's
end, whiichi is satisfactory. After making adequate provisions, BB has con-
sistently made profits over the last 5 years and has set aside adequate
amounts to reserves.
5.04      Loans mrade by BB for agriculture (about 585,000 in 1970) and
industry almost doubled in real terms in the 5 years ending 1970 and were
in 1970 Cr$ 5.5 billion (US$1 billion). Loans under Cr$ 80,000 (US$14,500),
about 90% of total loans, are approved at branch level and those above, at
regional division level, or by board resolution. Interest rates, loan
correction rates, other charges, loan and grace periods, and security re-
quirements vary according to borrowers and the size and purpose of the loan.
In 1970, the average annual yield (interest and other charges) of loans
was 20% for industry, commerce and individuals; 14.6% for rural loans; and
19.5, for external trade.  Thie weiglhted average for all loans was 17.5%.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
Standing, Instructions
5.(5      Lending policies and procedures are completely standardized
throughout BB by manuals of detailed standing instructions, covering every
type of loan made. They are revised and reissued by BB's operations division
(DENOP) as experience and policy changes dictate.  Loan applications are
appraised in accordance with the relevant standing instructions.  Project
implementation and administration would follow this well established BB
procedure. It would be a condition of effectiveness that the draft stand-
ing, instructions for grain storage development lending received at the time
of appraisal had been updated, in accordance with the specific conditions of
tlhis project, and had received Bank approval.
5.06      While BB's appraisal metihods are satisfactory for its current
lending program, it does not make full use of the appraisal data it collects
in preparing cash flows and financial rates of return. To improve the



- 17 -
evaluation of subloan proposals, assurances have been obtained durin,, negoti-
ations th:at guidelines on tnese methods would be included in the project's
standing instructions.
oijcct Coordination and Administration
5,07       Bl; proposes tihat the project be coordinated and assisted
by a (eneral Coordinating Committee (GCC), which would report to the
president of 13B. This proposal is acceptable. GCC would be chaired by the
ciief olF tile president's office and members would be tlie managers of
regional divisions responsible for the project area and the manager of
DLE04i'.  Responsibilities of GCC would be to:  (i) update and amend the
standing instructions for grain storage development; (ii) coordinate
project activities; (iii) advise on BB staff training needed under the
project and ciheck on its execution; (iv) advise on procurement procedures,
and (v) propose and initiate collection of financial, statistical and
progress data of the project.
5.08       GCC would meet not less than once every month and at any other
time upon request of tile chairman or any two members. The manager of
]JLNOP would be responsible for assembling and maintaining project data and
distributing regular reports to the Committee.  It would be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan that GCC hiad become operative.
5.09       Project administration would follow BB's normal irocedures,
whereby regional division directors would be responsible for general control
of the project in their respective regions; while branchi managers would be
responsible for the day-to-day project supervision and administration at
brancrl level.
SubloanApraisals, Terms and Conditions
5, 1 ('!   Subloan applications would be processed by branclhes in
accordance witih tle standing instructions issued for the project (para
5.05) anid tuien submitted to the respective regional divisions for review
by LJ;NOP prior to approval. As discussed in paragraph 4.18, BB's examina-
tion of loan applications is thorough and efficient.  To matintain present
hiiglh standards of loan appraisals and to keep up current time periods for
loani evaluations (small loans up to 4 weeks and large loans not longer than
3 montihs), BB has agreed to employ additional competent engineers and other
specialized staff in adequate numbers in DENOP, regional di-visions and
branchies as required by the increased workload under the pI-oject.  In
addition, BB is setting up a list of specialized outside consultants who
would be available to assist BB in loan appraisals. Further, regional
coordinators will be appointed within each regional division concerned
with the project.  Assurances to confirm BB's proposal regaLrding employment
of additional staff have been obtained during negotiations.
5.11       Provided collateral is adequate, BB would finance on average 86%
of costs of civil works, machinery, electrical works and engineering serv-
ices.  Subloans would carry an annual interest of not less than 7-1/2% (para
6.06); and a commitment fee of 1% would be charged on unused loan balances. The



- 18 -
proposed interest rate, combined with the monetary correction charge,
would be somewlat higher than BB's existing charges on comparable loans.
Loan periods are expected to be "p to 8 years, including 1-2 years' grace,
based on the financial evaluation of proposals. Loan repayments would be
by semi-annual installments. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations
that:  (i) subloan appraisals, terms and conditions would be as outlined in
this and paragraph 5.10; (ii) monetary correction would be paid by subborrowers
as outlined in paragraph 4.14; and (iii) throughout the project disbursement
period, all grain storage development loans in the project area and approved
by BB, whether under the Bank project or otherwise, would have uniform
terms and conditions.
5.12      Loan agreements between BB and subborrowers contain satisfactory
clauses, including insurance, inspection, management and training covenants,
and this practice would be continued. Assurances have been obtained during
negotiations that procurement covenants would be included in subloan agree-
ments when nationwide competitive bidding is required as outlined in
paragraph 4.18 (a).
C. Accounts and Audit
5.13      BB's accounting methods are satisfactory, but accounts are not
audited by independent auditors. Under Brazil's Banking Law, BB's accounts
are subject to examination by the Central Bank. Assurances have been obtained
during negotiations that (i) separate accounts would be kept at BB's head
office of subloans made under the project, including disbursement documents
of each subloan (ii) the Central Bank would continue to examine BB's accounts
and would audit and certify project accounts, including accounts of branches
involved in the project; and (iii) BB and certified separate project accounts,
and the Central Bank's reports thereon, would be forwarded to the Bank within
4 months of the close of BB's financial year.
D. Project Evaluation
5.14      Under BB's existing procedures, quarterly inspections are made
during the construction phase of subprojects, and at least once per year
during the remainder of the loan term. During these inspections, information
is collected on subborrowers' financial status, operation and management
capability. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that: (i) during
the subborrowers' operation phase, inspectors would also collect data on
effects of investments on subborrowers' income; and (ii) an analysis of
this information, supported by basic data, would be sent annually to the
Bank within 4 months of the end of BB's financial year.
VI. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
6.01      Based on demand for types of storage facilities and services
indicated by BB's survey (Annex 9), the project is expected to provide
about 1.9 million tons of additional storage capacity at full development



- 19 -
in tne project area, of which about 0.2 million tons would be for farm
storage. According to forecasts of marketable grain and the estimated
storage capacity requirement (Annex 8), the additional storage capacity,
provided by the project would permit a throughput of at least 3 million tons
cf grain production, equivalent to about 10% of the estimated total grain
output by 1975 in tihe project area. Further details on grain storage
capiacities, throughput rates, costs, prices and operational and financial
results are discussed in Annex 14.
6.02      To test the financial viability of proposed investments and grain
storage operations, 6 models have been prepared:  2 for farm storage and
4 for non-fara storage (Annex 14, Tables 1-7).  The models were selected
to illustrate the investment demand, as indicated by BB's survey. The
assumed storage and grain processing operations were based on statements
by existing operators, whicn have been adjusted to reflect: the improvement
proposed under the project.
6.03      The financial rates of return for the model facilities are
sumraarized in Annex 14, Table 1, and would be as follows:
Financial
Storage              Rate of
Capacity             Return
Iype of Operation                tons                  %
1.   Farm storage                        500                    29
2.   Farm storage
and rice milling                  500                    51
3.   Sack storage                      3,000                    17
4.   Sack storage                      4,800                    14
5.   Bulk storage                     10,000                    27
6.   Bulk storage                     40,000                    24
6.04      Sensitivity tests indicate that model facilities would generate
adequate returns, even with reduced operations.  The exception is the sack
storage operation (Annex 14, Table 5), where a reduction in throughput by
25% results in an unsatisfactory rate of return (5.5%). Howqever, when grain
trading an(i storinig are combined in the same unit, the rate of return (16%)
would be satisfactory at the reduced throughput rate. This emphasizes the
nee(d for careful appraisal of the financial viability of subloan proposals
(paras 3.08 and 5.06).
6.o)ro    TThe projected financial returns would be satisfactory and explain
thie keen response to BB's survey (para 3.06), and should enisure strong
derand for subloans by project participants. Cash flow projections show
that operators would be able to repay BB loans without undue difficulty
over 6- to 8-year periods at 7-1/2% annual interest and the monetary correction
charge.
6.06      The financial implications for BB "without" and "with" unforeseen
delay in disbursements and repayments (para 4.13) are shownL in Annex
15.  Trhe 7-1/22o interesL yield accruing to BB from subloans; (covering



- 20 -
costs of 50:50 mix of Bank funds at 7.25% and BB funds at 0.4%, plus
DB 's average administration cost of about 4.5% on sums disbursed and 0.7% on
sums outstanding each year) would make it possible for BB to build up
adequate reserves for risk coverage. Cash flow projections indicate
thiat subborrowers' repayments would generate sufficient inflow to repay
Bank funds within 15 years, including 5 years' grace and to cover a reasonable
degree of unforeseen slippage in commitments and repayments which could
occur due to unfavorable crop seasons.
6.07      Construction cost of civil works and equipment purchases amounting
to US$66.5 million would generate value-added tax revenues to the states in
tlhe project area of about Cr$ 16-22 million (US$3-4 million). At full develop-
Iaent, operators of project facilities would contribute about Cr$ 25 million
(US$4.5 million) in income taxes annually to the Federal Government.
VII.  ECONODiIC JUS'l'Ib'CAli'i
7.01      The project's principal contribution to Brazil's development
would be tne expansion of urgently needed grain storage capacity. This
would help reduce existing grain storage losses; strengthen grain marketing
operations, lower marketing costs through introduction of bulk handling;
enthance grain flows from production to consumption centers; reduce seasonal
gluts and shortages; prevent sharp drops in grain prices in years of good
crops by facilitating movement to export markets and thus provide price
stabilization of commodities; and encourage farmers to increase and sustain
grain production. Further, the project would provide a more efficient use
of existing transport services, development of which is being partly assisted
by the Bank (para 1.02). Further details, assumptions and methods used in
tile project's economic evaluation are discussed in Annex 16.
7.02      The customary "with and without" method of analysis, has been
followed in calculating the project's economic rate of return. The quantifiable
benefits would consist of:
(a)  reduction in grain storage losses in the case of farm
storage from 13.5% of total grain handled to 7.5%; in
nonfarm storage from 9.5% to 5.5%;
(b)  savings in grain handling costs as a result of conversion
from sack to bulk handling in 75% of the project units;
and
(c)  avoiding tihe costs of emergency storage, such as makeshift
arrangements and conversion of existing buildings to
temporary storage, whicih would be used without the project.
Based on these benefits, the project's internal economic rate of return would
be at least 26% (Annex 16, Table 1). W4ith variations in benefits and costs,
sensitivity tests indicate rates of return between 18% and 33% (Annex 16,
Table 3). In addition, it may be expected that the proposed project would
induce additional agricultural production because of its stabilizing effect



- 21 -
on farm prices.  However, this latter benefit has not been taken into account
because of the absence of information on supply elasticities and the consequent
difficulty in quantifying the benefit.
7.03      Throughi reduction in storage losses, the project would create
additional exportable surpluses of corn and soybean and substitute for
wheat imports, resulting in incremental export earnings and import savings
of about US$0.6 millioni during the bank loan repayment period and of about
US*5 million per year tihereafter. Further, the project would generate about
4,5()0 jobs for operating project facilities at full development.
7.04      With a high economic rate of return, some contributions to
employment and the balance of payments, the project deserves the high priority
given to it by Government and justifies the proposed Bank support.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During lonn negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  should the proposed monetary correction lead to neaative
real interest rates during the period of subloarL commit-
merit, the method of correction would be reviewed in consul-
tation with the Bank (para 4.14);
(b)  procurement procedures would be as outlined in paragraph
4.18; and feasibility studies, bid documents and contract
awards of subprojects of over US$1 million investment cost
would be subject to review by the Bank prior to BB approval
(para 4.19); and
(c)  subloan appraisals, terms and conditions would be as out-
lined in paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11; monetary correction
wouldl be paid by subborrowers as outlined in paragraph
4.14; and throughout the project period, all grain storage
development loans in the project area and approved by
BB, whether under the Bank project or otherwise, would
have uniform terms and conditions (para 5.11).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a)  an updated draft of the standing instructions for the
project had been approved by the Bank (para 5.05); and
(b)  the General Coordinating Committee within BB had become
operative (para 5.08).
8.04      Witii the indicated assurances, the project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of US$,30 million, for a term of 15 years, including a 5-year
grace period.

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Grain Production Outlook
1.        This Annex discusses some of the more important technical and
economic aspects which affect the outlook for higher yields and expanded
output of the grain crops for which storage would be provided under the
project.
Corn
2.        Corn accounts for about 10% of the gross value of agricultural
production, occupies some 10.2 million ha and is grown in all project
states. Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande
do Sul provide 65% of the total corn area and more than 70% of the pro-
duction. The crop is grown rainfed in upland areas. Production has
increased from an annual level of slightly above 8 million tons in 1964 to
over 10 million tons in 1970. Growth in output has been achieved largely
through expansion of area cropped, but high yielding hybrid varieties and
improved agronomic practices, notably closer spacing ard fertilizer, are
becoming more important particularly in Sao Paulo and Parana.
3.        The demand for corn for feed for the expanding poultry and pig
industries has been strong, and will continue to grow rapidly. The pig
industry, presently extensive and lard-oriented, will shift to more effic-
ient meat-type hogs and intensive production methods. This could lead to
further increased domestic demand for corn. Corn exports were US$ 57 million
in the 1968-1970 period. A major constraint on exports has been inadequate
These inadequacies have led to sharp seasonal and inter-year variations in
the price of corn, and have greatly retarded corn expansion.
Rice
4.        About 70% of the output of 7.4 million tons in 1970 was produced
in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Goias, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul. The rice
area expanded from 2 million ha in 1950 to 5 million ha in 1970. Rio Grande
do Sul uses irrigated lowland soils for rice; elsewhere, production is mainly
rainfed. In Rio Grande do Sul, average yield increased from 2 tons to about
2.8 tons between 1950 and 1970, but in other areas remained at between 1.2
and 1.5 tons per ha. Upland varieties responsive to fertilizers are lacking,
and rice is often planted as the first crop on newly cleared land, without
fertilizer and with poor husbandry practices.
5.        There are good prospects for considerable increases in rice pro-
duction in the next 10 years. Area can still increase and yields can be
increased by greater intensity of cropping in established areas, by heavier
use of fertilizer and other inputs, and perhaps by opening up highly



ANNEX 2
Page 2
productive areas under low cost irrigation. These developments could result
in an Increase in average yields from the present 1.5 tons of rough rice per
ha to 1.8 tons per ha in 1975.
Wheat
6.        In 1970 the 3 southern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and
Santa Catarina produced 83%, 13% and 4%, respectively, of the national
wheat crop. Wheat output in 1970 topped 1.7 million tons for the first
time, but the gap between domestic production and consumption is still
around 1.5-2.0 million tons per annum. This is met by imports, principally
from the U.S.A., Canada and Argentina. In 1970 wheat imports cost US$ 187
million CIF, the most costly single item on the import list. To help reduce
this drain, Government is trying to expand wheat production.
7.        Wheat Is a wlnter crop planted in May-June and harvested in October-
January with soybean in association. Soybean is planted in December, after
wheat, and harvested in April prior to wheat planting. Farms on which wheat
is grown for the market range from 50 to 800 ha. About 75% of the wheat
crop is cultivated and harvested mechanically. One of the attractions of
the wheat-soybean association is that the same machinery can be used for
both crops.
8.        Wheat hectarage has increased from an estimated 767,000 ha in 1965
to over 1.7 million ha in 1970, with yield increasing from 760 kg to 1,200 kg
per ha. Most wheat is planted on soils of high acidity which require
correction by liming and manuring to obtain reasonable yields. This acidity
problem complicates the introduction from other countries of improved
varieties with a higher yield potential. Other problems are stem rust and
mildew diseases which develop rapidly in humid spring weather and can cause
crop failure. The crop harvested in 1970 was a record one partly because
of increased plantings and improved agronomic practices, but also because
the weather reduced the Impact of endemic pests and diseases.
9.        Brazlifan and foreign plant breeders have been working energetically
with a wide range of imported genetic material. It appears unlikely that
the near miraculous results in Pakistan and India with short-strawed Mexican
wheats will be repeated in Brazil, but new varieties with a degree of disease
resistance and increased yield potential have been recently introduced. New
varieties contributed to the recent spectacular increase in wheat output in
Rio Grande do Sul.
Soybean
10.       Soybean production increased from about 107,000 tons in 1955 to
a record of about 1.5 million tons in 1970. The 1970 crop was harvested
from 1.2 million ha, mainly in Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.
Since 1966 a large expansion in area under soybean has taken place, largely
because of increased double cropping with wheat, and because of diversifica-
tion out of coffee in Parana and Sao Paulo. Yields have declined in recent
years to an average of about 1.2 tons per ha, mainly because of lack of
experience with the crop in new areas. About 315,000 tons of soybean and



ANNEX 2
Page 3
300,000 tons of soybean products were exported in 1970 and about 800,000
tons were crushed to meet domestic demand for oil.
11.       Soybeans are planted in December and harvested in April and May.
Nutrient needs are known and high yielding varieties are readily available
from Government, private and cooperative agencies. Most production is
mechanized, and the same machinery is used for wheat. It is reasonable to
expect an average yield of 1.5 tons per ha by 1975 in established areas,
and 1.25 tons per ha elsewhere.
12.       Further expansion of the soybean area in association with wheat
is probable in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana. The two crops
are complementary, and research recommendations for varieties, manuring,
and time of planting take account of this double cropping aspect. The
wheat-soybean rotation has much to commend it on technical and economic
grounds. Alternating a gramineous crop with a legume is agronomically
desirable, and resources such as land, labor and machinery are more fully
utilized. In Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso, Goias and Minas Gerais, soybeans can be
incorporated in corn and cotton sequences. The climate in these areas
appears suitable for soybean. If field trials bear this out, planning to
promote a large-scale expansion of plantings should begin. The amount of
this expansion will depend on comparative returns from alternative crops such
as corn, cotton, and particularly groundnuts. But a reasonable target for
1975 is at least 1.8 million ha by 1975. The private sector, including
cooperatives, will play an important role in soybean expansion, as it has in
the past.
Dry Beans
13.       In 1970, with over 3.5 million ha in beans (mainly Phaseolus Spp.)
and a crop of 2.4 million tons, all for the domestic market, Brazil was the
world's largest producer and consumer of beans. Production increased about
4% annually over the period 1950-70, mainly owing to expanded plantings.
Beans are cultivated in association with other crops, especially corn, and
generally are poorly tended. Yields are around 700 kg per ha. Studies of
crop associations and the establishment of economically optimal levels of
manuring for the associated crops are needed.

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Banco do Brasil
Organization and Management
1.        The Banco do Brasil (BB) was first founded in 1808, in the colonial
era, but went into liquidation in 1829. It was reformed in 1833, amalgamated
with another bank in 1853, and after varying fortunes it suspended business
in 1900 due to Government deflationary policies. After 6 years of very
limited operations, it was reactivated in 1906 and has had a continuous
existence ever since.
2.        Until 1964, BB acted as a commercial bank but also carried out
most of the functions of a central bank, including currency issue.  The
Banking Reform Law of 1964 created the Central Bank of Brazil, but BB retained
a number of central banking responsibilities, including overall control of
foreign exchange and external trade, and operation of the country's check
clearing bureau. BB currently provides normal commercial banking services
through its more than 750 branches. Additionally, it acts as financial
agent for the Federal Treasury and operates Government's wheat support
program and minimum price program for rural products.
3.        BB is a public limited liability company, although Government has
a majority shareholding. Its present statutes were approved at a share-
lolders meeting in 1942, and have since been occasionally amended, mostly
to provide increases in share capital. The latest was in November 1971,
when the capital was brought up to Cr$ 1.08 billion.
4.        BB's main objectives are to promote and advance! national production,
and to stimulate commercial interchange with other countries. To achieve
this, it is authorized to undertake all banking operations, including:
receiving money on deposit; making advances against loans; developing
specialized credit in agriculture, livestock and industry; dealing in foreign
exchange; financing import and export transactions; and financing public
works.
5.        BB is governed by a 12-member board of directors.  Its president
is nominated by the President of the Republic, and is also a member of the
National Monetary Council, which is responsible for monetary policy. The
President of the Republic also nominates a further director, who heads BB's
external trade division. The shareholders elect 10 directors, one of whom
heads the administration division, and must be chosen from among BB's employees,
active or retired.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
6.        The statutes lay down the administrative organization and
the duties and responsibilities of the president and directors. They are
similar to those found in most limited companies. The statutes also make
provisions for the allocation of profits. Ten percent must go to general
reserves, dividends to shareholders are limited to 20% of nominal share
value, and the balance must go to various special reserves.
7.        In its organizational approach, BB centralizes all decisions of a
directive nature and decentralizes those of an executive nature. The
current administrative organization is shown in the attached organigram
(Table 1). Administrative channels were revised in 1970 to give greater
autonomy to branches. This has proved to be very successful. The president,
who is assisted by a technical and legal advisor, has under him 12 divisions,
each headed by a director. There are five separate divisions dealing with
administration, personnel, foreign exchange, external trade and operations,
and seven divisions dealing with regional banking operations. The advisors
and directors of all divisions and their staffs are located at head office.
The director of the operations division is responsible for the maintenance
of standard operating conditions through BB's branches, and for operational
efficiency.
8.        The regional divisions and the number of branches operating within
them at the end of 1970, are as follows:
Region 1: the states of Acre, Amazonas, Para, Maranhao, Piaui,
Mato Grosso, and the Territories of Ampa, Roraima
and Rondonia (67 branches);
Rgpion 2: the states of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,
Pernambuco, Algoas, Sergipe, Bahia and the Territory
of Fernando Norohna (128 branches);
Region 3: the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and
Guanabara (59 branches). This region is also responsible
for the inspection of the eleven foreign branches and
offices;
Region 4: the states of Minas Gerais, Goias and the Federal
District (142 branches);
Region 5: the state of Sao Paulo (141 branches);
Region 6: the states of Parana and Santa Catarina (78 branches);
and
Region 7: the state of Rio Grande do Sul (84 branches). This
region is also responsible for operating the national
wheat support program under an autonomous department
(CTRIN), which is further discussed in Annex 4.
Branch managers report direct to the relevant regional director at head office.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        In addition to the 706 branches above, there were 45 subbranches
(13 in Sao Paulo State) managed through branches, and about 40 new autonomous
branches planned for opening in 1971.  BB also operates 9 service posts,
mainly in Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia, providing limited services to some
Government offices and institutions. Foreign branches and offices are at
Asuncion, Buenos Aires, Hamburg, La Paz, London, Mexico City, Montevideo,
New York, Santa Cruz, Santiago and Tokyo.
Staff and Training
10.       Details of staff by occupation are in Table 2.  At the end of 1970,
total staff was 42,900, an increase of 6% only since 1966. Most of this
increase was among the accountants to staff new branches, other grades having
remained fairly constant. BB classifies administrative staff at head office
as directors, division managers and their deputies. At branches, such staff
includes managers, deputy and submanagers, and assistant submanagers. On
this basis, at the end of 1970 administrative staff was 7,200, or about 16%
of the total, and almost one-tenth of these were at head office.
11.       Subordinate staff have access to seven regular training courses,
including administration, mechanized accounting, computer programming and
human relations. Over 30% of the staff have attended one or more of these
courses. Since 1965, over 1,000 potential and existing employees have been
given home and overseas scholarships for higher education, mainly in adminis-
tration, economics and banking. Regular seminars are held for branch
managers. BB is fully aware of the necessity of keeping its staff well
trained in up-to-date methods, and frequently arranges special courses when
the need for them arises.
Finance and Operations
12.       Condensed balance sheets from 1966 through 1970 are in Table 3, all
figures being calculated in Cruzieros of 1970. At the end of 1966, issued
share capital was Cr$ 24 million (actual). In November 1971, the issued share
capital was increased from Cr$ 720 million to Cr$ 1,080 million by incorpora-
ting Cr$ 180 million from reserves and issuing a further Cr$ 180 million at
par to existing shareholders, pro rata their holdings. Government owns about
55% of shares, the rest belongs mainly to individuals. Capital and reserves
have been increasing steadily, from 2.3% of total liabilities at the end of
1966 to 4.5% at 1970.
13.       BB's main source of funds is deposits: short-term, sight and demand.
Short-term deposits from the Treasury vary throughout the year, but in general
cover BB's loans and advances to the Treasury. Demand andi special deposits
cover mainly external trade and foreign exchange operations.  Over half (55%
at the end of 1970) comes from the Central Bank, the balance from commercial
sources. In common with other commercial banks, BB makes use of a number of
special funds (many with international finance). Some are operated through
the Central Bank! including the fund for stimulating fertilizer use
(FUNFERTIL), the general fund for agriculture and industry (FUNAGRI), and
the Bank's livestock project (CONDEPE). BB is also financial agent for a

number of funds, including: working capital for industry (FUNDECE); import-
ation of U.S. goods (FIBEP); German development (FAD); and the IDB-financed
fund for agriculture, husbandry and fishing products industrialization
improvement (FUNDIPRA), which is now almost fully disbursed.
14.       Most of BB's funds are used for loans and other advances and
credits. The loan to the Treasury (Cr$ 3.4 billion at the end of 1970)
covers various operations prior to the Banking Reform Law of 1964.  Other
Treasury advances (Cr$ 3.8 billion at the end of 1970) include other obliga-
tions on behalf of Government, and readjustment of a livestock loan. Over-
seas advances are mainly to cover external trade and foreign exchange
transactions. Fixed assets were Cr$ 441 million at the end of 1970 and
consist mainly of buidlings, equipment and stores. Against these were
depreciation provisions of Cr$ 350 million, giving a depreciated value of
Cr$ 91 million to these assets.
Operating Results
15.       Table 4 shows BB's operating results for 1966 through 1970.  BB has
consistently made useful profits, and after making adequate provisions,
has been able to set aside to reserves an average of about 12% of earnings
over the period. Most income comes from production and commercial loans,
while a little over half of total expenditures is for administration, of
which salaries and allowances are by far the biggest item.
16.       Sums written off each year are satisfactorily small, but have
been increasing, as follows:
1966    1967    1968      1969      1970

Financial Control
17.       The administrative division is responsible for keeping the accounts,
which are fully computerized, and standardized throughout BB. Financial
control of foreign exchange, external trade and other operations rests with
the three divisions responsible for them.  The inspector-general heads the
internal inspection department, and has a staff of about 150, most of whom
have reached branch manager level. Administratively, he comes under the
personnel director, but is responsible for independent checks throughout
BB on all operational aspects, including finance and administration. BB's
annual accounts, which are usually signed by the president, administrative
director and chief accountant, are not examined by independent auditors.
Under the Banking Law, they are subject to examination by the inspectorate

Page 5
division of the Central Bank, as are the accounts of all other commercial
banks. Such examinations are regularly made.
A ricultural and Industrial Loans
18.       Table 5 summarizes loans made from 1966 through 1970 for agricultural
and industrial purposes. In real terms, loans made in 1970 were almost
double those in 1966, and at Cr$ 5.5 billion, were equivalent to about
US$ 1 billion. Loans for agriculture (excluding livestock) remained at
about two-thirds of the annual total over the period, but the proportion
for short-term (under 1 year) increased from two-thirds in 1966 to about
four-fifths in 1970. The number of agricultural loans made (excluding
livestock) increased by 23% to 463,300 over the same period. By value, the
increase was about 90% in real terms. BB does not finance the marketing of
agricultural produce to any great extent, this being mostly in the hands
of the commercial banks. In 1970, only 12% of its agricultural loans were
for marketing, and these included loans to farmers for crops in storage.
19.       Loans for livestock remained at about 15% of the total over the
period 1966 through 1970. In 1970, just over one-quarter was short-term.
The average size of livestock loans in real terms was about Cr$ 6,500
(1970 prices) over the period, with very little annual change. Industrial
loans more than doubled over the period, and were Cr$ 1.5 billion in 1970,
about one-fifth of total loans during that year. Of this sum, 80% was
short-term.
20.       BB's combined loans for storage, grain mills and feed, soya, oil
and other flour mills have been as follows:
1966   1967   1968   1969   1970
(in millions of 1970 Cr$)
Short-term (for working capital)
Storage                                 -       -      2      10     15

Feed, soya, oil and
other flour mills                    14     12      12      19     18

Short-term as % of total               83      75     71      77     71
Lending for these purposes has increased by one-half over the 5-year period.
While these figures are small compared with BB's overall agricultural
lending program -- only 1.4% in 1970 -- they nevertheless represent in



ANNEX 4
Page 6
monetary terms a valuable contribution to this sector. Unfortunately, no
similar figures are avilable for all the commercial banks and development
finance companies, so that it is not possible to estimate BB's share of the
total.
21.       In the 7-month period September 1970 to March 1971, BB made longer-
term loans for construction of storage as follows:
Total      Average
Number      Value       per Loan    % by Value
--(Cr$ millions)--------
Sao Paulo                    2          0.63        0.34          2.50
Parana                       1          0.13         0.13         0.50
Santa Catarina               5          2.07        0.42          8.10
Rio Grande do Sul           27         22.88        0.84         88.90
Total             35        25.71         0.73        100.00
Of these loans, 17 were to cooperatives.  There were considerable variations
in loan sizes; the largest was Cr$ 8 million, the smallest Cr$ 7,000.  These
loans average around three-fourths of the total cost of construction.
Lending Policies and Procedures
22.       Lending policies and procedures are completely standardized through-
out BB's branches, by means of a series of detailed standing instructions
covering every type of loan made. These instructions are revised and reissued
as experience and policy changes dictate, and have proved to be a very
efficient method of standardization. The operations division is responsible
for rural and general credit regulations.
23.       Loan applications are received at branch offices, and are processed
in accordance with the relevant standing instruction. Branch managers are
under orders to give priority to applications by smaller borrowers. They
are authorized to approve loans up to limits which vary according to the
classification of the branch (from Cr$60,000 to Cr$ 120,000) and which
average about Cr$ 80,000, provided each application meets the criteria in
the standing instruction. In practice, more than 90% of BB's loan appli-
cations are approved in the branches.
24.       Applications for larger loans are processed by the branch as far
as possible and then referred to the appropriate regional manager at head
office. If financial, economic or technical advice is required, the
regional manager refers to the operations division, which maintains special-
ists in various fields on its staff. He also frequently refers back to the
branch for additional information. The regional manager is authorized to
approve loans up to Cr$ 400,000. Loans between this and Cr$ 1 million are
approved by the Regional Director. Loans between Cr$ 1 million and Cr$ 1.5
million are approved by the president, and any above this by the board.
Most larger loans (above about Cr$ 80,000) are processed and approved (or
rejected) within two months of receipt of the original application; smaller
loans rarely take more than two weeks.

Lending Terms
25.       BB requires security for all loans.  For short-term agricultural
loans, this can be a lien on the crops to be financed. For longer-term
agricultural and agro-industries loans (as with most others), the minimum
security is about one and a quarter times the size of the loan, and usually
includes a mortgage on land and property or other acceptalble collateral.
BB's staff includes qualified valuers, who assess the securities offered on
alL larger loans.
26.       Short-term commercial and industrial loans are repayable on a
specified date, and are usually for periods of less than one year. Most
short-term agricultural loans are made just prior to planting and are
usually repayable at harvest. For crop production, advances are a fixed
sum per hectare, depending on the crop, and rarely more tlhan 60% of BB's
estimated average value of production in the area. BB also makes advances
to farmers against harvested crops, with funds provided by the Commission
for Financing Production. Advances are 80% of the net minimum price of the
cros when it is held in a public warehouse, and 70% when lheld in the farmer's
own custody.
27.       Longer-term loans for agriculture and industry can be given up to
the full cost of development, provided the security is adiequate, but
average around four-fifths. Such loans rarely exceed five years, except for
a few of the larger ones to industry which can go up to 10 years. The
average is around 4 years. A grace period is given whenever financial
projections show this to be necessary, but except for larlger industrial
loans, is usually not more than one year. BB's thorough examination of loan
applications by its technical staff under its detailed appraisal procedures
has frequently led to savings in the estimated cost of individual development
proposals.
Interest Rates
28.       Interest rates and charges vary according to the borrower, the size
and purpose of the loan. The weighted average of annual borrower's charges
on BB loans in 1970 (based on distribution of loans outstanding at the end of
1970) was as follows:
Average
Loan               Interest
Distribution            Yield
__         __------(%) ----- ----
(1)  Loans for Industry, Commerce
and to Individuals                       54.1                 20.0
(2)  Rural Loans                                38.1                 14.6
(3)  Loans for External Trade                    4.4                 19.5
(4)  Loans of Foreign Exchange Division          3.4                  8.7
Total                          100.0                 17.5



ANNEX 4
Page 8
29.       Annual interest rates on short- and longer-term agricultural
loans are 10% if the loan is under 50 times the minimum monthly salary
(about Cr$ 11,000 at present), or 17% if above. Loans to cooperatives
are 2% below these rates. There are some lower rates under some special
programs. For industrial and commercial loans the annual rate depends
on the source of BB's funds. For loans financed from its own resources,
the annual rate is 12% if the loans are below Cr$ 11,000, and 20% if above,
although loans for industrial working capital are at 19.6%. For loans
using overseas funds, the rate is 22% if the loan is up to US$ 100,000
and between 10% and 12.5% with monetary correction if the loan is above
US$ 100,000.
30.       On deposits, BB's main source of funds, various interest rates
are paid but these are relatively low. Nothing is paid on some short-term
and sight deposits. Overall, over the last 2 years, financial charges were
0.4%, while income from operations was 4.2%, of average assets.
BB's Position in the Banking Sector
31.       At the end of 1960 there were 332 different banks in the country,
with a total of 5,600 branches and offices; 43 were foreign-owned. They
included development and specialist (e.g. housing and investment) as well as
commercial banks. By the end of 1970 the number had been reduced by about
half, to 172, while total branches and offices had increased by over one-
third to 7,700. Of these, 2,700 were in Sao Paulo State, and about 1 in 10
belonged to BB. The number of foreign-owned banks had hardly changed, at 42.
32.       In terms of capital and reserves, at the end of 1970 BB was second
only to the National Development Bank (BNDE), and was followed by the
National Housing Bank (BNH), the State Bank of Sao Paulo and the Bank of
the Northeast of Brazil, all Government-owned. Of the top 10 banks, only
2 were privately owned, and their combined capital and reserves were only
about one-fifth of BB's. In terms of size of deposits BB was, on the same
date, by far and away the largest bank; its deposits exceeded the total of
the next 9 Government banks, and were almost 10 times that of the foremost
private commercial bank.
33.       In terms of loans to the private sector outstanding at the end
of 1970, 21% came from BB, 43% from all other commercial banks, 16% from
investment banks and finance companies, and the balance from BNDE, BNH and
others. Short-term loans to the private sector were about 73% of the total,
whereas BB's was about 80% of its own total. From the foregoing, BB is by
far and away the most important bank in the commercial banking sector.

The Wheat Program
1.       ;Brvil 's wheat support program was adopted in 1965 for two major
purposes:  (a) to raise domestic wheat production for impcort substitution;
and (b) to stimulate development of the then stagnant economy of southern
Brazil, in pairticular rio Grande (in Sul, which was based on low density
livestoc-k farming.  The program consists of a minimum price scheme and a
system, of wheat quotas to flour millers. It does not aim at self-sufficiencv
in wlieat, because Brazil has commitments to import Argentine wheat in
excha11Cme for industrial exports. and would always need to import hard wheat,
whichl cannot be grown domestically for climatic reasons.
2.        Farmers' response to the program was enthusiastic:  vast areas of
extensively grazed pastureland were rapidly turned over to wheat cultivation.
This made possible increased soybean cultivation as a follow-up crop to
wiheat. In fact, the program has to be viewed as a wheat-soybean program.
Although wheat prices over the past 7 years have included substantial sub-
sidies (Table 1), soybean prices have not. Soybean is increasingly becoming
an important agricultural export for Brazil, reaching over 300,000 tons
in 1970, compared to nothing in 1964.  In addition, exports of soybean
products, such as soycake and soymeal, rose to equally high levels.
3.        The program is administered by CTRIN, an autonomous department in
Banco do Brasil, which purchases all domestic wheat and regulates imports and
suipplies to flour millers. SUNAB, the National SuPPlY SuPerintendencV,
estimates annual wheat requirements, based on consumption projections, and
allocates milling quotas to flour millers, expressed as a percentage of their
installed milling capacities. CTRIN arranges for the importation of the
difference between SUNAB's estimate of total requirement and its projection
of domestic production for the year; and makes supplies available to millers
on the basis of SUNAB's quotas.  Total wheat requirement for all of Brazil
in 1971-72 is estimated at 3.2 million tons (including about 1.5 million tons
imports), with flour millers' quotas averaging 17.3% of their installed
milling capacity. For the project area, total wheat allocation would be
about 2.5 million tons, with a quota average of 16.4% of total installed
milling capacity. Details of quotas and milling capacities are in Table 2.
4.        The price paid by millers (Table 1) is the weighted average of
CTRTN's procurement cost for domestic and imported wheat and includes CTRIN's
administrative costs. The support price paid to producers in a year is
based on an estimated production cost for that year, plus an estimated
farmers' profit of 31.3%. The mark-up has two parts: 30%7 is estimated
profit and 1.3% a contribution to an agricultural social fund.



ANNEX 5

5.        In real terms (expressed in 1971 Cruzeiros), Government has been
gradually lowering wheat support prices from Cr$ 810.37 in 1965 to Cr$ 546.67
in 1971, an overall decrease of 32.5% over that 6-year period (Table 1).
The average annual rate of decline over this period was about 6%. These
reductions were made possible by improvements in farm productivity, through
lower production costs and higher yields per hectare. Between 1965 and 1970,
estimated average production cost per hectare (in real terms) declined by
16%, or an average annual rate of 3.3%, while average wheat yields in Rio
Grande do Sul, where the bulk of wheat is grown, rose about 7.9% per year
from 1958-70. Production cost reductions and yield increases, taken together,
indicate a cost reduction per ton of wheat of about 10.4% per year. Since
this rate is much higher than the 6% average reduction in support farmgate
prices, it can be assumed that in spite of a gradual reduction in support
prices, wheat farmers' income must have improved.
6.        Further, a comparison (in real terms) of estimated production
costs and support farmgate prices in Rio Grande do Sul indicates that
farmers' profits must have fallen short of the 31.3% estimated for the
program (Table 3). In 1965 and 1967 the estimated production cost was even
higher than what was paid to farmers, mainly due to optimistic wheat yield
and production cost estimates and organizational deficiencies in initial
years of the program. Nevertheless, farmers have rapidly expanded wheat
production, indicating that they are willing to accept less than the 31.3%,
profit aimed at by the program. Moreover, forecasts in Table 3, based on
past yield and production cost trends and the 31.3% profit formula, indicate
that by 1974 the differential between the expected CIF wheat price and the
estimated production cost might reach a maximum of 24.6%. Provided present
policies would be continued, Rio Grande do Sul wheat could become competitive
by 1974 with imported wheat; and the maximum competitive margin could
include a farmers' profit greater by 8.5% than the highest (16.1% in 1966)
attained so far. With steadily improving cultivation practices and expectedl
introduction of higher yielding wheat varieties, competitiveness in wheat
should be achieved soon, not only in Rio Grande do Sul but also in Santa
Catarina and Parana, two other states with promising wheat potential.

in current U.S. dollars at US$ 63 per ton, adjusted to reflect
the assumed rate of U.S. dollar inflation for 1971 to 1975 included in
the forecast. Estimates for 1972-7h are interpolations of 1967-69 data
and the 1975 forecast, adjusted for U.S. dollar inflation.
2/  Based on projections along logarithmic trend lines for production cost
per hectare and yield per hectare.
3/  Includes a mark-up of 31.3% over estimated production cost as proposed
by the support program.
4/ These would be the highest allowable mark-ups over production cost to
make farmgate prices competitive with CIF prices. Since the ratio is
not meaningful when (B) exceeds (A), it is omitted for 1965 to 1971.
5/  These are the subsidy components of projected farmgate  prices, as
percentages of CIF prices, under the existing 31.3% markup formula.
The negative figure (-2.1%) in 1975 indicates that farm-gate prices
under the existing formula would be only 97.9% of CIF prices for that
year.

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Storage and Handling of Grain
Existing Facilities
1.        Brazilian storage and grain handling facilities are warehouses,
bulk storage facilities, silos and temporary facilities, such as converted
buildings and inflated vinyl warehouses held up by compressed air. During
peaks of harvest seasons, grain was also stored in recent years in the open,
on surfaced roads or temporary wooden floors, and covered rith plastic
sheets.
2.        Warehouses are usually one story sheds in which jute sacks of 60 kg
(net weight) are piled up to 30 sacks high. Traditional warehouses have a
minimum of equipment, and unloading, storing and dischargirng are done mainly
by labor. Modern warehouses are built of noncombustible maLterials and have
concrete floors, brick walls, and metal or concrete roofs. The larger units
are sometimes equipped with precleaners, driers, bagging machines and sack
conveyors. Pest control is done by covering sack piles with plastic sheets
and injecting underneath fumigating chemicals. In some instances, sack
warehouses are used to store grain in bulk, which, however, is not piled
against walls, as they are seldom capable of resisting grain pressure.
3.        Warehouses are used when grain has to be handled in sacks.  Dry
beans, due to a multitude of different varieties and grades, and processed
grain, such as seeds, milled rice and soymeal are not suitable for bulk
handling.  The majority of the small and medium sized (up to 5,000 tons
capacity) warehouses is located in production areas, rather than in consump-
tion zones. Warehouses in consumption centers are usually larger units
which service small processors and retailers, and therefore, achieve high
throughput rates.
4.        Warehouses are owned or operated by producers, public storage
companies, cooperatives, traders, processors and general warehousing enter-
prises. The latter are registered under the General Warehousing Law of 1903
(Annex 10) and are subject to inspection by federal and state authorities.
5.        Farmers are increasingly constructing new warehouses in grain
areas where cultivation 4pd harvesting are mechanized, for the following
reasons: (i) to achieve a higher utilization rate of expensive harvesting
machinery: (ii) to lower harvesting losses; and (iii) to take advantage of
higher prices paid for clean and dry grain. The most important equipment
of a modern farm wfarehouse is the hot air grain drier.  Demnand for farm
driers is strong; and a manufacturer in a grain district of Rio Grande do
Sul had in late 1971 about 60 pieces on order, with downpayments made.
Warehouses are also essential additions to bulk storage ancd processing



ANNEX 7
Page 2
facilities and used to diversify services, fully meet clients' demand and
achieve efficient operation of processing machinery.
6.        Temporary storage is used when bumper crops overtax existing
facilities.  All kinds of buildings, such as schools, churches and obsolete
sheds, are converted temporarily to storage of grain in sacks. As such
arrangements cannot cope with incoming harvests, grain is also stored in
the open and covered with plastic sheets.  Finally, inflatable vinyl units,
of about 4,000 tons capacity each, were imported and set up in production
areas as a temporary measure.  Protection of grain under these circumstances
is most inadequate and losses are high from rodents and other pests.
7.        Bulk handling has been increasingly introduced in recent years,
in particular for corn, wheat and soybean. In some instances, bulk flow
of wheat has been achieved from farms in Rio Grande do Sul to flour mills
in Sao Paulo. Introduction of bulk handling was assisted by the rapid
transport development in recent years in Brazil's center-south zone. Bulk
storage facilities in use include conventional silos and bulk units specifi-
cally adapted to Brazilian conditions.
8.        Grain silos are primarily used by public storage companies, large
cooperatives and processors, and are located at primary markets, transit
stations, port terminals, and in consumption centers. Most of them were
built after World War II, partly with foreign assistance, in concrete or
steel. In newer silos use of steel has been abandoned, taking advantage of
economies of concrete slip form construction. Several well known types of
slip forms are available to contractors and technical advice on their use
is available from suppliers.
9.        Most of the concrete silos are well constructed and perform
satisfactorily. Some units, however, were wrongly located and designed,
having excessive space and unnecessary supporting structures, and poorly
organized receiving and discharging facilities. Also, some silos lack
fumugating and aeration equipment. However, Brazilian engineers and
operators have learned from experience, and previous errors have been omitted
in new facilities.
10.       Bulk Warehouses.  Brazilian engineers, generally well advanced in
grain handling technology, began to realize in recent years that conventional
silos were unnecessarily expensive, at least in wheat-soybean production
areas. Domestic wheat and soybean have no grade differentiation and, there-
fore, do not need storage in a multitude of separate bins, but can be stored
in large single units. Several new designs for bulk storage facilities
were evolved and constructed by cooperatives in Rio Grande do Sul.
11.       The type of bulk facility which is principally and successfully
used, is a large single storage bin, with a conical hopper, 14 m deep and
excavated out of the ground, and covered by a metal roof. Such units may
hold 20,000-60,000 tons of grain. Construction and operation costs are
lower than costs of silos; and construction time is shorter. Initially,
receiving dumps and driers had inadequate capacities, which led to huge
lines of trucks waiting to be discharged. Grain is either delivered in



ANNEX 7
Page 3
bulk, or in sacks which are emptied by hand labor into receiving dumps.
Bulk units are fully equipped with mechanized grain handling installations,
including fumigation equipment. Where underground conditions do not permit
excavations, bulk units of a similar basic design are bui:Lt in concrete
above ground. Because of their horizontal lay-out, Brazi:Lian bulk facilities
need larger construction sites than silos, in which grain is stored in
vertical bins. However, land in grain production areas is cheap and
readily available.
12.       Conversion of existing warehouses to bulk handling is in initial
stages. Some public storage companies intend to set up under-roof bins,
including equipment, in buildings originally designed for sack handling.
Operation of such units, however, would be more expensive and less flexible
than operation of silos and other bulk facilities.
Drying Equipment
13.       Due to high humidity in the project area at harvest seasons, pre-
cleaning and drying of grain to about 13% moisture content is essential
for most storage operations, including farm storage. Most existing bulk
warelhouses and silos are equipped with mechanical pre-cleaners and hot air
driers. Batch driers are used for small units and flow driers for intermediate
and higlh capacity installations.
Processing Machinery
14.       Many private enterprises and cooperatives combine storage and
processing services to enhance revenues. Complementary processing equipment
in use includes rice, corn, soybean and feed mills, vegetable oil refining
equipnment, polishers for dry beans, and weighing and packaging machinery.
In addition, well managed storage units have laboratory facilities to test
commodities and ensure consistent quality.
Gradin 
15.       Brazil's wheat is classified as soft wheat and paid for at uniform
prices, set by Government. Price deductions are made for dampness, if the
moisture content exceeds 13%, and for damaged grain and impurities.  The
absence of a complicated grading system enables Brazil to store and handle
wheat at lower cost than in other countries, where wheat iLs marketed under
a multitude of grade differentiations. Millers and bakers are managing well
under the existing grading system, mixing domestic soft wheat with imported
hard wheat. There is no clear indication that processors and consumers
would benefit sufficiently from increasing the number of wheat grades, -which
would result in higher storage costs.
16.       Official classification standards for corn, rice, soybean and dry
beans are comparable to standards used elsewhere. Export classifications



ANNEX 7
Page 4
are according to international rules and are strictly enforced. Enforcrcement
of classification is less apparent in production areas, except in registered
general warehouses entitled to issue negotiable warehouse receipts, or
when commodities are mortgaged to banks.

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Estimated Net Storage Needs by 1975
in the Project Area
1.        This Annex has been prepared to estimate net storage needs in the
project area by 1975 for corn, rice, wheat, soybean and dry beans. Separate
estimates have been made for farm and non-farm storage requ:Lrement. Farm
units would store harvested grain until it is shipped to markets, or used
for seed, subsistence and livestock consumption. Non-farm storage would
include facilities beyond farmgates and up to gates of stores attached to
retail shops. It has been assumed that grain would flow from non-farm
storage at an even pace according to needs of consumption. Storage outside
farms would be located in production and consumption areas, and at transit
stations, including export terminals.
2.        Further, estimates of net storage needs have been based on:
(i) grain production forecasts by 1975 in the project area; (ii) length and
season of harvest by crops and by states; (iii) estimated sitorage needs due
to double cropping (wheat-soybean, corn-dry beans); (iv) grain accumulation
at the peak of harvest; (v) grain retained by farms; and (vL) the existing
storage capacity (1971).
Production Forecasts
3.        Production forecasts for 1975 have been based on extrapolations
of exponential regression curves (in the form log y = a + bt) fitted into
15-year annual time series data, ending in 1970 or in 1969, except for
wheat in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina for which 9-year (1962-70)
and 5-year (1966-70) time series have been used, respectiveLy. For soybean
in Parana, a residual figure was used, based on an aggregate forecast of
all five project crops, less individual forecasts of the otlher four crops
in the state. The projected growth rates for all crops are expected to be
realistic. Forecasts are in Table 1 and basic data and average annual growth
rates used are in Table 2.
Marketable Balances
4.        The quantities of grain entering the market for which non-farm
storage would be needed are shoNwn in Table 3. They have been based on the
production forecast data (Table 1) and estimates of farm retentions shown
in Table 4. Data on seeds and farm losses are from a study by the Getulio
Vargas Foundation (GVF).  Human farm consumption data have been based on
GVF's estimates of per capita consumption in rural areas in the early 1960's;
and estimates of grain retained on farms for livestock feed have been based
on data received during appraisal.



ANNEX 8

Gross Non-Farm Storage Requirement
5.        The non-farm storage requirement for marketable grain produced in
the project area would have to be met inside that area, since there are very
limited storage facilities in other states.  Grain from the project area,
but consumed in other states, would be shipped evenly throughout the year,
keeping pace with consumption requirements. Corn and soybean exports
usually take place after the harvest season and compensate for early grain
flows to states outside the project area. Storage requirement in the project
area would therefore not be affected by the grain's final destination.
6.        Gross storage requirement of a commodity has been based on estimated
peak accumulation at the time of harvest, adjusted for depleted balances
of double cropped grain (wheat-soybean, corn-dry beans), or of other grain
grown in the area, but having a different harvest season. Peak stocks have
been calculated with help of the formula: MB (1 - H ). H is the number of
12
months of the harvest season; MB the marketable balance (Table 3); and 12
tlhe number of months of the year. Details of gross storage requirement by
crops and states are in Table 5; they would amount to about 16.6 million
tons by 1975.
Existing Non-Farm Capacity
7.        Existing non-farm storage capacity (end 1971) was based on estimates
by the Federal Storage Company of the Ministry of Agriculture, from which
the capacity of facilities owmed by the Brazilian Coffee Institute was
deducted since these are exclusively used for coffee. As shown in Table 6,
the net capacity is about 12.2 million tons. Because of wrong location,
poor design or bad physical condition, more than 1.1 million tons of this
capacity would not be suitable for efficient grain storage. This would,
therefore, leave an existing capacity of only about 11.1 million tons in the
project area (see footnote 1, Table 6).
Farm Storage Requirement
8.        For the estimate of farm needs, data from Banco do Brasil's (BB)
storage demand survey were used. However, the farm storage demand of BB's
survey was increased by 33%, because farmers were not reached by the survey
to the same extent as other groups of investors. The additional farm
storage requirement by 1975 would be about 884.8 tons.
Overall Net Storage Requirement
9.        With a projected gross requirement of 16.6 million tons by 1975
and an estimated available capacity of 11.1 million tons toward the end of
1971, additional non-farm storage capacity of about 5.5 million tons would
have to be built during the intervening years to avoid shortages in 1975.
In addition, about 0.9 million tons farm storage capacity would be needed.
Overall storage requirement by 1975 summarized in Table 6, would, therefore,
be of the order of 5-6 million tons.

1/  This rate was not used to forecast the 1975 production.
Instead, individual projections for corn, rice, wheat
and dry beans were deducted from an aggregate projection
for all five grains in the state, and the residual assigned
to soybeans. This residual is closer to forecasts by
Brazilian officials.

1/ The calculation of estimated net storage requirement has been based on the following assumptions: (a) due to
inter-state grain movements in the project area (Annex 5), it is expected that at least 20% of the excess
storage capacity in surplus states would be used to store grain shipped out from states having a deficit in
storage capacity; (b) the storage requirement of surplus states would be as indicated by Banco do Brasil's
demand survey (Annex 8); and (c) based on information on existing storage capacity, about 1.1 million tons
existing capacity would not be suitable for grain storage due to wrong location, poor design and very bad
physical. condition.
2/ Based on ratios of farm to non-farm storage demand indicated by Banco do Brasil survey, adjusted for
inadequate coverage of farmers by the survey.                                                                              e

ANNEX 10

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
General Warehousing Law of 1903
1.        The Law regulates Brazil's general warehousing industry, and
enterprises offering storage services to the public must be registered
under it. The registration includes the permission for issue of negotiable
warehouse receipts (warrants), important to attract clients. Among others,
a restrictive requirement of the Law is that no activities (trading, process-
ing) are permitted on registered premises, other than keeping in custody
clients' produce in identifiable lots.
2.        Because of such restrictions, some registered general warehouses
achieve unsatisfactory occupancy and throughput rates, and as a result,
poor financial returns on investments. Based on data received from ware-
housemen in Minas Gerais, financial sensitivity tests were run regarding
2 types of facility and operation at 2 different throughput rates as follows:
Financial Rates of Return
Warehousing         Warehousing
and Trading        under the Law
3,000-ton Warehouse
Best Estimate                         35%                 17%
Throughput at 75%                     25%                 12%
4,800-ton Warehouse
Best Estimate                         27%                 14%
Throughput at 75%                     16%                  6%
3.        These returns indicate that a mixed operation can be more profit-
able; and that the financial viability of warehouses registered under the
Law is much more subject to variations in throughput than that of unregis-
tered enterprises. This fact confirms complaints by some registered ware-
housemen that they lose money in bad crop seasons; and explains their
reluctance to invest (Annex 9). Particular care will be taken under the
project that the financial viability of investment proposals would be
satisfactory.

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Operational and Financial Results
A. Storage Capacities and Utilization
1.        Based on demand for types of storage facilities and services
indicated by Banco do Brasil's (BB) survey (Annex 9), the proposed invest-
ment of US$ 75 million (Annex 12, Table 1) is expected to provide, at full
development, additional storage capacities as follows:
Type of Storage        Farm                Non-Farm
Investment Size        Up to                                  Sub-

2.        Farm storage is mainly needed in the project area to protect har-
vested grain from adverse weather during harvest seasons. Provision of farm
storage greatly reduces harvest risks, which in turn encourages farmers to
expand grain production (paras 9 and 10). Although benefits from farm
storage would be considerable (mainly due to expanded production, it is not
expected that grain producers would achieve higher utilizaition rates of
farm storage than the installed capacity, as there is little incentive to
store grain on farms longer than absolutely necessary. Irn the case of wheat,
farm prices stay the same throughout the year and there is; no advantage to
holding grain on farms for sale later in the season. Regarding corn, rice,
soybean and dry beans, most farmers are in need of cash at: the time of harvest
and thus interested in selling the major portion of harvested grain at the
earliest.
3.        The expected annual utilization of non-farm storage is based on
the estimate of peak accumulation during harvest and an assumed even outflow
of grain during the rest of the year from facilities (Annex 8). Overall
storage capacity provided under the project is expected to benefit at full
development at least 3 million tons of grain production, equivalent to
about 10% of the estimated output (about 32 million tons) by 1975 in the pro-
ject area.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
B. General Assumptions
Grain Storage Models
4.        To test the financial viability of investments and grain storage
operations under the project, 6 models have been prepared: 2 for farm
storage (Tables 2 and 3) and 4 for non-farm storage (Tables 4 - 7). The
selection of the models is based on BB's demand survey and reflects the
types of investment in demand in different states in the project area.
Assumed storage and processing operations of the models have been based on
a survey of existing facilities conducted by a Brazilian consulting firm
in 1971, which was updated at the time of appraisal.
Throughput Rates
5.        As discussed in paragraph 2, throughput in farm storage would not
exceed installed capacities. Due to seasonal market fluctuations, uneven
transportation arrangements and grain quantities in transit, throughput
in non-farm storage would depend on the size of facilities, designs, locations
and principal services rendered. Based on operational statements of existing
units, adjusted for improvements proposed under the project, specific through-
put rates of non-farm storage models would vary from 2-10 times the capacity
(Tables 4 - 7). Low throughput rates would be achieved in sack warehouses;
and high rates in transit facilities and storage units of traders and pro-
cessors in consumption centers.
Costs, Wages, Service Rates and Taxes
6.        Projected investment costs of models are based on current (fourth
quarter 1971) prices for civil works, machinery (including installation),
ancillary equipment, electrical works, engineering services and feasibility
studies in the project area. The same data have been used in estimating
project costs (Annex 12, Table 1). Operating costs are based on statements
of existing facilities, adjusted to reflect improvements proposed under the
project. Annual depreciation of buildings is set at 5%, and of machinery
at 10%. Wages used for financial evaluation are those prevailing during the
fourth quarter of 1971. Service rates and fees are averages charged in the
fourth quarter of 1971 by the state storage companies of Rio Grande do Sul
and Minas Gerais (Annex 6). Since the rates of Government storage companies
are somewhat lower than those of private warehoase operators and traders, they
provide conservative forecasts of revenues to project participants. Taxes
are calculated at 30% of net profit before taxes.
Grain Prices
7.        For corn, rice, soybean and dry beans, constant 1971 prices
were used in financial evaluations, since it is expected that future price
changes for these commodities would keep pace with general price movements
in Brazil. Average producer prices used (1971) are as follows:



ANNEX 14
Page   3
Cr$ per ton
Corn                                 270
Rice (in husk)                       550
Soybean                              500
Dry Beans (superior quality)       1,100
Based on average transport costs and trade margins in the project area,
producer prices have been raised (according to commodity) by 10%-15% to
estimate wholesale prices.
8.        Domestic wheat prices (fixed by Government under the wheat program,
Annex 5) are expect.ed to decline up to 1975 and would level off thereafter.
Wheat prices for 1972-75 are those projected in Annex 5, Table 3; and for
subsequent years the 1975 forecast has been used.
C. Specific Assumptions
Farm Storage
9.        Storage and Drying Facilities for Wheat and Soybean Farm.  A model
has 'been prepared (Table 2) which represents a wheat-soybean farm in Rio
Grande do Sul. This farm has a total area of 680 ha, of which prior to the
investment 293 ha are cultivated, producing about 440 tons wheat and 270
tons soybean. Without the proposed project, harvested grain, which has a
humidity of 18.5Z or higher, must be shipped within 2 days to the market
because it cannot be stored longer. Farm to market transport
would therefore be needed at least every second day, which is not always
possible because frequent showers may close roads periodically. Due to weather
risks in harvest seasons, the farmer cannot expand wheat and soybean produc-
tion since he has to expect large farm losses in the absence of farm storage
and drying facilities.
10.       With the proposed investment in farm storage and a grain drier,
it is assumed that the farm's cultivated area will be expanded by 147 ha
(about 50°' of existing), which is a conservative estimate. (A larger expan-
sion would be possible, but this would need additional investment in farm
machinery and this has not been assumed). The farm area use at full devel-
opment will therefore be as follows:
At Full              Prior to
Development          Investment
------------(ha)------
UJncultivable                   20                   20
Pasture                       220                   367
Arable                        440                   293
Total                  680                  680



ANNEX 14
Page   4
11.       The arable land will be cultivated with 440 ha wheat, followed
by 330 ha soybean. A larger soybean hectarage will not be feasible,
because soybean has to be seeded within a few days after wheat harvesting
since late plantings result in unsatisfactory yield. Average hectare
yields are estimated at 1.5 tons for wheat and 1.2 tons for soybean. Total
annual incremental production will therefore be 220 tons wheat and 133 tons
soybean, representing (after deducting production costs) an additional net
revenue of about Cr$ 33,000 per year at full development.
Farm Storage and Processing
12.       Storage and Milling Facilities for Rice Farm.  The second farm
model represents a mixed enterprise engaged in grain storage and processing
on a rice farm in the State of Rio de Janeiro (Table 3). Without the
project the farm produces 500 tons of rough rice per year which is sold
immediately after the harvest at low prices. With the investment in
storage and a rice mill, the farmer, in addition to being a producer, be-
comes also a miller and a trader. The storage provided under the project
will be used for rice milling operations and storing the farm's harvest.
and will enable the farmer to purchase 1,000 tons additional rice for
optimal utilization of his rice mill (capacity 1 ton per hour). No rice
area expansion has been assumed because of specific soil and water manage-
ment requirements in rice cultivation needing additional investments.
13.       Storing and milling 1,500 tons rice and selling 1,020 tons milled
rice and 135 tons brokens and bran will result in an additional revenue
before depreciation, interest and taxes of about Cr$ 139,000 per year at
full development. It is assumed that the milled rice is sold in the
metropolitan market of Rio de Janeiro to take advantage of premium prices
paid in consumption areas.
Non-Farm Storage
14.       Warehousemen who provide solely storage and ancillary services
would receive revenues from fees collected for services. These include
receiving and discharging, storing, cleaning, drying, fumigating and some
special handling like resacking.  For traders, who use their storage
exclusively for inventories, revenues would stem from: (i) the differential
between purchlase and sales prices of grain; (ii) the value added by storage
and ancillary equipment connected with grain trading operations; and (iii)
the incremental net profit on expanded trading made possible by the new
facilities. For operators of non-farm storage, who trade as well as provide
storage and ancillary services to others, income would therefore include
some or all of the foregoing forms of revenue (Tables 4, 5 and 6).
15.       Cooperatives usually provide services only to members and collect
fees for drying, cleaning, fumigating and other ancillary services, but not
for storing. An additional revenue for cooperatives is the differential
between the price of lower rated grades at which members' grain is received
and the price of higher rated grades sold by cooperatives. Based on data
from annual reports of different cooperatives, it has been estimated that
price differentials between incoming and outgoing grain would approximate



ANNEX 14
Page 5
storage fees charged per month by state storage companies (Annex 6). These
monthly fees have, therefore, been used in estimating the additional revenue
earned in the wheat-soybean cooperative storage model, which would amount
.:o Cr$ 432,000 per year at full development (Table 7).
D. Financial Returns
16.       Based on the foregoing operation, cost and revenue assumptions,
the best-estimate financial rates of return, after taxes, fEor models sum-
marized in Table 1 and detailed in Tables 2 to 7, would be:
Farm Storage:
500 tons capacity                                 29%
Farm Storage and Processing:
500 tons capacity and rice mill                   51%
Non-Farm Storage:
3,000 tons capacity (sack warehouse)              17%
4,800 tons capacity (sack warehouse)              14%
10,000 tons capacity (private bulk warehouse)   27%
40,000 tons capacity (cooperative bulk
warehouse)         24%
Variations in these returns resulting from sensitivity tests are shown in
the respective models.

ANNEX 16

BRAZIL
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Assumptions
1.        Benefits.  The project would add about 1.9 million tons to grain
storage capacity in Brazil's center-south zone, of which albout 0.2 million
tons capacity would be farm storage. For the economic rate of return cal-
culation, the "with and without the project" method has been followed.
Therefore, only those benefits that are incremental to the project in com-
parison with the "without the project" case have been taken into account.
These benefits would mainly consist of:
(a) reduction in grain storage losses;
(b)  reduction in grain handling costs as a result of
partial conversion from sack to bulk storage; and
(c) avoiding costs of emergency storage arrangemenlts
which would be used without the project.
2.        Studies by the University of Vicosa (Minas Gerais) indicate that
due to deficient storage facilities, grain losses on farms in the project
area amount to about 13.5% of total grain handled. Based on data of the
industry, grain losses in non-farm storage, under current unsatisfactory
conditions, were estimated at about 9.5%.
3.        Based on experience with well managed units in Brazil, the
following loss estimates were used in project evaluation:
Estimated Grain Losses
(in percent of total grain handled)
Type of
Storage           Current         Project         Reduction
Farm              13.5%            7.5%              6%
Non-farm           9.5%            5.5%              4%
These estimates are conservative and, possibly, losses could be further
reduced by 2 or 3 percentage points under efficient operation.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
4.        Bulk handling of grain has been increasingly introduced in recent
years in the project area and there are strong indications that this desirable
development would continue. It is, therefore, assumed that 75% of the
project's storage capacity (about 1.4 million tons) would be set up for bulk
handling. As the only alternative storage available without the project
would be sack storage, it has been assumed that savings in grain handling
costs due to introduction of bulk storage would be genuine project benefits.
5.        Emergency arrangements for grain storage would be discontinued
whienever project units begin to operate. Costs of these arrangements are,
therefore, considered benefits of the project. The annual cost of converting
existing buildings to emergency storage has been assumed to be 80% of the
current rates charged for sack storage by the Federal Storage Company. In
the case of storage in the open, costs of polyethylene plastic sheets and
wood planks have been based on November 1971 prices and on quantities
presently required for storing grain with the help of these materials.
Wooden planks were assumed to last 5 years and plastic sheets, 2 years.
Further, it has been assumed that 67% of emergency arrangements would be
conversion of buildings and 33% storage in the open.
6.        Costs.  Since the cost of machinery and equipment in Brazil is
in line with the cost of imported machinery and equipment, no adjustment
has been made in the economic rate of return calculation for value-added
taxes that have been included in the calculation of the total financial
cost of the project. On average, civil works are expected to have an
economic life of 20 years and equipment 'a life of 10 years. Prices of
corn, rice, wheat and soybean have been based on forecasts of the Bank's
Commodity Division, and prices of dry beans on projections of Brazilian
wholesale prices. All grain prices used in the economic evaluation have
been adjusted to account for domestic transport costs (Annex 16, Table 2).
Quantitative Results
7.        Based on the foregoing assumptions, the project is estimated to
have an internal economic rate of return of about 25.5%. The basic data
for this best-estimate rate of return are in Tables 1 and 2. To determine
the rate of return's sensitivity to reduction and increase in benefits, and
cost overrun, a series of tests has been made. These included: (i) reducing
all benefits by 25%; (ii) increasing benefits by 25%; and (iii) increasing
costs by 15%. The sensitivity tests, summarized in Table 3, show variations
in rates of return between 18% and 33%.
Balance of Payments
8.        Reduction in wheat losses would result in lower imports and
reduction in soybean and corn storage losses in higher exports. In addition,
expected reduction in marketing cost should make corn and soybean more
competitive in export markets and bring the price of domestic wheat closer



ANNEX 16
Page 3
to the CIF cost of wheat imports. Assuming that reduction in grain storage
losses as a result of the project represents additional exportable surpluses
in corn and soybean and reduction in wheat imports, the proDject's gross annual
c:ontribution to foreign exchange earnings between 1980 and 1993 would be about
US$4.9 million (in 1971 prices). Since the annual amortization of the Bank
loan, including interest, between 1979 and 1988 would be about US$4.3 million,
the project would make a net annual contribution of US$0.6 million to Brazil's
foreign exchange reserves during the Bank loan repayment period.
Conclusion
9.        With a satisfactory economic rate of return and contributions to a
mre equitable income distribution and to Brazil's balance of payments, the
project deserves the high priority accorded it by the Brazilian Government
and the Bank's financial support.

NOTE:
Prices of wheat, corn, rice and soybean have been based on price forecasts of
the Bank's Commodity Division, and prices of dry beans on projections of
Brazilian wholesale prices. For wheat, the projected CIF price has been used
to evaluate non-farm storage benefits since Brazil is a net-importer of wheat.
For corn, rice and soybean, FOB prices have been reduced by 10% to allow for
domestic transport and handling costs in the calculation of non-farm benefits.
Farmgate prices have been set at 90% of non-farm storage prices to allow for
transport costs from farms to markets.
