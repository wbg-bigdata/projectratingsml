INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO BANCO DO BRASIL, S.A. WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Banco do Brasil, S.A., for the equivalent of US$30 million to
help finance a project for grain storage in the Center and the South of
Brazil. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including five years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum and would be guaranteed
by Brazil.
PART I - THE ECONOMY AND BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
2.        The Brazilian economy and Bank Group operations in Brazil
were recently reviewed in the Report and Recommendation of the President
on the Fourth Highway Construction project (P-lll4 of July 26, 1972) and
relevant extracts are attached as Annex II following the country data
sheet. On the basis of the economic review, Brazil appears to be credit-
worthy for substantial amounts of Bank lending.
3.        In lending, the Bank is responding to Brazil's demonstrated
ability to use increasing amounts of external capital to enable it to
suatain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting sectors and projects
for lending, the Bank seeks to fill important development needs. In the
first place, the Bank can help Brazil to increase its foreign capital
inflow by providing loans to sectors where bilateral financing is not
available or where the Bank's participation will help Brazil obtain addi-
tional bilateral financing. In the second place, the Bank is hoping to
direct its lending towards areas in which it can support the Government's
efforts to strengthen institutions and pursue sound economic pclicies.
Thirdly, the Bank is stressing the selection of projects which will help
Brazil overcome the most critical constraint on economic growth, namely
the balance of payments. This means support of export-oriented or of
import substituting projects where Brazil has a significant comparative
advantage. Fourthly, in selecting projects for financing, a concerted
effort is being made to identify projects that will foster the growth of
the less developed parts of Brazil, particularly the Northeast, and
reduce regional and other income disparities.



- 2 -
4.        The proposed Grain Storage project fulfills the first three
criteria. As regards the first criterion,the project has a low import
content (see paragraph 25), spread over several hundred investment pro-
posals and it is, therefore, not likely to attract support from export
credit agencies. As regards the second criterion, the project will make
an important contribution to policy reforms in the agriculture sector of
the country. The existing warehousing law, enacted in 1903, has restric-
tive features affecting the occupancy rates and profitability of ware-
houses. Small grain producers, who cannot afford to set up farm storage
units of their own, would be helped by warehousing investments and the
Government is considering a review of the law for improving storage opera-
tions. Moreover, ex post indexing of subloans and the assurance of Banco
do Brasil, the main agency for agricultural lending in the country, not
to make any other grain storage loan on softer terms in the project area
(paragraphs 22-2h of this Report) would expand the practice of making
agricultural investment loans at positive real rates of interest. Finally,
and in respect of the third criterion, the facilities to be built under
the project would mainly handle'commodities which have a growing export
market or which would substitute imports, thereby contributing to Brazil's
current efforts to strengthen its balance of payments position.
5.        The project would benefit grain storage facilities in the Center
and the South of Brazil and we discussed with Banco do Brasil the possibil-
ities of extending the project area to include the Northeast. For the
present, demand for this type of credit is essentially in the surplus pro-
duction areas of the Center and the South and the still comparatively small
requirements of such facilities in the Northeast are proposed to be met
from Brazil's own resources, at highly subsidized rates of interest, under
the special Governmental programs for regional development (namely, the
PROTERRA, the PROVALE and the PRODOESTE programs). The experience of the
project before you would, however, be useful for designing similar credit
programs in the Northeast in the future, after Governmental programs aimed
at infrastructure and rural development have led to a spurt in agricultural
production and storage requirements in that region.
PART II - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR'
6.        The agriculture sector has been receiving much attention from
the Government in recent years and the Bank organized a sector survey
in 1969-70 (Report PA-52a of August 19, 1970). Review of the agriculture
sector has been an integral part of the annual country economic reviews
and this sector -- including the rural agricultural economy of the North-
east -- is being specially studied in the current year.
7.        Agriculture is a mainstay of the Brazilian economy, despite
the country's recent rapid industrial growth. In 1970 agriculture
accounted for 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product, employed 46 percent



-3-
of the labor force and farm products made up 80 percent of total exports.
Over the past decade, growth of agricultural output averaged .5 percent
a year and the Government in its plan for 1972-74 expects growth to
accelerate to 7 percent.
8.        Brazil is attempting to recover from the unusually low coffee
crop of 1970-71 (11 million bags) to an annual production of 26-28 million
bags. The mid-1960's coffee diversification program reduced too much
Brazil's coffee production capacity. Frost and rust brought the coffee
crop to dangerously low levels. Brazil has now embarked upon a wide
ranging program to promote planting of new trees and provide additional
fertilization and anti-coffee rust and broca treatment.
9.        There is intense activity aimed at accelerating growth in Brazil's
agricultural sector. Besides coffee, the greatest gains in agricultural
output are expected in the grain, soybean and beef production in the South
.ad Center.  The most important objective is expansion of grain and bean
production for domestic consumption and export.   In support of this objec-
tive, the Government is operating a general agricultural minimum price
support program which includes grains other than wheat and assures minimum
support prices, set near world market levels, and is announced in advance
of grain cultivation seasons. It has provided a strong incentive to
production. The Government also operates a wheat support program which
was initially designed to promote import substitution and producer prices
were substantially subsidized for this purpose. As domestic production
responded strongly (production increased from below one million tons in
1968, to around 2.^5 million tons in 1972) the subsidy paid to producers
was reduced by one-third and the support price is now at the level of 140
percent of the CIF price of import and at 110 percent of production cost.
Another area where intensive efforts in promoting production -- through
investment credits, introduction of improved technology, pricing policy
an( marketinig improvements -- are under way is livestock raising. Finally,
the Government is attempting to increase several fold by its "export cor-
ridor" program earnings from export of coarse grains, animal feeds, meat
and frozeni juices; the program consists of coordinated improvement of
production, storage, marketing and transportation of these items.
10.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's third to the agricultural
sector in Brazil.  A livestock development loan (US$40 million) was made
in 1967.  After initial delays, the project has recently been progressing
well. A loan of US$6.7 million was recently made for the Alto Turi Land
Settlement project in the Northeast. We are also holding discussions with
the Brazilians about financial assistance to a program of investment in
processing facilities for agricultural exports, an expanded livestock
project and about a settlement project in the Amazon region.
The Grain Storage Problem
11.       Grain and bean production in Brazil has increased dramatically
in recent years; production increases in 1970 over 190h were 63.5 percent.
for corn, 18.1 percent for dry beans, 17.9 percent for rice, 379.3 percent



for soybean and 157.7 percent for wheat. Exports of corn, rice and soybean
also increased significantly from an annual average of US$14 million in
1960-62 to US$116 million in 1968-70. While growth was less spectacular in
1971 because of adverse weather conditions, the Government expects a new
jump in production in 1972. It has started an impressive program for further
expanding exports of corn, soybean products, sorghum and various cattle, hog
and poultry feeds in the next few years. Production of meat, pork and poultry
within Brazil is also increasing, making larger demands on coarse grains and
processed feeds. Brazil's main producing area for wheat, rice, corn, soybean
and dry beans is the Center-South zone where the project will be mainly lo-
cated. This area has about 11.1 million tons of useful grain storage capa-
city, against an estimated requirement of about 16.5 million tons by 1975.
During peaks of recent harvest seasons,wheat was stored in the open, on
surfaced roads or temporary wooden floors, and covered with plastic sheets.
Inflated vinyl warehouses were pressed into service in some areas as an
emergency measure.
12.       At the Bank's suggestion, the Banco do Brasil in 1970 made an
extensive survey to estimate grain storage investment needs in the project
area. More than 800 investment proposals were identified, involving 2.L
million tons of storage capacity to-be built by farmers, cooperatives,
cooperative processors and traders. In November 1971, the appraisal mis-
sion made an independent estimate of storage requirements, based on exist-
ing useful storage capacity and forecasts of net marketable balances of
grains through 1975. These calculations indicated that 5-6 million tons
of additional storage capacity would be needed in Center-South Brazil by
1976, of which 0.9 million tons would be for farm storage. The proposed
project would provide about 1.9 million tons of additional storage in the
next four years, about one-third of the additional requirement. If the
first operation is successful, a second may be needed in the next two or
three years.
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.       A report entitled "'Appraisal of a Grain Storage Project, Brazil"
(PA-135a) dated August 2, 1972, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is presented at Annex III.
14.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Brazil
in November 1971. Negotiations took place from July 17-24. The Borrower,
Banco do Brasil, was represented by Messrs. Dinar Goyheneix Gigante, Othon
Pinto Cardoso and Carlos Alberto Vieira. Mr. Jayme Alipio de Barros, Gen-
eral Counsel of the Ministry of Finance, examined the Guarantee Agreement.
15.       The urgent need for grain storage investments was emphasized in
Bank economic reports since 1964 and the Agricultural Sector Survey Report
(1970).  In 1970, the Finance Minister of Brazil raised with me the question



of Bank assistance in this field and since then the Bank staff has been
assisting the Government and Banco do Brasil in developing the storage
project. As stated earlier, the Banco do Brasil has made a survey of
credit demand, and has tested the preliminary findings in pilot credit
programs with encouraging results.
16.       The project is a credit program under which 6-8 years' loans,
with 1-2 years' grace, would be made by the Banco do Brasil to over 800
sub-borrowers. These loans would help finance new storage units and
expansion and improvement of existing facilities at farms, markets and
transit and processing centers. The sub-borrowers would contribute 20
percent, the Banco do Brasil from its own resources 40 percent and the
proposed Bank loan 40 percent of the investment costs.
17.       On the basis of the survey of demand made by the Banco do
Brasil (paragraph 12), about 43 percent of the total investment would
be by farmers and farmers' cooperatives, another h3 percent by grain
proceEsors and traders, and the remainder by warehouse and mixed enter-
prises. About 90 percent of the total investment would be in corn, wheat
and soybean storage and processing plant; and investment would be about
equally divided between new construction and expansion of existing units.
Because of the excess wheat milling capacity in the project area, the
Borrower has agreed that wheat flour milling would not be financed under
the project.
18.       About 55 percent of the existing storage capacity is owned by
private and cooperative enterprises and the balance by Government agencies
(both federal and state companies). The technical operation of Brazilian
storage units is satisfactory and comparable to the best management stan-
dards elsewhere. Private and cooperative storage units have been more
fully utilized in the past than public units. Unsatisfactory occupancy
rates of some public grain storage units were due to the fact that these
units were constructed before the local demand had grown to sufficient
levels. The Banco do Brasil has, therefore, agreed that investment pro-
posals from public enterprises under the project would be subject to
prior consultation with the Bank.
The Borrower
19.       The Banco do Brasil, as the originator and sponsor of the scheme,
would be the Bank's borrower, and would administer the project. It is
Brazil's largest and oldest commercial bank. Until 1964, when the Banco
Central do Brasil was created, the Banco do Brasil also carried out most
of the functions of a central bank, including currency issue, and it still
acts as financial agent for the federal treasury and other Government
agencies. The Government holds 55 percent of the Banco do Brasil's share
capital (about US$215 million equivalent in 1971) and nominates its presi-
dent and one director, while the remaining shareholders elect 11 directors.



- 6 -
The Banco do Brasil has about 750 branches in Brazil and several offices
abroad. In 1970, loans made by the Banco do Brasil amounted to about
5.5 billion cruzeiros (about US$1.2 billion), of which agricultural loans
amounted to 4.3 billion cruzeiros (about US$936 million) made to over
half a million farmers; about 200,000 of the agricultural loans (value
1.3 billion cruzeiros or about US$280 million) were on terms between one
and three years.
20.       The Banco do Brasil has about 530 branches in the project area
and well trained and competent staff. It would set up a General Coordi-
nation Committee at the Bank's head office to coordinate the work of the
various parties involved. The regional directors of the Banco do Brasil
would be responsible for general control of the project in their respec-
tive regions; and the branch managers for day-to-day project supervision
and administration at the branch level.
21.       The Banco do Brasil's main sources of funds are deposits from
the public, banks, finance institutions, the Treasury and the Central
Bank. Because of its enormous holdings of public deposits on which it
pays no interest, financial charges in 1970-71 were only 0.4 percent of
average assets, while income from all operations was 4.2 percent, mainly
from interest on loans. In 1968-70 the average administration cost was
4.5 percent on sums disbursed each year and 0.7 percent on loans out-
standing. The Banco do Brasil has consistently made profits and has set
aside adequate amounts as reserves.
Terms of Subloans
22.       The subloans covering 80 percent of the investment costs would
be at an interest rate of 7-1/2 percent, subject to monetary correction
corresponding to the rate of depreciation in the cruzeiro-dollar exchange
rate, and subject to payment of commitment fee of one percent on undis-
bursed balances. Taking into account the cost of the funds used by Banco
do Brasil, including the commitment charge made by the Bank, it was agreed
that Banco do Brasil had to charge beneficiaries interest at 7-1/2 percent
in order to provide it with an adequate spread.
23.       Most agricultural lending in Brazil takes place at interest
rates of up to 22 percent without monetary correction (generally ranging
from 13 to 17 percent in the Center-South and 7 to 17 percent in the
Northeast). With the prevailing annual inflation rate of about 20 per-
cent, this yields in many cases a negative real interest rate.   The
system is sustained only with strong support of public funds. We have
had a continuing dialogue with the Government about agricultural lending
policies, and the Government agreed to ex post correction of the subloans
under the livestock project for which t eank made a US$40 million loan
(516-BR) in 1967. Discussions with the Government and the Banco do Brasil
have resulted in agreement that ex post correction would be also applied
to outstanding amounts of subloansT =iuer the proposed project.  With a
view to ensuring uniformity in lending terms for grain storage, assurance
was obtained during negotiations that Banco do Brasil will not, during
the period the Bank loan is being committed, make any other grain storage



-7-
loans on softer terms in the project area. The proposed project would
help to extend the practice of monetary correction of investment loans
in the agriculture sector of Brazil.
24.       The indexing of subloans would be based on movements in the
cruzeiro-dollar exchange rate. As long as Brazil follows its present
flexible exchange rate policy (including frequent small devaluations
corresponding to increases in the domestic price level, less increases
in the price level in the United States), linking of subloans to the
exchange rate should ensure that real interest rates remain positive,
except if the rate of inflation in the United States exceeded the Bank's
lending rate. It has been agreed that if the annual rate of inflation
in Brazil over a twelve month period to June 30 or December 31 were to
exceed by 7-1/4 percentage points or more the average annual rate of
devaluation of the Brazilian cruzeiro, new commitments under the loan would
be suspended and the Bank and the Borrower would consult with a view to
modifying the system of monetary correction so as to ensure that the
real interest rate remains positive.
Cost and Financing
25.       Estimated project cost, together with foreign exchange require-
ments, are summarized in Annex III and would involve about US$6 million
of foreign exchange and US$69 million equivalent of local currency expen-
diture. As stated earlier the project will be financed as to 40 percent
by the Bank loan (US$30 million), 40 percent by Banco do Brasil (equiva-
lent to US$30 million) and 20 percent (equivalent to US$15 million) by sub-
borrowers.
Procurement and Disbursement
26.       The Bank's loan would be disbursed against expenditures on civil
works, machinery, electrical works and engineering services.   No Banlc
disbursements would be made against costs of land and feasibility studies.
The working capital requirements for effective utilization of project
facilities would be met from sub-borrowers' own resources, the Banco do
Brasil and other commercial banks.
27.       International competitive bidding procedures would not be suit-
able. There would be over 800 different sub-borrowers, widely scattered
over Center-South Brazil with investments in sub-projects averaging about
US$100,000 which would be too small to attract international competition.
Bulking of sub-projects would not be possible because each unit would be
designed to meet the individual operators' requirements, and over 50 per-
cent of project funds are expected to be used for expansion and improve-
ment, so that the new construction and machinery must match existing
facilities. Procurement for sub-projects exceeding US$500,000 investment
cost (according to the Banco do Brasil's survey, 30-h0 new units) would



- 8 -
be on the basis of competitive bidding within Brazil. In other cases,
procurement would be through local bidding or direct negotiations which
would be carefully scrutinized by the Banco do Brasil. In the case of
any sub-project having an estimated investment cost of over US$1 million,
feasibility studies, bid documents and contract awards would be subject
to review by the Bank. All subloans exceeding US$1 million,or which
together with other outstanding subloans to the same beneficiary would
exceed US$1 million, would require prior approval by the Bank.
28.       The Bank loan to Banco do Brasil would have a duration of 15
years including 5 years' grace. The proposed term for the Bank loan
takes into account the expected lending terms to sub-borrowers (6-8
years), the time required for disbursement of the Bank loan (about 5
years), plus 2 years for possible setbacks or delays. An estimated
schedule for annual disbursements is presented in Annex III.
Financial and Economic Benefits
29.       To test the financial viability of proposed investments and
grain storage operations, 6 models were prepared: 2 for farm storage
and h for non-farm storage. The financial rates of return for these
models vary between 14 and 51 percent.
30.       The project would reduce grain storage losses, strengthen the
organization of grain marketing, lower marketing and movement costs
through bulk-handling and improved grain flows from production to con-
sumption centers. The quantified benefits would consist of:
a) reduction of grain storage losses in case of farm storage
from 13.5 percent to 7.5 percent of grain handled: in
non-farm storage from 9.5 percent to 5.5 percent;
b) savings in grain handling costs as a result of conversion
from sack to bulk handling in 75 percent of the project
units; and
c)  avoidance of the costs of emergency storage.
Based on these benefits, the project's economic rate of return would be
at least 26 percent. Through reduction in storage losses, the project
would create additional surpluses of corn and soybean and substitute for
wheat imports for a total value of about US$5 million a year.   At full
development the operation of the storage and processing plants would
require the employment of 4,500 people.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative Republic
of Brazil and the Bank, the draft Loan Agreement between Banco do Brasil
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors separately. The major features of these agreements have already been
described in this report.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDAIION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
There are now 23 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/474     Estreito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million loans of
February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966. The project is proceeding
on schedule. Equipment costs were substantially below estimates,
explaining the lower than forecast disbursements.
404         Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965. The project was completed in early 1971, (after
a delay of about eighteen months) except for the installation of
equipment for an associated transmission line. Ordering of this
equipment was delayed, and the loan is now expected to be fully
disbursed by December 31, 1973, four years after the initial closing
date.
442         Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:   US$49 million loan of March 15, 1966.
All the four generators were commissioned during 1971 and the project
has been completed. Disbursements will extend up to mid-1973.
475/476/
477/478     Power Distribution Projects:   US$6.2, US$8.1, US$41, US$6.3 million
loans of December 19, 1966. These four power distribution loans had
a slow start but after administrative reorganization in 1970 the
projects gained momentum. Procurement for the projects has been
completed but some equipment may not be delivered by the December 31, 1972
closing date. Most of the overhead distribution system has been completed;
construction work on transmission lines, substations and underground
distribution systems will extend into 1973.
516         Livestock Project:  US$40 million loan of September 23, 1967.   After
initial delays due to marketing and organizational difficulties, the
livestock credit program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
Some problems arose recently with respect to the calculation of
interest on indexed principal amounts during the grace period but
have now been settled with the Central Bank of Brazil. About
US$35 million out of the US$40 million loan have already been committed
and the balance is expected to be committed by September 1972.
Disbursements of Bank loan will be completed by the closing date
for the loan, December 31, 1973.

Loan No.
565         Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Prolect:  US$22.3 million loan of
October 23, 1968. Changes in the project layout and design have
increased substantially the local cost, which will be covered by
Eletrobras. Construction work is well advanced and the project
is likely to be completed on schedule.
566         Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:  US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1968. The project was delayed six mont.hs by spillway
foundation difficulties and is now scheduled to be completed by
October 1974.
567         First Highway Construction Prolect:  US$26 million loan of
October 23, 1968. The First Hlighway Construction project is
virtually completed at a cost slightly below estimates.
656         Industry:  US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970.  The date for
commitment of the loan by BNB originally set for June 30, 1972, was
postponed on June 29, 1972 by one year to reflect lower than expected
demand. The immediate obstacle to more rapid utilization of the loan
has been the Bank's requirement that entrepreneurs normally put uD
a minimum of 25 percent of total project cost from their own funds ln
order to have access to the Bank loan. As long as subsidized local
currency resources were plentiful, entrepreneurs chose to use them to
the utmost and to finance import costs from their own resources or
through suppliers' credits. The situation has recently changed
significantly. SUDENE has made it more difficult for prospective
investors to have access to subsidized resources, by requiring them
to increase their financial stake in projects and the Monetary
Authorities have extended ex post indexation to all term industrial
lending by Federal credit institutions. It is now expected that the
loan will be fully committed by mid-1973.
676         Second Highway Construction Project:  US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970. The Second Highway Construction project was about
67 percent complete on May 31, 1972. Although disbursements are
now slightly behind schedule, the 'project is expected to be completed
without delay and within cost estimates.
677         Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project: US$80 million loan of May 15, 1970.
Construction work started in early 1972 as scheduled.  A proposed
increase in the transmission svstem, together with substantially
higher than estimated equipment costs, are expected to raise the
projects cost by US$20 million over the original forecast.
728         Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:  US$70 million loan of April 5, 191L.
The project is proceeding according to schedule. The cost of the civil
works so far contracted is in accordance with the estimates.

Loan No.
755         Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971. Part of
the school construction project is likely to be delayed as a result
of delays in engaging consulting architects. A new schedule is under
discussion. Although completion of construction is expected to be
six months behind schedule, no need to postpone the closing date is
foreseen.
756         Santos Port Project:  US$h5 million loan of June 21. 1971.   The pro-
ject is proceeding satisfactorily. Preliminary engineering has been
completed, though invitation of tenders is slightly behind schedule.
The Bank has agreed to an increase in grain silo capacity and is
reviewing several other works revisions. Responsibility for the
overall port planning study has been transferred from the National
Transport Planning Organization (GEIPOT) to DNPVN, the National
Ports Department, which will be reorganized subject to the consul-
tant's study expected in September 1972.
757         Sao Paulo Water Supply ProJect:  US$22 million loan of June 21, 1971.
The loan became effective on January 13, 1972 and the state Govern-
ment is somewhat behind schedule in raising resources according to
the financial plan for the project. A Bank supervision mission is
due to review the position in September. SAEC, the borrower, has
made significant progress in reorganizing its structure and in im-
proving operations. The water and sewage tariffs have been revised
in fulfillment of the undertaking in the loan documents.
758         Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project: US$37 million loan of June 21,
1971. The loan became effective on January 13, 1972 and the state
Government is somewhat behind schedule in raising resources accord-
ing to the financial plan for the project. A Bank supervision mission
will review the position in September.
786         Railway Project - MBR:  US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971.
Delay of about 6 months occurred in awarding the contracts for
constructing the new railway link for the MBR iron ore mine due to
engineering problems encountered and inadequate project management
by the Federal Railways. Work has now commenced on site and some
of the lost time is being regained.
787         MAR Iron Ore Project:  US$50 million loan of August 25. 1971. The
estimated cost of the project has increased'due to major design
changes for the port terminal and several investment additions to
the project. A new financing plan is under discussion with the
Borrower and target completion dates at the mine and terminal should
be met.
812         Usiminas Steel Expansion Project:  US$63 million loan of April 11,
1972. The loan became effective only on July 28, 1972 and is
proceeding according to schedule.

THE ECONOMY
1.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil"(WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. The summary and conclusions
of that report was attached recently to the Report and Recommendation of the
President on the fourth highways project (P-1114 of July 26, 1972). The
economic report describes Brazil's remarkable economic growth over the past
several years and the policies which the Government has followed in achieving
that performance. The net external capital inflow associated with the
rapid growth was large, amounting during 1968-70 to US$2.8 billion of which
US$1.65 billion consisted of financial credits with maturities of one to
four years. The role of medium and long-term finance was important;
development agencies contributed US$690 million net (IDB, US$312 million;
AID, US$278 million; and IBRD US$98 million), while suppliers' credits,
including loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, totalled about US$200
million. Direct investments amounted to US$270 million.
2.        The economic report points out that continuation of rapid growth
in the 1970's will require substantial increases in medium and long-term
external capital inflows. Growth in the 1968-70 period was facilitated by
the existence of considerable excess production capacity, now almost
entirely in use. The capital and intermediate goods imports associated with
capacity expansion can be expected to enlarge Brazil's external resource
gap even if exports rise by as much as 11 percent in real terms as projected
in the economic report. At the same time, there is good prospect that
medium and long-term external capital will be forthcoming in larger volume
than in the recent past; private equipment procurement provides external
suppliers with a dynamic market and the Government has made considerable
progress in articulating its investment needs in the form of projects
suitable for external financing. However, Brazil's gross external capital
requirements are greater than the foreign exchange component of such projects.
While the capital investment needed to support Brazil's economic growth
targets is substantial, the import needs of most public investment projects
are relatively low, reflecting the ability of Brazil's highly developed capital
goods industry to compete successfully under international competitive bidding.
Hence, an appreciable part of foreign financing must be available to cover
local expenditures.
3.        A new general economic mission arrivedin Brazil in mid-August.    In
the meantime preliminary evaluation of events subsequent to the latest economic
report confirms the diagnosis contained in that report. In 1971, real GDP
grew by more than 11 percent, with both agriculture and industry performing
well. Brazil is experiencing a major upsurge in investment, supported by
both increased domestic savings and foreign capital inflow. Imports increased
by 29 percent with the increase concentrated in intermediate and capital
goods consumed by industry. Exports increased by 5 percent in 1971,
reflecting a fall in the share of traditional agricultural products (coffee,
cotton, cacao and sugar) but a major increase (32 percent) in exports of
manufactured goods. This represents a continuation of the rapid and success-
ful process of diversification of Brazil's exports. The pace of economic
growth has continued in the first few months of 1972, with exports resuming
a stronger upward trend.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
4.        Brazil's external debt increased by US$1.4 billion during 1971
to a year-end figure of US$6.6 billion, of which more than two-fifths
consisted of financial credits.   However, toward the end'of the year the
Government imposed comprehensive controls on resort to financial credit
designed to prevent short-term credits from being used as a substitute
for long-term capital. Thus far, in 1972 the rise in the total of such
credits has been matched by an increase in foreign reserves, which are
now equivalent to about US$2.5 billion or approximately six months' imports
of goods and non-factor services. Service of Brazil's external debt, exclusive
of the financial credits, amounted to about 13 percent of exchange earnings
in 1971. Although external debt management is one of the more critical issues
confronting the Government at high rates of growth, Brazil should be able to
service the increasing debt needed to support its growth targets as long as
the present high quality of economic management is sustained.
BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
5.        By July 31, 1972, Brazil had received 43 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$1,439.3 million (net of cancellations). Since August 1, the
Bank has approved a loan of US$51 million for the Fourth Highway construction
project. Annex I gives a summary statement of loans and credits as of
July 31, 1972. Of the loans declared effective, 24 have'not been fully
disbursed, and of those, disbursement of 12 was behind schedule at the end
of 1971. However, the pace of disbursements has accelerated. During FY 65
to FY 69 disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing to
US$66 million in FY 70, US$75 million in FY 71, and US$137 million in FY 72.
The disbursement rate should continue to accelerate during the next few
years. Comments on the implementation of individual projects are in Annex I.
6.        Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFC's commitments.
Since 1957, IFC has made 18 commitments in Brazil, totalling US$89.4 million,
of which US$5.4 million has been repaid, US$30.1 million sold and US$1.5 million
cancelled. Of the balance of US$52.4 million, US$37.0 million represents
loans and US$15.4 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments is also
given in Annex I.
7.        Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY 72, and seven loans
totalling US$437 million were approved. So far, in FY 73 two loans amounting
to US$57.7 million, have been approved. Subject to satisfactory completion
of the first livestock project (Loan 516-BR), we expect to present an
additional livestock project within the next several months. We are also
appraising the investment program of Light, S.A., the principal distributor
of electric power in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, with a view to a loan that
would assist the company to raise additional finance in the external capital
market.
