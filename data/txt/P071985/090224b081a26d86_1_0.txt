                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Almost all of the activities planned under the original $50 million credit have been completed and nearly 95% of it disbursed. Some of the notable achievements include the
                         rehabilitation of the worst 35 km escarpment section of the trunk road between Lusaka and Chirundu and the creation of a road funding agency, a road management agency and a
                         road safety agency. As a result of these reforms, Zambia has been better placed to fund all of its routine road maintenance requirements from road user charges.

                         2. Significant delays took place with the implementation of the major contracts supported under the two additional financings, the construction of the Chiawa Bridge and rehabilitation
                         of Link 3 of the Lusaka Chirundu road. These have now been signed and the works have commenced during the reporting period. The bridge will replace the existing ferry across the
                         Kafue River, providing more reliable access to the town of Chiawa and the lower Zambezi region, a major tourism and agricultural resource on the north bank of the Zambezi. The
                         rehabilitation of Link 3 will further improve Zambia's main transport corridor connecting to the south.

                         3. The continued vacancies at Board and Senior Management level of all three Agencies (Road Development Agency (RDA): Board; National Road Fund Agency (NRFA): Board
                         Chair; Road Traffic and Safety Agency: Board and CEO) are having a negative effect on the Agencies in that the corporate governance, required by law, is not comprehensively
                         implemented.
