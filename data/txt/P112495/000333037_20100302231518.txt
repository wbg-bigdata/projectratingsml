                           enterprises (SMEs).
                           The program supported by the REGE-DPL focuses on the
                           transition from managing the impact o f the global crisis to fiscal
                           adjustment and shared growth and aims to contribute to the
    Program                following main objectives: (1) economic management; (2) public
    Development            financial management; (3) affordable universal healthcare and
    Objective(s) and       improved educational access; (4) employment; (5) improved
    Contribution to        investment climate; (6) increased financial intermediation,
    Country Partnership    especially to SMEs. The proposed program supports all three
    Strategy (CPS)         pillars o f the Country Partnership Strategy, which are ( i )
                           improved competitiveness and employment, ( i i ) equitable human
                           and social development, and ( i i i ) efficient provision o f high-
                           quality public services.
                           There are four main risks to the program's outcomes:
                           Global economic riskfactors. High uncertainty over the pace of
                           global recovery creates s t i l l substantial downside risks to global
                           demand for Turkish exports (especially from the EU), to output
    Risks and Risk         growth and fiscal performance, and to the availability of
    Mitigation             international private capital flows to finance Turkish investments
                           and the corporate sector's roll-over o f external loans. In addition,
                           there remains some risk o f further systemic disruption in the
                           global financial system, with potentially significant ripple effects
                           on the Turkish economy. Realistically, there i s l i t t l e that Turkey
                           can do to mitigate the most severe risks o f further global

                                                 1
               economic disruption, beyond continued strong management o f its
               own economic span o f control (monetary and fiscal policy).
               Turkey also faces uncertainty stemming from international energy
               prices. Here mitigation measures include increasing energy
               efficiency and diversifying into non-oil sources such as wind and
               solar energy, policy areas where the Bank and the Government
               are collaborating closely.
               Economic management risks. The main risk comes from the
               challenge to macroeconomic, especially fiscal, management in
               the face o f the current slowdown. The 2010-12 Medium Term
               Program (MTP) has set a fiscal policy framework with measures
               and targets addressing the risk o f rising public debt ratios.
               Mitigating this risk i s the government's strong record o f fiscal
               management and high capacity in public debt management. A
               longer-term risk i s that fiscal balance i s achieved at the cost o f
               declining levels o f public investment i n growth-enhancing areas
               such as core infrastructure, reducing potential growth. The risk o f
               further delay o f some key reforms in the areas o f the labor market
               and worker protection and o f the investment climate i s reduced as
               the MTP and the Government's 2010 Annual Program contain
               these. Actions to mitigate these risks include continued close
               dialogue between the government, Bank teams, and those o f other
               institutions (e.g., IMF, European Commission (EC)), and the
               programmatic structure o f the Bank's DPL support to Turkey.
               Political risks. Turkey has had a stable government since 2002
               under the Justice and Development Party (AKP), facilitating the
               implementation o f major reforms. Key risks relate to continuing
               domestic political differences and the possibility o f declining
               public support for reforms due to the impact o f the crisis. There i s
               also a risk that a focus o f legislative and policy activity on the
               political agenda could delay ambitious and controversial reforms
               during the remainder o f the CPS period. The EU accession anchor
               continues to mitigate political risks.
               Social risks. The severe recession over the last 18 months caused
               increases in poverty and unemployment, especially youth
               unemployment, and as the recovery will likely be moderate and
               gradual, there i s a high risk that unemployment and poverty w i l l
               stay at elevated levels for some years. High unemployment and
               increased poverty, especially among young people, in turn create
               risks o f social tensions and declining support for Turkey's reform
               agenda, including the outstanding second phase o f the labor
               market reform. Mitigating the risk i s the emphasis the
               Government's program places on labor market measures,
               including active labor market programs.

                      TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

                                         .
                                        I INTRODUCTION

1.      Turkey i s now passing through a transition from weathering the global financial
crisis to re-establishing fiscal balance and sustainable, shared growth. The crisis has placed
strains on Turkey's economy and public finances. Manufacturing has been hard hit, with effects
on unemployment and economic hardships at the household level. At the same time, fundamental
strengths have kept Turkey on course to benefit from the global recovery. The first step to
returning to growth is to move from crisis-related fiscal expansion to balance and avoid
crowding out the private-sector led recovery. The second step i s to reinvigorate the business
climate reforms and human-capital investments that are central to Turkey's long-term goals.

2.       The proposed operation supports both the Government's c r i s i s response and this
 transition back to sustainable growth under the new Medium Term Program (MTP). In late
 2008 and 2009, the Government's crisis response packages went some way towards maintaining
jobs and protecting families during the downturn. Now, fiscal adjustment will rely on further
measures. Most important among these are cost containment in the health sector and continued
 implementation o f social security reform to limit the fiscal burden o f the combined health and
 social security deficit. Looking forward, the enactment o f legislation o f a fiscal rule and
 improving oversight o f public spending are the keys to greater certainty in economic policy and
value for money in public finance. T o spur j o b creation, planned reforms will increase labor-
market flexibility and worker protection and create an improved private-sector regulatory
framework under the new Commercial Code and Capital Market Law.

3.     The proposed Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment (REGE) DPL
continues support to Turkey's public sector reform agenda under the Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy L o a n (PPDPL) series. The Government has pressed ahead with i t s
public sector reform program, especially in the health and social security system and in PFM.
This program has been supported by the PPDPL series.' The program to be supported b y the
REGE-DPL continues this agenda with prior actions in the areas o f health, social security, and
public financial management. Accordingly, the REGE-DPL i s defined as the third operation o f
the PPDPL series.'

4.     The REGE-DPL also supports the transition to recovery and job creation through
business climate reforms supported under the earlier Competitiveness and Employment
Development Policy L o a n (CEDPL) series. Since the onset o f the global financial crisis, the
Government's private-sector development agenda has focused largely on immediate measures to
mitigate the impact o f the crisis and there has been a pause in the pre-crisis business climate

reform program, which had been supported by the CEDPL ~ e r i e s Business climate reforms in
                                                                   .~
the proposed series are therefore largely forward-looking. The REGE-DPL program includes one
prior action (on customs procedures) that extends the CEDPL agenda. Reforms from the earlier
planned CEDPL 3 operation become triggers for the expected follow-up operation (REGE-
DPL2).4

5.      The REGE-DPL also supports measures taken to maintain employment and
household incomes in the face o f the global crisis. From late 2008 into 2009, the Government
rolled out a series o f packages o f measures, first to protect financial stability, then io maintain
employment and stimulate domestic demand. The REGE-DPL program includes prior actions
related to these crisis-response measures. Figure 1 explains schematically how the proposed
REGE-DPL series combines i t s three components: the public-sector agenda, the private-sector
agenda, and the crisis response.

6.      The proposed program supports the ambitious growth agenda now facing Turkey.
Turkey's growth model will continue to be focused on integration with i t s neighbors, including
the EU, with export growth expected to play an important role again as global economic growth
resumes. The recent trend towards diversification o f its export destinations will reinforce
Turkey's growth in the medium term. Success rests on reforms to the business climate and labor
regulations to enhance competitiveness. At the same time, the fiscal challenge has intensified
with the recent downturn. Fiscal sustainability crucial to confidence in the economy and to create
the space for private sector finance. The ambition o f the reform program supported by the REGE
series reflects the Government's own commitment and the consensus among Government, World
Bank, and private-sector participants that these reforms are key to restoring strong, equitable
growth and employment in Turkey.

9.      The Turkish economy had already begun to slow down from 2007 onwards. Growth
in 2007 declined to 4.7 percent, from 6.9 percent in 2006. Quarterly year-on-year (y/y) growth
was 7.2 percent and 2.8 percent in the first two quarters o f 2008, respectively, and had slowed
fbrther by the third quarter to 1.0 percent (y/y, Figure 6a). This slowdown led to a build-up o f
inventories by Turkish firms: inventory accumulation accounted for approximately 2 percent o f
GDP between the first quarter o f 2007 and the third quarter o f 2008, before the crisis hit.

10.     This slowdown had several causes. First, high oil (and more generally energy) prices
were a driving factor i n Turkey's high CADS in 2006-08 (Figure 3). Second, at the same time
(starting from 2006) inflation targeting increasingly struggled to combat persistence in Consumer
Price Index (CPI) inflation (Figure 4), contributing both to higher real interest rates and to
continued real appreciation (between end-2003 and August 2008 the exchange rate appreciated
by 38 percent in real terms; Figure 6e). Fiscal expansion from 2005 onwards (measured by a 1.9
percent decline in the primary fiscal balance: Table 3) may also have contributed to uncertainty
about the sustainability o f the growth o f 2004-06.

11.     Slowing growth in 2007 was driven by slowing private investment and increased
imports. The contribution o f private investment (gross fixed capital formation) to growth fell
from 3.1 percent in 2006 to 0.6 percent in 2007 (Table 1). The contribution o f net exports caused
a further 1.2 percent fall, driven entirely by imports. These two factors more than explain the
slowdown in 2007, since at the same time the economy started to accumulate significant
inventories (a phenomenon that accelerated i n mid-2008 as consumption stalled).

12.      Fiscal policy had already loosened in 2006-08. The public sector primary fiscal surplus
declined from 5.0 percent in 2005 to 4.6 percent in 2006 and 3.1 percent in 2007. This change in
fiscal stance was driven by lower growth and increased primary expenditures, which rose by 2.7
percent o f GDP over 2005-07. The main driver o f increased spending was current transfers, o f
which the largest component i s transfers to the combined health and social security system. In


                                                                                           4
conclusion, this fiscal expansion was largely structural, made up o f rigid spending components
that are hard to reverse in the short term.

 The Government's Response

15.     T h e authorities' response to the impact o f the global crisis covered four areas: ( i )
monetary policy; ( i i ) banking liquidity measures; ( i i i ) fiscal stimulus; and (iv) employment and
social measures.
~~




  The CBRT Economic Tendency Survey includes a measure o f industrial inventory expectations, which peaked at a
seven-year high o f +18 in September 2008.

  December 2009 balance o f payments statistics report USD 33 million in M L T debt amortizations and USD 5 5
million in trade finance amortizations (CBRT). Gross short-term debt service adds to these amortizations.

  As Table 1 shows, since mid-2008 net exports have contributed positively to growth, because imports have
declined even faster than exports.

                                                         5
 16.   The inflation targeting regime allowed monetary policy to loosen in response to the
slowdown. Between October 2008 and November 2009, the overnight interest rate was cut 13
times by a total o f 1,025 basis points, from 16.75 percent to 6.50 percent (Figure 6e). Inflation
for 2009 was 6.5 percent, below the target rate o f 7.5 percent; the CBRT has kept rates
unchanged in i t s last two monthly decisions.

17.      The Government moved quickly to maintain confidence and liquidity in the banking
sector. Following the failure o f Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there were high levels o f
uncertainty about banks' access to foreign exchange (FX) and consequently concerns that
financial intermediation might stall, in extreme scenarios potentially threatening some
institutions' financial viability. Against this backdrop, the CBRT enacted several liquidity
measures in the fourth quarter o f 2008:

         The CBRT preemptively addressed potential liquidity problems in currency markets
        through the re-introduction o f i t s "blind-broker" lending facility (see Section V), the re-
         start o f FX auctions, and a reduction in reserve requirements on FX deposits (providing
        USD 2.5 billion in liquidity). The CBRT also made the terms o f i t s lender-of-last resort
        facility more flexible, though i t has not had to be activated.
        Credit for pre-exporting activities was expanded through an increase o f the EximBank
        credit line at the CBRT by USD 500 million to lJSD 1 billion and then to USD 2.5
        billion.
    0   The Council o f Ministers was given power to adjust the terms o f the deposit guarantee
        scheme, though no adjustments have been needed.
        Credit subsidies and technical support programs to SMEs were increased.
    0   The Capital Markets Board (CMB) took a number o f actions aimed at facilitating capital
        markets transactions, including the unification o f regulations on corporate debt issuance,
        the adoption o f regulation on asset covered bonds, a reduction in issuance fees, and the
        elimination o f maturity limits on corporate bonds and an increase in issuance limits.

18.      The Government's measures proved successful. The banking sector maintained FX
liquidity and Turkish banks have remained highly-capitalized and profitable. Figures tracking
usage o f the CBRT blind broker facility shows that demand peaked in November 2008 at USD
1.1 billion and has since fallen away to an average o f less than USD 30 million per month since
end-June 2009, as FX liquidity conditions have improved.

19:     The Government later took steps to reactivate credit activity in the banking system.
Chief among these actions i s the enhancement o f the existing Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF)
scheme. Legislation was passed making an additional T L 1 billion available to leverage credit
resources for SMEs (Annex 7). The fund follows international best practice in that it limits
guarantees to 65 percent o f loan amounts and leaves credit risk assessment and recovery with the
originating commercial banks. Burden-sharing has been introduced by requiring beneficiary
banks to participate in a subscription o f fresh capital for the CGF. The Government also
amended a decree (no. 32) to allow corporations to borrow in FX, for loans above USD 5 million
with average maturity greater than one year, from local branches o f Turkish banks.

20.   Later measures aimed to mitigate the credit effects on SMEs, which are the main
source of employment in Turkey. SMEs are estimated to account for three-quarters o f

                                                  6
employment in Turkey. With the decline in lending to SMEs, the government increased funding
to Turkey's Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB) by 48
percent to support existing credit subsidy and technical support programs. Credit availability
through Eximbank was also expanded from USD 500 million to I J S D 2.5 billion.

21.     Fiscal stimulus measures were limited in cost and targeted key industrial sectors.
Automatic stabilizers have accounted for an estimated 2.6 percent o f the 3.8 percent o f GDP
decline in the public sector primary fiscal balance between 2008 and 2009 (Table 3). O f this
automatic adjustment, approximately 1.6 percent o f GDP i s explained by the increase in the
combined deficit o f the health and social security system (Table 7, Section 111). In addition to
these automatic stabilizers, in March 2009 the government introduced exemptions on Value
Added Tax (VAT) applying to new cars and white goods. Initially these exemptions were to last
for three months; a three-month extension was approved in June 2009, which expired in
September 2009. The tax cuts appear to have had an impact, leading to a run-down o f inventories
in these sectors.

22.     As the employment effects o f the crisis became more apparent, the government
added employment and social measures to its response. With unemployment rising rapidly,
the Government introduced a number o f measures to encourage hiring, preserve existing jobs,
and expand active labor market programs (Table 2). The measures are broadly in line with
actions that other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries
have taken in response to the crisis and their design has taken into account international
experience as well as Turkey's legal and regulatory framework. The measures expected to have
most crisis mitigation impact are the following:

   0   Short-time employment compensation: paid to employees in companies that have had
       to substantially reduce weekly working hours temporarily or to temporarily suspend
       operation due to the effects o f the global crisis. This compensation i s paid from the
       unemployment insurance (UI) fund and "tops up" the reduced earnings paid to the
       worker. The Ministry o f Labor and Social Security (MOLSS) inspects f i r m s (at the f i r m s '
       request) and determines eligibility. This measure already existed in the UI benefit system
       but, as part o f the crisis package, the government increased the amount o f the subsidy by
       50 percent and extended the maximum length from 3 to 6 months, and then to 12 months.
   0   Accelerated scale-up o f vocational training: prior to the May 2008 employment
       reform, the Turkish Employment Agency (ISKUR) training program operated at a
       smaller scale: in 2007, about 23,000 people were trained with a total expenditure o f T L
       30 million and in 2008 this number was still about 30,000. The increases introduced in
       2009 substantially extended the training program (to above 150,000), a positive measure
       given the slack labor market conditions that prevailed. The program also includes a
       training stipend (TL 15 per day) so it provides some income support as well as skills
       development.
   0   Public works: these can be an effective instrument in a downturn for workers who
       cannot benefit from the formal social protection system. A key design feature i s to set
       employment features and the wage rate appropriately so that the program i s targeted
       towards these primarily informal sector workers. For legal reasons, under the Turkish
       program, participants are paid the minimum wage (pro-rata on an hourly hasis), which
       may in principle reduce the effectiveness o f the program's targeting. To ensure that the

                                                  7
          poor are not crowded out, ISKUR uses other features o f the program, most notably the
          types of employment offered, to ensure self selection o f the poor workers.

23.      The fiscal cost of the full package i s moderate. The 2009 employment measures are
estimated to cost approximately TL 900 million (about USD 600 million) or about 0.1 percent o f
2009 GDP. Most o f the direct fiscal costs are being financed by the UI Fund, which has large
reserves, amounting to about USD 28 billion in October 2009. Including all crisis-response
measures (including those in taxation and the financial system), recent estimates put the 2009
cost o f discretionary measures at 1.2 percent o f GDP and the expected cost in 201 0 at about 0.5
percent o f GDP.9

Outcomes

24.     Turkey's economy continued to contract in the first three quarters o f 2009. As a
consequence o f these factors and o f ongoing turmoil in world markets in early 2009, quarterly
growth plunged further to -14.7 percent, -7.9 percent and -3.3 percent in Q1, Q2, and Q3
respectively (y/y, Figure 6a). Annual economic growth in 2009 i s now forecast by Bank staff to
be in the region o f -6.5 percent. Unemployment has risen sharply (Figure 6b). After remaining
stable at levels below 10 percent for several years, the three-month moving-average open
unemployment rate peaked at 16.1 percent in January-March 2009 and stood at 13 .O percent in
September-November 2009 (and 24.0 percent among workers aged 24 and under) although this
recent decline i s in part seasonal.

25.     Estimated poverty effects have been significant." Simulations carried out by Bank
staff in early 2009 suggested that a slowdown o f the magnitude that Turkey i s experiencing
could be expected to add approximately 5 percentage points to the poverty rate, raising the
headcount rate (using the national poverty line) from 17.1 percent to about 22 percent (from
2008 to 2010). These simulations suggested that the most vulnerable groups are informal non-
agricultural workers (who account for nearly half the estimated increase in poverty), children and
young workers.

26.      A crisis impact survey fielded by the World Bank in partnership with United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Turkish think-tank Economic Policy Research
Institute (TEPAV) has confirmed significant social impacts. The main findings o f these
surveys have been ( i ) widespread impact on household income - 70 percent o f households report
reductions in income - with the most important effects coming through self-employment income
and wages; ( i i ) regressive distributional impact -the poorest 20 percent o f households before the
crisis reported the highest share o f reduction in income; ( i i i ) coping strategies show reductions in
food expenditures (including on children) as the main adjustment mechanism, with households
reducing spending on education and
health to a much lesser extent; (iv) , 7,000                                                             1 300-

27.    Private sector firms maintained access to international borrowing although rollover
ratios declined. Corporate rollover o f foreign debt amortizations f e l l below 100 percent in
December 2008 for the first time since January 2007. However, firms continued to cover most o f
their debt service through new borrowing, with drawings tracking repayments quite closely

 month on month (Figure 7). Over the first nine months o f 2009 the rollover ratio o f the non-
 banking corporate sector's external debt was just over 70 percent. At the same time, net errors
 and omissions on the balance o f payments showed inflows o f nearly USD 14 billion in the last
 quarter o f 2008 and the first half o f 2009, reflecting repatriation o f Turkish FX. Since early 2009
 the TL has traded in a narrow band around TL 1.50 to the U S dollar.

 28.      T h e banking sector has proven resilient but lending stalled in early 2009 and
 exposure to government securities increased. Banks remain highly-capitalized and profitable,
 despite deterioration in asset quality. The Turkish banking system relies on a strong and stable
 domestic deposit base and low loan-to-deposit ratios (80 percent in 2008 and 77 percent as o f
 November 2009). Wholesale funding (borrowing from banks abroad), including syndications and
 securitizations, i s only 15.8 percent o f non-equity liabilities (as reported by BRSA). Profitability
 has been helped in 2009 by widening net interest margins as the policy interest rate has been cut,
 enabling banks to reduce their deposit costs and compensate for higher provisioning charges. The
 capital adequacy ratio was 20.4 percent as o f end-November 2009. Since end-2008, commercial
 bank lending has increased only marginally (by 3.8 percent in nominal terms), while securities
 holdings have increased from 27 percent to 32 percent o f total assets. In nominal terms, lending
 to S M E s fell by 9 percent in the 12 months to November 2009. The performance o f corporate
 and commercial loans and mortgages has held up well, whereas non-performing loans (NPLs) for
 SMEs, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans have risen. The N P L ratio for the banking
 system as a whole was 5.4 percent at end-November 2009 compared with rates around 3 percent
 before the crisis. As o f end-2009, a gradual recovery i s reported in the loan portfolio, with slight
 reductions in N P L ratios.

 29.    External pressures have been alleviated in the short term by the economic slowdown
 combined w i t h lower oil prices. Although financing requirements remain from the external
 refinancing needs o f Turkish firms and banks, external sustainability concerns have diminished
 as the C A D has fallen, with lower growth and cheaper energy imports. The 2009 C A D i s

                                                     11
projected to be approximately 1.8 percent o f GDP (Table 3). For the medium term. the C A D i s
forecast to remain in the range o f 2-4 percent o f GDP. Although the external accounts remain
sensitive to oil prices, this i s not expected to create significant external vulnerability in the
medium term (see "External Debt Sustainability and Financing Sources").

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

30.     The current account and inflation persistence have now diminished in immediate
importance while the fiscal challenge has increased. Turkey's CADS are not expected to
return to pre-crisis levels in the medium term, although higher oil prices could s t i l l pose a
challenge. Inflation persistence appears to have receded, with inflation for 2009 below its .target.
The monetary framework has not been altered and w i l l continue to pursue unchanged inflation
targets (6.5 percent in 2010 and 5.5 percent in 201 l), line with the framework in place since
                                                       in
2006. On the other hand, higher debts and deficits as a result o f the global crisis have sharpened
the challenge to fiscal management and underlined the central importance o f the MTP and annual
budgets.

31.     Global conditions are now more favorable. Since early 2009, the global environment
for emerging markets has improved considerably. The Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI-t),
one measure o f risk aversion towards this asset class, fell from a post-crisis high o f 865 basis
points on October 24, 2008, to 274 basis points at end-December 2009 (Figure 60. Turkey's own
EMBI+ spread has slightly outperformed the aggregate index, falling from its own post-crisis
high o f 889 basis points (October       Figure 8: Confidence Indices and Capacity Utilization Rate (CUR)
27, 2008) to 197 basis points at

quarter o f 2009 (Figure 8). Capacity utilization has risen from a low o f 61.4 percenr in January
2009 to 67.6 percent in December. International Finance Corporation (IFC) clients confirm this
picture: investment and business development plans remain in place even if delayed, access to
finance, both domestic and external, i s not generally viewed as the binding constraint, and order
books are fuller relative to the trough experienced in early 2009.



" Improved prospects were reflected by a two notch upgrade by Fitch Ratings on December 3,2009 (to BB+ from
BB-), citing "Turkey's relative resilience to the severe stress test o f the global financial crisis and some easing in
prior acute constraints related to inflation, external finances and political risk." Moody's (to Ba2 from Ba3, January
8,2010) and JCR (to BB from BB-, February 1, 2010) also upgraded Turkish sovereign debt subsequently. Most
recently, on February 19, 2010, Standard and Poor's upgraded Turkey's long-term credit rating from BB- to BB,
maintaining a positive outlook.

                                                                12
    33.     Consumption i s expected to lead the recovery in GDP growth; exports will take
    longer. Fixed capital formation fell by 18.0 percent in the third quarter o f 2009 (y/y) whereas
    private consumption has already leveled o f f (-0.9 percent in the third quarter versus -1.5 in the
    second and -10.0 percent in the first). Weak demand for Turkish exports i s expected to improve
    only slowly. Exports have so far showed little sign o f recovery, falling by 4.6 percent in the third
    quarter (y/y). This puts limits on the pace o f expansion that can be hoped for in the recovery
    phase. Even with a resumption o f growth, unemployment i s likely to remain high as job creation
    will be likely to lag behind the recovery.

    34.     Public debt and deficits have risen as a result of the downturn. The overall public
    sector deficit i s expected to be 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2009. The primary balance i s projected at a
    2.1 percent deficit in 2009 (the first primary deficit this decade), down from a 1.7 percent surplus
    in 2008. Public debt (EU definition) i s forecast at about 47 percent o f GDP at end-2009, from
    below 40 percent at end-2007.

    35.      This deterioration embodies rising expenditures and falling revenues and GDP.
    Expenditures rose 10.9 percent in real terms in 2009 (y/y) while revenues fell by 3.4 percent in
    real terms (y/y). General government expenditure as a share o f GDP w i l l increase neady 6 points
    to 40.1 percent in 2009. The largest item has been current transfers to the social security
    institution (SSI, including for health expenditures), budgeted to rise by about 2.0 percent o f GDP
    in 2009. Personnel costs (to rise by about 0.9 percent o f GDP in 2009) and interest payments (to
'
    rise by about 0.5 percent o f GDP) are also significant contributors. General government revenues
    are expected to rise by 0.7 percent o f GDP to 33.5 percent.

    36.     Crowding out the recovery i s now a risk. Turkey's access to foreign borrowing i s
    likely to remain lower than before the crisis in the medium term, given global financial
    conditions. Quarterly growth i s expected to turn positive (y/y) in the fourth quarter o f 2009 and
    Bank staff forecast growth in 2010 to be 3.5 percent, through gradual recovery and base year
    effects. High government financing needs in 20 10 could therefore crowd out private borrowers
    from domestic credit markets and stifle this recovery. The risk o f such crowding out underlines
    the importance o f fiscal adjustment.

    The Medium Term Program (MTP)

    37.   The M T P i s central to the transition from crisis management to renewed growth. On
    September 16, 2009, the Government announced the MTP, followed on September 18 by the
    more detailed Medium-Term Fiscal Plan. The MTP gives aggregate targets for the period 20 10-
    12 and the 2010 budget must be consistent with it. The 2010 Budget passed by pliiliament on
    December 25,2009, i s consistent with the MTP.

    38.     The 2010-12 M T P uses realistic macroeconomic assumptions based on a gradual
    recovery. Growth i s projected to recover to 3.5 percent in 2010, 4.0 percent in 201 1, and 5.0
    percent in 2012. These growth assumptions are i n line with forecast projections constructed by
    bank staff and discussed with the Turkish authorities. The growth process assumed in the MTP
    and underpinned by the reform program relies on a combination o f slowly recovering exports
    and private-sector led domestic demand and i s predicated on lower capital inflows. Growth in the
    range o f 3-4 percent in 201 1 i s below most estimates o f growth potential for Turkey, implying

                                                     13
that the MTP conservatively assumes a return to levels close to potential growth as o f 2012.
Projected export growth i s modest throughout the period, in the range o f 10 percent, less than
half its growth rate in 2004-08. Over 2004-09 the real effective exchange rate (REER, Figure 6c)
has appreciated by only about 3 percent per year on average and with the continuation o f the
inflation targeting regime and declining expected inflation (to 4.8 percent in 2012) the program
assumes an approximately stable path for the REER. The return o f private sector investment                           '


growth to 8 percent in 2010 and 10 percent in 201 1 will be - to an even greater extent than
recently - domestically financed. Private-sector external rollover (Table 6) i s assumed by World
Bank to remain below 100 percent in 20 10 and to return to only slightly positive net borrowing
in2011.

39.     The MTP assumes only a gradual improvement in public sector balances. The MTP
projects a shift from a 2.1 percent primary deficit i n 2009 to a 1.0 percent surplus in 2012. Half
the adjustment occurs in 2010, with a reduction o f the deficit to 0.3 percent. More ambitious
fiscal adjustment may not have been credible given the role o f automatic stabilizers and fiscal
pressure from social security and health expenditures. The underlying policy measures are not
discussed in detail in the MTP documents themselves but have been discussed with executing
agencies as well as with bank staff, with the critical areas being health, social security, and
revenue mobilization (including measures at central and local levels). The introduction o f a fiscal
rule in 201 1 should provide an anchor for this adjustment process.

40.     Improvement in the primary balance in 2010 i s driven by the revenue side. General
government revenues increase by 2.1 percent o f GDP in 20 10 while expenditures remain roughly
constant as a share o f GDP. The Government attributes about 8 percentage points o f the rise in
tax revenue to nominal GDP growth and the remaining 10 points to policy changes.12 The latter
include the removal o f special consumption tax (SCT) and V A T cuts in September 2009 (TL 3.0
billion) and petroleum and tobacco VATISCT increases (TL 6.4 billion). Other measures include
a V A T hike on luxury restaurants; the introduction o f fees for imported mobile phones; increased
fees for driving license, identity card, and passports; and increased highway toll^.'^

41.     Expenditure measures account for nearly all the planned adjustment in 2011 and
2012. Over the MTP period (2010-12) the MTP plans a total (cumulative) adjustment to central
government primary spending o f 1.3 percentage points o f GDP (Table 4). The main sources o f
this adjustment are health expenditures (0.4 percent), current transfers to the S S I (0.3 percent),
and public investments (0.3 percent). An important assumption i s also that personnel
expenditures fall slightly over the period, which will require moderate pay increases for public
sector workers. Key reforms to underpin this adjustment are global budgets in health and
measures to increase the contribution o f beneficiaries to health services. The MTP i s
conservative about assumptions regarding the effect o f the health system copayments, assuming
only the estimated revenue effects and making no assumptions about the demand shift effect on




l 2 World Bank analysis suggests the elasticity o f tax income to GDP i s almost unity, leading to conclusions very
similar to those o f the government reported here.
l 3 Most measures are already enacted; the lump-sum taxes on petroleum, cigarettes, and alcohol require approval by
the Council o f Ministers.

42.    The Program assumes increasing some own-revenue mobilization by local
government. The M T P projects a 0.55 percent o f GDP adjustment in local administration'
balances over 2008-12, moving to a fiscal deficit o f 0.3 percent o f GDP in 2012 from 0.6 percent
o f GDP in 2008. This adjustment comes mainly from the revenue side (0.3 percent o f GDP). A
new municipal revenue law i s expected to increase municipal own revenues. A slight
improvement in local administration utilities' revenues i s also projected. In addition, the Program
estimates a 0.1 percent o f GDP reduction on the expenditure side.

43.    The Program assumes a slow but steady flow o f privatization revenues. These are
projected to be TL 10.4 billion in 2010, TL 9.4 billion in 201 1, and TL 8.9 billion in 2012.
Foreign investor interest in Turkey, particularly in i t s energy sector, remains high. The M T P
assumes half o f these privatization proceeds in i t s projections for public debt.

44.      The Government has announced its intention to apply a fiscal rule to set overall
deficit targets from the 2011 budget onwards. The rule will improve medium term planning
and will also serve as a legal signaling device to markets about the rationale for the targets set
and the robustness o f the forecast trajectory for public debt, spending, and taxation. The
Government has engaged in broad consultations, has undertaken a thorough review o f
international experience, and i s considering the details o f design options. The parametric and
institutional details o f the rule are expected to be determined before the 2011 budget process.
The rule i s likely to set the EU-defined deficit (including local government but excluding public
enterprises) and to allow for adjustment over the cycle to promote counter-cyclical fiscal policy.

l4 The Government i s conducting an ongoing sector review o f public expenditures with technical inputs from the
World Bank within the framework o f the Programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PPER).

45.      Overall, the government's economic framework for 2010-12 represents an
appropriate balance between ambition and realism. The measures underpinning fiscal
performance will present challenges, against a backdrop o f high unemployment and political
factors. More ambitious targets could thus have been perceived as less credible. The proposed
DPL series supports key fiscal measures that underpin the achievement o f the MTP. Most
important among these are reforms to the health and social security system to limit the burden o f
the combined deficit and the planned implementation o f the fiscal rule from 201 1.

46.     The projections in the M T P have so far been validated by recent economic
developments and a recently announced ad-hoc increase in pensions will be fully financed
within M T P targets. The central government overall deficit for 2009, assumed to be TL 62.8
billion in the MTP (6.6 percent o f GDP), was TL 52.2 billion (5.5 percent o f GDP). Similarly,
the out-turn for the IMF-defined central government primary deficit was TL 6.5 billion better
than expected in the MTP (1 - 5 percent o f GDP versus an expected 2.2 percent). The main reason
was central government revenues, which outperformed the MTP target by TL 1 1.1 billion. In
early 2010, legislation was passed to increase pensions (excluding civil service retirees) by a flat
TL60 per month in all cases where this exceeds the CPI-linked increase mandated by law? The
cost o f this measure will be about 0.3 percent o f GDP and this i s largely covered by
compensating measures already taken, including higher than assumed increases to consum tion
taxes and the social security revenue effects o f a higher than assumed minimum wage rise."The
law leaves unaffected the provisions o f Law No. 55 10, the implementation o f which i s included
in the REGE-DPL. Nonetheless, it introduces a discretionary element to decisions designed to be
formula-driven and further compresses
pension benefits, with potential adverse
effects on incentives to contribute.

an "interest rate" shock that applies a one S shock to the real interest rate in 20 10-11 interrupts
the declining trend in debt-to-GDP, as public debt reaches 53 percent o f GDP in 2011 and
gradually declines to 50 percent by 2013. Finally, a "combined shock" simulates an unchanged
fiscal stance going forward by assuming that the 2009 primary balance remains the case in 20 10-
1 1, along with a permanent 15 percent nominal depreciation and one-half SD adverse shocks to
the real interest rate and growth for 20 10-1 1. Under this combined-shock public debt peaks at 56
percent o f GDP in 20 1 1 before falling back below 52 percent by 20 13. The full description o f the
stress tests i s given in Table 5.

48.      The rise in debt ratios underlines the importance o f the proposed measures
underpinning Turkey's fiscal readjustment, as well as the return to growth. Turkey has a
strong track record in public debt management, mitigating some o f the macroeconomic risk to
debt sustainability. The measures in the MTP should allow Turkey to reproduce this track record
during the recovery. I t should be underlined that the scenarios used for this debt sustainability
analysis are fairly negative and that even under these scenarios the debt ratio remains at levels
below, say, the EU Maastricht criterion o f 60 percent." Moreover, ,Turkey has a track record in
2002-08 o f bringing down its public debt through appropriate fiscal policy and strong debt
management techniques when required.

External Debt Sustainability and Financing Sources

49.      The economic slowdown has removed the main source o f pressure on Turkey's
external debt dynamics in recent years, the CAD. The gradual economic recovery assumed in
the MTP and the associated external financing assumptions pose no threat o f a rapid escalation
o f public or private external debt in the near future.

50.     Public external debt i s low and i s expected to remain so. Since the 2001 crisis the
Undersecretariat of Treasury has pursued a conservative strategy o f financing itself largely using
domestic currency debt instruments, removing much o f the FX risk from the public debt
portfolio. The Undersecretariat o f Treasury reports that in 2001 a 5 percent real depreciation
would have added 2.2 points to the public debt-to-GDP ratio; in 2008 this sensitivity was only
0.8 points. Other market risk has likewise diminished.


'* Note: The Maastricht ratio applies to EU-defined debt whereas the reported simulations use gross public debt
                                                        17
51.     Only under a scenario o f continued low growth, weak Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), and real depreciation would private-sector external debt increase significantly. After
declining in 2001-05, external debt-to-GDP increased by more than 4 percentage points in 2006,
driven by corporate external borrowing. External debt-to-GDP stood at 37.5 percent at end-2008.
Under the assumptions o f the MTP, simulations show that this ratio will increase to 45 percent in
2009, mainly due to the decline in GDP. Figure 10 illustrates two alternative scenarios with
higher external debt outcomes. A n "accelerated recovery" scenario assumes a one percent
increase in growth over the MTP, but with higher CADs only partly covered by FDI. Under this
scenario, external debt peaks at 47.5 percent o f GDP in 201 1. A "headwind" scenario i s more
adverse, with lower GDP growth (1 S lower over 2010-12), smaller CADs, USD 4 billion

lower FDI in 2010-12, and a one-off 15 percent nominal depreciation in 2010. Under this
scenario, external debt climbs above 50 percent in 2010 and remains roughly flat thereafter.
These s t i l l do not represent unsustainable levels o f external debt. Nonetheless, economic policy -

overall need for foreign financing in               Headwind
2009, while at the same time most
large corporations have either retained market access or been able to draw on their own FX
holdings.

53.     Turkey's foreign financing needs have fallen but will remain high in 2010-12. The
C A D contracted from USD 41.9 billion in 2008 to USD 13.9 billion in 2009. A sharp contraction
in investment has cut the demand for medium- and long-term (MLT) borrowing by the private
sector, which has been reflected in lower rollover ratios. Repayments are also lower beyond
2010. CAD projections in the MTP rise from USD 1 1 billion i n 2009 to USD 28 billion by
20 12.19

54.    On the financing side, Bank projections assume a moderate rise in capital inflows
consistent with a slow global recovery. Turkey should be in a position to attract further F D I
given privatization efforts and the potential for mergers and acquisitions: baseline net F D I
inflows rise from USD 6 billion in 2009 to USD13 billion in 2012. Similarly, net portfolio flows
are assumed to be positive, consistent with a storyline o f continued Eurobond issuance and the
potential o f the domestic capital market to raise financing.




 l 9 IMF (World Economic Outlook) projections are similar, with a sharper rise in 2010 followed by a slower increase
thereafter (USD 11.1 billion in 2009, USD 21.6 billion in 2010, USD 25.5 billion in 201 1, USD 26 billion in 2012).

55.   Overall, there i s a high probability that external financing will be available to
support the MTP. The base scenario below (Table 6), based on the M T P plus certain
assumptions, assumes a gradual improvement in rollover ratios o f banks and corporations' MLT
debt from 72 percent in 2009 to 130 percent in 2012 (compared with pre-crisis rollover ratios
above 200 percent). Together with public external debt rollover, this assumption results in a
small projected international reserve accumulation over the period. Lower rollover ratios o f the
order o f 90 percent to 100 percent in 201 1 and 2012 would lead to only small declines in
reserves. Higher o i l prices than assumed here also pose additional external financing risk.20

operation. Turkey also produces annual E U Pre-Accession Economic Programs that detail short-
and medium-term policy actions and structural reform priorities related to EU accession. Turkey
has moved to medium-term budgeting since 2006, and the fifth Medium-Term Fiscal Plan
covering the period o f 20 10-20 12 was issued i n the Official Gazette dated September 18,2009.

57.    The proposed program supports four out of five o f the development axes of the
Plan. The Ninth Development Plan`s vision i s "a Turkey which grows in stability, shares her
income more equitably, i s competitive at a global scale, transforms into an information society
and has completed the stage o f legal harmonization for EU membership". To pursue this vision,
the Ninth Development Plan comprises five "development axes" or strategic areas o f action,
namely: (a) Enhancing Competitiveness, (b) Fostering Employment, (c) Strengthening Human
Development and Social Solidarity, (d) Ensuring Regional Development and (e) Increasing
Quality and Efficiency in Public Services. The proposed program i s thus strongly aligned with
the new strategic objectives o f the government; supporting selectively key elements o f (a), (b),
(c) and (e). These program areas were chosen in view o f their importance, the quality o f the       .'
economic and sector work (ESW) on the subjects conducted jointly by government and the
Bank, and their strong relationship to the CPS objectives.

58.     The 2010-12 M T P mirrors these development axes. "Strengthening Human
Development and Social Solidarity" includes reforms in health and social security that anchor
fiscal stabilization, in addition to education and vocational training measures important for
equitable growth. "Enhancing Competitiveness" includes the continuation o f business climate
reforms. "Fostering Employment" includes labor reforms to increase employment flexibility.
"Increasing Quality and Efficiency in Public Services" incorporates Turkey's agenda o f PFM
reforms. The details o f the main areas supported by the proposed loan series are discussed below.

Fiscal Adjustment, Growth and Employment under the Medium Term Program (MTP)

59.     The M T P attempts to address Turkey's main growth constraints in the post-crisis
global economy: limited financing (domestic and international) for investment;
productivity and export competitiveness; and labor skills. The key to maximizing financing
for private-sector led growth i s fiscal adjustment to free up domestic savings for private
investment. As discussed earlier, Turkey's medium-term growth strategy will continue to focus
on trade and financial integration with the EU and an increasingly diversified set o f other
partners, for which the business climate reforms are central. Vocational training and labor-
market reforms are steps on the path to making Turkey's labor market more competitive. Finally,
universal health service provision, sustainable social security, and measures to broaden pre-
school and basic education are the keys to making this growth process equitable in the long run.

Health and Social Security

60.     Secondary legislation has been issued to continue the implementation o f the social
security and UHI reform passed in 2008. The reform law had been enacted after being
published in the Official Gazette on 16 June 2006 but the Constitutional Court then cancelled
many provisions o f this law shortly before it took effect. Necessary modifications then having
been made in M a y 2008, most provisions o f the law had taken effect by October 1 , 2008. A
significant part o f the secondary legislation required for the enforcement o f this law (No. 5510)
has since been issued.

61.    T h e merger o f separate SSK (Social Security Institution for Workers in the Old
System), B a g - K u r (BK) and E m e k l i Sandigi (ES) databases and the conversion o f
remaining manual records into electronic form are key next steps o f SSI reform. Important
progress has been made unifying SSK, BK and ES institutions under the single umbrella o f SSI,
including the merger o f departments with parallel functions and the integration o f staff. All staff
members now work under the same institutional structure, with unified human resource
management. Given that around 25 percent o f active members have records spanning multiple
databases and about 20 percent o f records are still in manual format, completion o f this project
would increase efficiency significantly, allowing more in-depth analysis and one-point access at
local S S I offices. All S S I departments are also developing strategic plans for further
modernization, to be implemented in 2010. S S I monitoring and data analysis are also being
upgraded. By end 2009, 80 percent o f the content o f the S S I Monthly Statistical Bulletin i s to
have been revised.

62.     T h e depth o f the recession has posed a fiscal challenge to the social security system.
Until the recession, S S I expenditures and revenues had grown roughly in line with the number o f
beneficiaries and active contributors (Figure 1 1; Annex 6). The M T P estimates a 1.6 percent o f
GDP deterioration in the social security and UHI combined deficit (total transfer from the budget
plus state contribution) in 2009 from 2.9 percent in 2008 to 4.5 percent in 2009 (Table 7). This
deterioration comes mainly from the expenditure side. A 1.4 percent o f GDP increase in
expenditures is expected to be driven mainly by a 0.9 percent increase in pension payments (with
the remainder coming from a 0.4 percent o f GDP increase in health expenditures). Revenues
decline only slightly as a share o f GDP. The explanation for this pattern i s that nominal

64.     Measures to date to contain health expenditures have had mixed results. In 2006,
SSI introduced "bundled" pricing for outpatient visits to control excessive itemized billing in an
open fee-for-service environment. However, this measure did not adequately control volume; i t
therefore did not have major impact on health expenditures. In 2007, S S I implemented a fixed
global budget for all Ministry o f Health (MOH) hospitals; to date the cap has been successful at
containing further spending growth in these hospitals. Since 2007, S S I has unified the claims
management system and all hospitals report through SSI's claims system Medical Messenger
(MEDULA). The MEDULA system can verify claims and reduce fraud, increasing efficiency.
Measures to control pharmaceutical expenditures are focusing on reducing prices. These have
had an impact, with pharmaceutical expenditures declining as a percentage o f SSI health
expenditures, although at 40 percent these remain high compared with other Middle Income
Countries (MIC). The main cause o f high pharmaceutical expenditures i s the high volume o f
prescriptions, with the consumption o f antibiotics a particular problem.

65.         Expenditure measures applying to private healthcare have so far failed to rein in
costs. In July 2008, S S I introduced several measures to contain expenditures on private health
facilities: ( i ) private hospitals could charge a maximum o f 30 percent above the price charged by
SSI, ( i i ) a co-payment o f TL 10 was introduced for outpatient visits to private health facilities,
while the commensurate amounts for university and M O H facilities was set much lower (TL 6
and TL 3, respectively), and ( i i i ) the prices o f certain high volume procedures such as cataracts
and cesarean sections were reduced. These interventions did not have much impact -
expenditures on private hospitals continue to grow. S S I had saved TL 130 million through the
co-payment measure in the first five months o f 2009, and TL 100 million through the reduction
o f prices o f cataracts and cesarean sections in the first seven months o f 2009.

                                                     22
66.       New measures to control health costs are therefore important for fiscal stabilization.
From October 2009, increased co-payments for outpatient visits apply. Rates are T L 2 for family
medicine, T L 8 for university and M O H hospitals and T L 15 for private hospitals. If no
prescription i s given, no co-payment will be required for family medicine and a TL 3 discount
w i l l apply to university, M O H and private hospitals, aiming to reduce over-prescription.
Supplementary billing caps w i l l remain in place. The reform law has also introduced a legislative
framework for global budgets, within which S S I has a right to buy health services from hospitals.
S S I has been implementing a global budget with M O H hospitals since 2007. In 2010, the
Government has also imposed spending limits for university and private hospitals.
Complementing this, copayments and price caps are designed to control the costs o f private
hospitals and pharmaceuticals. Ifspending approaches these cap, additional measures may be
introduced.

67.     A key fiscal challenge i s to strengthen health expenditure management policies. The
Government has announced two future measures: (a) global budgets for university and private
hospitals, (b) the expansion o f family medicine to all 81 provinces. The next step i s for S S I to
negotiate global budgets with all hospitals based on a defined payment methodology. Expansion
o f family medicine without further refinement o f the capitation system to emphasize cost-
effectiveness would create fiscal concerns.

68.     A further challenge i s the implementation of measures that will encourage
microeconomic efficiency among providers. This can be best achieved through appropriate
provider payment systems and applying controls to the benefits package. Measwes would
include: ( i ) rational drug guidelines implemented for all primary health care physicians including
family doctors; ( i i ) a quarterly monitoring and feedback system on prescribing practices for
primary care doctors, linked to performance-based payments; ( i i i ) a Diagnosis Related Groups
(DRG) system for acute care; ( i v ) performance monitoring and payments for university and
private hospitals; and (v) a new Hospital Union Law and M O H Restructuring Law.

Public Financial Management (PFM)

69.     Improved PFM will support fiscal adjustment and increase effectiveness and value
for money in public services. The government has a successful track record o f PFM reform but
full implementation by line agencies will take several years. Progress so far has improved the
comprehensiveness and transparency o f PFM. Turkey has transformed i t s legal, institutional and
Information Technology (IT) frameworks. Budget and accounting systems now provide a sound
infrastructure on which to base further PFM reform. The needed PFM reforms are large-scale,
covering almost the entire public sector, and complex, requiring fundamental behavioral
changes. These reforms are therefore expected to be implemented over several years and require
on-going adjustments, based on outcomes.

70.    PFM benchmarking revealed that achievements have been greater on upstream
budgeting than on downstream implementation. The Government completed a Public
Financial Management Performance (PFMP) benchmarking study (jointly with the Bank) in July




                                                23
2009, using the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) frameworkn2'Reforms
such as upgrading the legal and institutional framework, the introduction o f medium-term
planning and budgeting, new budget definitions and classification, the elimination o f off-budget
activities, and setting standards and guidelines have so far been led by central institutions. These
reforms are reflected in strong ratings. Weaknesses in downstream budget areas such as internal
control and audit systems, a complementary external audit function, and commitment monitoring
are now challenges. Ownership in the strategy development units (SDUs) o f the line agencies i s a
further critical factor for the sustainable success o f the P F M reforms.

71.      Reforms are ongoing in line with the Government's timetable. All central government
institutions and municipalities and Special Provincial Administrations (SPAS) with populations
above 50,000 - with the exception o f eleven institutions - have completed strategic plans.22
Likewise, 76 institutions completed performance programs in 2008 and 120 institutions prepared
performance programs for the 20 10 budget cycle. The MOF. revised Performance Program
(previously called Performance Budgeting) Guidelines in July 2009 and issued legislation on the
performance program in the same month. To support institutions in the preparation o f
performance programs in line with their strategic plans, the M O F has provided training events to
representatives o f 172 public institutions.

72.     Work on internal management and financial control has also progressed. The M O F
issued standards in this area in December 2007. All general government institutions have
prepared two-year internal control strategies and action plans. To develop the administrative
capacities o f SDUs, 444 financial services experts and 148 financial services experts have been
recruited. The M O F has been supporting capacity building through periodic training events
focused on the SDUs. The M O F Central Harmonization Unit prepared a "gap" analysis on
financial control supported by a twinning arrangement with the United Kingdom (UK) National
Audit Office. Based on this analysis the M O F will prepare an action plan to address the issues
identified by the analysis. 800 internal auditors have been trained, certified and appointed, with
128 new internal auditor candidates going through training. All secondary and tertiary legislation
including internal audit standards have been issued. The Internal Audit Coordination Board has
completed the Public Sector Internal Audit Strategy Paper for 2008-2010. The government has
also announced that the structure and capacity o f the Board will be strengthened. The General
Directorate o f Public Accounts (GDPA) o f the M O F has issued six public accounting standards
in conformity with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSAS). Drafts
o f two more standards have been shared with the public for comments.

73.   The government has issued consolidated central government and local
administrations financial statements on an accrual basis for 2006, 2007, and 2008.


21
   PEFA i s a partnership between the World Bank, the EC, the U-K Department for International Development, the
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the French Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, the Royal Norwegian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, and the IMF. PEFA aims to support integrated and harmonized approaches to assessment and
reform in the field of public expenditure, procurement and financial accountability. Additional information on the
PEFA methodology i s available in www.pefa.org.
22
   Preparations for eleven central government institutions are s t i l l underway and expected to be finalized soon. These
institutions are the Ministry o f Energy, Prime Ministry, Presidency, Constitutional Court, Court o f State, Turkish
International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA), Higher Education Board, State Opera and Ballet,
Bogazici University, Aksaray University, Student Selection and Placement Center (OSYM).

                                                           24
Consolidated general government financial statements are yet to be prepared because o f the lack
o f consistent data from SSI. This owes to technical issues coming from the unification o f the
three social security schemes. Once this accounting problem i s solved, the M O F will be able to
produce the consolidated financial statements for general government.

74.    There has been a significant improvement in local administrations' financial
management and fiscal transparency. In line with the Public Finance and Debt Management
Law, the PFMC Law, and the Municipality and Metropolitan Municipality Law, local
administrations are now generating financial statistics consistent with general government
standards and the Undersecretariat o f Treasury closely monitors their financial situation against
domestic and foreign borrowing limits. Recent legislation (Law No. 5779) also introduced a
mechanism to reduce municipalities' capacity to build up additional expenditure through arrears
accumulation (tax, social security, electricity, etc.) although there remain some practical issues in
implementing this automatic claw-back.

75.     A stronger Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law will be central to effective PFM
and control. Effective financial accountability requires modernization o f public audit.
Objectives are: (a) to clarify institutional responsibilities, promote audit improvements in line
with international standards and support the shift from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring;
and (b) to expand the scope o f TCA audits to cover the whole public sector. An updated draft
T C A law was submitted to the Parliament on February 1,201 0.

76.       The planned adoption o f a fiscal rule will be important to reduce economic
uncertainty. The government's stated intention i s to target the overall public sector balance as a
share o f GDP, which i s closely related to the trajectory o f public debt burden indicators. As
described above, the global financial crisis has weakened Turkey's fiscal and public debt
position. The M T P responds to these circumstances. As with any plan, implementation risks
apply to the measures underpinning performance. International experience shows that a well
designed and implemented fiscal rule can help reduce the uncertainty associated with
implementation risks and increase investor confidence. Turkey's planned introduction o f a fiscal
rule i s informed b y a review o f such international experience and o f relevant design options.

77.      The M T P contains measures to improve weaknesses defined in the PFMP study. The
M T P proposes the introduction o f the legal framework for a fiscal rule in 2010 and its
implementation with the 201 1 budget. The external audit framework will be modernized through
the new T C A Law, training activities to enhance audit capacity, and widening the mandate and
activities o f the TCA. The number o f internal auditors i s being increased (through training and
certification) while internal control systems will also be enhanced through capacity building.

78.    Further reforms are expected to be programmed in line with the findings of the
PFMP report. For example, the introduction o f a modernized public-sector commitment
monitoring system i s critical for improved transparency, by providing more thorough
information on the government's current liability and arrears.

Business Climate Reforms

79.     Business regulatory reform can mitigate the effects of the global crisis and lay the
foundations for sustainable growth and employment. Notable measures in recent years have
included ( i ) tax simplification, accompanied by a reduction o f the corporate income tax (CIT)
rate from 30 percent to 20 percent; ( i i ) streamlining o f procedures for firm start-up; ( i i i ) adoption
of. a modern F D I promotion strategy coupled with the restoration o f legal certaipty for land
ownership by foreigners; ( i v ) simplification o f customs procedures and e-transformation o f
customs offices with the introduction o f a Computerized Customs Activity System (BILGE); (iv)
strengthening the protection o f investors' and minority shareholders' rights; ( v ) reform o f
research and development (R&D) legislation aimed at increasing the private sector share o f
R&D; and (vi) first phase labor market reform geared toward lowering non-wage labor costs.
Moreover, the government has continued its privatization program, despite a difficult global
environment. In 2009, privatization revenues totaled USD 2.3 billion (compared to USD 6.3
billion in 2008), with the sale o f three regional electricity distribution companies accounting for
the bulk o f these revenues (USD 2.07 billion).

80.     The Coordination Council for the Improvement of the Investment Environment
(YOIKK) plays a key role in stimulating and coordinating regulatory reforms. YOIKK's
Steering Committee i s chaired by the Undersecretary o f the Treasury and comprises o f the
Deputy Undersecretaries o f the Prime Ministry, SPO, MOF, Ministry o f Industry and Commerce,
and Undersecretariat o f Foreign Trade, along with the Secretaries General o f the four main
Turkish business associations. In 2007, YOIKK approved an action plan with reforms in 10 key
policy areas: start-ups, labor market flexibility, licensing, land titling, taxation, customs
simplification, intellectual property, investment promotion, SME support, and corporate
governance. The plan was updated i n early 2008 and again 'in early 2009 and included FDI and
R&D as key policy areas. Key reforms already implemented i n 2009 include an amendment o f
the Customs Law to streamline and reduce the cost o f customs procedures; a simplification o f
hiringhedundancy reporting requirements; increased SME financial support through the
KOSGEB; the harmonization o f tax returns; a reduction in internet and wireless communication
taxes; and a reduction in the Resource Utilization Support Fund Tax on bank consumer loans.
The Government also introduced a new subsidy scheme for investment projects incorporating
sector and regional development priorities.

81.      An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) i s being conducted jointly by YOIKK and
the World Bank to identify constraints to productivity, innovation, trade and FDI. The ICA
should be finalized in the first quarter o f 2010. The objective i s to benchmark progress in the
business environment since the last I C A (2007) and examine issues critical for competitiveness.
The I C A w i l l be complemented by the 2008-09 Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (BEEPS). Roundtables with businesses were held in November 2009, to
understand the implementation o f regulations and give a more accurate interpretation o f survey
results.

82.    Turkey's regulatory environment for business, despite improvements, i s still seen as
a constraint for entrepreneurship. Doing Business indicators show challenges in reducing time
and procedures to close a business, employ workers, and deal with construction permits. OECD
Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators also show that Turkey lags behind OECD

                                                    26
comparators in the conduciveness o f i t s regulatory framework to competitive outcomes: Turkey
ranks only ahead o f Poland among OECD countries. Finally, BEEPS results indicate that the
`time tax' - the time spent by entrepreneurs in dealing with the requirements o f regulation -
increased three-fold in 2005-08, with senior management's time spent on dealing with
regulations reaching 27 percent. Licenses and construction permits have been identified as two
important areas for improvement.

83.     Enactment of a modernized Commercial Code remains a critical future reform. The
current Commercial Code was adopted in 1956 and has only sporadically been updated. The
draft Code, which has been under preparation for about seven years, and i s in line with the EU
Acquis, i s a major step towards better monitoring o f property rights and a simpler business
climate. Consumer protection, investors` rights, minority shareholders' rights, corporate
governance as well as electronic registry and transactions are among the topics covered b y the
Code. Nevertheless, adoption o f the Code has proven to be a challenge, mostly on account o f i t s
size (about 1,500 articles), given established parliamentary procedures.

84.     Additional outstanding investment climate reforms include: ( i ) intellectual property
rights (IPR) reform, including the Turkish Patent Authority Law, and the signing o f the
Trademark L a w and the Patent L a w Treaties, to align the IPR regulatory framework with the EU
Acquis; ( i i ) insolvency and corporate restructuring reform, including regulatory changes to
restore the balance between preserving company value and protecting lenders' rights.

85.    The Government's agenda to strengthen financial intermediation includes the
Capital Market Law. The C M B i s planning to send a new Capital Market L a w to the Prime
Ministry by end-2010 that i s expected to help promote the orderly growth o f capital markets. The
L a w will reflect the results o f a twinning project with the German financial regulator, on
harmonizing regulations with the EU Acquis on capital markets. Given delays in the adoption o f
the Commercial Code, the C M B i s also exploring alternatives for a streamlined Capital Market
Law, which would grant it regulatory powers not specifically linked to the Commercial Code.

86.      A further law covering leasing, factoring and financing companies has been drafted.
The draft law (prepared by the BRSA) i s currently before parliament. I t makes necessary
amendments to existing regulation o f these institutions to meet new needs in the sector:
strengthening the regulatory framework for the establishment, operation, and management o f
institutions, enhancing financial reporting supervision and monitoring, and updating
administrative fines and offences. I t i s envisaged that all these institutions will be subject to
common regulation. Leasing, Factoring and Financing Company Associations are to be
established o f which membership will be obligatory. A Central Invoice Registry System i s also
to be established b y the Factoring Association to document factoring transactions.

 87.    The recently published Judicial Reform Strategy and Action Plan, as part o f their
far-reaching scope, outline a further reform agenda important for the business climate. The
judicial system provides a backdrop against which Turkish businesses and foreign f i r m s
operating in Turkey must make investment decisions and enter contracts. According to the 2008

was a slight worsening from 2005 BEEPS results. In addition, 75 percent o f firms found the
courts to be         These results correspond to a broader 2007 survey o f Turkish citizens which
found that less than 50 percent were satisfied with Turkish courts, with the most negative views
held about speed o f pro~essing.~' Judicial Reform Strategy, endorsed by the Council o f
                                     The
Ministers, gives a thorough listing o f the issues facing the Turkish judiciary and judicial system.
The Strategy gives a diagnostic consistent with the EC's 2009 Progress Report (and also with the
Bank's own assessment in analytical work still underway). Development o f the Strategy
responds to EC concerns and forms part o f Turkey's efforts on Chapter 23 o f the Acquis
Communautaire (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights).

 88.    The Judicial Reform Strategy emphasizes the judiciary's independence,
impartiality, efficiency and professionalism, in addition to raising access to justice and
alternative dispute resolution. The strategy tackles some o f the most difficult issues facing
judiciaries in emerging market countries, including ( i ) striking the right balance between judicial
independence and accountability; ( i i ) judicial corruption; ( i i i ) making the best use o f automation
for both efficiency and transparency; and (iv) identifying ways to improve public confidence in
justice institutions. The Strategy makes proposals in several areas, in which the Action Plan then
provides more detailed activities, including:

     0   Creating permanent trainers to improve the Justice Academy;
         Improved evaluation, promotion and the disciplinary system for judges;
         A code o f ethics for judges and prosecutors;
         Online publication o f decisions o f the Cassation Court (Yargifay) and Council o f State
         (Danistay);
         Improved court management through professional administrative bodies and removing
         administrative responsibilities from judges;
         Legal Aid Centers to serve those that cannot afford court or attorney fees; and
     0   Online filing and access to information by non-lawyers.

89.      I n the judicial area, a revised Civil Procedure Law and a new Mediation Law
applying to civil disputes remain on the agenda o f parliament. In addition, the
implementation o f the Strategy and Action Plan will require the Ministry o f Justice to set
priorities among (and establish the costs of) a broad set o f reforms.

Labor Market Reform

90.    Even before the current recession, Turkey's labor market performance had been
disappointing. Despite six years o f sustained growth after the 2001 crisis, the employment rate
never rose above 46 percent, about 20 percentage points below the EU average. Moreover, just
under half o f those employed have been working in the informal sector. Employrncnt rates for
women and young people have been particularly low by international standards.

23 This includes those firms responding that the court system was a moderate, major or severe obstacle to their
business. The percentage increases when limited to only those firms that have used the courts.
24 These firms either tended to disagree or strongly disagreed with the statement that Turkish courts are "quick".

University Human Rights Law Research Center, 2008).

                                                          28
91.     Not surprisingly, the labor market has deteriorated significantly over the past year.
Non-agricultural unemployment peaked at 19.8 percent in February 2009, 5.6 percentage points
higher than 12 months earlier. The number o f unemployed workers registered with ISKUR has
doubled in the past year. The crisis has disproportionately affected youth and the less educated
and job losses have been concentrated in industry and construction. The resumption o f job
creation typically lags behind economic recoveries; it i s thus to be expected that the sluggish
labor market w i l l persist even after the economy starts to expand. More recently, employment
figures suggest a gradual recovery: in October 2009, non-agricultural employment was 1 56,000
more than a year earlier, while the unemployment rate was 1.8 percentage points higher.

92.     First stage labor-market reform has focused on measures to reduce non-wage labor
costs and raise skills. The Government's program focuses on three goals: reducing non-wage
labor costs, raising skills, and making the labor market more flexible while improving worker
protection. The third objective - labor market flexibility and worker protection - has been
pushed back by the onset o f the crisis: understandably, the priority in 2009 has been mitigating
the negative consequences o f the recession in the labor market.

93.     Flexibility can be combined with worker protection. Key future actions w i l l involve
reforming the regulatory framework to make the labor market more flexible (and thus more
conducive to job creation) while continuing to strengthen the tools available to workers to adjust
to change. The flexibility measures are important since Turkey currently has one o f the most
rigid employment protection regimes in the OECD.

94.     Priorities for reforming employment protection rules include increasing the scope
for flexible contracting and changing the rules regarding severance pay. Flexible contracting
includes fixed-term contracts, temporary work, and part-time work. Turkey's current regulations
regarding the first two are out o f line with OECD norms. I n terms o f fixed-term contracts,
removing the current restrictions on when these contracts are allowed and on the number o f
possible renewals would make Turkey's rules more similar to those in other countries.
Temporary work currently only occurs based on transfers to similar employment within the same
holding company or group o f companies and with the written consent o f the worker. Concerns
about easing these restrictions on fixed-term and temporary work center on the fact that they
would encourage employment that was, by its very nature, non-permanent and potentially
precarious. However, the existing restrictions on these work forms create incentives for even
more precarious informal employment since there are no alternatives for flexible jobs in the
formal sector. Women and youth would especially benefit from opportunities for flexible formal
work.

95.      Private employment agencies represent one step in this direction. In June 2009, the
Government passed legislation to allow private employment agencies to facilitate temporary
work beyond the narrow rules that currently exist. However, the bill was subject to Presidential
Veto on the grounds that the version o f the law submitted did not ensure equality among
different types o f employment contracts. The Government has indicated that i t will reintroduce
legislation soon to permit private employment agencies addressing this concern.

96.    The other major area for improved employment regulation i s severance pay.
Turkey's generous severance pay rules are a disincentive to job creation and discourage

                                               29
formalization. They are widely disregarded by employers so that, outside the public sector and
large corporations, few workers actually appear to receive payments upon separation. Transitory
Article 6 o f the 2003 Labor Code (Law No. 4857) provides for the creation o f a severance
account. This would remove many o f the existing problems and be especially effective if
severance funds were integrated with UI.26

97.     The expansion o f vocational training helped the unemployed during the crisis;
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are now central to making further expansion a success.
Vocational training in Turkey i s run by a government agency - ISKUR - reporting to the
Ministry o f Labor and Social Security, which subcontracts courses through a tendering process to
both public and private providers (in 2009 about half o f providers were private). The success o f
these providers in placing trainees in employment i s one criterion used to determine provider
selection. ISKUR programs, small scale until quite recently, are being enhanced to converge with
the findings o f OECD experience in vocational training. ISKUR training programs have
expanded rapidly, from about 33,000 in 2007 to about 210,000 in 2009 (for all ALMPs). The
World Bank i s now partnering with ISKUR to help improve M&E and thereby, over time, adapt
and further increase the impact o f i t s programs.

98.      Turkey has begun to implement a competency-based qualification system. This l i n k s
curricula and qualifications in technical and vocational fields with occupational needs. The
objective i s not only to improve skills and encourage lifelong learning, but also to harmonize
qualifications in Turkey with those overseas, encouraging labor mobility. The Vocational
Qualification Authority (VQA), created in 2006, i s now accredited by the EU as the Turkey's
qualifications coordination center and i t s certificates will be recognized by the EU. Secondary
legislation and regulations are complete and staffing sufficient. Eleven "Sector Committees"
have been established and increases to this number are being studied (four committees will be
established in early 20 10). Twenty-one "Cooperation Protocols'' have been signed, developing
468 occupational standards in 13 sectors; 1 10 occupational standards were developed in 2009
alone (53 published so far in the Official Gazette) and this process continues in 2010. The
National Qualification format has also now been determined. One National Qualification has
been developed in the energy sector and certification has started with the accredited body.
Qualification development protocols have been signed in three other sectors; construction,
automotive and textile and 800 standards and qualifications for 400 occupations will be
developed b y the end o f 2013. Turkey recently announced a Lifelong Learning Strategy,
including V Q A in the associated action plan.

Education

99.    Increasing educational attainment while reducing disparities and providing quality
are key challenges for Turkey. Turkey has almost universal primary school enrollment - with
net enrollment o f 96.5 percent - but enrollment varies b y region and b y gender within certain
regions. Despite increases in recent years, enrollment rates in preschool, secondary and tertiary
education remain l o w b y international standards. Moreover, many learning outcomes are poor:
almost half o f 15 year olds in Turkey score at or below the lowest proficiency level in
mathematics, compared with about 20 percent for OECD countries.


26   This type o f integrated reform has been introduced most notably in Chile.

                                                           30
100. Improving educational outcomes in Turkey requires a comprehensive reform
package. The education debate in Turkey has turned to the issue o f education quality: how to
increase the number o f young children who enter school ready to learn, improve the quality o f
learning outcomes, and link the education system with the demands o f the labor market.

101.     Early childhood development,
including preschool education, provides
the foundation to help young children
develop      the    necessary cognitive,                0    10,000 20,000       30,000     40,000 50,000

young children i s l o w in Turkey given the
country's income level and l o w comparc to most countries (Figure 12). In addition, the
distribution o f preschool coverage i s highly inequitable, with fewer opportunities for preschool
for the children who need i t most, including those whose parents have lower levels o f education
and incomes as well as children living in less developed areas.

 102. Investing in early childhood development is therefore an important part of reforms
to improve the quality and equity of learning outcomes. Increasing preschool coverage,
particularly for disadvantaged children and their families in Turkey, would help more children to
enter school ready to learn, providing greater opportunity for the next generation to improve their
educational attainment and earnings while reducing intergenerational transmissions o f
inequities.28 In addition, expanded access to preschool would remove one o f the obstacles to
female labor force participation and could result in increased female labor force participation in
the short run with immediate growth and productivity effect^.^'

103. The Ministry o f National Education (MONE) i s working to increase preschool
enrollment with the goal o f universal preschool education f o r 5 year-olds by 2014. M O N E
has informed Governors and provincial education directorates about plans for making preschool
education universal through a circular issued in June 2009; implementation began in September
2009 with 32 pilot provinces. These provinces were selected because universal coverage could
be attained more quickly than in other provinces as they did not need any new facilities. M O N E
has hired 15,500 new preschool teachers this school year, increasing the number o f preschool
teachers b y more than 50 percent. Preschool enrollment in these provinces has increased from
804,000 at the end o f the 2008-09 school year to 900,000 in November 2009. The M O N E
Projects Coordination Center i s also working on a "Strengthening Preschool Education Project"
financed in cooperation with the EU under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)


27 MONE i s also working on an EU-funded project to improve the quality o f vocational and technical education.

disadvantaged children at day care and preschool through capacity building in MONE,
municipalities, other public institutions, and NGOs, and through the development o f community-
based models and partnerships.

Summary

104.    The Government's program, supported by the proposed operation, includes
measures to respond to the impact of the global crisis on jobs and incomes in addition to
key reforms to help restore equitable growth and employment during the exit from the
crisis. These reforms are focused on the areas o f health and social security, PFM, business
climate reforms, labor-market regulation, and education.

Participatory Processes

105. Turkey has its own participatory processes underpinning policy formulation.
Government policy in employment, fiscal adjustment, social security, investment climate
reforms, and other areas i s informed by regular consultation with stakeholders in varied forums.
Groups involved in this process include unions, employer organizations, chambers o f commerce
and industry, civil society organizations, academics, and private sector representatives. Important
consultation processes revolved around the social security reforms, to ensure full feedback from
beneficiaries. More recently, the World Bank and the Government jointly prepared Female Labor
Force Participation and Welfare Survey Studies which in addition to quantitative data included
numerous consultative meetings among stakeholders.

106. Strong working relations with civil society are an important part o f the World
Bank's partnership with Turkey. The Turkish authorities and the World Bank have engaged
intensively with civil society in the preparation and implementation o f projects such as the
Health Transition Project (HTP) and the Istanbul Municipal Services Project. Academia, think
tanks, private sector associations and businesses, as well as a wide range o f Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGO), are engaged in the analytical and policy work the Bank undertakes with
the authorities, e.g., the Middle East Technical University (METU) in joint human development
policy dialogues (including United Nations Development Program (UNDP)), in which
international experts assess social policy reforms abroad and in Turkey, and the Union o f
Chambers and Commodity Exchanges (TOBB) and TEPAV in investment climate work.

                 IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

LINK TO CPS

107. The proposed operation forms part of the CPS covering FY2008-11. `The CPS was
endorsed by the Executive Board on February 28, 2008. Its goal i s for the Bank Group to partner
Turkey in realizing the country's development vision-fast and sustained growth with equity-
through full integration with the Government's development strategy. Accordingly, the CPS i s
shaped directly by Turkey's Ninth Development Plan and by the Government Program: i t aims to
contribute to three o f the Plan's development pillars: ( i ) improved competitiveness and
employment, ( i i ) equitable human and social development, and ( i i i ) efficient provision o f high-
quality public services.

108. The CPS has just been reviewed with the government in light of the global crisis. A
CPS Progress Report, endorsed by the Executive Board on January 7, 2010, summarizes
adjustments to the CPS agreed between Turkey and the World Bank Group to reflect global
developments and evolving country priorities. The resulting program for the remainder o f the
CPS period will focus sharply on areas crucial for renewed growth: stimulating private sector,
especially Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), business and job creation; sustainable energy
and infrastructure; and human capital and social protection o f the most vulnerable groups.30The
agreed adaptation o f the CPS program includes the proposed REGE-DPL, in support o f a
program that combines the continuation o f Turkey`s fiscal and public-sector reform agenda
(supported by the earlier PPDPL 1 and PPDPL 2 operations) with the private sector development
agenda (supported by the earlier CEDPL and CEDPL 2 operations).

 109. The proposed loan amount o f USD 1.3 billion i s consistent with the CPS and the
increase agreed in the CPS Progress Report. Reflecting economic developments and evolving
priorities, the Progress Report sets out new IBRD financial commitments in FY 10 o f up to USD
3 billion, including up to USD 2 billion in DPL financing. The program focus and loan amount
o f the REGE-DPL are in line with this agreed increase, with the loan being timed to help Turkey
manage the effects o f the global crisis, and with the significance o f the completed program
actions, particularly in creating the "exit strategy" from the fiscal expansion o f 2009. As set out
in the CPS, the scale o f available Bank financing and its phasing over the CPS period are
determined by the Bank's review and approval o f each new loan commitment. This review
focuses on sound macroeconomic management, financial sector stability, and progress i n the
three CPS development areas mentioned above.

COLLABORATION W I T H THE I M F AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

110. The IMF's most recent Stand-By Arrangement for Turkey was completed
successfully in M a y 2008. Since the onset o f global financial turbulence, the Turkish authorities
have maintained an active dialogue with I M F staff.


30IBRD and IFC will accelerate financing to the private sector, especially SMEs. The updated CPS program also
envisages enhanced Bank AAA and financing for human and social development, including social and poverty
monitoring, jobs, and vocational training. Finally, as Turkey has set out to strengthen its contribution to local and
global environmental sustainability, the Government and the Bank plan to broaden the electricity DPL program to
include energy efficiency, climate change, and environmental sustainability.

                                                          33
111. The Bank and the IMF are coordinating and working together closely on Turkey. In
recent months topics on which Bank and Fund staff have collaborated include assessment o f
developments in the health and social security systems, energy pricing, and local administration
finance. Bank staff has provided the fund team with inputs in the form o f the analysis o f social
and employment impacts o f the crisis, social security actuarial analysis, health policy analysis,
and poverty simulations. I M F staff regularly share macroeconomic files and the detailed fiscal
assessments o f fund staff have informed the Bank's own views o f the new M T P . Bank and Fund
staff members in Ankara and Washington regularly discuss Turkish policy issues and the IMF
staff has been in close consultation with the Bank team in the preparation o f the present proposed
operation. There are no significant areas o f disagreement between the two institutions in their
assessment o f the broad areas o f priority for structural reforms, as well as the overall
appropriateness o f the macroeconomic framework.

 112. The World Bank also maintains close dialogue and collaboration with the EC in
Ankara and Brussels, with UNICEF and UNDP in Turkey, and with European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and European Investment Bank (EIB). The Bank
and the EC hold regular exchanges in their Ankara offices on issues such as social policies and
provide prior comments on relevant analytical work. Recent surveys into the impact o f the
economic slowdown in Turkey at the household level were conducted jointly with UNICEF (as
well as with TEPAV). The Bank and U N D P have begun working together on climate issues,
through for instance, UNDP's pilot program on the Ceyhan basin in south-central Turkey. The
Bank i s also working together with the German Development Bank, Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaujbau Bankengruppe (KfW) and U N D P in providing technical assistance to industry and
financial intermediaries for energy efficiency investments. Bank staff also holds regular
consultations with staff from EIB, which has an active portfolio in Turkey including areas o f
common interest such as energy and agriculture, and EBRD, which has recently opened an office
in Istanbul. The Undersecretariat o f Treasury plays an active role in donor coordination.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

 113. The program to be supported by the proposed REGE-DPL operation and the
planned REGE-DPL2 operation (1) continues the reform program supported by the
programmatic Public Sector DPL series; (2) incorporates key pending reforms from the
Competitiveness and Employment programmatic DPL series; and (3) includes critical
measures responding to the impact of the global financial crisis. O f the nine prior actions
included in REGE-DPL, three are included in or are closely related to the indicative triggers for
PPDPL 3; one i s closely related to key next steps for CEDPL 3; four are crisis response measures
(of which the one on vocational training i s also closely related to a trigger in the CEDPL
agenda); and one i s a new structural prior action in education. The planned REGE-DPL2 i s
expected to support a balance between the competitiveness and employment agenda foreseen b y
the government in the CEDPL series, and the public sector agenda foreseen by the government in
the PPDPL series. Within the former, the REGE-DPL retains focus on labor reforms and an
improved regulatory framework for the private sector. The latter includes important reforms
underpinning the return to sustainable public-sector balances under the new Medium-Term
Fiscal Plan, especially in social security and health.



                                               34
114. Table 8 summarizes how the REGE-DPL and the planned REGE-DPL2 relate to the
past PPDPL and CEDPL series. This reflects progress to date on the Government's public
sector and competitiveness and employment agendas, respectively. The Government has pressed
on with reforms under the PPDPL umbrella. The CEDPL agenda, in contrast, slowed as
legislative activity had to focus on protecting workers and firms from the worst effects o f the
global crisis. The REGE-DPL series formally continues the PPDPL series while the CEDPL
series implementation will formally complete and be subject to review by an ICR. See Annex 5
for fuller explanations o f the relationship between the two prior series and the proposed program,
including the results frameworks o f the operations.

 115. REGE-DPL complements related investment lending. In health and social protection,
the Health and Social Security Adaptable Program Loans support investments in the family
health system and technical and administrative improvements in SSI, important components o f
Turkey's model for financially sustainable, universal access to healthcare and social security. In
private-sector development, the policy measures supported by the proposed program
complement the Bank's lending to SMEs and exporters through its credit line f a c i l i t i e ~ . ~ '

116. The proposed program i s complemented by a second proposed programmatic series
o f DPLs focusing on energy and environmentally sustainable development. This operation
would grow out o f and broaden the reform areas supported under the Programmatic Electricity
Sector Development Policy Loan (PEDPL). The first loan in this series was approved by the
Board on June 11, 2009.32

REGE-DPL rogram reflects lessons from the recent 1993-2004 Country Assistance Evaluation
for Turkey, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY04-FY07 Completion Report,34as well
as the recent review o f World Bank ~ o n d i t i o n a l i t y Conclusions o f these reports include the
                                                                .~~
importance o f full ownership by government as well as full integration into a government reform
program.

118. The CAS Completion Report recommended that the Bank Group's future assistance
program should envisage greater support for private sector development. The current and
planned future operation are at the heart o f the Bank's strategy for Turkey in that respect,
including a comprehensive package o f reforms targeting an improved competitiveness
environment for f i r m s . I t also supports labor market reforms intended to increase labor force
participation rates for women and youth which, according to the Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment carried out for CEDPL 2, would particularly benefit poorer households. The
Completion Report also singles out the importance o f combining high quality analytical work
with policy-based lending. The proposed operation rests on a large volume o f high-quality
analysis, carried out by bank staff in partnership with government organizations, as well as by
other institutions (see Analytical Underpinnings below).

119. The design o f the proposed program reflects the experience in Turkey that the
government's reform agenda i s best supported through programmatic series o f two o r
more operations. Indicative triggers for the future operation reflect the government's own
reform priorities as discussed in the Development Plan, the MTP, and in many cases legislation
either before parliament or under preparation by the relevant ministries. The government has
consistently expressed its preference for programmatic lending encompassing the broad array o f
reform areas that the authorities are pursuing. Finally, an important feature o f such lending i s the
appropriate flexibility in defining indicative triggers for the next operation. While the
government has a well-defined set o f planned actions and planned timing, the actual feasibility o f
each reform step in a given period depends on many factors outside the government's control.
Past experience, in particular with the CEDPL series, points to the importance of balancing
ambition and realism in follow-up triggers. The lesson o f the PPDPL series (which built on the
earlier three-loan Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan series spanning
2001-04) i s that prolonged engagement in Turkey, maintaining commitment to key reform areas,
delivers results over time. Accordingly, the inclusion o f ambitious and complex reforms
(especially in the business climate and labor market areas) in the program expected to be
supported by the follow-up REGE-DPL2 reflects strong Government ownership o f these reforms
and the common view o f the authorities and the Bank on their importance.

120. A further lesson from programmatic lending to Turkey i s the importance o f
continuity in program design, mirroring the government's rolling MTP. The Bank supports
the government's own rolling program and thus mirrors the continuity o f this plan in DPL

programmatic approach. Consistently pursuing pending reforms over many years has proven
critical in several key areas, such as social security reform, disaster management, and energy.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

121. I n its 2008 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM),36 the World Bank, in
partnership with the Undersecretariat o f Treasury completed a wide-ranging assessment o f
the challenges to sustaining Turkey's high rates o f growth since 2002. Key areas emphasized
in that study were structural fiscal reforms, PFM, investment climate reforms, and employment
regulations. The study reaches conclusions that are consonant with other international studies o f
the Turkish economy, notably the annual progress report o f the EC and the 2008 country survey
carried out by the OECD.

122. The PFM agenda supported by the proposed operation is the subject o f ongoing
programmatic ESW. In collaboration with the steering committee o f the PPER, a World Bank
team recently completed (June 2009) the PFMP benchmarking exercise, based on the PEFA
methodology. The benchmarking found a high level o f performance in central, "upstream" PFM
functions with room to enhance impact in decentralized and "downstream" functions, for
example including line agency audit and control functions. The next stage o f this work involves
detailed expenditures reviews by sector, subject to agreement with the Steering Committee at
each stage.

 123. Ongoing work with YOIKK and several studies o f the business environment have
contributed to the policies supported by the proposed operation. Recommendations for
improvements in the investment climate are grounded in recent ICAs (2007 and f~rthcoming),~'
"Doing Business" surveys,38 and BEEPS. A recent study o f innovation policy in Turkey
underpins parts o f the investment climate analysis. A financial sector assessment was completed
in September 2007.39

 124. I n the area o f employment and labor-market regulations, the Turkey Labor Market
Study was published in 2006.40In addition, the 2009 CEM focuses on informal ernpl~yment.~'
These studies have developed detailed strategic recommendations for possible approaches to
labor market reforms and other policy areas affecting informality such as taxation and business
regulations. Social issues relating to education, labor markets, and social programs are analyzed
in two further recent studies: "Turkey: Equality o f Opportunities and Early Childhood
Development" (2009) which focuses on equality o f opportunity in Turkish society today, most
importantly on the l i f e chances o f today's children, and "Female Labor Force Participation in
Turkey: Trends, Determinants, and Policy Framework" (2009), which focuses on understanding

 125. Finally, the B a n k has undertaken several initiatives to assess the economic and
social impacts o f the global financial crisis. These have been largely described elsewhere in
this program document. In early 2009 Bank staff held a series o f consultative meetings with
government officials to discuss the impact o f the global economic crisis, including labor-force
survey-based simulation results, and international experience in responding to it. More recently,
the Bank teamed up with TEPAV and UNICEF to field quantitative and qualitative surveys in
five urban and two rural areas on the impact o f the economic downturn on Turkish households.

           V.    THE PROPOSED "RESTORING EQUITABLE G R O W T H AND
                EMPLOYMENT" DEVELOPMENT POLICY L O A N (RFCGE-DPL)

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

126. The proposed operation supports Turkey's crisis response and the transition to a
path o f sustainable shared growth. The operation takes an integrated approach to the
transition, based on the government program embodied in the Ninth Development Plan and the
MTP, the CPS, the recent CPS Progress Report, and the extensive analytical underpinnings
described above. As in almost all countries, the crisis response led to a natural deterioration in
economic indicators. Private sector activity plummeted in late 2008 and into the first quarter o f
2009. As discussed in Section 11, public debt ratios have worsened; the budget and the combined
health and social security system face new fiscal challenges as a result o f the 2009 contraction.
Moreover, unemployment and poverty have risen. The policy response o f the government has
been in line with these challenges.

 127. The Government's crisis response combined monetary and fiscal expansion,
employment measures, and social protection; this response i s supported by the proposed
operation. REGE-DPL supports the government's crisis response packages, announced between
September 2008 and July 2009. I n late 2008, with the emphasis on protecting financial
intermediation and reassuring the system that FX liquidity would be maintained, the CBRT
announced a series o f liquidity measures in addition to traditional monetary easing. Later, as
attention shifted to the slowdown in the real economy and its employment and social
consequences, government measures shifted to fiscal expansion beyond automatic stabilizers,
through V A T cuts, active labor-market programs to protect employment and help unemployed
workers, and expanding credit to SMEs, the main source o f employment. The operation therefore
supports prior actions representing crisis response measures.

128. With the stabilization o f the Turkish economy, the proposed operation supports the
Government's focus on measures to return to fiscal balance in the medium term. The
proposed operation supports the underpinnings o f the government's MTP, the key to this
transition. Foremost among these are global health budgeting measures and spending limits to
rein in health spending and measures to curtail demand for more costly private health care. Also
important i s the continued implementation o f the social security reform passed in 2008, key to
maintaining long-term fiscal balance and thus confidence in the economy, and administrative
reforms to social security. Third, public financial measures aim to improve fiscal c,ontrol and
transparency.

129. The proposed program includes further planned actions to attain fiscal equilibrium
through a targeted adjustment over a medium-term horizon. The proposed program supports
the extension of this fiscal adjustment agenda into next year and beyond. A second operation in
the series would support planned measures i n economic management and PFM such as the
adoption o f a fiscal rule (planned from 201 1) and a law currently in parliament governing the
TCA. In health, future cost-containment measures will be needed, most importantly the
extension o f global budgets to university and private hospitals. Future technical and
administrative reforms in the social security system will also help to contain the overall deficit o f
this system, financed from the general government budget.

                                                 40
130. As growth returns, the measures supported by the proposed operation aim to build
s k i l l s and improve the investment climate, fostering equitable growth. The REGE-DPL
supports the Government's agenda in the areas o f labor markets, education, and the investment
climate. The shift from the protection o f jobs to the protection o f workers i s a key challenge to
increase j o b creation. Education - particularly early-childhood interventions, preventing
dropouts later, and vocational training - remains the long term key to improving labor
productivity and to making growth reach the least well-off. And key constraining factors in the
investment climate are "time taxes" (particularly destructive as they generate no corresponding
revenue to the government) and access to finance.

 13 1. The planned follow-up REGE-DPL2 operation would support key reforms
continuing the Government's equitable growth and employment agenda. Pre-school access
i s planned to expand to 13 new provinces per year (to 45 by the time o f the REGE-DPL2).
MOLSS is implementing a plan to continue recent increases in vocational training delivered by
ISKUR and most importantly to improve performance monitoring and management. Further
labor market reforms are planned. Key measures for private-sector development include the new
Commercial Code (currently in parliament) and Capital Market Law.

132. Overall, the program supported by the proposed REGE-DPL series falls into two
pillars: "Fiscal Management" and "Equitable Growth and Employment."

   0   Fiscal Management includes continuing to provide inclusive social services (health and
       social security) while making these sustainable b y reining in costs.
       Also key to continuing to deliver quality public services at value for money i s the P F M
       agenda, also included under Fiscal Management.
   0   Growth and employment in 2008-09 has been protected (to some extent) by crisis
       response packages, components o f which are included under the Growth and
       Employment pillar.
   0   Structural measures under Equitable Growth and Employment include investment climate
       reform driven by the Y O I K K Technical Committee action plan, supported by the Bank,
       specifically customs streamlining and the Government's agenda to improve educational
       outcomes. Key elements o f the future agenda here are further labor-market reforms,
       vocational training, and the new commercial code, which i s currently before parliament.
   0   The legal prior actions envisaged under the proposed operation are listed below in Box 1.

133. The program supported by the proposed REGE-DPL i s expected to have positive
fiscal impact. The costs o f measures supported by the REGE-DPL are outweighed b y the fiscal
benefits o f restraining spending in the health and social security system alone. Four prior actions
have potential fiscal costs. The increase and extension o f short-time employment compensation
and the expansion o f the coverage o f ISKUR vocational training programs are estimated to have
cost about TL 400 million in 2009. All spending for the activities within the scope o f the
mentioned programs are covered by the UI fund with no further central government budget
contribution. The expansion o f preschool education in 32 provinces has an estimated cost o f
about TL 40 million in 2009 and, overall, the cost o f all these measures i s estimated at about 0.05
percent o f GDP in 2009. The short-time employment compensation measure i s scheduled to
expire at the end o f 2010 in the absence o f any extensions. For 2010, the vocational training
program will have an estimated cost o f about TL 300 million and preschool expansion will cost

                                                41
about T L 240 million. Finally, the Treasury contribution to the Credit Guarantee Fund
constitutes a contingent liability for the budget. Depending on usage and default rates, the fiscal
cost o f this measure in 2010 could be around T L 100 million. The total cost o f measures
supported under the REGE-DPL i s therefore about 0.06 percent o f GDP in 2010. By comparison,
the fiscal adjustment for the 2010- 12 period associated with central government health spending
and the combined deficit o f the health and social security system i s approximately 0.7 percent o f
GDP.

134. T h e results framework o f the operation carries forward the results frameworks o f
the PPDPL series and parts o f that o f the CEDPL series, where relevant. Several
quantifiable results indicators from PPDPL 2 and CEDPL 2 are included in REGE-DPL (see also
Annexes 2 and 5). Some indicators are added to this list, reflecting ( i ) measuring the impact o f
the government's crisis mitigation policies, ( i i ) Turkey's recent PFMP benchmarking and
planned follow-up own assessment, and ( i i i ) limited new policy areas introduced for REGE-DPL
(see Annex 5).

POLICY AREAS

PILLAR 1: Fiscal Management

l-A: Maintaining Inclusive Social Programs at Sustainable Cost

 136. Key objectives o f Turkey's fiscal reform program are to maintain universal health
coverage and to protect the long-run financial sustainability o f the health and social
security system. The social security reform has been implemented through secondary legislation
and regulation. Administrative reform has been partially completed with the staff merger o f the
three previously self-standing social security systems. Now, continued implementation o f the
social security reform combined with cost containment in the health sector are even more
pressing in the new fiscal environment.

137. The M T P pursues the agenda o f cost containment in health. S S I i s implementing a
global budget for MOH hospitals and spending limits for university and private hospitals.
Extension o f global budgets based on a defined payment methodology would further enhance
S S I capacity to manage hospital expenditures. Expansion o f family medicine without further
refinement o f the capitation system to emphasize cost-effectiveness generates fiscal
sustainability concerns for the health sector. Rational drug prescription and greater emphasis on
prevention are key areas.

138.        There are two prior actions for the proposed operation under this pillar:

       0    Implementation o f the Social Security and Universal Health Insurance Law, as enacted in
            June 2006 and amended in May 2008, including enactment o f secondary legislation; and
            the merger o f staff from the three prior systems (as stipulated by the Social Security
            Institution Law)
       0    Implementation o f global budgets for MOH, the introduction o f spending limits in
            university and private hospitals through the 2010 budget, and publication o f an S S I
            budget circular stating pharmaceutical expenditure controls.43


139.        Expected triggers for REGE-DPL2 in these areas are the following:

       0    Implementation o f the Law reforming the administrative dimensions o f social security,
            including the merging o f data and I T systems o f three social security systems
       0    Implementation o f global budgets for university and private hospitals.

In addition to administrative reform, i t i s important that the rules-based approach established in
the 2008 social security reform law i s reinforced, in particular through the absence o f any further
ad hoc pension increases. A further step to control health costs would be a reformed family
medicine capitation system, including rational drug prescription and preventive health care.

140. The impact of these reforms i s expected to be significant and measurable. The impact
o f the data merger in S S I will be felt through a new unified administrative structure and

43   See Section 111 for a fuller discussion.

                                                   43
potentially the ability to create social security "one-stop shops" at the local level. Continued
implementation o f the social security and UHI law and further cost-saving measures in health
will be measured by the combined deficit o f the social security and UHI system as a share o f
GDP, which the M T P foresees declining gradually from its. 2009 value (4.5 percent).

1-B: P u b l i c F i n a n c i a l Management (PFM)

141. I n o r d e r t o stabilize a n d s t a r t t o bring d o w n the p u b l i c debt burden, a key goal i s t o
increase value f o r money in the delivery o f p u b l i c services. To pursue this goal, upstream
reforms to central P F M functions such as strategic planning and budgeting now need to translate
into improved operational efficiency in line agencies.

 142. A k e y development in PFM has been the Government's b e n c h m a r k i n g o f i t s o w n
progress in o r d e r t o p r i o r i t i z e f u t u r e reforms. This has been undertaken with the support o f
the Bank under the PFMP benchmarking exercise and will not only facilitate priority-setting but
also allow the measurement o f future progress. There i s one prior action for the proposed
operation in this area:

       0   Revision o f the Guidelines for performance based budgeting and preparation by at least
           50 institutions o f their performance budget.44

143. T h e i m p a c t o f performance plans i s expected t o b e felt in overall i m p r o v e d p u b l i c
service delivery, value f o r money, a n d u l t i m a t e l y p u b l i c welfare across government
institutions. For the purposes o f measuring impact o f this reform, measurement o f the quality o f
P F M outcomes will be pursued through the Bank's ongoing partnership with the authorities
through the PFMP benchmarking, which will be updated at regular intervals.

144. T h e r e a r e two expected triggers f o r R E G E - D P L 2 in the PFM area, focusing o n t h e
highest i m p a c t elements o f the government's PFM agenda f o r the c o m i n g year:

       0   Enactment o f legislation o f an effective fiscal rule consistent with the concurrent Medium
           Term Plan;
       0   Enactment o f the T C A law.

145. T h e i n t r o d u c t i o n o f the planned fiscal r u l e i s expected reduce uncertainty, p r o m o t e
counter-cyclical fiscal policy, a n d strengthen the credibility o f the Government's d e b t
targets in t h e MTP. The details and precise legal status o f the fiscal rule remain to be defined. A
well-designed law would set targets for one or more key fiscal balances (e.g., overall public
sector fiscal deficit) that would be consistent with the pursuit o f M T P debt targets, within a
framework o f countercyclical taxation and spending. Key features for the effectiveness o f such a
rule are a timely and transparent framework for measuring and reporting, credible values for the
key parameters (which can be challenging if the rule covers the whole public sector), and
sensible escape clauses to deal with crises and other extreme situations. Such a law would be
welcomed by investors in Turkish assets and would, if appropriately designed, increase the
certainty surrounding macroeconomic management and thus the credibility o f economic policy.


44   "Institutions" refers to ministries, universities and government agencies.

                                                            44
Measurement o f the results o f such a rule would be through the attainment o f the debt targets set
out in the MTP in place at the time o f the design and adoption o f the rule.

146. The planned new TCA law will extend the audit mandate of TCA to the entire
public sector and enables implementation of the reforms foreseen in the PFMC.
Inconsistency between the PFMC and the current TCA laws prevents adequate functioning o f
external audit, one o f the pillars o f a modern PFM structure. In addition, the current TCA audit
function i s limited to "conformity" audit, impeding the development o f full and credible public
reporting. The draft law extends the scope o f TCA audit to include regularity, financial, and
performance audits, with less focus on the judicial function. The draft law defines audit as a
planned activity, to be carried out in accordance with the international standards. The
implementation o f this draft law will thus promote public accountability.

PILLAR 2: Equitable Growth and Employment

2-A: Employment and Social Protection during the Crisis

147. Prior actions for the REGE-DPL in this area focus on banking stability,
employment, and SME access to finance. The proposed first REGE-DPL operation focuses on
four prior actions to mitigate the effects on Turkey o f the global crisis:

         Implementation o f the CBRT blind broker function45
         Increase in short-time employment compensation (by 50 percent) and i t s extension (from
         3 to 6 months, and then to 12 months) effective until end 2010 to reduce layoffs (part o f
         the employment support packages)
         Amendment o f the Public Finance and Debt Management Law to provide authority to
         expand the CGF by T L 1 billion
         Accelerated expansion o f the coverage o f ISKUR vocational training (and trainee
         stipends), reaching 150,000 people in 2009.46

148.    Impact measures are related to the take-up o f each o f these measures during the
crisis. The blind broker facility "insured" more than USD one billion o f inter-bank FX
transactions at the height o f demand in November 2008. Take up o f short-time employment
compensation was about 40,000 workers in December 2009. Vocational training i s expected to
reach 300,000 trainees over the two years 2009-10. The CGF i s expected to increase credit
intermediation to SMEs by several billion T L from 201 0.

149. N o future crisis-related triggers are envisaged for REGE-DPL2. This reflects the
time-bound nature o f the crisis and the Government's response.




45 Blind brokerage implies the Central Bank making a market anonymously between banks who wish to demand and
supply foreign exchange on the interbank market, Le., guaranteeing to purchase from sellers and to sell to purchasers
at the market rate, in effect insuring foreign exchange default risk.
46 See Section 11 for a fuller discussion o f all these measures and section I11 for a discussion of vocational training..


                                                           45
2-B: Private-Sector Led G r o w t h and Job Creation after the Crisis

150. Job creation in the private sector depends p r i m a r i l y o n labor market r e f o r m and in
the long term o n improved matching o f worker s k i l l s w i t h labor-market needs, through
improved education and vocational training. Given the young demographic structure o f the
Turkish labor force and the need for more flexible labor regulations, these are the main priorities.
New laws currently before parliament, such as the Commercial Code and the Capital Market
Law, will also represent important strides forward in the business climate and would be
welcomed by investors.

151. There are two p r i o r actions supported by the proposed operation related t o this
long-term agenda:

     0   Amendment o f the Customs Law to streamline customs procedures (part o f YOIKK
         Technical Committee actions)
     0   Hiring o f 15,000 new preschool teachers for the 2009-10 school year and issuance o f
         MONE Circular launching universal preschool education for children 5 years o f age in 32
          province^.^'
152. Expected triggers f o r the planned R E G E - D P L 2 operation in the investment climate
area focus o n labor reform, the new Commercial Code a n d the new Capital Markets Law,
a n d the continuation o f policies to expand pre-school education and improve a n d expand
vocational training:

    0    Reform measures to increase labor market flexibility and worker protection
    0    Enactment o f the new Commercial Code
    0    Enactment o f the new Capital Market Law
    0    Establishment o f a performance-based management system for ISKUR programs and
         launch o f an evaluation o f the effectiveness o f ISKUR programs in the context o f the
         expansion o f training services
    0    Pilot implementation o f preschool education expanded to 13 additional provinces and
         progress reports completed by all 32 pilot provinces.

 153. The impact o f many measures in the REGE-DPL p r o g r a m i s difficult to measure
directly, as they are cross cutting in nature. The impact o f the streamlining o f customs can be
measured directly by the decline in the average number o f days to clear customs (15 as o f
September 2009). The impact o f labor-market reform could potentially be assessed by the
fraction o f unemployed workers covered b y UI or other safety nets. An effect o f the pew Capital
Markets L a w i s expected to be an increase in non-bank financial intermediation, such as the
value o f insurance and leasing assets as a proportion o f the financial system, which stood at 3
percent in 2007. The impact o f the preschool expansion will be measurable through preschool
enrollment rates in the pilot provinces. In addition, the expansion o f ISKUR services and
improvements to i t s monitoring and performance management system will be measurable as
increased rates and numbers o f trainees placed in lasting employment.


47 See the relevant parts of Section Ill,"Business Climate Reforms" and "Education" for a fuller discussion o f these
measures.

           richer quintiles, with much smaller informality rates, have more eligibility compared to
           average.
       0   As o f end-December 2009, the public works program had reached about 45,000
           people. Program evaluations o f similar schemes around the world show that the level o f
           wages offered in this scheme may play an important role in promoting the success o f the
           program in reaching the "unemployed poor.'' Since for legal reasons the wage for the
           program had to be set at the minimum wage, ISKUR relies on additional targeting
           measures, such as the type o f activities undertaken, as the key to optimizing i t s
           distributional impact.
       0   The largest component o f the employment package in response to the crisis i s the
           expansion in the vocational training programs. The government aims to reach 140,000
           beneficiaries through this program in 2010. The program has a potentially significant
           impact on poor household incomes both in the short-term through the daily stipend o f TL
           15 and in the medium to long term through the skills enhancement. As o f December
           2009, about 166,000 registered unemployed had enrolled.
Under conservative assumptions regarding the number o f beneficiaries and utilization o f the
above programs by the poor, the combined favorable impact on poverty i s expected to more than
fully offset the estimated negative poverty effect created b y the copayment measure.

 159. The expansion o f preschool education-an important element o f early childhood
development, supported by the proposed REGE-DPL, is also expected to be pro-poor.
Increased preschool education reduces poverty rates through a number o f channels, such as
increased educational attainment for those children receiving preschool education and increased
labor force participation o f their parents, particularly mothers. While the specific program
currently being implemented by the government (piloting o f the program in 32 provinces) i s the
initial phase o f expanding preschool education in Turkey, an illustrative simulation demonstrates
the progressive impact o f the policy. In a simulation in which the generation o f 20-39 year olds i s
assumed to have attended pre-school programs when they were six-year olds, several channels o f
influence were considered, including occupational choice, fertility effects and higher earnings
stemming from the additional educational attainment. Significant impacts are estimated, with
incomes almost 8 percent higher, poverty within the cohort 11 percent lower and the female
labor force participation rate 9 percent higher.48

160. Finally, the structural policies supported by the program are expected to promote a
sustainable higher growth path, with long-lasting impact on poverty. Many o f the policies
supported by the proposed REGE-DPL are long term measures, the implementation o f which
will not only strengthen public sector management and improve the business climate, but also
build confidence in the aftermath o f the global crisis, reinforcing the sustainability o f growth.
Although the impact o f these policies on poverty are not easy to measure, the order o f magnitude
for the reduction in the headcount poverty would be significantly higher than those resulting
from the temporary, "crisis-response" measures. The experience o f 2002-08, characterized b y
high growth, i s illustrative: the poverty rate declined from 27.0 percent to 17.1 percent.

161. M o r e detailed poverty and social impact assessment will require improvements in
Turkey's M&E capacity. The government has requested technical assistance from the World
Bank in its efforts to strengthen the M&E o f its programs. As part o f the REGE-DPL preparation
process, the Bank has delivered technical assistance on M&E to representatives o f ten
institutions. The SPO and Undersecretariat o f Treasury have emphasized the importance o f the
results agenda, and more specifically to increase M&E capacity in key line agencies. More
specifically, ISKUR has also requested the Bank's assistance in M&E o f its employment
programs (ALMPs). The merger o f data from the three social security systems, a measure
supported under the REGE-DPL, should enable improvements to the SSI's M&E capacity.
Technical assistance i s being provided to the S S I for impact evaluation o f the demand and supply
side reforms introduced this year. Finally, through the Health Transformation and Social Security
Reform Project (HTSSRP) as well as a grant from the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF),
the Bank i s supporting capacity-building o f the Turkish Institute o f Health for M&E o f the
Government's Health Transformation Program.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

162. The reforms supported by the proposed operation are not likely to cause significant
effects on the country's environment o r natural resources. The PFM reforms supported by
this operation are expected to enhance budget transparency, accountability, financial
management, and ultimately service delivery. This overall emphasis on improving governance
should improve environmental spending along with other categories.

163.    Turkey has a fairly well developed body o f environmental legislation and
institutions. In addition Turkey i s advancing the harmonization o f the national legislation with
the EU Environmental Acquis and aims to harmonize its legislation fully within the next few
years. Turkey's environmental legislation makes no distinction in the standards applied between
public and private sector activities and compliance requirements.

164. The prior actions supporting the streamlining o f customs procedures are not
expected to have any harmful impacts. The reforms supported by the operation essentially
streamline reporting and facilitate the use o f electronic forms. More specifically, customs
streamlining will not have any impact on the screening o f prohibited substances and the existing
laws covering screening s t i l l apply. In this context it i s noteworthy that several environmental
regulations and by-laws pertaining to regulating trade have been harmonized with the E U Acquis
and already entered into force: a by-law on the protection o f species o f wild fauna and flora by
                                                                   a ~
regulating trade (consistent with the CITES c ~ n v e n t i o n ) ; ~by-law concerning the import o f
skins and other products o f certain species; and the prohibition o f import o f certain wild animal
species originating from countries where their capture i s permitted. Furthermore, in early 2009
Turkey started preparation to become a party to the Rotterdam Convention regulating imports o f
dangerous chemicals and pesticides. Turkey i s also in the process o f harmonizing its legislation
on the classification, labeling and packaging o f dangerous substances under an ongoing EU
project .


49CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species o f Wild Fauna and Flora) i s an international
agreement between governments that aims to ensure that international trade in specimens o f wild animals and plants
does not threaten their survival.

                                                       50
165. The public works program i s covered by existing environmental regulations.
Turkey's environmental legislation and its law on rights to information apply to administrative
and technical measures to provide public access to all information categories, including
environmental information. This (plus existing Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
legislation) provides the framework for the screening and implementation o f projects under the
public works program introduced by the Government as a response to the effects o f the global
crisis. As in many other Bank projects, environmental impacts will be managed through existing
institutions and regulations.

166. Turkey's environmental priorities and commitments are specified in official
documents. These include Turkey's National Report ,on Sustainable Development (2002)
prepared for the Johannesburg Summit, the environmental chapter o f Turkey's National Program
for the Adoption o f the Acquis (2001), and the National Environmental Action Plan (1998).
Turkey became a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol in February 2009. A number o f sector
strategies complement these national reports, such as the Nutrient Reduction Action Plan (2002)
which focuses on efforts to reduce agricultural waste runoff to the Black Sea; the National Forest
Program (2004); and the National Strategy and Plan o f Action on Biodiversity (2001) which
outlines Turkey's commitments as a signatory to the Convention on Biodiversity. Protected Area
Management Plans have been prepared in a participatory manner for four sites with strong local
consultation on land use and zoning o f the protected areas.50

 167. The Bank and other institutions are partnering with Turkey in its efforts to improve
environmental management. A programmatic operation i s under discussion with the
authorities, supporting the integration o f sustainable development principles in sector
policies/programs and the enhancement o f energy security, following on the First Programmatic
Energy DPL approved in June 2009. Reforms under this proposed operation's environment
component aim to improve the policy and regulatory framework for protecting and improving
urban environment services and to strengthen environmental management. The EU i s also
helping build capacity for environmental regulation and management and for revising legal
instruments for nature conservation. The Turkey-EU Environment Screening process was
completed in June 2007.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

 168. The Undersecretariat o f Treasury will be responsible for coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries and agencies. A number o f other agencies are involved in
the implementation o f the public sector reform program being supported by the REGE-DPL
program including MONE, SPO, MOF, Ministry o f Justice, MOH, MOLSS, ISKUR, TCA and
SSI, BRSA, CBRT, CMB, Customs Undersecretariat, and KOSGEB.

169. As part of the REGE-DPL preparation process, the Bank has delivered technical
assistance on M&E to representatives o f nine Turkish government agencies and
parliament. SPO and Undersecretariat o f Treasury have emphasized the importance o f the
results agenda, and more specifically to increase M&E capacity i n key line agencies. A
significant part o f the Bank's dialogue with the government has been geared towards

50
     Sultansazligi, Igneada, Camili and Koprulu Canyon.

                                                          51
strengthening M&E capacity through three separate vehicles: a PPER, the Joint Portfolio
Performance Review (JPPR), and an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. Under the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) program, a two weeks hands-on training, Designing and
Implementing Sustainable Results-based M&E Systems in the Public Sector in Turkey, was
organized jointly with SPO in June, 2009. In addition, an IDF grant i s providing finance to SPO
and pilot agencies to develop an M&E framework designed to assess the results o f the National
Development Plan.

170. MOLSS and SSI continue development o f an M&E process o f the social security
reforms to ensure adequate feedback from beneficiaries to policy-makers. This qualitative
feedback mechanism w i l l complement the ongoing quantitative poverty monitoring which i s
undertaken annually (and continuously) since 2002 by TURKSTAT. The monitoring systems for
S S I are supported under the HTSSRP.

171. Bank staff will focus on the impact outcomes o f the program and the adjustments
that need to be made to the operation as it evolves, to take into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the intended
development goals. The review will be largely based on the monitoring indicators (benchmarks)
and the goals o f the program. A t the same time, the overall status o f the government's program
will be monitored to determine whether country conditions and the specific conditions o f the
proposed operation have been met.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

172. P F M in Turkey has strengthened considerably and was recently benchmarked
under the PFMP exercise. After 2001, modernization o f Turkey's system o f public financial
accountability in line with international standards was an urgent PFM priority. Enactment o f the
PFMC Law in 2003 marked a defining moment in this process. The Law defines new principals,
rules and structures for Turkish PFM systems including budget formulation and execution,
financial and internal control systems, and internal and external ,audit structures. Each year,
budgets and indicative proposals for the following two years are prepared according to the
functional, economic and institutional classifications defined under the PFMC Law. The
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) analytical budget classification and the accrual based
accounting systems have been expanded to all general government institutions, including local
administrations. The MOF i s thus able to consolidate the budget realization for all general
government institutions. Periodic financial statements are prepared regularly and on time. GDPA
prepares aggregated financial reports for the central government, which are published as a
monthly bulletin. The PFMC Law has transferred the authority to incur expenditures and provide
other approvals for expenditures above predetermined thresholds (internal control over budget
expenditures) to the SDUs established within each public administration. The most important
positive feature o f the PFMC Law i s that i t combines duties and responsibilities in a single
spending authority that incurs expenditures and i s kept accountable. The PFMC Law has also
introduced a modern internal audit framework, an important step given increased devolution o f
spending authority to line agencies.

173, Accounting. A n automated online accounting system has been implemented. The M O F
developed in-house an automated online public accounting system (Say2000i) has been up and

                                               52
running since 2002. The system captures receipts and payments from more than 1,500 sites o f
the MOF's GDPA across Turkey as they are made and can produce financial statements and
covers all general budgetary institutions except the Office o f the President and the accounting
office for State Debt within the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. Turkey has consciously switched
from cash-based to an accrual basis o f accounting. A uniform chart o f accounts that i s
harmonized with budget classification has been implemented. The GDPA has issued a new
framework for the accrual-based chart o f accounts, harmonized with the economic classification
o f the newly adopted GFS budget classification system. Article 49 o f the PFMC Law mandates
that accounting be harmonized with international standards, and that standards be issued by a
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which has been operating since June 2006.
The GASB i s under the MOF, comprised o f representatives from the TCA, SPO, MOF,
Undersecretariat o f Treasury, and other agencies.

174. Procurement, Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade i t s public p1 ocurement        :
legislation and practices in line. with international standards. The current Public Procurement
Law was enacted in 2002. The Law i s based on the United Nations Commission on International
Standards (UNCITRAL) Model and moves Turkey in the direction o f compliance with EU
standards. The independent Public Procurement Agency (PPA) established by law to oversee
public procurement and ensure enforcement o f the new procurement standards i s fully
operational. The Government i s working on new procurement legislation for SOEs in the public
utilities sectors consistent with the relevant EU directive in order to improve operational
efficiency o f the SOEs. Benchmarking o f Turkey's public procurement system against an
internationally recognized baseline o f best practice in procurement was carried out jointly by the
World Bank and the Turkish PPA in February 2006 and updated in October 2007. The
benchmarking included analysis o f four main pillars: legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar
I);  institutional framework and institutional capacity (Pillar 11); procurement operations and
market practices (Pillar 111); and the integrity o f procurement systems (Pillar IV). I t showed that
the country achieved greatest progress in the legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar I),   and
in the integrity o f the national public procurement system (Pillar IV). Further improvements in
public procurement are important in: (a) lowering o f the threshold for publication o f contract
award decisions; (b) eliminating restrictions in the form o f thresholds for participation by
international bidders; and (c) simplifying dispute resolution system. Finally, selection o f
consulting services procedures would benefit from use o f quality-and-cost based selection
system, particularly for. the assignments that require high competence and relevant experience.

175. Auditing. Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization o f
Turkey's public audit system. The objectives are twofold: (a) clarify institutional responsibilities,
promote improvements in audit quality in line with international standards and support the shift
from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to improve operational
performance; and (b) expand the scope o f TCA audits to cover the entire general government
including local administrations, autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining
extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with the overall objective o f transforming the TCA
into an effective state audit institution. These objectives have been facilitated by enactment o f
the PFMC Law and w i l l further be completed through enactment o f the new TCA law. The
PFMC Law established a framework for decentralizing internal audit to the line agencies in line
with EU requirements. I t discontinued the TCA's involvement in budget execution and focused
on ex-post audits, including performance audits. The TCA i s committed to undertake internal

                                                 53
reforms to align its institutional structure with international standards for state audit institutions,
to upgrade i t s audit capabilities, and to reach consensus with the other government audit bodies
on implementation o f the reform. A draft action plan for the TCA's internal reform has been
prepared and will be improved, including through a peer review by auditors from other European
state audit institutions. The action plan i s expected to be adopted b y the Government and T C A
after the enactment o f the T C A Law.

176. FX Control Environment. The IMF had conducted a safeguards assessment o f the
CBRT in April 2002 and determined that, while number o f measures was taken to strengthen the
CBRT, such as the conduct o f a quality external audit and the preparation o f financial statements
according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there remained a number o f
vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed. The assessment recommended reorganization o f the
internal audit function, expansion o f the role o f the audit committee, publication o f IFRS
financial statements, and reconciliation o f program monetary data with the audited financial
statements, including an audit o f the treasury component. Since then CBRT has taken a number
measures including reconciliation o f monetary data with audited financial statements and i t s
audit by the independent auditor, publication o f annual audited financial statements and the
independent auditors report, reorganization o f internal audit function, including the adoption o f a
new charter and the appointment o f the head o f the internal audit department. The audit reports
by independent auditors on the financial statements o f the CBRT for the years 2008, 2007, 2006,
2005, 2004 and 2003 provided a clean audit opinion. Past audits and generally positive
assessment b y the IMF indicate that there are no strong reasons for asking additional safeguards
such as audit o f deposit account.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

177. Disbursement and Implementation Arrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures for DPLs. The untied finances will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation o f the program and not tied to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval o f the loan and notification by the
Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal application. The IBRD
will deposit the proceeds o f the loan with the CBRT, which will form part o f the official FX
reserves at the request o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. The Government will utilize the
proceeds o f the loan in foreign currency for either foreign debt servicing or for crediting the local
currency equivalent into the treasury single account for financing budgeted expenses. Prior to
that, the borrower will pay a front-end fee amounting to 0.25 percent o f the loan amount from its
o w n resources. If, after deposit in this CBRT account, the proceeds o f the loan are used for
ineligible purposes (for example, for financing items imported from non-member countries or
goods or services on the IBRD standard negative list), the IBRD will require the borrower to
refund the amount directly to the IBRD, and the IBRD will cancel an equivalent undisbursed
amount o f the loan.

178. Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date, The administration o f this loan will be the
responsibility o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury, The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision o f the Loan Agreement. Given the IMF's positive assessment o f the
CBRT, an audit o f the deposit account for the proceeds o f the loan i s not considered necessary.

                                                  54
The Undersecretariat o f Treasury w i l l provide the Bank within 30 days a confirmation letter
stating that the DPL funds have been received and deposited in the designated account assigned
by the Borrower that forms part o f the Borrower's budget management system. The closing date
o f the loan w i l l be November 1,2010.

R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

179. There are four main risks to the program's outcomes: ( i ) global economic risks, ( i i )
economic management risks, ( i i i ) political risks, ( i v ) social risks.

180. Global economic risk factors. High uncertainty over the pace o f global recovery creates
still substantial downside risks to global demand for 'Turkish exports (especially from the EU), to
output growth and fiscal performance, and to the availability o f international private capital
flows to finance Turkish investments and the corporate sector's roll-over o f external loans. In
addition, there remains some risk o f further systemic disruption in the global financial system,
with potentially significant ripple effects on the Turkish economy. Realistically, there i s little
that Turkey can do to mitigate the most severe risks o f further global economic disruption,
beyond continued strong management o f its own economic span o f control (monetary and fiscal
policy). Turkey also faces uncertainty stemming from international energy prices. Here
mitigation measures include increasing energy efficiency and diversifying into non-oil sources
such as wind and solar energy, policy areas where the Bank and the Government are
collaborating closely.

181. Economic management risks. The main risk comes from the challenge to
macroeconomic, especially fiscal, management in the face o f the current slowdown. The 20 10-12
MTP has set a fiscal policy framework with measures and targets addressing the risk o f rising
public debt ratios. Mitigating this risk i s the government's strong record o f fiscal management
and high capacity in public debt management. A longer-term risk i s that fiscal balance i s
achieved at the cost o f declining levels o f public investment in growth-enhancing areas such as
core infrastructure, reducing potential growth. The risk o f further delay o f some key reforms in
the areas o f the labor market and worker protection and o f the investment climate i s reduced as
the MTP and the Government's 2010 Annual Program contain these. Actions to mitigate these
risks include continued close dialogue between the government, Bank teams, and those o f other
institutions (e.g., IMF, European Commission (EC)), and the programmatic structure o f the
Bank's DPL support to Turkey.

182. Political risks. Turkey has had a stable government since 2002 under the Justice and
Development Party (AKP), facilitating the implementation o f major reforms. Key risks relate to
continuing domestic political differences and the possibility o f declining public support for
reforms due to the impact o f the crisis. There i s also a risk that a focus o f legislative and policy
activity on the political agenda could delay ambitious and controversial reforms during the
remainder o f the CPS period. The EU accession anchor continues to mitigate political risks.

183. Social risks. The severe recession over the last 18 months caused increases in poverty
and unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and as the recovery will likely be moderate
and gradual, there i s a high risk that unemployment and poverty w i l l stay at elevated levels for
some years. High unemployment and increased poverty, especially among young people, in turn

                                                  55
create risks o f social tensions and declining support for Turkey's reform agenda, including the
outstanding second phase o f the labor market reform. Mitigating the risk i s the emphasis the
Government's program places on labor market measures, including active labor market
programs.

Mr. Robert 13. Loellick
President
The World Bank
Washington I I C 20433
U.S.A.




Dear Mr. Zoellick



1. Our Government's sound economic policies and structural refoniis have increased the quality
   o f lifc of' our pcoplc. ensurcd strong macroeconomic stability and provided the cconomy wilh
   a ilesiblc and productive structure. Confidence and stability i n thc Turkish cconomy wcrc
   established and a deep rooted process o f change uas c o n i n i c n c d towards economic
   restruct tiring and public nianagernent.

2. Originaling in the I;S housing market crash in the second half of2007. tlic subscquent sharp
   decline o f asset prices in devcloped niarkcts resulted in a decline in houschold w a l t l i anc!
   contraction i n giobal deinaxid. 'This process had serious ef'f'ccts on financial sector balancc
   sheets and seriousiy daniaged the global iinaiicial system. Given global economic and
   financial intcgration, most econoniies were affected. What began as financial turmoil i n 2007
   devcloped into a global economic crisis almost unprecedcnted i n size and scope. 'l'hroiigh
   coordinated action, thc international community has responded rapidly and effectively to this
   global downturn, leading to the first signs o f rccovery in the second half o f 2009. Although
   this recovery s t i l l dcpcnds on public sector support, the world economy is recovering 1:ister
   than anticipatcd and i s expected to grow by more than 3 percent in 201 0.

3. The global crisis affected our economy through trade, financing and expectations channels.
   On trade, given the impact o f the crisis on the EU region, which constitutes around 5 0
   percent of our exports. Turkish exports started to fall froin October 2008. This affected the
   leading sectors which had significantly contributed to growth in recent years. rcducing
   production and employment.

4. The second channel through which the crisis affected the Turkish economy i s the financing
   channel. Weakening private capital tlows and tighter international financial conditions
   reduced the debt rollover ratios of the corporatc sector and made it harder to access extcrnel
   financing. Finally. increased global cconoinic uncertainty caused delays in invcstnicnt and
   corisuinption decisions and thus led to a further decline in economic activity and domcstic
   demand.
                                                                                                          Annex 1
                                                                                                        Page 2 of 6




5. As a consequence ofthe global contraction and its effects on our economy through thc above
   mentioned channels growth stalled in 2008 at 0.9 percent. In January-Scptcmber period o f
   2009, GDP has contracted by 8.4 percent. However. quarterly grow7h figures indicated that
   the recovery has already started in the last quarter o f 2009. The contraction in econoniic
   activity has rcsul!cd i n a dccrcase i n employment. as i n many countries. Ilneniploymcnt
   increased to 13.1 percent in Nokernher 2009 which i s 0.5 percent higher compared to the
   Novcmbcr 2008 figurc.

6. The crisis has had some positive consequences for thc current account balance and for
   inilation. Imports have declined inore than exports. reducing the currcnt accoiiiit deficit
   signiiicantly (to less than 14 billion I I S Dollars for 2009). Declining commodity prices arid
   contracting deniand havc conrributed to a declining trend in inflation. 2009 consumer
   inflation fcll by 3.6 percent compared to end-2008 (at 6.53 percent versus our (nrgct 01' 7.5
   percent for 2009). Furthermore our Banking seclor showed considerable resilience to global
   financial turbulence. Strong capitalization. robust profits. minimal forcign currency exposure.
   and adequate liquidity p!:yed important r o k in 'Turkish Banks' weathering tlic crisis.

7. Our government took proacti\c actions starting from the first signs o f thc effects o f the
                                                                                      and
   global crisis on our economy. These actions include monetary, liscal. eniplo~niient social
   measures. Thcsc ineastires aiined to revitalize economic activity. sustain cniployiiient and
   production. 'I'o niaintain existing employment and create new jobs, w e havc iniprovcd thc
   Rayment conditions regarding short-time employment compensation and unemployment
   insurance benefits: increased the funds allocated to vocational training programs; and
   introduced measures to decrease non-wage costs. We have also increased transfers t o
   EXIMBANK and Small and Medium Enterprises 1)evelopineiit Organization (KOSGEl3) to
   support private scctor employnent and production. .At the same time. iiieasures taken by the
   Central I3ank, the 13ankingRegulation and Supervision Agcncy (BIISA) and Capital Markets
   Board (CMB) ai111 to increase credit volume. liquidity, financial intcmicdiation and
   confidence in irnancial markets.

   The Medium Term Program (MTP)

8. Having takcn thc necessary actions io implement the crisis rcsponsc mciisurcs nccdrd to
   allc\iate the adverse impacts of the crisis in 2008 a i d 2009. we are nov. fociisecl on scctiring
   sustainablc gro\ilh in the inediuin and long tcrni. In ordcr to sct our medium-tenn
   macrocconornic fraincwork and also to further strcngthen macroccononiic stability. we
   announccd Turkey ' s no\+ threc-year economic program i n Scptcinbcr 2009.

9. The MTP aims for thc resumption of robust and sustainable growth i n 'furkc?. Our program
   has been designed taking into account new circumstances and pre\:ailing global uncertainties.
   The I'rograin maps out the exit strategy froin the policies impicnicntcd in response to thc
   crisis. The Program also addrcsscs dcbt sustainability and is based on rcalistic
   macroecono~nicassumptions and achievable targets, which take into consideration severe
   downside sccnarios. This was indeed proven by 2009 budget realizations, which were better
   than M'I'I' expectations.

IO. According to our projections in the MTP, cconomy \vi11 resume grovdh in 2010 arid pace 01'
    growth will increase in 201 I.We are expecting 3.5 percent. 4 percent and 5 percent growth
    rates in 2010. 201 1 and 2012 respectively. General Government deficit to GDP ratio i s
    expected to decline to 1.7 percent by the end of2012.

I1. 1 \vould like to emphasize that our program has rcccivcd cndorscmcnt from intcrnational
    financial markets and that our iinprovcd prospects havc been rcflccted by upgraded ratings
    by Fitch. Moody's. Japan Credit Raiing ,4gency (JCR) and Standard & Poor's.

   Enhancement o f Public Financial Management

12. Given the importance o f m effective and modem social protcction system, our Government
    has introduced a serious reform o f social security and universal health insurance. One o f thc
    key pieces o f legislation within the reform program, Social Security and Ilniversal Health
    Insurance Law No. 5510, was enacted on June 16, 2006 and aniendcd on May 8, 2008; most
    ofthe provisions ofthe amended Law had become effective by October 2008. Sincc thcn, wc
    havc rcniained fully committed to the iinplenientation o f thc 1 . a ~ . significant number of
                                                                            A
    the secondar). legislation actions required for the enforcement o f this L a w h a w already bccn
    issued.

13. 'The other kcy pircc o f social security legislation, the Social Security Institution Law No.
    5502, was cnactcd on May 20. 2006. reforming the administrativc dimcnsions of' social
    security. Prior IO this reforni. there were three separate social securit) systcnis. LVc havc
    made significant progress in unifying these separate systems under the singlc unibrella of the
    Social Security institution. including the integration 01' staff and the mcrgcr o f dcpartmcnts
    with paraiicl l'unctions. Taking into consideration the magnitude o f this unification operation.
    the administrative dimension o f this rcfomi program (including thc merger of data and I,['
    s y s t e m o f prior systems) will continuc to be i n the agenda o f our Governmcnt.

14. A s part o f the above mentioned reform to social sccurity and health insurancc. we have
    introduccd I.:nivcrsal Health Tnsurance with the objcctivc o f iinprciving ;ICCCSS to quality
    hcalth serbices ibr the poor. improving cfficiency and quality 01' thc hcalth systcm. and
    effecti\.ely icgulating access t o licalth insurance. In order to cnsurc the cfiicicncy ol' hcalth
    cspcnditurcs and thc tiscal sustainability we have introduccd several measures. For instance.
    wz have started to apply increased co-payments for out-patient \isits since October 2009.
    'I'hc Social Security Institution (SSI) has also introduced phannaceuticdl cspcnditure ceiling
    to control costs. in line with Reform I,aw No. 5510. S S I i s continuing to implement a global
    budget for Ministry o f Health hospitals. Spending limits for university and private hospitals
    havc also been introduced through the 201 0 budget. Moreover. SSI has started to implement
    a strict spending monitoring system for private hospitals. We have also announced future
    measures under the MTP including rational drug use. Diagnosis Rclakd Groups (DRG)
    implementation, and the expansion o f family medicine to all 8 1 provinces.

15. We arc glad to report that Public Financial Management (PFM) in 'l'urkey has been
    strengthened considerably. After 2001, the modernization of lurkcy's systcrn of public
    linancial accouniability i n line with international standards was a n urgent priority. 'fhc
    ciiactincni of the Public Fiiiancial Management and Control (PFMC) Law i n 2003 marked i            i
    defining nionicnt in this pro       iniplenieiitaticrii stai-tcd i n 1006. U e have s e w rcniarkablc

    fomiulation and i'secution. tinancial and internal control s p t e m s . and internal and cstcriial
    audit structures. Each year. budgets and indicative proposals for the !'oliowing two ).ears are
    prepared according to the functional, econoinic and institutional classi tications dctincd under
    the I'FMC' I.aw. The most important feature of' the T.a\v i s that i t combines duties and
    rcsponsibilitics in a single spending authority that i s thcrcby kept accountablc. 'l'hc Ministry
    o f Finance issued revised Performance Program Guidelines in July 2009.

16. A s rcquircd by :he PFMC Law. all central government institutions, municipalities, and
    Special Provincial Administrations 5vith populations above 50.000 have coniplctcd their
    stratcgic plans. Likewise. 76 institutions completed performance programs in 2008 and 120
    institutions prepared performance programs in the 201 0 budget q c i e under rcviscd
    guide1incs for perfonnancc-based budgeting.

17. Work on internal management and linancial control has achieved good progrcss. 'l'hc MOI'
    issued standards in this area in December 2007. A l l gencral govcmmcnt institutions h a w
    prepared two-year internal control strategies and action plans. In order to dcvelop the
    administrative capacities o f Strategy Development Llnits. 444 financial services experts and
    148 deputy financial services experts have been recruited.

18. We also submitted an updated draft Turkish Court o f Accounts (TCA) Law to the I'arliatnent
    on Fehruaiy I".    2010. With this law. our main objective i s to extend (o the scope o f TCA
    responsihilitics to cover all public administrations.

19. We arc working on a fiscal rule i n order to reduce uncertainty with respect to tnacrocconotnic
    management and to strengthen the credibility of' our fiscal policies. The legal framework for
    the fiscal r u l e will be completed in 2010. Starring from the 201 I budget pcriod. I'f:M w i l l be
    conducted in line with a fiscal r u l e over the medium to long term.

   Equitahle Growth and Employment

20. Expanding employment opportunities has been one o f the main goals of' our cconomic
    program. 'T'hc eniployinent package. which we introduced in May 2008, included important
    policics ainiing to reduce non-Uagc costs and strengthen active labor market programs.
    Broad reduction of the einployer's social security contributions (by 5 pcrcc'nt). a time-bound
    reduction 01' t.mploycr's social sccurity contribution for noinen and youth and the casing of'
    obligator), hiring rcguiations arc w i n e of the measures included in thc eniployinent packagc.
    Furthermorc, iiiciisurcs to incrcasc labor niarkcc flexibility and worker prokction are in our
    (iovcriinicnt's agenda.

21. One ofthe inipacts ofthe global crisis on Turkey i s rising uncmploynicnt. As a response, our
    Governnicnt introduced cmploynient and social measures to encourage hiring. preservc
    cxisting jobs and expand active labor market programs.

22. "Short-time einployinent conipensation". which already misted under lincniployment

           ANNEX 4: RELATION TO EARLIER PPDPL AND CEDPL SERIES

 1.     The Government's planned actions supported by the Programmatic Public Sector DPL
series (operations in FY2006 and 2008) covered the following policy areas: ( )  IMacroeconomic
Stability; (11) Social Security and Social Assistance Reform; (111) Budget and PFM Reform; (IV)
Public Administration and Governance Reform. Indicative triggers for the envisaged PPDPL 3 at
the time o f PPDPL 2 are shown in Table A5-1,

2.       Within the REGE-DPL, PPDPL's social security, UHI, and social assistance content (11)
i s included under Pillar 1-A (Inclusive Social Programs at Sustainable Cost). Measures relating
to the health system have been grouped with further social security administrative reform. Both
indicative triggers for PPDPL 3 on social security have been met although the recession, by
holding down revenues in relation to expenditures that cannot be cut in real terms in line with the
GDP contraction, has hurt the overall balance o f the system, an effect that persists throughout the
2010-12 period covered by the Medium Term Fiscal Plan.

3.      PPDPL's PFM content i s included under Pillar 1-B (Enhancing PFM), linked directly to
improving overall fiscal performance through public sector efficiency gains. Both indicative
triggers have largely been met: 50 institutions have prepared performance-based budgets and,
with the exception o f 11 administrations, government entities covered by the second indicative
trigger have prepared strategic plans. The former action i s included as a prior action in the
REGE-DPL.

4.      PPDPL's judicial content under pillar (IV) i s described (but not included as a prior
action) in Section 111. The main outcome associated with this reform program i s improvement in
Turkey's business climate. The Mediation Law, included as an indicative trigger in PPDPL 2,
remains on the agenda o f parliament, while the Judicial Strategy and associated Action Plan have
been endorsed by cabinet and published, viewed as an important prerequisite for further
progress. In the interest o f selectivity, PPDPL policy actions in the area o f regional development
have been excluded from the REGE-DPL prior actions.

5.      The Government's planned actions supported by the Programmatic CEDPL series
(operations in FY07 and FY08) covered the following policy areas: (I)
                                                                    Macroeconomic Stability;
(11) Enhancing Competitiveness and F D I through Investment Climate Reforms; (111) Improving
Financial Intermediation; (IV) Expanding Employment Opportunities. Key next steps for the
envisaged CEDPL 3 at the time o f CEDPL 2 are shown in Table A5-2.

6.       Although the REGE-DPL i s not formally considered as a follow-on operation to CEDPL
2, it does adopt much o f the substantive content o f the CEDPL series, which w i l l now be closed.
Within REGE-DPL, CEDPL's investment climate and financial intermediation content areas (11)
and (111) are included under Pillar 2B (Private-Sector Led Growth and Job Creation). O f the three
next steps listed for the investment climate, only parts o f the YOIKK action plan have advanced
far enough to be considered a prior action for REGE-DPL (which focuses on customs
streamlining as most significant given the importance o f reinvigorating trade flows post-crisis).
O f the three next steps listed for financial intermediation, none has been completed. However, in
this area the Government's broad range o f financial-sector measures to mitigate the impact o f the
                                                                                               Annex 4
                                                                                             Page 2 of 4

.global financial crisis on credit conditions for f i r m s in Turkey, particularly SMEs, are considered
important, with the expansion o f credit guarantees constituting a prior action for REGE-DPL.

7.      The areas o f the Government's employment generation reforms supported by the CEDPL
series are included under Pillars 2-A and 2-B o f REGE-DPL. O f the three next steps in this area,
one has been completed, with competency-based occupational standards now defined in 23
occupational categories. For reasons o f selectivity this i s not included as a prior action for
REGE-DPL. In the employment area as in financial intermediation, the design o f the REGE-DPL
reflects the Government's priorities in responding to the circumstances created by the global
financial crisis. The part o f the Government's employment support package relating to expanded
vocational training i s included here as a prior action for the REGE-DPL.

8.       In summary, o f the nine prior actions included in REGE-DPL, three are included in or are
closely related to the indicative triggers for PPDPL 3 (PFM, social security law implementation,
and health sector measures); two are related to key next steps for CEDPL 3 (customs
streamlining under the Y O I K K Action Plan and increased vocational training); three are purely
crisis response measures; and one i s a new structural prior action in education. In terms o f the
future agenda, REGE-DPL supports an even balance between the competitiveness and
employment agenda foreseen by the Government in the CEDPL series, and the public sector
agenda foreseen by the Government in the PPDPL series, with the former incorporating much o f
the planned content o f CEDPL 3 and the latter including important reforms underpinning the
return to sustainable public-sector balances under the new Medium-Term Fiscal Plan.

Results

9.       O f the 13 indicators used for the results framework for the REGE-DPL series, three are
taken directly or slightly modified from the results framework for PPDPL 2 (UHI, social security
deficit, and unified administrative structure), two are taken directly from the results framework
for CEDPL 2 (non-banking assets and ISKUR's placement rate), and eight are newly proposed
for this operation. This overlap reflects the common aims and objectives that the REGE-DPL
series inherits from the two earlier series, as implied by the overlap in policy areas, prior actions,
and indicative triggers in Annex 2, combined with the need for greater selectivity in tying results
indicators closely to prior actions and triggers, a basic principles o f DPL design.

10.     The eight new indicators not only reflect attempts to monitor the impact o f the
government's policies to mitigate the impact o f the crisis, but also developments i n Turkey's
policies. Thus, capturing post-crisis impact are the following indicators:
    0   Usage o f blind broker function during the crisis
    0   Take-up o f extended short-time employment compensation
    0   Credits to SMEs
    0   ISKUR vocational training programs reaching 300,000 people.
Reflecting developments in Turkey's own assessment environment are the following:
    0   Improved indicators under the PFMP benchmarking exercise (from baseline study).
Finally reflecting new policy areas introduced for REGE-DPL are the following:
    0   Public debt sustainability, measured by meeting MTP targets
    0   Days to clear customs (baseline: 15 in 2009)
    0   Participation rates in preschool in the 32 pilot provinces (baseline: 2009).

Fiscal developments 2000-08


1.     The rapid GDP growth experienced in 2002-2007 period translated into significant
expansion o f pension coverage among the active workers. In addition, the Government
introduced important measures to increase coverage further, the most influential being two
"amnesty" campaigns in 2006 and 2008 which allowed eligible workers to "buy" pension rights
by paying contributions for previous years at beneficial terms. While projections o f pension
system finances performed jointly by World Bank and the Undersecretariat o f Treasury in 2002
assumed 20 percent growth in private sector contributors to 2007, actual coverage growth came
to 47 percent in contributors.

6.      I t i s instructive to compare the "structural" S S I deficit - defined as the difference
between regular unsubsidized contribution revenues (including employer contributions for civil
servants) and total spending on pensions and health - as presented in Figure A6-5. This
demonstrates that the structural deficit has been increasing since January 2008, mirroring budget
transfers to SSI, and showing a very different pattern from reported deficit. This i s primarily due
to social security spending continuing to increase while increases in regular unsubsidized
contribution revenue have stalled during the recession.

 1.     The idea o f a credit guarantee scheme in Turkey was initiated in 1991 with a motivation
to ease the credit constraints faced by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). A partnership
was later formed between TOBB, KOSGEB (Ministry ofJndustry and Trade General Directorate
for Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Development), occupational groups "TOSYOV, TESK,
MEKSA"54 Halkbank to realize this initiative. CGF became operational in early 1990s, but it
             and
grew substantially in mid 2000s. By Figure A7-1: Guarantees Provided by the CGF as a Percentage

Fund.60 Immediately after the Council o f Ministers' decree on the principles o f the support, 20
banks became shareholders to the CGF, and i t s structure changed radically.


4.     In this new setup, the capital o f the CGF has increased to TL 240 million (with the
decision taken at the Annual Meeting held on 9 September, 2009). The CGF i s envisaged to
undertake two separate functions:

(i)Fund under Undersecretariat of Treasury support: After a period o f negotiations at
ministerial level among the Undersecretariat o f Treasury, CGF (including each o f i t s existing
shareholders) and banks (under the umbrella o f the Bankers' Association), all parties agreed o n
the establishment o f a new credit guarantee system, for which the Undersecretariat o f Treasury
support under L a w No. 4749 will remain in effect for 2 years following i t s establishment. A
major reform in the new setup is, in addition to the endorsement o f the Undersecretariat o f
Treasury for extending guarantees, the participation o f banks in the shareholding structure o f the
CGF. Under this arrangement, 20 banks have now become shareholders in the CGF with equal
shares (Table A7-l), quadrupling i t s paid-in capital and lending capacity. This gives these banks
the right o f representation in the CGF Board o f Directors (with 2 members out o f 9). O f the
remaining members, two are appointed by the Undersecretariat o f Treasury, two by KOSGEB
and three by TOBB, with T O B B also appointing the chairman o f the Board.

(ii) Traditional role of CGF: The CGF will carry on extending guarantees under the scheme
explained above in Section I.Maximum volumes were increased from TI, 750,000 to TL
 1,000,000 per SME and if the applicant i s a group company the maximum volume can be
increased to TL 1,500,000, The number o f financial institutions CGF works with was increased
from 27 to 36. For the utilization o f this fund, banks may send a request to the CGF for it to
support the debtor under i t s own risk, [ Figure A7-2: Flow o f Funds in Guarantee Agreements

Undersecretariat o f Treasury i s empowered with a veto power over decisions related to the loans
under i t s support.

6.      For each "Treasury-supported" loan, 65 percent o f the risk will be borne b y the
Undersecretariat o f Treasury and the remaining 35 percent will be collateralized, leaving no risk
to the CGF. Loans with maturities less than 4 years and a maximum volume o f about USD
685,000 will be supported. As mentioned above, if the applicant i s a group company, the
maximum volume can be increased to TL 1,500,000 (about USD 1 million). Ufilike in the
traditional role o f the CGF, follow-up procedures will be fully undertaken by the associated
banks, with a payback mechanism channeled from the Undersecretariat o f Treasury to the banks
through the CGF. The banks will later transfer the collected collateral amount to the CGF, for it
to pass on to the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. This support will be provided to beneficiaries in
exchange for a "guarantee commission" (0.9 percent).

Conclusions

8.      The new CGF scheme i s an important part o f the Government's efforts to tackle the
consequences o f the global financial crisis. The approach o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury to
extending guarantees to f i r m s in hardship has proven effective in a number o f other countries
during crises. Indeed, in Turkey, the scheme i s being put in place somewhat later than expected
and could probably have had greater impact if adopted at an earlier stage o f the domestic credit
crunch.

9.      Some independent observers have raised concerns over the new CGF structure s t i l l
requiring complementary collateral o f about 35 percent from beneficiary firms. This requirement
will constrain access to credit for some SMEs, possibly limiting the program's impact on post-
crisis recovery. Notwithstanding this criticism, a collateral rate o f 35 percent i s reasonable in
international comparison to avoid misuse o f funds and minimize the N P L ratio, in a period where
the country i s in need o f sjrict control over public expenditures. The procedures related to the

establishment o f the new CGF scheme have been undertaken following a fully transparent legal
process, in line with international good practices.
