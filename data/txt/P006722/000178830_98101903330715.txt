APPRAISAL OF THE CHIVOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
INTERCONEXION ELECTRICA S.A.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) requires the equivalent of
about US$75.1 million in external financing to cover the foreign exchange
cost of the Chivor Project, consisting of the first phase (500 MW) of the
Chivor hydroelectric plant and of a 180 km 230 kV line to connect the
plant to ISA's interconnection network. The plant would include the Es-
meralda rockfill dam on the Bata River, a 5.75 km pressure tunnel, a 2 km
surface penstock, and a powerhouse with 4 x 125 MW units. The estimated
cost of the Project is US$114.2 million equivalent.  The external finan-
cing would be provided by the proposed Bank loan of US$52.3 million
equivalent and by bilateral credits estimated to total about US$22.8
million equivalent.
ii.       ISA was fomned in 1967 for the interconnection of the four main
electric systems in central Colombia, representing about two-thirds of the
whole Colombian power sector, and for the planning, construction, ownership
and operation of new power plants in the interconnected syst.EL ISA is
owned by the public utilities owning the four systems, with load centers in
Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Manizales (para. 3.01). The Bank has decisively
supported the concept of integration, first by advocating the interconnec-
tion and coordinated operation of the four systems and then by helping to
finance ISA's first project, a 535 Im 230 kV network interconnecting the
four systems, presently under construction, with completion expected by
mid-1971.
iii.      ISA's network is appropriate to the planned general development
of the Colombian power sector, and it has made possible the first joint
planning of a large-size power development in Colombia. Studies perforued
by ISA, its consultants, and the Departamento Nacional de Planeacion
(Planeacion) to determine the most suitable power generation program in-
dicated that Chivor was of highest priority, and the Bank agrees with this
conclusion. Chivor, the first generation project to be built and operated
by ISA, is to start operation in mid-1975, and this schedule is realistic.
The project design contemplates the future expansion of the plant to a
total of 1,000 MW.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost
of the main and minor civil works contracts and minor equipment orders, all
of them to be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding,
and the corresponding interest during construction. Prequalification of
contractors for the main civil works contract has been completed, and bid-
ding is presently under way. Colombian firn's would compete for minor civil
works contracts and a few minor equipment orders. It has been estimated
that the foreign components of such contracts and orders awarded locally



(ii)
would be 40% and 70%, respectively, of their total costs, and the Bank
loan would be disbursed against these percentages of the actual costs of
local contracts and orders. A 15% margin of preference will be allowed
domestic suppliers in evaluation of bids for these equipment orders.
v.        The financing of the main equipment orders would be arranged
directly by ISA with the supplier countries. Meetings to consider Bank-
sponsored joint or parallel financing of the Chivor Project were held in
Paris in December 1969 and March 1970 with the principal supplier countries 1/.
Agreement was not reached on either system of flnanclng. ISA has therefore
undertaken to obtain bilateral financing for the main equipment orders.
vi.       The local currency cost of the Project, equivalent to about
US$48.5 million, and the interest during construction on the
bilateral credits, estiaated at about US$2.7 million equivalent, would be
financed by the four sponsors in proportion to their agreed participation
in the output of Chivor. The actual and forecast financial positions of
the sponsors, including provisions for their investments in Chivor, are
acceptable.
vii.      ISA's Estatutos do not define precisely the method for pricing
Chivor energy.  ISA has prepared a tentative mathod Which is acceptable
in principle and is used in this report. The aotual aothod will depend on
the revision of the Estatutos presently being studied by consultants, as
required by undertakings received in connection with the first Bank loan
to ISA (575-C0), and will be reviewed by the Bank. The revision should
take place before mid-1971, when the interconnection network will be placed
in operation.
viii.     The estimated financial positions of ISA and its sponsors not
only seem sound, but at projected levels of tariffs and construction activ-
ity, all the systems taken together appear to generate considerable oash
surpluses in later years. This is attributable in part to the realization
of the very economies for Which ISA was establiahed, and in part to the
fact that the sponsor companies pay no dividends on the substantial equity
investments in them. Thus, in the future divideods could be paid to the
local and national governments, or tariffs could be reduced.
ix.       This would be the Bank's second loan to ISA. Loan 575-0D for the
interconnection project was made in Decemaber 1968 for an amount of US$ 18
million equivalent, and is being disbursed. A total of 13 Bank loans with
an aggregate initial principal amount of about US$216 million equivalent
has been made to ISA's sponsors. The Bank's experience with ISA in the
adsinistration of Loan 575-00 and in the appraisal of the Chivor Project
has been satisfactory. No problems are foreseen regarding ISA's capacity
to manage the construction of, and to operate the interconnection network
and Chivor.
x.        The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$52.3 million equiv-
alent, for a term of 30 years including a grace period on amortization of
about 7 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE CHIVOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
INTEROONEXION ELECTRICA S.A.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) requires the equivalent of
about US$75.1 million in external financing to cover the foreign exchange
cost of a project consisting.of the first phase (500 MW) of the Chivor
hydroelectric plant and of a 230 kV line to connect the plant to ISA's
network (see Map 1). The cost of the Project would be approximately
US$114.2 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost of the Project
is estimated to be equivalent to US$65.7 million, and the corresponding
interest during construction would be equivalent to US$12.1 million.
The proposed Bank loan of US$52.3 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange cost of the main and minor civil works contracts and
minor equipnent orders, and the interest charges on the loan payable
during construction. The main equipment orders, estimated to total
about US$22.8 million equivalent;, would be financed by bilateral credits.
1.02      ISA is owned by the following sponsors, which are the utility
companies owning the four main electric systems in central Colombia:
(i) Empresa de Ehergia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB)
(ii) Empresas Publicas de Nedellin (EFM)
(iii) Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca (CVC) and Central
Hidroelectrica del Rio Anchicaya Limitada (CHIDRAL)
(iv) Central Hidroelectrica de Caldas (CHEC) and Instituto
Colombiano de Ehergia Electrica (ICEL)
The local currency cost of the Project equivalent to about US$48.5 million,
and the interest during construction on the bilateral credits, about
US$2.7 million equivalent, would be financed by the sponsors as follows:
40% by common stock subscriptions in equal parts by the four sponsors,
and 60% by bonds purchased by EEB (91.8%) and EPM (8.2%).
1.03      EEEB initiated in 1955 investigations of the hydroelectric pos-
sibilities of the Ouavio, Bata, Lengupa and Upia basins (see Map 2), and
in 1961 studies for a power development on the Bata River. For these
investigations and studies, BEEB has used the services of the Colombian
engineering firm Ingetec Limitada (Ingetec) as general consultants, and
of several specialists of international reputation in hydrology, geology,
dam, tunnel and power plant design and construction, as advisers. The
studies indicated that the most feasible and economic development would
be the Chivor Project, consisting of a regulating reservoir on the Bata
River, created by a rockfill type dam at the Esmeralda site, and of a



-2-
powerhouse on the Lengupa River bank, to which the water from the
reservoir would be conducted by two pressure tunnels and penstocks
developing an average head of 756 m.
1.04      The Chivor Project is the first jointly planned large-size
power development in Colombia. It is the culmination of the efforts of
many years by the Departanento Nacional de Planeacion (Planeacion) with
the Bank's active support.  Planeacion, ISA and the Colombian consultants
Ingetec and Integral Limitada (Integral) made several studies to deter-
mine the most suitable sequence of construction of generating plants for
a long range power generation program. These studies included the eval-
uation of several alternative prograns equally capable of meeting the
interconnected system's demand up to 1980. In accordance with the results
of the studies, ISA and its sponsors adopted a program with Chivor (first
stage, 500 NW) as the first plant to be built, owned and operated by ISA,
to start operation in mid-1975. The initial design of Chivor included
provisions for the future diversion of the Ouavio River to the Esmeralda
reservoir on the Bata River. After discussions with the Bank, ISA gave
further consideration to the Ouavio-Bata develoPient, and concluded that
the Guavio River should not be diverted because it presents good and
economic possibilities of its own.  The corresponding changes of Chivor's
initial design reduced its cost by about US$25 million equivalent to the
present estimate of US$114.2 millixn equivalent. The Emeralda reservoir
and the Bata River flow would be adequate for an ultimate installed
capacity in Chivor of 1,000 MW; the present first stage would include
the necessary provisions to permit the future expansion.
1.05      This would be the second loan to ISA 1/.  The Bank has financed
power development in Colombia for nearly 20 years, and 14 loans with
an aggregate amount of about US$234 million have been made to ISA and the
four interconnected systems, which represent about two-thirds of Colombia's
electric power sector. The Bank's experience with ISA and its sponsors has
been generally satisfactory, with the notable exception of CVC/CHIDRAL's
financial difficulties, the product of insufficient revenues and funds to
finance the heavy investments in which they are involved. The Government
has agreed to provide additional credits to CVC/CHIDRAL, which, in conjunc-
tion with tariff increaset,will assure adequate funds to carry out their
progps  and participate in Chivor.  The construction of ISA's 230 kV
interconnection network is progressing satisfactorily and on schedule.
The need for the central interconnection is urgent and ever-growing; it
will be utilized imediately upon its completion in mid-1971 to prevent the
power shortages otherwise forecast on the CVC/CHIDRAL system. The 115 kV
1/   The Bank and 12 supplying countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K. and U.S.A.)
agreed to participate in joint financing of the interconnection pro-
ject. Bank loan 575-co of December 1968 is for a mximum of US$18
million equivalent. It is exPected that joint financing from those
countries of some equipment orders on a 50/50 basis will contribute
about US$9 million equivalent.

line Ibague-Zarzal (see Map 1), in operation since September 1969, is
being used intensively to supply surplus energy from FEET to cVC, thus
helping to solve the serious power shortages which occurred in 1969 in
Cali and the Valle del Cauca. The construction and operation of the
interconnection network and of the Chivor plant will establish ISA's
desirably predominant role in thei development of the Colombian power
sector.
1.06      At the time this report was prepared, information on the
results of 1969 operations was not yet available in final form, and
therefore the latest "actual" figures are for 1968. A review of pre-
liminary results of 1969 operations confirms that they were essentially
the same as the estimated figures used herein.
1.07      The Bank has been collecting and reviewing basic information
on the Chivor Project since mid-1968, and in January 1969 initiated in
Colombia the discussions on the Project and the power generation program
which ultimately led to the cost reduction mentioned in paragraph 1.04.
This report has been prepared by M. Isla and K. Stichenwirth makinig use
of this information; from information they and M. Reis obtained in
August-September 1969 during an appraisal mission to Colombia with visits
to Bogota, Cali and the Chivor site; and from information made available
during a visit to Colombia by M. Isla in April 1970.

2.   THE SECTOR
2.01      Colombia, with a population of about 20 million, had in 1968 a
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about Col$95 billion, equivalent to a
per capita GDP of about US$285.  The population is growing at a rate of
approximately 3.3% per year, and emigration from rural to urban areas
has been taking7place at a fast pace. The major influence on the
country's overall economic performance has been the world market for
coffee, Colombia's principal export. During the last decade, the
structure of production changed considerably.  Agriculture, which in
1958 accounted for about 37% of GDP, by 1967 had fallen to 30%; manufac-
turing in that period accounted for about 16% to 17%. The relative
share of electric power, gas and water more than doubled, from 0.7% to
1.5% of QDP.
2.02      Official planning is now based on a GDP growth rate of the
order of 7% per year, compared to actual growth rates of 6.5% in 1969,
5.8% in 1968 and below 5% in the preceding years. To support this
increased development effort, the Government has boee rapidly improving
the coordination of the different elements of economic policy, planning
more systematically the public sector, and making much needed changes
in sectoral policies, institutions and priorities. However, the real-
ization of Colombia's considerable growth prospects will still remain
dependent on continued coordinated effort between the external financing
agencies and the Colombian Government.
2.03      Colombia occupies a territory of 1,139,000 kn2, crossed on
the western part by a mountain system with three north-south cordilleras,
ranging up to 5,000 m in altitude, which divide the country into three
main geographic regions: Costa Atlantica (northern), Andina (central
and western) and Llanos Orientales (eastern). Near 99% of the population
live in the Costa Atlantica and Andina regions, which comprise abouw 40%
of the area of the country and are divided politically into Departamentos
and the Distrito Especial de Bogota. The Llanos Orientales region has an
extreuely low population density and minimum economic development, with
practically no electrification. The electric sector is therefore geo-
graphically located in the northern, central and western regions of the
country, which, because of the extensive mountain system, have important
potential hydroelectric resources.
2.04      At the end of 1968, the total installed generating capacity in
Colombia was 1,940 MW, including 250 Ml in privately owned plants.  The
total generation in 1968 was 7,500 GWh, including 1,000 GWh generated in
the private plants; 74% of the electric energy generated by the public
utilities was of hydro origin.  Public service was supplied alost
wholly by the following four entities (the figures in brackets are
installed capacities at the end of 1968):



(i)  EEEB (471 MW), a municipal utility for electrical
service only, which supplies energy to Bogota and
the Departamento de Cundinamarca, directly and by
bulk supply to departmental rural distributing
agencies and subsidiaries of ICEL.
(ii)  EPM (450 MW), a municipal utility providing elec-
tricity, water/sewerage and telecommunications
services, which supplies electric energy to Me-
dellin and the Departamento de Antioquia, directly
and by bulk supply to the rural distributing sub-
sidiary of ICEL.
(iii)  CVC (270 MW, including CHIDRAL's plants), a multi-
purpose, autonomous, nationally-chartered regional
entity for the development of the Cauca Valley, which
supplies electric energy to the Departamento de Valle,
mainly by bulk supply to Empresas Municipales de Cali
(EMCALI) and to other rural distributing agencies,
subsidiaries of ICIL and CVC.
(iv)  ICEL (466 MW, including 67 MW of CHEC's plants), a
National Government Institute, formerly called
Electraguas, which through 15 departmental and 13
minor subsidiaries supplies electric energy to the
rest of the northern, central and western regions
of the country.
2.05      The development of the Colombia electric sector in recent years
has been remarkable: in the last 12 years the energy demand has increased
at an average rate of approximately 11% per year, which is expected to be
at least maintained in the next decade, as the prospects are that GDP will
grow at a higher rate than in the past (paras. 2.01 and 2.02). In
spite of this, the average per capita annual consumption in 1968 was about
375 kWh, below the Latin America average of approximately 475 kWh. The
extensive geography and the rugged mountain chains have isolated the various
regional centers, which traditionally have developed separately their own
customs, regional institutions and economic resources, and also their own
electric systems. The levels of electric development and consumption are
substantially different between regions, and even more so between urban and
rural areas. The average per capita annual consumption in some Departamentos
is of the order of 500 kWh, but in others does not reach 100 kWh. While in
the 30 cities of more than 30,000 inhabitants the average consumption in
1968 was 565 kWh, about 70% of the country's rural population did not have
any electric service at all. Furthermore, the parochial attitude prevailing
in the various regional electric systems sometnwes has caused uneconomic
development of the country's power sector. This has been more noticeable
in recent years, when the need to supply higher and rapidly increasing
demands has showin the advantages of the integration and joint planning of
the sector, which will pernit the development of larger and more economic
projects and a better utilization of the country's energy resources. Had



-6-
the central interconnection been accomplished earlier, it would have avoided
power shortages recently experienced in the Caucs Valley (para. 1.05).
2.06      As indicated in paragraph 2.o41, the principal population centers
in the country are served by autonomous local or national agencies, with
state systuis controlled by ICEL providing service in the rural areas and
some secondary population centers. In some of the latter, electricity is
provided, by municipal undertakings which in many instances rely upon the
ICEL systess for bulk supply. The principal cities have enjoyed the bene-
fits of sophisticated planning by the utilities serving that, whereas the
development of the rest of the country has at times been haphazard and
uncoordinated. Recognizing this, the Government working through ICEL and
the major urban "eIpresas" is attempting to improve planning by grouping
the smaller systems into six zones and delegating the responsibility for
coordination of supply within each zone. This represents a departure from
the hitherto highly centralized and sometimes unresponsive control exerted
by ICEL's predecessor.  For example, a new ageancy, Corporacion Electrica de
la Costa Atlmstica, has been created to construct and operate major steam-
electric plants and high voltage transmission faeilities to provide coordi-
nated supply to Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Sincelejo, etc., which
were being supplied separately frm isolated  alL plants.  In the long
term it is likely that more intensive development of later-regional trans-
mission facilities at 230 kV and higher voltages will gradually bring about
integration of the sector, and permit the realization of economies of scale
through the construction of larger plants. The ISA system will form the
keystone for this developnent.
2.07      For many years the Bank has urged the eatabliahment of  a compre-
hensive., rational public utility tariff policy In Colombia, but until re-
cently, tariff adjustments have been granted on an ad hoc basis, aud some-
times they have been too small and too late. At present, the situahion is
much improved with respect to the power sector. In December 1968, tbe
Government instituted the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos
(Junta), as part of Planeacion, to regulate public utility tariffs., appro-
priately structuring and adjusting them to cover operating expenditures
and provide a reasonable return on revalued assets to permit the orderly
financing of expansion. The Junta has been able to process a good part of
the backlog of'applications by electric power agencies. Notwithstanding,
much work remains to be done to bring about national uniformity in accounting,
reporting, valuation techniques, etc.



3. THE BOROWER
3.01      ISA is a stock corporation established on September 14, 1967 under
Colombian commercial law. Its authorized stock capital at present amounts to
Col$200 million, divided into 2,000 shares with a nominal value of Col$100,000
each.  The founding menbers have subscribed and paid for in Colombian currency
200 shares representing a total of Col$20 million as follows:
50 shares                 Col$ 5,000,000
E1H4                50 shares                       5,000,000
CVC                 49 shares                       4,900,000
CHIDIRAL             1 share                          100,000
ICEL                49 shares                       4,900,000
CIIEC                1 share                          100,000
TOTAL              200 shares                  Col$20,000,000
Since CVC is th? major owner of CHIDRAL, and CHEC is a subsidiary of ICEL,
it is considered that ISA's sponsors are EEE, EPM, CVC/CHIDRAL and ICEL/
N6IC; each is represented on ISA's four member board of directors.
3.0'2     ISA's statutory purposes are the interconnection of the sponsors'
electric systems and the planning, construction, ownership and operation of
new powier generating plants in the interconnected system (see Map 1). All
major generation projects in the system will be built by ISA, with the ex-
ception of the following plants under construction in 1967, which will be
completed and wholly owned by the respective sponsors: E1 Colegio (300 MW),
Canoas (148 KW) and Alto Muna (future) (EEEB); Guatape (560 MW) (EPM); San
Francisco (135 MW) (CHEC); and Calima I (120. Mi) (CVC). CVC/CHIDRAL re-
served the option to build and own Alto Anchicaya, and have since exercised
it. ISA's Estatutos outline procedures for financing ISA's investments and
guiding its operations, differentiating between the interconnection network
and generating plant 1projects.  In both cases, it is contemplated that the
foreign exchange component of the investments would be financed by external
loans.
3.03      The Estatutos  establish that the four sponsors will provide in
equal parts the necessary funds to finance the interconnection network, re-
ceiving ISA shares, and that they will be guarantors of credits and loans
to ISA for the network. The Estatutos define also how the sponsors con-
tribute to the operating expenses of the interconnection network, and re-
quire that the energy transferred will be bought by ISA from the supplier
and sold1 to the recipient at no benefit or loss to ISA.
3.04      Regarding IoA's generating plants, the Estatutos contemplate  that
they will be financed by the sponsors as follows: 40% by subscription of
ISA stock in equal parts by the four sponsors, and 60% by bond sales to the
sponsors in the proportions necessary to have each sponsor's total contribu-
tion proportional to its agreed participation in the output of the plant.
The present Estatutos are silent with respect to the sponsors' obligations
to be guarantors of credits and loans to ISA for generating plant projects.
The Estatutos stipulate  that ISA's tariffs for the energy generated in its
plants should be sufficient to provide for operating expenses, debt service



-8-
and payment of dividends on the stock associated with each plant at least
equivalent to the current interest rate in Colombia.
3.05      All these provisions of ISA's Estatutos regarding the intercon-
nection network and the generating plants are used in chapter 6 of this
report to analyze ISA's financial plan for the period 1969-78, including
the completion of construction and the operation from mid-1971 of ISA's
first interconnection project, financed by Loan 575-OD (see para. 1.05)
and the construction and the operation from mid-1975 of ISA 's first
generating plant, the proposed Chivor ProJect. The present FEtatutos
are generally acceptable, but contain some shortcomings needing reso-
lution, in particular:
(a) With regard to the pricing of energy transfers among the sponsors
through ISA's network, the method to determine the supplier's
tariff, based on a return on its investment, should be defined
more precisely to take into account the lack of uniformity in
accounting methods among the sponsors and the different values
of the various classes of energy (peak, base, emergency, dump,etc.)
(b)  Regarding ISA's generating plants, the Estatutos should establish
the sponsors' obligations to be guarantors of credits and loans to
ISA., and should include more complete and definite criteria and
methods to schedule the operation of the plants and to price the
various classes of energy generated.
ISA agreed, in connection with Loan 575-C0, to study these shortcomings
of the Eatatutos with the assistance of consultants. Such a study is
now underway by the Swiss firnm of Motor-Columbus, financed from the pro-
ceeds of Loan 575-0), to be completed by the end of 1970. ISA has in-
dicated that it will be prepared to modify the Ebtatutos in accordance
with the results of this study. Daring negotiations, ISA agreed that
the revision of the Estatutos will be effected before mid-1971, When
the interconnection network will start operation. The Bank will have
an opportunity to approve the proposed revisions before their adoption.
3.06      ISA is administered by the General Assembly of Shareholders,
the Board of Directors, and the General Manager. The General Assembly
elects the Board's four members, and the Board appoints for two years
the General Manager and his two Deputies (Administrative and Technical),
who may be reappointed inrdefLaitely.  The resolutions of the General
Assembly or the Board are adopted by the favorable vote of at least 75%
of the shares or 3 of its 4 members, respectively. The General Manager
is ISA's legal representative for all its commitments.
3.07      ISA's planned organization (see Annex 12) includes five adsinis-
trative and five technical departments. The Bank's experience with ISA in
the administration of Loan 575-CO and in the appraisal of the Chivor Pro-
ject has been satisfactory. Assisted by consultants, ISA is managing the
interconnection project acceptably. ISA is a new, not-yet fully tried
organization, but no problems are foreseen regarding its capacity to
manage the construction of, and to operate the interconnection network
and generating plant projects, for which ISA will have the support of its



- 9 -
sponsors' experienced personnel and facilities for training. ISA's manage-
ment has been successful in recruiting well-qualified personnel, and all of
the departments are at present appropriately staffed.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Market
4.01      The annual peak loads, gross generation and corresponding load
factorsV/ for each of the sponsor systems in the period 1959-68 are shown
in Annex 1.  Operating results for 1968 and installed capacities at the end
of that year were:
EEEB      EPM     CVC/CHIDRAL    CHEC    TOTAL
Peak Load (MW)             350.1      327.0     211.0         75.5     915.4
Gross Generation (GWh)   1,629.7   1,698.4   1,033.9         373.4   4,735.4
Load Factor (%)              53.1      59.1       56.o        56.2      59.0
Installed Capacity (MW)    471.0      450.o     270.0         67.0   1,258.0
Because the time incidence of system peak load varies between sponsors, the
coincident peak load on the interconnected system is expected to be about 5%
lower than the aggregate of the individual peaks.  The following data sum-
marize the overall annual rates of growth experienced:
ESEB      EPM      CVC/CHIDRAL      CHEC
Period                     1959-68   1959-68       1960-68     1964-68
Overall Rate of Growth:
(% per year)
- Peak Load              11.8      9.3          11.7          6.4
- Gross Generation       11.9      9.9         12.0           7.6
Examination of historical data reveals wide fluctuations in growth rates and
load factors, reflecting economic problems of the country which depressed mar-
ket growth in some years and brought about financial difficulties in the sector
contributing to shortages of power. However, remarkable stability has been
manifested in later years, and a more orderly development in the future is ex-
pected. The CHEC system has shown an increasing rate of growth in 1968 and
1969, higher than the 1964-68 average, caused by a relatively rapid industrial
development in the area of Manizales, which is expected to continue in future
years.
4.02      The market forecasts of each sponsor, based on an examination of the
past, and projection of trendz ln the future, with due account, of planned eco-
nomic development through the 'sponsor's area, have been reviewed by the Bank,
and the following annual rates of growth forecast by each sponsor have been
used in this report for the peak load and gross generation demand forecasts
of each system up to 1980 (see Annex 2):
RFR              12%      (1969-1972) and 10% (1973-1980)
EPM               9%      (1969-1980)
CVC/CHIDRAL      10%      (1969-1980)
CHEC             10%      (1969-1980)
1/ the ratio of average load to peak load



- 11 -
Statistical data on past rates of growth (para. 4.01) show that the peak load
and gross generation have increased at a fairly comparable rate, the data on
the CHEC system having minor significance in this respect not only because the
period involved is short but also because the system itself is relatively small.
Furthermore, as the high rates of growth forecast for the four systems start
from rather low levels of per capita consumption, it is likely that the favor-
able effect on the load factor of the increase in industrial consumption will
be compensated by a rapid increase in domestic uses of electricity.1/ The pre-
diction used in the forecasts that the 1968 load factors of each system will be
maintained is, therefore, justified.
14.03     The rates of growth adopted are slightly lower, as an average, than
11% predicted for the whole Colombian electric sector (para. 2.05). Should
the actual growth of the sponsors' markets be larger than the forecasts, higher
utilization of the existing and planned plants, including Chivor in the initial
years of its operation, and eventually the installation of short construction
term generating facilities, such as gas turbine units, would be required.
Power Generation Program
4.04      The existing generating plants and those under construction in the
four sponsors' systems, including Alto Anchicaya (340 MW) under construction
by CVC/CHIDRAL for initial operation in 1974., can meet the interconnected
system demand forecasts up to 1975. Several studies have been carried out by
ISA, its consultants Ingetec-Integral and Planeacion to determine the most
suitable and economic schedule of new generating plant construction in the
interconnected system to meet the demand forecasts up to 1980. These studies
took into account the 16-month dry periods that are likely to occur once in
seven to ten vears and the need for a 10% reserve margin in capacity. These
are reasonable planning criteria.  Following is a summary of these studies and
their conclusions which have been found acceptable.
)J.oL°    At the present time there are two hydroelectric development possi-
bilities the studies for which are sufficiently advanced to be considered
realistic alternatives for supplying the additional generating capacity needed
in 1975 and later years: the proposed Chivor plant (500 MW) and the second
stage (280 NW) of Guatape Project in Medellin. The Bank suggested consider-
ation be given to construction of new thermal capacity as an additional
alternative, and a major steam plant and a gas turbine installation were
studied. The principal question to be resolved was the most economic sequence
in which the plants should be constructed. Using computer models which per-
mitted the investigation to encompass variations in timing of investments,
assumecd operating and fuel costs, reservoir usage, etc., the studies con-
firned that the construction of Chivor for initial operation in 1975 was the
most attractive alternative from both the economic and system operation view-
points. Thus, the interconnected sponsors and ISA will be completing Alto
Anehicaya by 19714, Chivor by 1975, and in the meanwhile continuing studies
to confirm the choice of the next increment to generating capacity required
beyond then.
1/ ftesidentiil consumption, part-.cularly where consumer usage is relatively
low, usually is associated with load factors low compared to industrial
cons3umption.



_ 12 -
Utilization of Chivor
4.06      Under the assumption of average hydraulic conditions in the years
following initial operation of Chivor, its contribution to meeting the re-
quirements of the interconnected system will gradually increase (as the
overall market grows) from 181 GWh in 1975 to 3,677 GWh in 1980 (see Annex
3). The average annual generation of Chivor thereafter will be 3,477 G'lJh.
Thus, the 500 MW first phase installation will be operated at the very high
utilization factor of 79%. This confinns the desirability of later expand-
ing the plant to 1,000 MW and shiftingits operation from base load to peaking
generation, when the system demand and generating capacity reach appropriate
levels.
ProJect Justification
4.07      The studies of the power generation program justify the building
of Chivor as part of the most feasible and economic schedule of new power
plants in the interconnected system for ensuring that the system demand
up to 1980 will be met. The planning criteria (see para. 4.04) may appear
somewhat conservative, but are  justified in this case given the inherent
uncertainties in the projections of the demand and also in the time required
to construct large hydroelectric projects such as Alto Anchicaya and Chivor.
The Chivor Project itself, described in the next chapter, has been soundly
conceived, and its estimated cost, equivalent to about US$228/installed lid,
is relative2y low, especially taking into account that the present invest-
ment for 500 MW includes an important component (the dam in particular)
common to this phase and the future expansion. It is estimated that the
overall cost of the whole 1,000 MJ plant will be equivalent to about
US$150/installed kW.

5. THE PROJWECT
Project Description
5.01      The Chivor Project consists of the first phase of a hydroelectric
plant on the Bata River, with 500 MW installed capacity, and a 180 ka
double-circuit 230 kV transmission line to ISA's 230 kV transmission net-
work now under construction. The installed capacity will be expanded in
the future to a total of about 1,000 MW. The site is located about 120 km
northeast of Bogota, in the highlands of the Cuavio, Bata and Lengupa Rivers,
tributaries of the Upia River (see Maps 1 and 2).
5.02      The average flow of the Bata River at the dam site in the 13-year
period of record is 62.5 m3sec. In view of the gradient of the River and
the characteristics of the valley at the Esmeralda site, preliminary studies
of both rockfill and concrete arch dams were carried out. These studies,
including sub-surface exploration, revealed that the rockfill design had
some cost advantages, whereas the suitability of the geology to an arch
structure wa.s so questionable that the arch-type dam had to be discarded.
The crest elevation is 8 m above the maximum water level in the reservoir,
to provide a safe surge storage margin and increase spillway capacity
in case of a very high flow, or seismic waves. The reservoir wiZl have a
total storage capacity of 815 million m3, of which 665 million m, are use-
ful.  The estimated reduction of capacity due to silting is 2 million m3
annually. The powerhouse will be located on the right bank of the Lengupa
River, and a pressure tunnel and steel penstock will convey the water from
the reservoir, developing an average net head of 756 m.  The plant's annual
generation with average hydraulic conditions will be 3,477 GWh.
5.03      The Project will consist of the following principal elements:
(a) Esmeralda dam: rockfill type with central impervious
core on a concrete block; 230 m high from lowest point
in the foundation and 280 m long at crest e evation;
total volume of dam of about 10.9 million mi.
(b)  A spillw :  open channel, gated, for maximum flow of
13,000 m /sec. This large capacity, much greater than
required for floods of one in 10,000 year frequency
(4,000 m3/sec), will provide a desirable safety margin
against possible seismic effects as noted in paragraph
5.o2, or in the event of surges caused by landslides
into the reservoir.
(c) A 5,750 m long, 6 m equivalent diameter pressure tunnel
and a 2,000 m long, 3.9 a diameter surface-mounted steel
penstock. Intake works, a gate shaft and 100 m of the
second (future) pressure tunnel will be built at the
same time.
(d) A powerhouse with four units, each one consisting of a
175,000 hp Pelton type turbine for gross head ranging
from 718 to 805 m, a 125 MW alternator, three single
phase 13.8 kV/230 kV step-up transformers and related
auxiliary electrical and mechanical equipment.



- 14 -
(e)  An outdoor switchyard including appropriate switching
and control and protectiorn equipuent.
(f)  A 180 hn 230 kV dou7ole-circuit trans.ission line and
the necessary worics and equipmnent to connect this line
to EEEB's 115 kV system at Suba and to ISA's 230 kV
network at La Mesa.
(g) About 30 km of relocated access roa from Somondoco to
Santa Maria, and 8 ka of &ccess roads to the works.
The design is well defined and suitable for making a realistic cost estimate
and a construction schedule.
Project Schedule
5.04      ISA and Ingetec have prepared a network-type project schedule, using
the Critical Path Method (CPM). The schedule is realistic. The resultant
completion time for unit 1 initial operation is June 1975.
Project Cost Estimate
5.05      The estimated cost of the Project is equivalent to about US$114.2
million, of which the equivalent of about US$65.7 Ltllion would be in
foreign exchange. Annex 4 shows the estimated detailed schedule of ex-
penditures for the Project. A surmary is presented below. The proposed Bank
loan of US$52.3 million would finance items marked (*) and a proportionate
amount of the contingencies.                                            % of

5.06      The cost estimates of the various parts of the Project have been
carefully and conservatively prepared, and are acceptable.  The civil works
estimates have been calculated from the design quantities and the corre-
sponding estimated unit costs, for which data on material costs and siailar
local and foreign precedents are available.  The cost estimates of the main
equipment are based on preliminary quotations received from manufacturers,
and for the liner and penstock, on previous experience in Colombia. For
the rest of the Project, the experience with recent comparable procurement
has been used. Different provisions for contingencies have been allowed
for the various civil works and equipment cost estimates; the resultant total
provisions for contingencies in civil works and equipment represent about 20%
and 13% of the respective total cost estimates. These are reasonable margins
for a project of this type.
5.07      The local currency component of the civil works estimates includes
primarily the costs of manpower and Colombian materials. The foreign ex-
change component represents the estimated costs of construction machinery,
import materials, and supervision personnel, general expenditures and profits
of foreign contractors. The resultant estimate of the local currency compo-
nent of the civil works is comparable to that actually obtained in recent
similar works in Colombia.  The engineering would be local in a very large
proportion (about 90%); the foreign cost component represents the cost of
several foreign specialist consultants.
5.08      ISA would insure the works and equipment against all reasonably
insurable risks during the construction period, and also the plant in
operation.  Moreover, ISA is preparing at the Bank's request an appro-
priate plan for accident prevention.
ProJect Management and Ehgineering
5.09      As Map 1 shows, Chivor is closer to Bogota than to the other systems,
and preliminary investigations and engineering activities for Chivor were
started by EEEB some time ago (para. 1.03), before the formation of ISA. With
the decision to proceed with construction, ISA's Board decided that ISA would
assume full overall responsibility for the Project, and set up the basic ar-
rangements for the project management and engineering whereby use will be
made of the operational capability of EEEB, while at the same time promoting
the development of ISA. EEEB will be responsible to ISA for the engineering
carried out by Ingetec, a continuation of this consultant's previous investi-
gations, studies and design work on Chivor. Ingetec will continue to use the
consulting services of specialist advisers of international reputation in
various fields of the Project.  The organizations of and arrangements between
ISA, EEEB and Ingetec to carry out their respective responsibilites appear
appropriate. Efficient and sound project management and engineering may be
expected.



- 16 -
Procurement
5.10      The procurement for the Project would include the main and several
minor civil works contracts and several main and minor equipment orders.
Civil works would be contracted for on the basis of unit prices. The equip-
mer', orders would include transportation to site and erection; in the case
of the penstock the related civil works would be included as well. All the
(ontracts and orders financed by the proposed Bank loan would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive biddinz. Prequalification of con-
tractors for th( main civil works contract has been completed, and bidding is
presently underway. Colombian general contractors or suppliers are not ex-
pected to compete for this contract or for the major equipment orders, al-
though Colombian firms might be subcontractors. On the other hand, Colombian
firms would compete for the minor civil works contracts and for a few minor
orders for auxiliary and miscellaneous equiprment.  It has been estimated
that the average foreign components of such contracts and orders awarded to
local contractors and suppliers would be 40AC' and 7C%., respectively, of their
total costs. The Colombian Government has requested and during negotiations
the Bank agreed to a margin of preference for domestic suppliers of these
minor equipment orders equal to the total of taxes generally applicable to
the importation of such equipment into Colombia to the extent that such
total does not exceed the equivalent of 15% of the CIF price of the equip-
ment. The locally awarded equipment orders are expected to amount to a
total of about US$850,000 equivalent of which about US$600,000 equivalent
would be foreign components. The Bank's previous experience with procure-
ment carried out by IS4A EEEB and Ingetec has been satisfactory.  ISA will
order the main equipment from sources with which it will arrange bilateral
credits.
Disbursement
5.11      The proposed loan would be disbursed only for the actual foreign
exchange payments under the civil works contracts and minor equipment orders,
and for engineering services and interest during construction on the loan.
In the case of minor civil works contracts and minor equipment orders
awarded to Colombian firms, the Bank would disburse against 40% and 7C%,
respectively, of the actual cost of the workc performed and ex-factory prices.
Any loan funds surplus after completion of the project disbursements would
be cancelled.

6. FINANCIAL PLANS
Interconexion Electrica S.A.
6.01      ISA was created by its sponsors to achieve joint objectives of
coordinated planning, construction and operation which would have been
difficult to realize without the intemnediary of a comnonly-owned corpo-
ration. In particular, the sponsors have agreed to make available to ISA
funds for expansion which they would have been unable to lend to, or in-
vest in, other sponsors for the same purpose.  Thus ISA is wholly depen-
dent upon the sponsors, and its Estatutos reflect these arrangements. ISA
must rely upon them for meeting local currency requirements, and its
foreign borrowings for the interconnection network are made with their
guarantee (paras. 3.02 to 3.04). ,Ideed, as noted, the sponsors must
contribute to ISA's operating expenses, and their total payments to ISA
must also defray amortization and interest payments on debt. Therefore,
ISA's finances cannot be examined by themselves and, in order to develop
a comprehensive appreciation of its financial position, the sponsors must
be examined separately and then all considered on a consolidated basis.
6.02      The local currency investment requirements of the interconnection
project are being financed as provided for in the Estatutos by stock pay-
ments, and the foreign exchange component is being raised by joint financing
by Loan 575-00 together with four supplier countries' credits. The operating
and administrative expenses of the interconnection network will be paid by
the sponsors in proportion to the total energy sold annually by each of them
to bulk and retail customers other than ISA. Depreciation charges, interest
on credits and loans and amortization payments in excess of depreciation will
be contributed by the four sponsors in equal parts. The energy transferred
through the interconnection network will be bought by ISA from the suppliers
and sold to the recipients at prices which balance the revenues and expenses
of ISA in the transfer. The local currency component of the Chivor Project,
estimated at Col$839.0 million plus Col$196.4 million interest during con-
struction on bonds, and Col$46.2 million  equivalent to the interest charges
on bilateral credits during construction would be financed by issuing to the
sponsors Col$432.6 million in shares and Col$649.0 million in bonds (as noted
in para. 1.02, 91.8% of the bonds for Chivor will be purchased by EEEB and
8.2% by EPM). The Project's foreign exchange cost would be financed by the
proposed Bank loan of US$52.3 million equivalent and by bilateral credits of
US$22.8 million equivalent. For the Bank loan a 30-year tenm including a
grace period of about 7 years is appropriate, and interest at 7% per year
has been assumed. For the bilateral credits, a 1 0-year ternm from delivery
of the goods and interest rate at 7.5% have been assumed. Consequently, the
proposed financing of the Project is as follows:

It should be noted that all the projections for ISA and the sponsors have
been made on the basis of current prices and exchange rate. No allowance
has been made for possible future changes of local price levels, or for
fluctuations of the exchange rate. This approach is justified by recent
experience in Colombia where the Government has been pursuing the en-
lightened policy of adjusting electric tariffs (and revenues) quickly to
changing conditions in the economy.
6.04      The 1969-1978 financial projections, shown in Annexes 5 to 11,
cover Chivor's construction period and, since operation of the first unit
starts in mid-1975 while construction and erection work for the remaining
units is still going on, the first 3A years of its operation. About 1980/81
generation facilities in addition to the Guatape II - Santa Rita plant,
whose construction by EPM is already contemplated, will be required, which
means that additional expendibtres will have to be made in ISA's system or
in the systems of the other sponsors by about 1977. However, the next
addition to capacity has not yet been determined, and so its cost has not
been shown in the projections. The effect is small in the years covered,
and this omission does not affect the soundness of the financing plans.
6.05      As pointed out in paragraph 3.04, ISA's Estatutos in their pre-
sent fornm only cite the various items which must be covered by revenues
from sales of energy generated, but they do not define precisely the
method for pricing this energy. Furthermore, although they require that
the charges for sales of energy be adequate to pay all costs, including
capital costs, they do not discriminate between charges for capacity and
charges for energy. For purposes of analysis, ISA has arbitrarily assumed
that the sponsors will pay for their energy purchases at the low price of
Col 6¢/kWh (equivalent to US  3.5 mills/kWh) and for their capacity entitle-
ment at prices suitable to provide the balance of revenue requirements.
These total charges, when Chivor's output is fully utilized, would be about
Col 9¢/kWh (equivalent to US 5.2 mills/kWh). This is reasonable and com-
pares favorably to costs of power generated in the sponsors' systems.
6.06      ISA's financial "perfornmance  is merely a reflection of the
condition of its sponsors. As long as the sponsors discharge their
obligations under ISA's Estatutos. its financial situation will be sound.
Therefore, a breach of the Estatutos will be a condition of default under
the proposed loan. The financial projections show that the combined oper-
ations of ISA and its sponsors should produce during 1970-1978 a rate of
return on all their assets of about 9% to about 12%, showing that the pro-
posed financing plan is reasonable in this respect. In view of the fact
that the method for pricing the energy generated by ISA's plants is not
yet defined, the rate of return covenant of Loan 575-00, requiring ISA's
revenues to be sufficient to provide a 9% minimum rate of return on
currently valued net generation plant assets in operation,is also a re-
quirement of the proposed loan.



- 20 -
Sponsors' Position
6.07      To assure that the sponsors will be able to meet their obligations
to ISA, a detailed examination of the actual and forecast financial positions
of EEEB., EPM and. CVC/CHIDRAL has been made and is presented in Annexes 9, 10
and 11. ICEL/CHEC will fulfill its obligations with appropriations from the
national budget, a provision which the Government has confirmed.
6.o8      The financial situation of EEEB is satisfactory.  EEEB will thus
be able to meet its obligations to ISA during this period. The actual rates
of return on revalued assets in service are acceptable. The 9% required by
Loan >37-C will be achieved about mid-1970. when the latest tariff increase
(Nar 1969) will have been in effect for about one year. The debt/equity ratio
duzing the future years is quite acceptable, becoming lower than 50:50 after
1969.
6.o9      EPM's financial standing and forecast cash position are also
satisfactory, and will enable EPM to make the necessary contributions to
ISA. The principal measure of performance set forth in Loan 369-oD is a
40% contribution to expansion, which is being achieved. The limitation on
the incurrence of debt, expressed as a 60:40 debt/equity ceiling, is also
being observed when account is taken of the severe devaluation of the
Colombian currency since the loan was made. That is, on the basis of assets
and equity revalued, the test is met. Annex 10 shows calculations of debt/
equity ratios on two bases: with the book value of assets and with the
revalued assets.
6.10      CVC/CHIDRAL is the only sponsor that needs substantial assist-
ance to meet its obligations to ISA. These agencies have in the past
perennially experienced straitened financial cirewastances, due in part
to their failure to make timely application for tariff increases,and
subsequent delays by the Government in granting them.  This situation is
much improved, as has been noted in paragraphs 2.07 and 6.03. In connection
with Loan 575-00, the Government agreed to make contributions amounting to
Col$200 million to CVC/CHIDRAL during 1969-72 at the rate of Col$50 million
per year. Recent CVC/CHIDRAL forecasts, taking into account these contributions,
nevertheless show cash deficits in the period 1970 through 1973, arising mainly
from the need to make substantial investments in Alto Anchicaya, presently
under construction with financing from Canada and the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank (IDB). In the course of the appraisal, the nature and magnitude of
the finascial problems involved were identified, and possible solutions were
analyzed in detail.  Prior to negotiations the Government confirmed to the
Bank it would make available to CVC/CHIDRAL 8-year credits of Col$11.6
million in 1970, and Col$55.0 million in each of 1971 and 1972. However,
funds additional to these will be required during 1971-1973 in an amount
of about Col$220 million, of which about Col$40 million will be derived from
a Col 1.00/kWh increase in tariffs to become effective July 1, 1970. The
balance will be provided by the Government, as required by a specific under-



- 21 -
taking to this effect obtained during negotiations. Planeacion has indicated
that the necessary funds will be provided in the fozu of 8-year 10% credits.
These credits would be required in 1972 (Col$80 million) and 1973 (Col$100
million).  CVC/CHIDRAL's projected financial position is satisfactory.
6.11      When examining Annexes 9 and 11, it can be seen that EEM  and
CVC/CHIDRAL will build up a considerable amount of cash in later years,
especially after 1974. The surpluses are a financial indication that,
by interconnecting the four main electric systems of central Colombia,
savings in cost and cash requirements for new investbents will materiaJlize.
Furthermore, this situation arises because there are substantial equity in-
vestments in each system, upon which no dividends ever have been paid nor are
any scheduled to be paid in the future. Another reason is that debt service
requirements are proportionately lower as the slowdown in expansion require-
merits due to the interconnection will reduce the need for new borrowings,
while outstanding obligations will continue to be amortized. To make proper
use of the "surplus" funds, one could visualize dividend payments on invest-
ments to the Government and/or Municipalities which could be used as sources
of funds for other sectors. Future reductions in rate of return targets
might be conceivable, which would imply reductions in tariffs, thus enabling
the customers to participate in the benefits.
Accounts and Audits
6.12      The firm of Price Waterhouse has alreacV set up an accounting
system for ISA. ISA has retained the services of Arthur Andersen, a
qualified independent firu acceptable to the Bank, as its auditors.

7. AGREMEHNTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations in March 1970, the following agreements
were reached:
(a) The Estatutos will be revised in a mamner acceptable to the
Bank not later than June 30, 1971. The scope of the study
by the consultants towards this revision has been expanded
and clearly defined to include recomeendations regarding
the operation of Chivor and the pricing of its generation
(paragraph 3.05). A breach of the Estatutos would consti-
tute a breach of the proposed agreement with the Bank
(paragraph 6.06).
(b) ISA's sponsors will be guarantors 6f the proposed Bank loan,
and of other loans and credits to ISA for the Project under
arrangements acceptable to the Bank (paragraphs 3.04 and
3.05).
(a) ISA will use its best efforts to obtain credits on reason-
able terms from supplier countries to finance as large a
portion as possible of the foreign costs of the main
equipment orders (paragraphs 1.01 and 6.02).
(d) For the minor civil works contracts awarded to local
contractors, the Bank loan would be disbursed against 40%
of the actual cost of work performed, this percentage
representing the estimated average foreign component of
such contracts (paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11).
Ce) For the minor equipment orders supplied from Colombia, the
Bank loan would be disbursed against 70% of their ex-factory
prices, this percentage representing the estimated average
foreign component of such local supply. Domestic suppliers
would be allowed a margin of preference in evaluation of bids
for these minor equipment orders equal to the total of taxes
generally applicable to the importation of such equipment
into Colombia to the extent that such total does not exceed
the equivalent of 15% of the CIF price of the equipment
(paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11).
(f) Funds required by CVC/CHIDRAL to meet their obligations will
be provided by the Government (paragraph 6.10).

1/ Gross generation assuming average hydraulic conditions, a plant availability of 90%
and that from 1976, with Chivor in operation, the utilization of the thermal plants
in EEEB and CVC/CHIDRAL systems will be reduced to 30%. The figures for EEEB syster¶
include an increase in generation from 1976 onwards due to the contribution to the
Bogota River from the planned Chingaza Water project (see Map 2).
