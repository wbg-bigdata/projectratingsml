REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR AN
IRRIGATION PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma for
the equivalent of US$17 million on standard IDA terms to help finance
an irrigation project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        The latest economic report entitled "The Current Situation and
Prospects of the Union of Burma" (168a-BA) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 25, 1973. Country data are provided in Annex I.
2.        Burma is the largest country in the south-east Asian mainland
and the country is rich in natural resources. However, most of this wealth
is yet to be developed and the per capita income of Burma is still well
below $100. Burma came out of the Second World War and the struggle for
independence in 1948 economically devastated and politically divided.
The fifties were a period of turbulence, both political and economic. When
the present Covernment came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to
unify the country and complete the social transformation of the economy which
had begun in the forties.
3.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the
attainment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still
problem particularly in the hill and border areas but there is probably
greater stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization
of all the major sectors with the exception of agriculture has been accom-
plished. Agrarian reform has given the peasants virtual ownership of the
land and eliminated major inequalities in the pattern of landholdings.
In the effort to attain self-sufficiency, most of what little investment
there has been has gone into the development of the industrial sector.
This transformation has been accomplished at the cost of some economic
disruption and its benefits are yet to be reaped.
4.        The Government's major success has been in the provision of
advanced social services for a population of about 30 million. Efforts
were made to raise the standard of living by reducing inequalities in the
distribution of income, keeping the prices of basic commodities stable and
widening the scope of education and health services. Disparities exist but
incomes are more or less equally distributed and, in the fields of health
and education, Burma has achieved successes surpassing those of much richer
countries. These successes have been accomplished, however, at the expense
of dynamic economic growth. Over the past decade, the rate of growth barely
kept pace with the population, which is growing at around 3 percent per annum.



- 2 -
5.        The performance of the major sectors has been disappointing.
Agriculture directly provides about one-third of GDP, and much of secondary
and tertiary activity is also based on agricultural products. Over the
past decade, the real rate of growth of agriculture (after allowing for
fluctuations due to weather) was less than 2%o per annum. The main factors
constraining the growth of agriculture are the disproportionately low level
of investment in agriculture and the unwillingness of the Government (until
last year) to use pricing policy to stimulate increases in production. The
low level of investment has left the rice subsector with little technical
capability for further expansion in the short run, and the emphasis on price
stability has been a factor depressing the production of several crops.
6.        Diversification of the overall structure of production has to
be achieved through an expansion of the share of industry in GDP, and
Burma's potential for expanding the industrial sector is basically good. So
far, however, Burma has not been very successful in pursuing industrial
growth. This has been due to an important degree to such factors as the lack
of capital, the slow growth of agricultural production and the shortage of
foreign exchange but it has also been due to the neglect of the small-scale
(largely private) sector which still accounts for more than half of value-added
in manufacturing; inadequate pricing policies; insufficient replacement of
existing capacity; lack of incentives; lack of correspondence with market
forces and inadequate attention to putting the state enterprises on a self-
sustained, economically viable basis.
7.        The foreign trade and balance of payments position provide the
most striking illustration of the continued deterioration of the economy.
Rice is the major export and the most serious consequence of the stagnation
in rice production coupled with an expanding population has been the drying
up of the export surplus. In the early sixties, Burma exported a million-
and-a-half tons of rice a year. Since then exports fell steadily to less
than 400,000 tons in 1968 and 1969, which were poor crop years. In recent
years, there was a recovery to about 700,000 tons but this is well below
the prewar average of 3 million tons. Exports of teak and minerals which
have good market prospects have dwindled; mineral production is one-tenth
the prewar level and teak production stagnates at the prewar level.
8.        The deterioration of Burma's terms of trade has been particularly
severe since 1968. The 36% deterioration in the terms of trade between
1968 and 1971 was almost solely due to the 47% drop in the export price
of rice over this period. The resulting decline in export earnings imposed
a severe limitation of the country's import capacity and hence its economic
development. Over the decade 1961-1971, the purchasing power of Burma's
exports declined by 55% and it was less than 20% of its prewar value in
1971. In 1973 the terms of trade moved in Burma's favor; unfortunately,
on account of the drought and a poor harvest, rice exports were suspended
in 1973. With better crop prospects for 1974 and the expected continuation
of high world market prices for rice, export earnings are expected to
recover this year. In addition, Burma is an oil producing country and its
oil import requirements are marginal. In 1973, oil consumption amounted
to around 9 m barrels, of which nearly 90% was produced in Burma; the balance



-3-
was imported in crude or partly refined forms and represented 2% of the
import bill. An extensive oil exploration program on which great hopes are
based is currently underway with assistance from governments and foreign
oil companies on a contract basis.
9.        Burma contracted several new loans during 1972/73, mostly from
Japan and from the People's Republic of China. As of September 30, 1973,
the total external debt was $415 million, including an undisbursed balance
of $207 million. The average terms and conditions of these loans are very
favorable. The grant element on all the loans taken together is about 53%.
Even so, repayment obligations have been rising very rapidly and they
were equal to over 60% of disbursements in 1973. The undisbursed balance
of $207 million is expected to be fully drawn down over the next five years
and the debt service ratio which is currently 18% is expected to rise to
about 21% by 1975.
10.       GDP in constant prices increased by 1.1% during 1972/73 compared to
2.5% during the previous year. The main reason for the slow growth of produc-
tion was the 7% decline in agricultural output brought about by drought
conditions. Industrial output decreased by nearly 3% in 1972/73. The expan-
sion of total output would have been even smaller but for the increases in
the output of the mining and services sectors. Mineral output increased by
5.1% in 1972/73, due primarily to the rise in the production of crude oil.
The value of output of the services sectors increased by nearly 9%.
11.       During 1972/73 consumption grew at a slightly lesser rate than
CNP while gross fixed investment increased by nearly 10%. The ratio of
investment to GNP remained low at around 12%. National savings remain
at around 8% of GNP. Per capita income in constant prices was K 410
(US$85) in 1973, showing a slight decrease over the previous year. The
continued worsening of the economic situation is also reflected in widening
budget deficits and a weakening of the balance of payments situation. Deficit
financing in 1972/73 amounted to around K 300 million, or about the same
level as in the preceding two years. In the face of declining revenues and
increased current expenditures, the level of capital expenditure had to be
cut by 5% compared with 1971/72 in order to contain the inflationary impact
of the budget deficit.
12.       During 1972/73, the trade balance showed a surplus of nearly $11
million, compared to a deficit of nearly $50 million in the previous year.
This, unfortunately, did not result from any real improvement in the external
sector. Foreign exchange earnings from agricultural products have been
decreasing from $225 million in 1961/62 to US$72 million in 1972/73, on
account of rapidly diminishing rice surpluses. Other earnings from exports
of forest products and minerals have remained virtually static over the last
ten years at around $40 million per annum. The balance of trade surplus re-
corded during 1972/73 was due to a drastic cut - by about a third - of imports.
The major cutback was in imports of industrial raw materials and producer goods.
13.       As noted in recent economic reports, the assessment of performance
cannot be limited to the criterion of economic growth but must take into



- 4 -
account all of the country's objectives. While economic performance has
been poor, Burma's major success over the past decade has been the provision
of advanced social services for a population of about 30 million with a per
capita income of well below $100. These achievements are still there and
these goals are still being pursued but, by now, the possibility of further
social progress is being endangered by the lack of job opportunities for the
growing population and the stagnation, if not decline, in living standards.
14.       The major economic problems continue to be the slow growth of
agricultural and industrial production, the acute shortage of foreign
exchange and the low level of public savings. Current levels of investment
cannot lead to dynamic growth; indeed, they will barely be enough for the
task of rehabilitating existing productive capacity. The shortage of
financial resources has been the dominant factor in determining the low
level of investment, and the problem for Burma is how to mobilize sufficient
resources to carry out an expanded investment program. Efforts will also
have to be made to curtail the growth of expenditures and improve the manage-
ment of public sector enterprises. The main potential source of domestic
savings is the public sector enterprises, and the task of improving the manage-
ment of public sector enterprises is one which cannot be further postponed.
15.       Another avenue for mobilizing resources for investment is a
dynamic export policy. The world market prospects for nearly all of Burma's
traditional exports are very good. Poor export performance is a direct
corollary of the slow growth of production, and considerable increases in
investment in agriculture, forestry and mining are required to increase and
diversify production for export. At the same time, an increased flow of
exports will require corresponding improvements in export marketing and
pricing policies.
16.       The Government is increasingly aware of these shortcomings and has
begun to take steps to deal with its economic problems. The uniform selling
price of rice has been abolished; the structure and level of wages have been
revised and there is greater flexibility in the use of piece rates, and other
productivity incentives. Interest rates on savings deposits have been
increased. This measure together with the expansion of the banking network
should induce more private savings. The cooperatives are taking over retail
distribution from state enterprises and it is hoped that this relative libera-
lization will bring about improvements through reduction in stocks and wast-
ages. In the industrial and mining sectors several schemes have been intro-
duced, and others are under consideration for improving efficiency. Though
these measures may not be enough to reverse present trends, most of them
represent steps in the right direction.
17.       As indicated above, all the macro-indicators point to a difficult
economic situation. This is, however, partly due to the neglect of the
economy over the past decade, and to the steady drop in the purchasing
power of Burma's exports. For these reasons, it would be unrealistic to
expect a major reversal of these trends in the immediate future. Moreover,
the analysis of the recent economic report indicates that the major economic
problems are deep-seated. Substantial increases in investment over time



are needed to set the economy on the path of growth. The causes for
optimism are, however, the country's resource potential and the evidence
that the authorities have only begun to make an effort to harness some of
this potential. To develop these resources, even at the modest rate of 4Z
per annum increase in GDP will require substantial inflows of foreign assis-
tance.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
'B.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956 and of
IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961 the Bank made three loans totalling
$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon (Loan 140-BA) helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths
and storage facilities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment.
Two loans (Loan 139-BA and Loan 274-BA) helped finance the postwar reconstruc-
tion and dieselization of the railways. All three projects were satisfactorily
completed and the loans fully disbursed by FY68. No lending was requested
or made between 1962 and 1973. In June 1973, IDA made two credits totalling
$33.0 million, both for transportation projects. One credit (Credit 413-BA)
is halving to rehabilitate the inland waterways fleet, the other (Credit 414-BA)
4s heiping to finance the rehabilitation of the railways' assets and acquisition
of locomotives and rolling stock. Implementation of both projects is proceed-
ing oatisfactorily. IFC has made no investments in Burma, nor is any currently
planned. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of the two ongoing projects.
In addi£ion, the Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed survey for the
improvement of navigational channels in the Rangoon River.
i9.       The proposed Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most
imraediate constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diver-
sifying production for export in order to alleviate the critical shortage
of foreign exchange. To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary
emphasis on the development of the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors.
With increasing output from these sectors, Bank Group assistance will expand
:o include modernization and expansion of industrial capacity and further
investments in the transport sector.
20.       In addition to the present project and the proposed credit for
a 3-ci--esry Project, the documents for which have been circulated for considera-
twio, a- a later date, two projects are currently being prepared in the
miniLxng aad livestock sectors. The mining project, which is being prepared by
the goveruaent with UNDP assistance, would help rehabilitate and expand
smallscale tin and tungsten mining including collection and beneficiation
facilitieoc The livestock project is likely to consist of establishing
li'.Tcztock de2velopment centers, facilities for vaccine production and disease
cont-rol; Pi.2k and meat processing and the provision of technical services.
This ;roject is being prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Prog,ram. Thease projects are tentatively scheduled for presentation to the



-6-
Executive Directors in the second half of FY75. A Technical Assistance Credit
for identification and preparation of projects in a number of sectors is
currently being discussed for possible financing by either the Association
or the UNDP in FY75. A telecommunications project is also being considered
for FY75. For FY76, the Bank Group has under consideration a second irriga-
tion project, a fourth railways project and a seeds multiplication and agri-
cultural research project. In addition, the ongoing feasibility study of
Rangoon Port may lead to financing of a ports project.
21.       The Bank Group presently accounts for less than 4% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 10% of debt service. In five years the
Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to 15-20%
and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
22.       The wealth of Burma lies primarily in its rich agricultural,
forestry, fishery and livestock resources, and the economy is heavily
dependent on the agricultural sector. Agriculture, including livestock,
fisheries and forestry, provides 40% of Burma's GDP, 70% of employment and
90% of export earnings. In addition, much of manufacturing, transportation
and trade involves the processing, handling and distribution of agricultural
commodities. In seeking to shift the economy to an industrial base during
the past decade, Government policy tended to place agriculture in a sub-
sidiary role as supplier of basic foodstuffs and raw materials. Taking
account of variations due to weather fluctuations, the growth of agricultural
output over the past decade was slightly over 2% per annum, which was
lower than the rate of growth of the population. The failure of agriculture
to grow, however, precipitated a change in policy. The current Four-Year
Plan (1971-74) gave first priority to increasing output of crops, livestock,
fisheries and forest products for export and to substituting domestic
production for imports. A revised plan, put into effect on April 1, 1974,
continues to pursue these objectives. Specific objectives for the agricul-
tural sector include increased production of rice and jute for export,
cotton to supply raw material for the domestic textile industry, and other
cash crops for both domestic consumption and export.
23.       Rice, the dominant crop - accounting for 65% of the cultivated
area - and the country's largest export, has also registered a poor record
over the past decade. Once the largest rice exporter in the world, Burma
suffered severely from the devastation wrought in World War II and from
recurrent social disturbances. As a result of extensive embankment and
reclamation work carried out from 1958-1963, the sown area under paddy
regained its prewar level of 12.4 million acres in 1964. Since that time
there has been no significant increase in area under cultivation or in
yields, and production has fluctuated around its prewar level of about 8
million tons paddy.



24.       About 70% of the area under paddy is in Lower Burma, mainly in the
Irrawaddy Delta. Mostly local varieties are grown and only about 350,000 acres
are sown to high yielding varieties (HYV) due to inadequate water control.
Paddy is also the most important crop in Upper Burma, where lack of water is
the major constraint to increased yields and adoption of HYV. Although there
has been a substantial increase in fertilizer use during the last four years,
average use is still very low - only about 4 lbs of nutrient per acre in 1973
compared to about 11 lbs in India. In addition, government control of rice
marketing and price policy has depressed production.
25.       The price paid to farmers for paddy was kept constant at K 3 per
basket (46 lbs) from postwar to 1964, at which time it was increased to
K 3.10 per basket. Further increases to K 3.30 and K 3.58 occurred in 1967 and
1969, respectively. The price was increased twice in 1973 and the latest
increase this time to K 6.00 per basket (equivalent to US$60.00/m ton at the
official exchange rate) was announced in November 1973. The impact of the
policy of maintaining the procurement price of paddy low has been particularly
severe on paddy farmers in Lower Burma who have virtually no alternative
to paddy production during the wet season. Until the latest price increases,
the net return from paddy production was quite low, and farmers sold as much
of their crop in the illegal free market as possible. In addition to the
substantial increase in the procurement price of paddy, the government has
abolished the uniform retail selling price for rice, and farmers in rice
surplus areas are allowed to sell part of their paddy crop to the private
sector after delivering a specified proportion to the Government. The Govern-
ment has thus begun cautiously to use price policy and a more liberal market-
ing system to encourage increased rice production, particularly for export.
26.       Other important crops include jute, cotton, oilseeds (groundnuts
and sesamum) and pulses. Jute acreage and production have responded well to
the government's efforts and 50,000-60,000 tons are being exported annually.
The cotton expansion programs seem to be encountering more serious problems.
Production remains below the levels of the early 1960's as yields continue
to decline. Export pulses have shown little tendency to respond to direct
government efforts to expand production except when procurement prices
were raised. Groundnut production is particularly susceptible to weather
conditions and the drought of recent years has been the major reason for the
decline in production since 1970/71.
27.       The government's policy towards the agricultural sector is
currently in a transitional stage. The prices of paddy and other major
crops have been substantially increased. However, further changes will be
required to develop the country's agricultural resources to full advantage.
The more important steps include (a) the adaptation of known high yielding
varieties and the development of new ones; (b) increased input use, parti-
cularly of fertilizers; (c) increased investment in irrigation, drainage
and flood protection works; and (d) improvements in price and marketing
policies. The Government is aware of the need to give small farmers access
to improved farm technologies and has requested Bank Group assistance in this
fi.eld. fn response to this request a Bank subsector mission recently visited
Burma. The report is scheduled for discussion with the Government in June.



- 8-
Irrigation Development in Burma
28.       Irrigation systems throughout Burma were severely damaged during
World War II, and the irrigated area did not reach prewar levels until the
mid-1960's. About 2.3 million acres or 12% of the sown area is presently
irrigated, although only about 300,000 acres are double-cropped. Irrigation
water comes mostly from the Irrawaddy River and its tributaries, and is used
primarily to supplement monsoon rainfall during the wet season for paddy,
and to a much smaller extent to irrigate other crops in the dry season. The
Government, through the Irrigation Department, controls and maintains the
major systems which irrigate about one million acres. Scattered village irri-
gation works, constructed and maintained by cultivators, irrigate an addi-
tional 800,000 acres. In recent years, the Government has given technical
and financial assistance for the construction, operation and maintenance of
some of these works.  In the Irrawaddy Delta, low lift pump irrigation has
increased during the past decade from an insignificant level to about 250,000
acres in 1973. Another 250,000 acres are irrigated by wells and other sources
mainly stream diversions. In addition, there are about 1,440 miles of embank-
ments, mainly in the Delta, to prevent floods from the Irrawaddy River and
its tributaries. The Irrigation Department constructed and maintains these
embankments, which presently protect nearly 2 million acres of cultivated
land. The expansion of irrigation contributed to the increase in sown
acreage, double-cropping and the introduction of high yielding varieties of
seed. In the Delta area, the expansion of pump irrigation has been largely
responsible for the expansion of the acreage under jute cultivation.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed IDA project would be the first for agricultural
development in Burma. In recognition of the priority of improved water
control for agricultural development, the Government has requested IDA
assistance in irrigation development. The proposed project is the first
in a series of water resource development projects identified for external
support. It was recommended by the Bank's 1972 economic review mission to
Burma, supplemented by an irrigation identification mission in October
1972. In March 1973, an FAO/IBRD Cooperacive Program mission assisted the
Government in preparing the project. In September 1973, an IDA mission
visited Burma to appraise the project. A report entitled "Appraisal of
an Irrigation I Project" (No. 395 BA) is being circulated separately. A
summary of the credit and project is attached as Annex III.
30.       At negotiations held in Washington in May 1974, the Government of
Burma was represented by a delegation led by U Chit Moung, Deputy Minister
of Planning and Finance.



- 9-
Descrition and Implementation
31.       The proposed project would provide small pumps to irrigate 270,000
acres in the Irrawaddy Delta and 27,000 acres in Upper Burma, workshop
equipment for five repair and service stations for these pumps, and four
jute baling plants in the same areas; minor flood embankments to protect 23,000
acres of farmland in the Delta from annual floods, and spare parts and mech-
anical services to repair construction equipment of the Irrigation Department.
Funds would also be provided in the project for carrying out feasibility
studies of two high priority irrigation projects. (For details see Annex
III.)
32.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests would be responsible for the
project, which would be carried out by four of its agencies. The Agricultural
Mechanization Department would be executing agency for the irrigation pumps,
while the Agriculture Corporation would be responsible for establishing the
four jute baling plants and for providing extension services, seeds, and
agricultural inputs to farmers in the project areas. The Irrigation Depart-
ment would be executing agency for the remaining three sub-projects. The
Planning and Statistics Department would coordinate all aspects of the project
and monitor project benefits. In addition, the Directorate of-.CooDeratives
of the Ministry of Cooperatives would ensure the distribution of diesel fuel,
lubricant and grease for the pumps. A Project Committee with the heads of
these five agencies as members, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister
of Agriculture, would be established to direct, supervise and monitor project
implementation. A condition of credit effectiveness would be that the
Project Committee had been established. Project implementation would take
three and a half years.
33.       The Government agreed that separate accounts for each sub-project
would be maintained by the respective implementing agencies and that an
independent auditor satisfactory to the Association would be employed to
audit these accounts annually.
Costs and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$22.5 million of
which US$17 million or 76% of the total project cost is the estimated
foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA credit would finance the
entire foreign exchange component. The Government would contribute the
2.ocal currency funds through annual budget appropriations.
35.       The small pumps would be sold for cash to groups of farmers, and
for 50% down payment with the balance to be paid within 12 months to
cooperatives. Owners of pumps would be responsible for meeting their own
operation and maintenance costs. In the case of the minor embankment sub-
project, operation and maintenance costs would be collected in full from
the beneficiaries through a land tax but not the capital costs since these
farmers are among the poorest in Burma and already pay a high implicit tax
on all paddy which they sell at low official prices.



- 10 -
36.       Because most pumps procured under the project would be sold to
groups of farmers for cash, it is expected that they would henefit farmers
with average landholdings of about 11 acres. Suitable credit facilities
are not currently available to enable small farmers with limited savings
to purchase their own pumps. These farmers would be able to rent pumps
provided by the project from cooperatives. However, the cooperative system
needs to be strengthened and its coverage expanded. The Government has
agreed to establish a separate account for the proceeds of the sale of the
pumps and accessories financed out of the proceeds of the Credit, and to use
the funds within two years to provide medium and long term credit to farmers
through credit institutions acceptable to the Association.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Pumps and accessories, workshop equipment and tools, equipment and
imported building materials with an estimated total cost of US$10.5 million
would be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance
with IDA guidelines.  The Government-owned Heavy Industry Corporation (HIC)
owns and operates a large modern factory which manufactures pumps. HIC would
participate in the bidding for pumps and accessories, and a preference
limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing custom duty, whichever
is the lower, would be extended to HIC in the evaluation of bids. In the
event that HIC is awarded the contract for the supply of the pumps, IDA
would finance about US$3.0 million of local currency expenditures. Since
spare parts for the repair of construction equipment are specific by make
and model, international competitive bidding procedures are not appropriate.
These items with an estimated cost of US$2.2 million would be procured
directly from the manufacturers of the equipment or their agents. In
addition, small off-the-shelf items each costing less than US$5,000 and
limited to a total of US$50,000 would be bought directly from the overseas
suppliers.
38.       There are no private contractors in Burma, therefore, civil works,
namely, buildings and grounds for the jute baling plants, and earthworks
together with sluices for minor flood embankments which are quite small,
simple to construct and scattered over a wide area would be carried out by
the Government under force account. The repair of construction equipment
for the Irrigation Department would also be carried out under force accotnt.
39.       Disbursement from the proposed credit would be made,at the rate
of 100% against the cif costs of directly imported equipment, spare parts
and materials, and the ex-factory price of pumps and equipment manufactured
locally. For consultants' services, disbursement would cover the actual
foreign exchange costs.
Justification
40.       The primary benefit from the project would be an increase in
the production of rice and jute for export, cotton to supply the domestic
textile industry and miscellaneous food crops for domestic consumption and
minor exports. Some 330,000 farmers and hired agricultural laborers would

benefit directly from the project. Production would increase from the pres-
ent 222,000 tons of paddy and 5,000 tons of miscellaneous crops to over
300,000 tons of paddy, 37,000 tons of jute, 3,000 tons of seed cotton and
25,000 tons of miscellaneous crops at full development in 1982. The net
foreign exchange earnings from the incremental rice and jute production
would be around US$13 million per year.
41.       At projected world market prices for the major internationally
traded crops and inputs and domestic prices for minor crops, a shadow
exchange rate of K 10.00 = US$1.00 (which is a reasonable estimate of the
value of foreign exchange to the economy) and seasonally adjusted market
wage rate for all farm labor, the rate of return for the small pumps would
be about 42% and for the minor flood embankments, 22%. The net benefits
from the repair of construction equipment, though not estimated, would be
substantial, since an investment of US$3.7 million equivalent would rehabili-
tate US$20 million worth of equipment which would be used to complete
ongoing irrigation and flood control projects to serve some 144,000 acres.
42.       Despite its deliberate production orientation, the project would
nevertheless yield substantial social benefits. With small pump irrigation,
the annual demand for farm labor would increase from 12 million man-days at
present to about 24 million man-days at full development, which would
greatly reduce underemployment in the project areas, particularly in the
dry season. Employment opportunities would be created both for landless
laborers and small farmers, who earn half or more of their annual family
incomes by working for others in peak agricultural seasons and in non-farm
employment.
43.       Although the increase in yields and production due to the project
are modest, both the small pump and the minor embankments sub-project would
have low investment costs -- US$30 and US$50 per acre, respectively -- and
the economic rates of return of both sub-projects are quite high, reflecting
their high priority in Burma's strategy for developing the agriculture
sector. These low-cost, quick-yielding investments with minimal improvements
in inputs and supporting services would provide a minimum package to achieve
an immediate production response. They would not fully exploit the potential
for agricultural development in the project areas, but would provide a founda-
tion upon which to build further increases through future improvements in
inputs and supporting services.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Union of Burma
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
45.       The special features described in paragraphs 33 and 36 of this
report are reflected in Sections 4.01 and 4.04 of the draft Development
Credit Department.



- 12 -
46.       Section 8.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement sets out
the establishment of the Project Committee as a condition.of-effectiveness.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement-of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
